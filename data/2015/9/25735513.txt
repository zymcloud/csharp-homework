Objectives:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is established as bridging therapy of HCC listed for transplantation (LT). CT-guided brachytherapy (CTB) has not been evaluated as a bridging concept. We compared CTB and TACE for bridging before LT in HCC patients.Methods:Twelve patients with HCC received LT after CTB (minimal tumour dose, 15-20 Gy). Patients were matched (CTB:TACE, 1:2) by sex, age, number and size of lesions, and underlying liver disease with patients who received TACE before transplantation. Study endpoints were extent of necrosis at histopathology and recurrence rate after OLT.Results:There were no significant differences between the CTB and TACE groups regarding Child-Pugh category (p = 0.732), AFP (0.765), time on waiting list (p = 0.659), number (p = 0.698) and size (p = 0.853) of HCC lesions, fulfilment of Milan-criteria (p = 0.638), or previous liver-specific treatments. CTB achieved higher tumour necrosis rates than TACE (p = 0.018). The 1- and 3-year recurrence rate in the CTB group was 10 and 10 % vs. TACE, 14 and 30 % (p = 0.292).Conclusions:Our data show comparable or even better response and post-LT recurrence rates of CTB compared to TACE for treating HCC in patients prior to LT. CTB should be further evaluated as an alternative bridging modality, especially for patients not suited for TACE.Key points:• CT-guided interstitial brachytherapy (CTB) is a promising alternative to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). • CTB instead of TACE is possible for bridging to liver transplantation in HCC patients. • HCC recurrence was not associated with CTB despite potential tumour seeding.
