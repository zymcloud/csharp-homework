Despite advances made in the diagnosis and treatment of human colorectal cancer (CRC), the long-term survival for CRC remains poor. Long non-coding RNA anti-differentiation ncRNA (lncRNA DANCR) was identified to be involved in carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. While its expression in CRC and potential role in tumor progression is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression level of lncRNA DANCR as well as its association with CRC progression and prognosis. The expression of lncRNA DANCR was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in 104 CRC specimens. The prognostic value of lncRNA DANCR was further analysis. Our results showed that lncRNA DANCR expression was increased in CRC tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues (P
