Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The concept of drug-eluting bead TACE builds on the rationale of intratumoral drug delivery, and drug-eluting bead TACE has been shown to provide consistent and reliable results and to significantly diminish systemic drug exposure, liver toxicity, and drug-related adverse events as compared with conventional TACE. Based on the belief that combinations of TACE and other local or systemic therapies have several theoretical advantages, many clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of TACE in combination with local treatment such as radiofrequency ablation or radiotherapy, and systemic therapy such as sorafenib or another molecular therapy. TACE has also been used as a preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HCC to improve survival and as a bridging therapy before liver transplantation to downstage HCC. In the present evidence-based review, the authors summarize the current status of these transcatheter arterial embolic therapies in HCC.
