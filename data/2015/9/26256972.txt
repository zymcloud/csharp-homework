Purpose:Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) is a Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway inhibitor. We investigated whether DKK-1 is related to progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and HCC patients.Materials and methods:In vitro reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), wound healing assays, invasion assays, and ELISAs of patient serum samples were employed. The diagnostic accuracy of the serum DKK-1 ELISA was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under ROC (AUC) analyses.Results:RT-PCR showed high DKK-1 expression in Hep3B and low in 293 cells. Similarly, the secreted DKK-1 concentration in the culture media was high in Hep3B and low in 293 cells. Wound healing and invasion assays using 293, Huh7, and Hep3B cells showed that DKK-1 overexpression promoted cell migration and invasion, whereas DKK-1 knock-down inhibited them. When serum DKK-1 levels were assessed in 370 participants (217 with HCC and 153 without), it was significantly higher in HCC patients than in control groups (median 1.48 ng/mL vs. 0.90 ng/mL, p0.05). When three biomarkers were combined (DKK-1 plus AFP plus DCP), they showed significantly higher AUC (AUC=0.952) than single marker, DKK-1 plus AFP, or DKK-1 plus DCP (all pConclusion:DKK-1 might be a key regulator in HCC progression and a potential therapeutic target in HCC. Serum DKK-1 could complement the diagnostic accuracy of AFP and DCP.
