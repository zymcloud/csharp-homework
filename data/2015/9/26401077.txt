Aim:To study the effects of QHF-cisplatin on H22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their mechanisms of action.Methods:Sixty BALB/c mice were randomly divided into a model group (n = 48) and a normal control group (n = 12). An HCC xenograft tumor was created by injecting H22 cells directly into the liver parenchyma of the mice. The 48 BALB/c mice in the model group were randomly divided into four groups: QHF, DDP (cisplatin), QHF plus DDP, and model control. The inhibitory effects of these drugs on tumor growth were evaluated by calculating the rate of tumor growth inhibition. The mice were examined by observing their general condition, body weight and survival time. Changes in tumor tissue were observed under an optical microscope. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in serum were measured. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition (c-Met) factor, phosphorylated (p)-c-Met, p38, p-p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-ERK and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were evaluated in tumor and liver tissues using western blotting.Results:Compared with the DDP group, a lower incidence of toxic reactions and a higher survival time were observed in the QHF plus DDP group. Tumor weight was significantly lower in the QHF, DDP and QHF plus DDP groups than in the model control group (0.24 ± 0.07, 0.18 ± 0.03 and 0.14 ± 0.01 g vs 0.38 ± 0.05 g, respectively), and the differences were statistically significant (P Conclusion:QHF and DDP have an antiangiogenic effect on H22 HCC in mice. QHF inhibits tumor growth via blocking the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway, inhibiting p38, ERK and VEGF signaling.
