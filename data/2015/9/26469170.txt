A 55-year-old man had been diagnosed with Wilson's disease and was treated with D-penicillamine 36 years earlier. He also had a 20-year history of psoriasis vulgaris and cyclosporine treatment. In 2012, a he presented with a hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)that was removed via partial hepatic resection. In 2014, multiple HCC and a portal vein tumor thrombus were found in his posterior lobe. Sorafenib treatment was initiated. Cyclosporine treatment was continued. Three months later, abdominal enhanced CT revealed marked tumor reduction and shrinkage of the portal vein tumor thrombus. The therapeutic effect of sorafenib continued for 6 months. We did not observe deterioration in his psoriasis vulgaris and Wilson's disease for 9 months after sorafenib initiation.
