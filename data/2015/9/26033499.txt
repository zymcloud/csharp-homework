Background:The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of locoregional therapy (LRT) combined with arsenic trioxide (As2 O3 ) treatment in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:One hundred twenty-five primary HCC patients were recruited for a randomized controlled study. Patients were randomly divided into group A (n = 61) and group B (n = 64). All patients received transarterial chemoembolization. Group A patients were given As2 O3 at 10 mg/d for 4 courses (21 days per course) with a 2-week interval between courses. Survival times, therapeutic responses, extrahepatic metastases, and adverse events were recorded.Results:A better therapeutic response was found in group A patients, as shown by higher objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) values in group A versus group B (ORR, 81.96% [95% confidence interval (CI), 72.32%-91.62%] vs 59.37% [95% CI, 47.34%-71.41%], Ï‡(2) = 7.650, P Conclusions:LRT combined with As2 O3 treatment prevents extrahepatic metastasis and prolongs the survival time for primary HCC patients.
