The story of high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) in cancer is complicated and the function of HMGB1 in different cancers is uncertain. This review aims to retrieve literature regarding HMGB1 from English electronic resources, analyze and summarize the role of the HMGB1 signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and provide useful information for carcinogenesis and progression of HCC. Results showed that HMGB1 could induce cell proliferation, differentiation, cell death, angiogenesis, metastasis, inflammation, and enhance immunofunction in in vitro and in vivo HCC models. HMGB1 and its downstream receptors RAGE, TLRs and TREM-1 may be potential anticancer targets. In conclusion, HMGB1 plays an important role in oncogenesis and represents a novel therapeutic target, which deserves further study.
