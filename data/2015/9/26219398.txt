Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3) is essential for cell mitosis and transcriptional functions. In the present study, we first demonstrated that both TACC3 protein and mRNA levels were elevated in HCC tissue samples compared with non-cancerous tissue biopsies according to western blot analyses, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays. Moreover, high TACC3 expression was positively correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p
