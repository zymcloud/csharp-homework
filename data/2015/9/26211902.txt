Here, the potential of two nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for controlled release of sorafenib was evaluated. The obtained systems showed characteristics suitable as drug delivery systems for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through parenteral administration. The use of a mixture between a solid lipid (tripalmitin) with a liquid lipid (Captex 355 EP/NF or Miglyol 812) to prepare NLC systems could give a higher drug loading capacity and a longer term stability during storage than that obtained by using only solid lipids. The obtained nanoparticles showed a nanometer size and high negative zeta potential values. Scansion electron microscopy (SEM) of the sorafenib loaded NLC revealed a spherical shape with a diameter
