A 42-year-old woman was referred, for adjuvant treatment, by an oncosurgeon (outside our centre) after a transhiatal oesophagectomy and gastric pull-up for middle one-third squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus pT3N1M0. She underwent adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to the tumour bed, regional nodes and scar. RT dose planned was 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. During the second week of RT, a painful nodule was observed over the lower back and cytology was positive for squamous cell carcinoma. Hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) was planned for this skin nodule as 30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks using electron beams for pain palliation. Two months later, another nodule developed at the surgical scar on the anterior abdominal wall along with lung and liver metastases. This nodule was also given palliative RT. The patient tolerated the treatment well and had partial pain relief, and, in view of poor prognosis, was advised best supportive care.
