Targeting Eph (erythropoietin producing hepatoma) receptors with monoclonal antibodies is being explored as therapy for several types of cancer. To test whether simultaneous targeting of EphA2, EphA4, and EphB4 would be an effective approach to cancer therapy, we generated a recombinant trispecific antibody using the variable domain genes of anti-EphA2, anti-EphA4, and anti-EphB4 monoclonal antibodies. A multidisciplinary approach combining biochemical, biophysical, and cellular-based assays was used to characterize the trispecific antibody in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that the trispecific antibody is expressed at high levels by mammalian cells, monodispersed in solution, thermostable, capable of simultaneously binding the three receptors, and able to activate the three targets effectively as evidenced by receptor internalization and degradation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic analysis using tumor-bearing nude mice showed that the trispecific antibody remains in the circulation similarly to its respective parental antibodies. These results indicate that simultaneous blockade of EphA2, EphA4, and EphB4 could be an attractive approach to cancer therapy.
