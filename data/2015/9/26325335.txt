Whereas cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) is a first-line medicine to treat solid cancerous tumors, it often causes serious side effects. New medicines that have an equivalent or even better therapeutic effect but with free or less side effects than cisplatin are highly anticipated in cancer therapy. Recent reports revealed that Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) possesses hepatoprotective activity in addition to anticancer. In this study, we wanted to know whether AC enhances chemo-sensitivity of cisplatin and/or alleviates cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity, as well as the underlying mechanisms thereof. Our results indicated that AC inhibited proliferation of line-1 lung carcinoma cells and rescued hepatic HepG2 cells from cisplatin-induced cell death in vitro. The fact is that AC and cisplatin synergized to constrain growth of line-1 lung carcinoma cells in BALB/cByJ mice. Quantitative real-time PCR further revealed that AC promoted expression of apoptosis-related genes, while it decreased expression of NF-ÎºB and VEGF in tumor tissues. In liver, AC reduced cisplatin-induced liver dysfunctions, liver inflammation and hepatic apoptosis in addition to body weight restoration. In summary, AC is able to increase cisplatin efficacy by triggering expression of apoptosis-related genes in line-1 lung cancer cells as well as to protect liver from tissue damage by avoiding cisplatin-induced hepatic inflammation and cell death.
