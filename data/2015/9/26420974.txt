Lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma (LEL-HCC) is a rare form of undifferentiated carcinoma of the liver characterized by the presence of an abundant lymphoid infiltrate. Here, a case of LEL-HCC is described. An 81-year-old woman with a chronic hepatitis C infection was referred to the general surgery department of our hospital in August 2013 with a diagnosis of HCC. A past ultrasound examination had revealed a 60 mm-diameter nodular lesion in the third segment of the liver. After a needle biopsy, the lesion was diagnosed as HCC. The patient underwent surgery with a liver segmentectomy. Two additional nodes on the gastric wall were detected during the surgical operation. The histology of the removed specimen showed a poorly differentiated HCC with significant lymphoid stroma. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the epithelial component was reactive for CK CAM5.2, CK8, CK18, CEA (polyclonal) and was focally positive for hepar-1 and that the lymphoid infiltrate was positive for CD3, CD4 and CD8. The tumor cells were negative for Epstein-Barr virus. The gastric nodes were ultimately determined to be two small gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The synchronous occurrence of HCC and GIST is another very uncommon finding rarely described in the literature. Here, we report the clinicopathological features of our case, along with a review of the few cases present in the literature.
