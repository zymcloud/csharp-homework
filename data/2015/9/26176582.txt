Fourteen compounds were isolated from the root of Lindera reflexa Hemsl. Among these compounds, reflexan A (compound 1) was discovered to possess a novel skeleton and two stilbenes (compounds 2 and 3) were newly discovered compounds. Eleven known compounds (4-14) were also isolated, which included three alkaloids, one coumarin, four stilbenes, two flavonoids and katsumadain. The unusual structure of compounds 1, 2 and 3, along with their absolute configurations, was determined from UV, IR, HR ESI-MS, and 1D and 2D NMR data and by the comparison of experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. All of the isolates were tested with antitumor and anti-inflammatory assays. The results revealed that compounds 1, 2, and 3 all showed inhibitory activity toward three tumor cell lines, A549 (human lung carcinoma), BEL-7402 (human liver carcinoma) and HCT-8 (human colon carcinoma). None of the compounds exhibited anti-inflammatory activity.
