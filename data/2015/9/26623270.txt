Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a rapidly growing cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD comprises a spectrum of liver conditions, ranging from simple steatosis to steatosis with inflammation (steatohepatitis) and progressive fibrosis. Weight loss represents a first line therapeutic modality for the management of NAFLD. Herein, we review the evidence base for medical, surgical, and endoscopic approaches to weight loss and their potential impact on the natural history of NAFLD.
