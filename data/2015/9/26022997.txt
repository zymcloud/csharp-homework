Background:There is limited information regarding NLR-PLR (the combination of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR] and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [PLR]) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess the predictive ability of NLR-PLR in patients with resectable hepatitis B virus-related HCC within Milan criteria after hepatectomy.Methods:Two hundred thirty-six consecutive HCC patients were included in the study. The postoperative NLR-PLR was calculated based on the data obtained on the first postoperative month after liver resection as follows: patients with both an elevated PLR and an elevated NLR, which were detected by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, were allocated a score of 2, and patients showing one or neither of these elevations were allocated a score of 1 or 0, respectively.Results:During the follow-up period, 113 patients experienced recurrence and 41 patients died. Multivariate analyses suggested that tumor-node-metastasis stage, preoperative alpha-fetal protein, and postoperative NLR-PLR were independently associated with recurrence, whereas microvascular invasion and postoperative NLR-PLR adversely impacted the overall survival. The 5-y recurrence-free and overall survival rates of the patients with a postoperative NLR-PLR of 0, 1, or 2 were 43.6%, 35.6%, or 8.3% (P Conclusions:The postoperative NLR-PLR predicted outcomes of hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients within Milan criteria after liver resection.
