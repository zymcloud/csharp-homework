The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of stenting combined with radioactive iodine-125 seed strands following chemoembolization for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 52 hepatocellular carcinoma patients with IVC obstruction. All patients received chemoembolization of tumor-supplying arteries and IVC stents, and 18 patients additionally received iodine-125 seed strands, which were fixed to the stents. Improvement of IVC obstruction and the tumor response rates were compared between the two groups with a median follow-up time of 2.5 months. In both groups the stents were successfully deployed. At the 2-month post-procedural follow-up, the mean diameter of the IVC obstruction site, the mean pressure difference between the distal IVC obstructive segment and the right atrium as well as the obstruction scoring did not differ significantly between the two groups. By contrast, the tumor response rate of the iodine-125 seed strand group was 94.4%, whereas for the group without iodine-125 seed strands it was 35.3% (P
