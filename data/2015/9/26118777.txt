Clinical response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been poor. Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is central to ATO treatment efficacy of acute promyelocytic leukemia. We examine impacts of PML expression on the effectiveness of ATO treatment in HCC. We show that increased PML expression predicts longer survival and lower cancer recurrence rates after HCC resection. However, high PML expression dampens the anti-tumor effects of ATO in HCC cells. Gene microarray analysis shows that reduced PML expression significantly down-regulates expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member A1 (ALDH3A1). ALDH3A1 depression facilitates accumulation of ATO-induced reactive oxygen species. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and promoter activity assays confirm that PML regulates ALDH3A1 expression through binding to the promoter region of ALDH3A1. Clinically, ATO treatment decreases the disease progression rate in advanced HCC patients with negative PML expression. In conclusion, PML confers a favorable prognosis in HCC patients, but it induces ATO resistance through ALDH3A1 up-regulation in HCC cells. ATO is effective for HCC patients with negative PML expression. Combined with an ALDH3A1 inhibitor, ATO may be efficacious in patients with positive PML expression.
