Intracranial germ-cell tumors (GCTs) represent 10-15% of all pediatric brain tumors in East Asia. There is a wide histopathological spectrum of intracranial GCTs. Germinomas and nongerminomatous GCTs are the two major classifications. It is difficult to distinguish different subtypes of intracranial GCTs based solely on imaging studies, however, some tumor markers, such as α-fetoprotein or β-human chorionic gonadotropin, are helpful for diagnosis. In this study we present the case of a 13-year-old girl with an intracranial mixed GCT containing a hepatocellular carcinoma and germinoma without a primary liver tumor. Based on this unique pathological diagnosis, a series of treatments were applied, including surgery for gross tumor removal, adjuvant radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Long-term follow up indicates fair disease control.
