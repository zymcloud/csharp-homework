The liver is a common site of metastatic and primary disease, as well as a site of benign masses. Given the import of liver containing tumor, its treatment draws from a variety of cancer specialists. Potentially curative options exist for primary and metastatic liver disease; however, advanced disease presentation often prevents cure. The current level of evidence for embolotherapy targeting hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastatic colorectal cancer is examined, along with intra-arterial treatment options for focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatic adenoma. More specifically, chemoembolization, both conventional and drug-eluting bead, and (90)Y radioembolization are reviewed.
