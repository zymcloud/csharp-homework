Background/aims:The usefulness of immunohistochemistry to screen for the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype in gastric cancer remains unclear. Moreover, the prognostic value of MSI phenotypes in gastric cancer has been debated.Methods:The clinicopathologic parameters and survival outcomes of 203 MSI-high (MSI-H) and 261 microsatellite-stable (MSS) advanced gastric cancers (AGCs) were compared. Next, we compared the immunohistochemistry results for hMLH1 and hMSH2 with those of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method. Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to conduct survival analyses.Results:The MSI-H AGCs were correlated with older age (p<0.001), female gender (p=0.018), distal location (p<0.001), larger size (p=0.016), and intestinal type (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the MSI-H phenotype was an independent favorable factor that was related to overall survival in patients with AGC (p<0.001). Compared with the PCR-based analysis, immunohistochemistry exhibited high sensitivity (91.1%) and specificity (98.5%) in the detection of MSI phenotypes.Conclusions:MSI-H gastric cancers have distinct clinicopathologic features and better prognoses, which suggests the necessity of MSI analysis in gastric cancer. Immunohistochemistry can be a useful and reliable screening method in the assessment of MSI status in gastric cancer.
