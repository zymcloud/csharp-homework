The Let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family is frequently downregulated in multiple human tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous report demonstrated that hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) suppressed the expression of let-7 in HepG2 hepatoma cells. However, the underlying mechanisms were not elucidated. Lin28B is known to negatively regulate the maturation of let-7, and this prompted us to determine whether HBx acts through Lin28B to suppress let-7. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine let-7 expression before and after treatment with c-Myc-and Lin28B-specific siRNAs in HepG2 cells stably/transiently transfected with HBx. mRNA and protein analyses were employed to determine the correlation of HBx, c-Myc and Lin28B in HCC tissues and cells. Cell cycle and proliferation assays were performed to delineate the consequences of Lin28B repression in HepG2 cells expressing HBx. Lin28B was overexpressed in HBx-transfected cells and HBV-infected liver tissues. HBx-c-Myc-Lin28B axis mediated the repression of let-7 in HepG2 cells. Reduced expression of Lin28B inhibited the growth and cell cycle progression of HepG2 cells by derepressing let-7 and repressing c-Myc. There was not only a preliminary HBx-c-Myc-Lin28B-let-7 pathway but also another possible double-negative feedback loop between c-Myc/Lin28B and let-7 in HepG2 cells transfected with HBx, which together induced the deregulation of let-7. Lin28B has the potential to be a novel molecular target in the treatment of HBV(+) HCC.
