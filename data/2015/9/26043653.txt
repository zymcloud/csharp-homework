Background:Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is highly accurate in depicting the vascularity of liver nodules. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinomas from dysplastic nodules in cirrhotic patients with small liver nodules showing atypical or not coincidental typical vascular pattern on two dynamic imaging techniques (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging).Methods:A total of 46 patients with cirrhosis and a liver nodule smaller than 3cm showing an atypical or non-coincident typical vascular pattern on two dynamic imaging techniques, who underwent liver contrast-enhanced ultrasound and ultrasound-guided liver biopsy, were retrospectively reviewed. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound findings were compared with histopathological and clinical data, and with the two dynamic imaging findings.Results:Significantly different contrast-enhanced ultrasound enhancement patterns were observed among dysplastic nodules, Edmondson grade I and grade II-III hepatocellular carcinomas. Ten out of 11 (90.9%) non-hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas on two dynamic imaging techniques showed a hypervascular pattern on contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and these made it possible to distinguish hepatocellular carcinomas from dysplastic nodules.Conclusion:Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is useful for the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinomas from dysplastic nodules in cirrhotic patients with small liver nodules.
