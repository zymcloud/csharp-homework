Dysregulation of miRNAs is a common feature in human cancers, but this phenomenon has not been studied extensively in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-128 has been found to be downregulated in cancer. However its role in HCC remains unclear. miR-128 was underexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines compared with their normal controls. Additionally, ITGA2 and ITGA5 were predicted as the target genes of miR-128. ITGA2 and ITGA5 were inversely correlated with the expression of miR-128 in HCC cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the overexpression of miR-128 significantly inhibits HCC cell metastasis and stem-cell like properties via ITGA2 and ITGA5. Our results suggest the existence of a novel miR-128-ITGA pathway and indicate that miR-128 acts as a tumor suppressor during hepatocellular carcinogenesis. These results may provide a promising alternative strategy for the therapeutic treatment of HCC.
