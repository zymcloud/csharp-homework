Goal:Metabolic syndrome and its components play an important part in the development of not only cardiovascular conditions, but also digestive and pancreaticobiliary system diseases. The aim of our study is to present a comprehensive overview of the diseases where metabolic syndrome is an inducing risk factor, or where it affects the course of the disease.Results:Metabolic syndrome is a significant risk factor of induction of gastroesophageal reflux and its complication, which is Barretts esophagus. Metabolic syndrome was described as the disease closely linked to idiopathic intestinal inflammations, diseases of the biliary tree and pancreas. Acute pancreatitis, both its development in obese individuals and the burden of its course, are in close correlation with metabolic syndrome, similarly as the course of chronic, mainly alcoholic pancreatitis. Study of non-alcoholic steatopancreatitis presents a challenge, most importantly with regard to the function of pancreatic B cells in obese individuals. Non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis and its forms may as much as lead to the stage of cirrhosis of the liver and they pose a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Metabolic syndrome was also described in a population study as a risk factor for carcinoma of the colon.Summary:Metabolic syndrome and its components present an important risk factor in relation to inducing some benign as well as malignant gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary diseases. A systemic approach to influencing the metabolic syndrome and its components is therefore one of the important approaches to influencing the development and course of not only cardiovascular conditions.
