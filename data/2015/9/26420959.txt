Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fifth most common cancer that predominantly occurs in liver cirrhosis patients, requires staging systems to design treatments. The barcelona clinic liver cancer staging system (BCLC) is the most commonly used HCC management guideline. For BCLC stage B (intermediate HCC), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment. Many studies support the use of TACE in early and advanced HCC patients. For BCLC stage 0 (very early HCC), TACE could be an alternative for patients unsuitable for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or hepatic resection. In patients with BCLC stage A, TACE plus RFA provides better local tumor control than RFA alone. TACE can serve as bridge therapy for patients awaiting liver transplantation. For patients with BCLC B, TACE provides survival benefits compared with supportive care options. However, because of the substantial heterogeneity in the patient population with this stage, a better patient stratification system is needed to select the best candidates for TACE. Sorafenib represents the first line treatment in patients with BCLC C stage HCC. Sorafenib plus TACE has shown a demonstrable effect in delaying tumor progression. Additionally, TACE plus radiotherapy has yielded better survival in patients with HCC and portal venous thrombosis. Considering these observations together, TACE clearly has a critical role in the treatment of HCC as a stand-alone or combination therapy in each stage of HCC. Diverse treatment modalities should be used for patients with HCC and a better patient stratification system should be developed to select the best candidates for TACE.
