Hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection, which is one of the global public health concerns, is among the most common causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It was proposed that cytokine-mediated immunity plays a critical role in determining the outcomes of hepatitis B virus infection. Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine that shows a broad range of immunoregulatory properties during immune responses and combats host invading pathogens. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the possible association between expression levels of IL-12 gene with HBV infection in patients with HBV infection. This clinical study was performed on 30 HBV patients and 30 healthy controls. SYBR Green Real-time PCR was performed to examine the expression level of IL-12 gene in HBV patients. Then, the rate of expression was calculated using the Livak ([Formula: see text] ) method. Î”CT of samples in the two groups were compared using t test method. PCR was also used for HBV-DNA evidence. The results of our study demonstrated that the difference in mean of IL-12 gene expression between healthy subjects and HBV patients is statistically significant.
