Interleukin-4 (IL-4) polymorphisms have been reported to influence an individual's susceptibility to liver disease as it is a central anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokine; however, these results remain controversial.A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relevant literature was thus performed to better estimate the relationship between IL-4 polymorphisms and liver disease.Systematic searches of various databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) for studies published before July 5, 2015 were performed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated in fixed or random-effects models were used to estimate the strength of the association. Subgroup analyses, meta-regression, Galbraith plots, and sensitivity analyses were also performed.A total of 16 case-control studies, of which 15 involved the -590C/T polymorphism and 3 involved the -33T/C polymorphism, were included in the study. With respect to the -590C/T polymorphism, a significantly increased risk of liver diseases was found in the overall population (TT + CT vs CC: OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06-1.49, P = 0.009 and CT vs CC: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.00-1.48, P = 0.048) and the Asian population (TT + CT vs CC: OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.04-1.57, P = 0.020). Further subgroup analyses also showed significant associations between the -590C > T polymorphism and the risk of hepatitis C infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, no association was found between the -33T/C polymorphism and risk of liver diseases in all comparison models.This meta-analysis suggested that the IL-4 -590C > T polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of hepatitis C infection and hepatocellular carcinoma, especially among the Asian population.
