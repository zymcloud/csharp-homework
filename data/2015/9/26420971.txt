Aim:To compare the efficacy and safety of chemoembolization alone or chemoembolization combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), including oxaliplatin (OXA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (CF), in inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without distant metastasis.Methods:Eighty-four inoperable HCC patients were enrolled. Thirty-nine patients underwent chemoembolization alone, and the other 45 patients underwent chemoembolization + HAIC (OXA/5-FU/CF) treatment non-randomly. The progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups.Results:A significant difference in the ORR was observed between the chemoembolization alone and chemoembolization + HAIC groups. There was no statistically significant difference in DCR between the two groups. The median PFS (mPFS) showed a significant difference between the two groups. For patients with BCLC stage A/B disease, with or without vessel invasion, the chemoembolization + HAIC group showed better mPFS when compared to chemoembolization alone, but no significant difference was found in patients with BCLC stage C disease. The parameter of pain (grade III-IV) in the chemoembolization + HAIC group was increased statistically.Conclusion:Chemoembolization combined with HAIC with OXA/5-FU/CF may be safe and more effective than chemoembolization alone for inoperable HCC patients without distant metastasis.
