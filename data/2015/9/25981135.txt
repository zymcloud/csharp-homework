Downstaging can facilitate liver transplantation (LT) for patients outside of Milan criteria with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the optimal protocol and downstaging outcomes are poorly defined. We aimed to characterize rates of successful downstaging to within Milan criteria and post-LT recurrence and survival among patients who underwent downstaging. We performed a systematic literature review using the MEDLINE and Embase databases from January 1996 through March 2015 and a search of national meeting abstracts from 2010 to 2014. Rates of downstaging success (defined as a decrease of tumor burden to within Milan) and post-LT recurrence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted by treatment modality, study design, and patient characteristics. Thirteen studies (n = 950 patients) evaluating downstaging success had a pooled success rate of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.39-0.58%). In subgroup analyses, there was no significant difference comparing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) versus transarterial radioembolization (TARE; P = 0.51), but there were higher success rates in prospective versus retrospective studies (0.68 versus 0.44; P
