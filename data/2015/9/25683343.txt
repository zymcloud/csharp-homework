The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is expected to increase in parallel with obesity rates and the ageing population. Recent studies show that Type 2 diabetes is associated with a twofold increase in the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a leading cause of chronic liver disease. Individuals with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a more advanced stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are specifically at risk of developing fibrosis/cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease) and hepatocellular carcinoma; therefore, identifying individuals (with Type 2 diabetes) who are likely to develop hepatic complications is paramount. In the present clinical review, we discuss the potential impact of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosis on Type 2 diabetes, and the putative risk factors for developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis fibrosis. We highlight the limitations of currently used tools in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosis and staging, and provide an insight into future developments in the field. We present an example of a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease screening protocol and discuss the therapeutic options currently available to our patients.
