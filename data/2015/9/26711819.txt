Objective:To evaluate the safety and efficiency of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and subsequent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells transfusion for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted for 63 early-stage HCC patients who were treated with TACE and sequential RFA in this hospital between July 2001 and January 2012. These patients were divided into two groups: TACE+RFA+CIK (31 patients) and TACE+RFA (32 patients). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and adverse events were compared between two groups.Results:The median OS and PFS in the TACE+RFA+CIK group were significantly longer than those in TACE+RFA group (OS: 107.5 vs 61.4 months, respectively, P=0.038; PFS: 43.0 vs 30.0 months respectively, P=0.024).The 3-, 5- and 10-year cumulative overall survival rates in the TACE+RFA+CIK group were higher than those in the TACE+RFA group (93.3%, 77.7% and 35.4% vs 76.7%, 57.7% and 29.3%, respectively). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year cumulative progression-free survival rates were also higher in the TACE+RFA+CIK group (93.5%, 66.4% and 28.4% vs 84.4%, 38.5% and 0.1%, respectively). No serious complications were observed in both groups.Conclusion:This study suggests that CIK cells transfusion is safe, feasible, and superior in prolonging the OS and PFS time of early-stage HCC. However, any conclusions must be confirmed by more clinical studies.
