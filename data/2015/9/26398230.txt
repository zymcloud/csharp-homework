This chapter reviews a new type of hepatocellular neoplasm, serum amyloid A-positive hepatocellular neoplasm (SAA-HN), which arises in patients with advanced alcoholic liver disease such as cirrhosis. SAA-HNs share histological and immunohistochemical features with inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma, for example, a strong immunoreactivity for SAA. Clinicopathological features and issues regarding SAA-HN are reviewed with emphasis regarding its potential to develop into hepatocellular carcinoma.
