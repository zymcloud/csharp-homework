Objective:To determine the clinical, biochemical and radiological prognostic indicators and to compare the performance of six staging systems in patients of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Study design:Descriptive study.Place and duration of study:Department of Gastroenterology, Doctors Hospital, Lahore, from October 2007 to December 2013.Methodology:Patients with HCC were included. Baseline clinical, hematological and radiological variables were noted. Patients were followed for 5 years or till death. Survival predictors were identified using Cox proportional hazard analysis and 6 prognostic staging systems were evaluated by determining homogeneity, discriminatory ability and monotonicity.Results:Of the 228 patients included, male to female ratio was 2.6/1 (165/63) and mean age was 56.5 Â±10.4 years. Majority of patients 189 (82.9%) were anti-HCV positive. Solitary HCC lesion was seen in 121 (53.1%) patients, 16 (7%) had 2 lesions while 73 (32%) had 3 or more lesions. Only 36 (15.8%) patients had palliative therapy for HCC. Survival rate was 45.2%, 25%, 12.3%, 7%, 2.2% and 1% for 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years respectively. Male gender, portal vein thrombosis, serum albumin Conclusion:Male gender, presence of portal vein thrombosis, low serum albumin, large tumor size and high AFP level are poor prognostic indicators in patients of HCC. CLIP has better performance in predicting mortality.
