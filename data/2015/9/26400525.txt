Objective:Our objective was to examine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of interleukin (IL)-8 (rs4073 and rs2227306) and IL-10 (rs1800871 and rs1800872) genes, and clinical effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and subsequent prognosis in patients with liver cancer.Patients and methods:115 patients with liver cancer underwent TACE. Venous blood specimens were collected for genomic DNA extraction. The restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) analysis was used to detect the above variants of IL-8 and IL-10 genes. In addition, blood levels of alpha fetal protein (AFP) were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Patients were followed up to uncover the association of the above genotypes with treatment efficacy and survival.Results:Patients with the homozygous genotype AA or homozygous genotype TT (respectively, -251 and +781 sites) of IL-8 gene, and wild-type genotype TT or homozygous genotype AA (respectively, -819 and -592 sites) of IL-10 gene showed the best effectiveness of TACE. Furthermore, these patients also exhibited the lowest AFP levels and the longest survival after the treatment.Conclusions:Clinical efficacy of TACE and patient survival in liver cancer are associated with specific variants of IL-8 and IL-10 genes.
