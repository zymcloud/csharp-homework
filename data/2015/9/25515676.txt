Purpose:To investigate whether additional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) improves therapy response evaluation by Gd-EOB magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radioembolization.Materials and methods:Fifty patients with radioembolization for HCC underwent gadobutrol and Gd-EOB MRI with DWI prior to and 30, 90, and 180 days after radioembolization. A combination of gadobutrol MRI, alpha-fetoprotein, and imaging follow-up served as the reference standard. Two radiologists reviewed Gd-EOB alone (Gd-EOB), DWI alone (DWI), and the combination of both (Gd-EOB+DWI) separately and in consensus using a 4-point-scale: 1 = definitely no tumor progression (TP), 2 = probably no TP, 3 = probably TP, 4 = definitely TP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and kappa analysis were performed.Results:Kappa values for Gd-EOB, DWI, and Gd-EOB+DWI ranged between 0.712 and 0.892 (P Conclusion:Additional DWI does not substantially improve therapy response evaluation by Gd-EOB MRI in HCC after radioembolization but proved helpful in single cases.
