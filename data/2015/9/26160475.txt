Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease, thus becoming an epidemic in the Western world with a major impact on public health. NAFLD encompasses a large spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and may progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The role of genetic polymorphisms is not clear. Evidence supports the hypothesis that genetic factors are involved in the predisposition to NAFLD, and thus should emphasize the polygenic nature of the disease as a limiting factor in these studies. However, the polymorphic allele associated with increased hepatic steatosis appears to be associated with various different combinations of phenotypes, including increase or decrease of the biochemical and clinical parameters. It is possible that SNPs in genes involved in excessive fatty acid oxidation would predispose to NASH. On the other hand, the SNPs could determine the inadequate mitochondrial overload during times of excessive FFA supply. However due to the multiple hits involving some pathways, a brief review of genetic variants on mediators of oxidative stress, inflammation and lipid metabolism pathways is presented. It is clear that the discovery of genetic and environmental associations, robust enough to direct the treatment and to trace specific prevention strategies would only be possible with studies examining the susceptibility of NAFLD in a number of individuals considerably higher than assessed so far. These studies need a large number of well phenotyped cases and controls and certainly require national and international collaboration.
