Circulating microRNAs are deregulated in liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are candidate biomarkers. This study investigated the potential of serum microRNAs; miR-19a, miR-296, miR-130a, miR-195, miR-192, miR-34a, and miR-146a as early diagnostic biomarkers for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC. As how these microRNAs change during liver fibrosis progression is not clear, we explored their serum levels during fibrosis progression in HCV-associated chronic liver disease (CLD) and if they could serve as non-invasive biomarkers for fibrosis progression to HCC. 112 Egyptian HCV-HCC patients, 125 non-malignant HCV-CLD patients, and 42 healthy controls were included. CLD patients were subdivided according to Metavir fibrosis-scoring. Serum microRNAs were measured by qRT-PCR custom array. Serum microRNAs were deregulated in HCC versus controls, and except miR-130a, they were differentially expressed between HCC and CLD or late fibrosis (F3-F4) subgroup. Serum microRNAs were not significantly different between individual fibrosis-stages or between F1-F2 (early/moderate fibrosis) and F3-F4. Only miR-19a was significantly downregulated from liver fibrosis (F1-F3) to cirrhosis (F4) to HCC. Individual microRNAs discriminated HCC from controls, and except miR-130a, they distinguished HCC from CLD or F3-F4 patients by receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed a panel of four microRNAs (miR-19a, miR-195, miR-192, and miR-146a) with high diagnostic accuracy for HCC (AUC = 0.946). The microRNA panel also discriminated HCC from controls (AUC = 0.949), CLD (AUC = 0.945), and F3-F4 (AUC = 0.955). Studied microRNAs were positively correlated in HCC group. miR-19a and miR-34a were correlated with portal vein thrombosis and HCC staging scores, respectively. In conclusion, studied microRNAs, but not miR-130a, could serve as potential early biomarkers for HCC in high-risk groups, with miR-19a as a biomarker for liver fibrosis progression to cirrhosis to HCC. We identified a panel of four serum microRNAs with high accuracy in HCC diagnosis. Additional studies are required to confirm this panel and test its prognostic significance.
