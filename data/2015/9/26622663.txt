Gefitinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, which is used to treat patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations. Dermatological reactions are the most common adverse events associated with gefitinib treatment; other adverse effects, including diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis and an asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes have also been reported. The present study describes a patient with intestinal obstruction who was successfully undergoing treatment with gefitinib for primary and metastatic neoplasms. Gefitinib-induced intestinal obstruction has not been previously reported; therefore, careful monitoring of gastrointestinal symptoms should be conducted throughout the course of gefitinib-treated malignancies.
