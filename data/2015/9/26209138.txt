Aims:This study aims to evaluate the anti-cancer effect of daucosterol and explore its possible mechanism.Main methods:MTT and colony formation assay were performed to determine the effect of daucosterol on cancer cell proliferation in vitro. H22 allograft model was used for the assessment of its anti-cancer activity in vivo. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using DCFH-DA probe with flow cytometry system and a laser scanning confocal microscope. LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)-II conversion was monitored with immunofluorescence and immunoblotting to demonstrate daucosterol-induced autophagy.Key findings:We found that daucosterol inhibits the proliferation of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and gastric cancer cell lines MGC803, BGC823 and AGS in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, daucosterol inhibits murine hepatoma H22 cell growth in ICR mice. Daucosterol treatment induces intracellular ROS generation and autophagy, but not apoptotic cell death. Treatment with ROS scavenger GSH (reduced glutathione), NAC (N-acetyl-l-cysteine) or autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) counteracted daucosterol-induced autophagy and growth inhibition in BGC823 and MCF-7 cancer cells.Significance:Daucosterol inhibits cancer cell proliferation by inducing autophagy through ROS-dependent manner and could be potentially developed as an anti-cancer agent.
