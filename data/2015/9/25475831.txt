Genetic polymorphism of miR-34b/c gene is a candidate factor for attributing predisposition to carcinoma. However, results of mounting studies, concerning association of miR-34b/c gene rs4938723 with risk of cancer, present contradictory results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to systematically assessment the possible association between them. The overall results of meta-analysis indicate a significant association was only observed between rs4938723 and cancer risk in genotype model (P(h)=0.203, OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.01-1.70 for CT vs. TT). After stratifying by ethnicity and cancer type, genotype CT of rs4938723 was significantly association with an increased cancer risk in Asian population (P(h)=0.187, OR=1.10, 95%CI=1.01-1.20), allele C and genotype CT were significantly positive associated with hepatocellular cancer (P(h)=0.113, OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.01-1.23 for C vs. T; P(h)=0.121, OR=1.19, 95%CI=1.03-1.37 for CT vs. TT), but rs4938723 was negative associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P(h)=0.342, OR=0.66, 95%CI=0.47-0.92 for CC vs. TT; P(h)=0.519, OR=0.67, 95%CI=0.49-0.93 for CC vs. CT/TT; P(h)=0.443, OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.51-0.99 for CC/TT vs. CT). These findings suggested that rs4938723 was a susceptible locus only for hepatocellular cancer and colorectal cancer.
