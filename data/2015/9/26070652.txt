Purpose:After thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, patients often withdraw L-T4 for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, showing signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. A slighter hypothyroidism (reducing L-T4 to one-half) has been proposed to limit these inconveniences. We evaluated half-dose L-T4 protocol, in comparison to conventional L-T4 withdrawal, in terms of effectiveness and improvement of clinical and biochemical disorders.Methods:We randomized 55 thyroid cancer patients into two groups: 29 patients underwent 5 weeks of half-dose of previous L-T4 treatment (HD group); 26 patients replaced L-T4 with L-T3 for 3 weeks followed by 2 weeks of withdrawal (TW group). Clinical features (Zulewsky clinical score) and biochemical parameters (lipids, liver, and muscle enzymes) were evaluated in all patients at baseline and after 5 weeks.Results:Total cholesterol, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase increased at 5 weeks in both groups, but significantly more in TW, but no difference was found by clinical score. Patients who achieved the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) target value (25 µU/ml) were 92.3% in TW group and 48.3% in HD group (p < 0.001). In the HD group, only basal TSH statistically correlated with the achievement of the TSH target. Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that a basal TSH ≥0.52 μU/ml is required to reach an adequate TSH level.Conclusions:Half-dose L-T4 protocol, compared to conventional L-T4 withdrawal, is associated with less biochemical disorders but no significant clinical advantage. Therefore, the half-dose protocol reaches an adequate TSH target in 48.3% of patients and is not effective unless basal serum TSH is ≥0.52 μU/ml.
