Ferulic acid is a ubiquitous phytochemical that holds enormous therapeutic potential but has not gained much consideration in biomedical sector due to its less bioavailability, poor aqueous solubility and physiochemical instability. In present investigation, the shortcomings associated with agro-waste derived ferulic acid were addressed by encapsulating it in electrospun nanofibrous matrix of poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)/polyethylene oxide. Fluorescent microscopic analysis revealed that ferulic acid predominantly resides in the core of PLGA/PEO nanofibers. The average diameters of the PLGA/PEO and ferulic acid encapsulated PLGA/PEO nanofibers were recorded as 125 ± 65.5 nm and 150 ± 79.0 nm, respectively. The physiochemical properties of fabricated nanofibers are elucidated by IR, DSC and NMR studies. Free radical scavenging activity of fabricated nanofibers were estimated using di(phenyl)-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)iminoazanium (DPPH) assay. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay confirmed the cytotoxicity of ferulic acid encapsulated nanofibers against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. These ferulic acid encapsulated nanofibers could be potentially explored for therapeutic usage in biomedical sector.
