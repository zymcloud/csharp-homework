Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world, and it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite improvements in HCC therapy, the overall survival rate is still very low because of the late detection of the tumors. Thus, early detection of HCC offers the best chance of survival for patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved small noncoding RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression and protein translation. Many studies have shown that they played a very important role in cancer progresses and outcomes. The aberrant expression of miRNAs is common in various human malignancies and it modulates cancer-associated genomic regions or fragile sites. As for the relationship between miRNAs and HCC, several studies have demonstrated that the aberrant expression of specific miRNAs can be detected in HCC patients' serum and plasma or HCC cells and tissues, and miRNAs have shown great promise as diagnostic and prognostic markers for HCC. In the present review, we discussed the applications of miRNAs as biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis, and the association between miRNAs polymorphisms and the risk of HCC as well.
