This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of ADAM8 on the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocytes and hepatoma carcinoma cells during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. The expression of ADAM8 was significantly increased with good correlation of PCNA expression increasing and cells apoptosis decreasing during the progression of HCC in the liver of mice. Proliferation experiment in vitro showed that recombinant ADAM8 could induce the expression of PCNA in L02 cells, but not in HepG2 cells. Apoptosis experiment in vitro showed that recombinant ADAM8 did not induce or inhibit the expression of apoptosis-related factors Bcl2, Bax, and Caspase3 in L02 cells, but significantly induced the expression of Bcl2, inhibited the expression of Bax and Caspase3 in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, our study suggested that ADAM8 could promote the proliferation of normal hepatocytes and render hepatoma carcinoma cells more resistant to apoptosis to play important roles during the progression of HCC.
