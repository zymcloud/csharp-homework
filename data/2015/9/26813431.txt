Objective:To explore the surgical risk, perioperative outcome and the response of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A retrospective case-matched study was conducted to compare the characteristics and corresponding measures of patients in the preoperative TACE group and the control group without TACE. A total of 105 patients (82 patients with selective and dynamic region-specific vascular occlusion to perform hepatectomy for patients with complex hepatocellular carcinoma) was included in this study, in which 35 patients underwent TACE therapy, and a 1:2 matched control group of 70 subjects.Results:The patients of preoperative TACE therapy group had a higher level of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase before operation (119.52±98.83) U/L vs. (67.39±61.25) U/L (P=0.040). The operation time was longer in the TACE group than that in the control group but with a non-significant difference (232.60±95.43) min vs. (218.70±75.13) min (P=0.052). The postoperative recovery of liver function and severe complications in the preoperative TACE group were similar to that in the control group (P>0.05). There were no massive hemorrhage, biliary fistula and 30-d death neither in the treatment group and matched control group.Conclusions:Preoperative TACE therapy has certain negative effect on liver function. It is preferable to use selective and dynamic region-specific vascular occlusion technique during hepatectomy and combine with reasonable perioperative treatment for this group of patients, that can ensure safety of patients and promote their rapid recovery.
