Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a major cause of liver-related death and indication to liver transplantation (LT) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection following the widespread adoption of antiviral therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs). Yet, the long-term outcome of patients undergoing liver transplantation for an HCC developed during effective NUC treatment is unknown.Methods:We evaluated 101 patients with persistently compensated cirrhosis who were consecutively transplanted for HCC in two centers in Milan. At LT, 91 (90%) patients had undetectable serum HBV DNA (Results:During 106 (range 3-165) months following LT, HCC recurred in 11 (11%) patients (nine beyond MC at explant, two with HBV recurrence). Age (HR 1.1, 95%CI 1.0-1.2, P = 0.04) and exceeding MC (HR 9.6, 95%CI 2.9-32, P Conclusions:Extended survival of HBV cirrhotics transplanted for HCC can be achieved by coupling MC at listing with persistent pharmacological suppression of HBV.
