This article offers an overview of a new therapeutic option in hepatocellular carcinoma using trans-arterial radioembolization. In particular, it covers practical aspects of the technique and the currently available preliminary data in terms of disease control. We explore the potentials of radioembolization both in early and advanced stages of the disease, as single treatment and as companion to targeted agents such as sorafenib.
