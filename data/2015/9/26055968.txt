The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of conventional ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in guiding and assessing early therapeutic response to radiofrequency (RF) ablation for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs; up to 3 lesions, each ≤3 cm in diameter) and to report the short-term follow-up results. Between September 2011 and January 2013, 63 patients with 78 HCCs (≤3 cm) underwent conventional US- and CEUS-guided percutaneous RF ablation. CEUS was repeated after 20-30 min to assess therapeutic response, and local efficacy was further confirmed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 mo after tumor ablation. Patients were followed periodically to look for local tumor or disease progression. Survival probability was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Complete ablation was achieved for 76 (97.4%) of 78 HCCs in one (n = 73) or two (n = 3) sessions. No major complications were observed in any patient. The overall concordance in assessment of therapeutic efficacy of RF ablation between CEUS and MRI was 97.4% (76/78 tumors). The concordance test gave a value of κ = 0.74 (p
