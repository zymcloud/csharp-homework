Background and objective:A systematic review was conducted to evaluate whether or not antiviral therapy with nucleotide/nucleoside analogs (NA) have survival benefit for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative treatment.Methods:An electronic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed to identify comparative studies in which the adjuvant effects of NA for patients with HBV-related HCC after curative treatment were evaluated. Primary outcome included survival rate, and secondary outcomes included tumor recurrence rate and side effects. Review Manager 5.1.6 software was used for meta-analysis.Results:Twelve studies involving 6682 patients were included in our review. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that significant differences favoring the antiviral treatment groups were observed in 1-year survival rate (RR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.53-0.79, PConclusion:Current evidence showed that antiviral therapy with NA could improve survival and reduce early recurrence for patients with HBV-related HCC after curative treatment. More high-quality prospective trials are expected.
