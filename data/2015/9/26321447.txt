Tumor ablation in the liver has evolved to become a well-accepted tool in the management of increasing complex oncologic patients. At present, percutaneous ablation is considered first-line therapy for very early and early hepatocellular carcinoma and second-line therapy for colorectal carcinoma liver metastasis. Because thermal ablation is a treatment option for other primary and secondary liver tumors, an understanding of the underlying tumor biology is important when weighing the potential benefits of ablation. This article reviews ablation modalities, indications, patient selection, and imaging surveillance, and emphasizes technique-specific considerations for the performance of percutaneous ablation.
