The relationship between Dicrocoelium dendriticum and cancer has been poorly investigated so far, but a large amount of findings suggest that other trematodes can favour cancer in both animals and humans. In this study, the effects of D. dendriticum on cell proliferation, cell death mechanisms and oxidative stress induction were evaluated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines (HepG2 and HuH7). Results showed that short time exposure to low concentrations of somatic antigens from D. dendriticum caused slight proliferation in both HepG2 and HuH7 cells while high concentrations and long exposure time to extracts from D. dendriticum caused a significant growth inhibition. This effect was, however, not paralleled by apoptosis but it occurred with an about 40% increase of the formation of autophagic vacuoles. In the same experimental conditions, a strong oxidative stress was recorded with an about 100% increase of the intracellular O(2-). These data suggest the occurrence of an escape anti-apoptotic mechanism in HCC cells. In conclusion, these results suggest a role for D. dendriticum in the chronic oxidative stress and in the regulation of transformation processes in HCC warranting additional investigations in this specific area of research.
