Background/aims:To screen for serum protein/peptide biomarkers of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated chronic hepatic lesions in an attempt to profile the progression of HBV-associated chronic hepatic lesions using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) techniques.Methods:Using SELDI-TOF MS, serum protein/peptide profiles on the CM10 ProteinChip arrays were obtained from a training group including 26 HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 30 HBV-associated LC patients, 85 patients at different stages of liver fibrosis, and 30 asymptomatic HBV carriers. The most valuable SELDI peak for predicting the progression to LC in HBV-infected patients was identified.Results:A SELDI peak of M/Z 5805 with value for predicting LC in HBV-infected patients was found and was identified as a peptide of the C-terminal fraction of the fibrinogen a-chain precursor, isoform 1.Conclusions:The peptide of the C-terminal fraction of the fibrinogen Î±-chain precursor, isoform 1 with M/Z 5805, may be a serological biomarker for progression to LC in HBV-infected patients.
