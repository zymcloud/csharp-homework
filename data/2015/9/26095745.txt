The role of Balanites aegyptiaca (B. aegyptiaca) on development and growth of Ehrlich Ascitic carcinoma (EAC) and metastasis (liver and spleen) was evaluated. Balanite (400mg/kg; 10mg in 0.1ml/mouse) was given daily over a period of two weeks started 24h before intraperitoneal injection of EAC (2Ã—10(6)/once). The present study deals with the effect of B. aegyptiaca on the growth of transplantable ascetic tumor, life span of EAC-bearing mice, hepatocellular and splenic histology. Antioxidant and biochemical changes as well as p53 genes expression were recorded. B. aegyptiaca extracts inhibited tumor growth and proliferation in ascetic fluid through a significant decrease in tumor volume, total cell volume, and viable cell count and prolonged the life span of mice. Also, it significantly decreased the levels of lipid peroxidation and increased SOD, CAT levels and P53 expression. Also, balanite inhibited either tumor invaded/or affected hepatic and splenic tissue. This result gives a new insight on beneficial effect of B. aegyptiaca in primary and secondary loci of Ehrlich Ascitic tumor through its antioxidant effect.
