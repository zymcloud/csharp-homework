Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by small stature, intellectual disability, and accelerated pathologic aging. Through the Cockayne Syndrome Natural History Study, we have identified 8 cases of acute hepatic failure after metronidazole administration (8% of our cohort), 3 of which were fatal. The interval between initial administration and death was 6 to 11 days. Two of these patients also experienced acute neurologic deficit. Both hepatotoxicity and acute neurologic deficit have been reported previously as extremely rare adverse events after metronidazole administration. However, we have not identified any patients with CS who have received metronidazole without serious adverse effects. We recommend that a diagnosis of CS be considered an absolute contraindication to the use of metronidazole.
