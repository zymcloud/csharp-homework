Ectopic liver (EL) tissue is a rare entity which is reported to occur in several organs such as the gallbladder, pancreas and some other places. The EL tissue is usually detected incidentally during laparoscopy or autopsy, and several potential mechanisms may explain the development of liver ectopia. Although ectopic liver tissue is usually asymptomatic, it develops the same pathologic conditions as orthotopic liver. Although incidental ectopic livers rarely existing and do not have clinical importance, they should be looked for during electron microscope scan and histopathological examination should be carried out to rule out pathological changes since development of hepatocellular carcinoma is a possible issue. In this article, we presented an EL tissue in stomach of which only two cases were reported previously and this is the first reported case of a laparoscopically treated EL which lies to the bottom submucosal of the stomach. It would seem sensible to resect the ectopic tissue under endoscopic and the patient was well when seen for follow-up three months later.
