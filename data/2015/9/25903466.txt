Previous studies have identified a number of microRNAs (miRNAs) that were aberrantly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Nevertheless, their diagnostic and prognostic value in serum has not been fully evaluated. Herein, the levels of five serum miRNAs, namely, miR-182, miR-331-3p, miR-197, miR-492, and miR-581, were detected in 103 HCC patients, 95 benign liver diseases, and 40 healthy controls using real-time PCR technique. The results showed that, compared with benign liver diseases and healthy controls, the levels of serum miR-182 and miR-331-3p were significantly increased in HCC patients, both P
