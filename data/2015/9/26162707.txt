Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility of a 20 % reduced contrast dose hepatic arterial phase (HAP) CT for hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with 100 kVp.Materials and methods:The study included 97 patients with hypervascular HCC who underwent dynamic CT, including HAP scanning. The 54 patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥60 were scanned with our conventional 120 kVp protocol. The other 43 patients (eGFR Results:Estimated effective dose and image noise were not significantly different between these groups (p = 0.67 and p = 0.20, respectively). The TLC and CNR were significantly higher for the 100 kVp protocol than for the 120 kVp protocol (52.2 HU ± 17.4 vs 40.8 HU ± 18.6, p Conclusion:For hepatic arterial phase CT of hypervascular HCC, 100 kVp scan allows a 20 % reduction in the contrast dose without reduction in image quality compared with a standard 120 kVp CT protocol.
