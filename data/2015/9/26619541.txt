Objective:To investigate the expression difference of somatostatin (SST) , SST receptors (SSTR) and COX-2 in chronic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, precancerous lesion and hepatocellular Carcinoma, and explore the relationship between portal hypertension and SST/SSTR expressions.Methods:A series of human liver tissues were obtained from surgery, including normal liver 4 cases, chronic hepatitis 14 cases, hepatic cirrhosis 40 cases, precancerous lesion 40 cases and HCC tissues 40 cases. Peripheral bloods were collected from 20 patients before and after the operation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). SSTR 1-5 subtypes in hepatic tissues were detected by immunohistochemical study and RT-PCR. Levels of SST and COX-2 were quantified by radioimmunoassay and Western blot.Results:90% of precancerosis expressed high levels of SSTR 2, 5 subtypes, and SSTR mainly distributed surrounding portal vein. At lest 60%o of HCC expressed SSTR 2, 5 subtypes, and there were positive correlations between levels of SSTR 1-5 and SST. Levels of SST in peripheral blood of cirrhotic patients significantly increased after TIPS(PConclusions:Precancerosis or early stage of HCC may be the optimum time for synergetic medication of SST analogue and COX-2 inhibitor.
