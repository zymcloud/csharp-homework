Goal and background:Host genetic diversity may play roles in development of HCC. This study was conducted to validate the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) gene polymorphism on development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV).Study:The study cohort comprised 224 patients with HBV-associated HCC and 206 with HBV-associated liver cirrhosis (LC). Using chromosomal DNA, TNF-α promoter gene polymorphisms were determined at 3 common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites (TNF-α-1031 T>C, TNF-α-857 C>T, and TNF-α-308 G>A) using a single base extension method. The genotype distributions were compared between the 2 groups. All the HBV-associated LC patients were followed up regularly every 6 to 12 months for surveillance of HCC development.Results:In the cross-sectional analysis, the frequency of TNF-α-857 T allele was much higher in patients with HCC compared with those with LC (42% vs. 31%, PConclusion:Our data suggest that TNF-α-857 T allele is closely associated with development of HCC in HBV-associated LC patients.
