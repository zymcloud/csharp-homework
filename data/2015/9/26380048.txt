Aim:To investigate factors that accurately predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development after antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.Methods:CHC patients who received pegylated interferon and ribavirin were enrolled in this cohort study that investigated the ability of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) to predict HCC development after interferon (IFN) therapy.Results:Of 1255 patients enrolled, 665 developed sustained virological response (SVR) during mean follow-up period of 5.4 years. HCC was occurred in 89 patients, and 20 SVR patients were included. Proportional hazard models showed that HCC occurred in SVR patients showing AFP ≥ 5 ng/mL before therapy and in non-SVR patients showing AFP ≥ 5 ng/mL before and 1 year after therapy besides older age, and low platelet counts. SVR patients showing AFP ≥ 5 ng/mL before therapy and no decrease in AFP to Conclusion:The criteria of AFP
Alpha-fetoprotein; Hepatitis C virus; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Interferon.
