Objective:To analyse the impact of liver resection (LR) in patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) within the Barcelona-Clinic-Liver-Cancer (BCLC)-B stage.Methods:Analysis of patients with BCLC-B HCC treated with LR or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) between 2007 and 2012 in our hospital. Survival/recurrence analyses were performed by log-rank tests and Cox multivariate models. Further analyses were specifically obtained for the HCC subclassification (B1-2-3-4) proposed recently.Results:Eighty patients were treated (44-TACE/36-LR). Number of nodules was [1.8(1.1)], being multinodular in 50% of cases. Although resected patients had a higher hospital stay than those who underwent TACE (14 ± 13 vs 7 ± 6; P = 0.004), the rate and severity of complications was lower measured by Dindo-Clavien scale (P Conclusions:Management of Intermediate BCLC-B HCC stage should be more complex and include updated criteria regarding B-stage subclassifications, VI and tumour differentiation. Modern surgical resection would offer improved survival benefit with acceptable safety in selected BCLC-B stage patients.
