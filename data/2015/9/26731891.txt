Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) -positive human Mac-2-binding protein (WFA(+)-M2BP) is a new glycol marker related to liver fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate WFA(+)-M2BP as a predictor of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis C. A total of 115 patients with chronic hepatitis C who underwent liver biopsy were included, and the diagnostic accuracy of WFA(+)-M2BP for liver fibrosis was evaluated. A case-control study was conducted including 14 patients with chronic hepatitis C who developed HCC and 52 controls to estimate the utility of WFA(+)-M2BP as a predictor of HCC development. WFA(+)-M2BP increased stepwisely with the progression of liver fibrosis (p
