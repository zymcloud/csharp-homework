Adinbitor is a disintegrin previously obtained from Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus stejneger by our group. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities of recombinant Adinbitor (rAdinbitor). rAdinbitor stimulation can inhibit the in vitro proliferation, migration and invasion capacities of murine hepatocarcinoma H22 and Hca-F cells. The administrations of rAdinbitor either by gavage or intraperitoneal injection suppress the tumor malignancy and prolong the survival rate and time of H22-transplanted mice. The number and size of formed blood vessels decreased dramatically in tumorous tissues in that the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) were significantly decreased in responding to rAdinbitor treatment. The protein levels of IL-18 and IgG increased significantly in the serum of H22-transplanted tumor mice with rAdinbitor treatment. rAdinbitor shows in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects as an angiogenesis inhibitor and immunocompetence enhancer.
