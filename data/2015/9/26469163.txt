Background:Dexmedetomidine (Precedex®)is an agonist of a2-adrenergic receptors in certain parts of the brain. It was approved for "procedural sedation in the non-intubation in under local anesthesia" in June 2013 in Japan. However, because of metabolism delay, dexmedetomidine has to be administered carefully to patients with liver dysfunction.Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility and safety of sedation using dexmedetomidine in percutaneous arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma with liver dysfunction.Methods:Thirty consecutive cases of percutaneous arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis(male, 23; female, 7; age, 74±5.9; weight, 62.7±12.3 kg; Child-Pugh A, 23; Child-Pugh B, 7)were analyzed retrospectively. Dexmedetomidine was administered at 3 mg/kg/h for 15 minutes as the initial loading dose and at 0.4 mg/kg/h as the maintenance dose. The sedation level was evaluated using the Ramsay sedation scale.Results:In 30 of 30 cases, percutaneous arterial chemoembolization therapy could be performed with dexme- detomidine sedation. In 27 of 30 cases, the procedure was completed with the maintenance dose of 0.4 mg/kg/h. In 3 of 30 cases, the maintenance dose was increased to 0.6 mg/kg/h because of patient body motion. The mean administration time of dexmedetomidine was 82±30 minutes. The level of sedation measured with the Ramsay sedation scale at the end of the procedure was 3 points in 29 cases and 5 points in one case. Adverse events occurred in 3 of 30 cases. Intravenous drip leakage occurred in one case, vertigo occurred in one case, and vomiting occurred in one case. There were no adverse events requiring treatment.Conclusion:Sedation with dexmedetomidine in percutaneous arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma with liver dysfunction was feasible and safe.
