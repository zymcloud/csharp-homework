Objective:Small bowel (SB) is the second most common site of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). We evaluated clinical presentation, pathology, imaging features and metastatic pattern of SB GIST.Methods:Imaging and clinicopathological data of 102 patients with jejunal/ileal GIST treated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA) between 2002 and 2013 were evaluated. Imaging of treatment-naive primary tumour (41 patients) and follow-up imaging in all patients was reviewed.Results:90/102 patients were symptomatic at presentation, abdominal pain and lower gastrointestinal blood loss being the most common symptoms. On pathology, 21 GISTs were low risk, 17 were intermediate and 64 were high risk. The mean tumour size was 8.5 cm. On baseline CT (n = 41), tumours were predominantly well circumscribed, exophytic and smooth/mildly lobulated in contour. Of 41 tumours, 16 (39%) were homogeneous, whereas 25 (61%) were heterogeneous. Of the 41 tumours, cystic/necrotic areas (Hounsfield units < 20) were seen in 16 (39%) and calcifications in 9 (22%). CT demonstrated complications in 13/41 (32%) patients in the form of tumour-bowel fistula (TBF) (7/41), bowel obstruction (4/41) and intraperitoneal rupture (2/41). Amongst 102 total patients, metastases developed in 51 (50%) patients (27 at presentation), predominantly involving peritoneum (40/102) and liver (32/102). 7/8 (87%) patients having intraperitoneal rupture at presentation developed metastases. Metastases elsewhere were always associated with hepatic/peritoneal metastases. At last follow-up, 28 patients were deceased (median survival, 65 months).Conclusion:SB GISTs were predominantly large, well-circumscribed, exophytic tumours with or without cystic/necrotic areas. Complications such as TBF, bowel obstruction and intraperitoneal perforation were visualized at presentation, with patients with perforation demonstrating a high risk of metastatic disease. Exophytic eccentric bowel wall involvement and lack of associated adenopathy are useful indicators to help differentiate GISTs from other SB neoplasms.Advances in knowledge:SB GISTs are predominantly large, well-circumscribed, exophytic tumours, and may present with complications. They often are symptomatic at presentation, are high risk on pathology and metastasize to the peritoneum more commonly than the liver.
