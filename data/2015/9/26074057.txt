Inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) functions to regulate cell-cell signalling, immune responses and cell proliferation. ICOS single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may affect protein expression and functions. This study investigated the association of ICOS SNPs with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and outcome in a Chinese population. A total of 1290 Chinese Han individuals were enrolled, including 63 asymptomatic HBV carriers, 220 chronic hepatitis B patients (CHB), 249 HBV-related liver cirrhosis patients (LC), 108 patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 338 patients with natural HBV clearance and 312 healthy subjects (as controls). DNA samples from these subjects were genotyped for four ICOS SNPs (rs11883722, rs10932029, rs1559931 and rs4675379) using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay and analysed. The data showed that genotype and allele frequencies of ICOS SNPs in cases and controls followed the Hardy-Weinberg distribution. The CC genotype of rs4675379 was higher in patients with HBV infection (including AC, CHB, LC and HCC) than in patients with HBV clearance (P = 0.006). Furthermore, the genotype 'GA' and the minor allele 'A' of rs1559931 were associated with a decreased HCC susceptibility (P
