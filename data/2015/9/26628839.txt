Background and aims:Preliminary data suggests lower serum hepatitis B surface antigen level is associated with more severe liver fibrosis in HBeAg positive patients. We evaluated the association of HBsAg level with biochemical, virological, and histological features in asymptomatic patients with chronic HBV infection.Methods:HBsAg levels were measured at baseline in 481 asymptomatic, treatment naive patients with chronic HBV infection. Subjects were followed-up prospectively (median, 12; range, 8-36 months). Phases of HBV infection were defined after regular monitoring of HBV-DNA and transaminases. Liver histology was scored using the METAVIR system.Results:HBeAg positive (n, 126) patients were significantly younger than HBeAg negative (n, 355), median age 26 vs 30 years; P Conclusion:Lower HBsAg level might reflect the status of advanced liver fibrosis in HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B subjects.
