Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe complication in patients with chronic liver disease with poor prognosis. Liver transplantation (LT) is a promising treatment for HPS; however, very severe HPS, which is defined by an arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2 ) of less than 50 mmHg and a right-left intrapulmonary shunt rate of more than 20%, may be a contraindication to LT, including living donor LT (LDLT). Here, we report two cases of decompensated liver cirrhosis with very severe HPS which were resolved after adult-to-adult LDLT including ABO-incompatible LDLT. Both patients required oxygen supportive therapy in combination with specialized respiratory care postoperatively, followed by improvement of oxygenation and substantial decreases of intrapulmonary shunt rate. These findings suggest very severe HPS can be resolved by LDLT, including ABO-incompatible LDLT, and reduced graft volume did not impede the reversal of intrapulmonary shunting. Our current report may indicate that adult-to-adult LDLT, including ABO-incompatible LDLT, is becoming an effective therapeutic method and prompt a review of previous reports as well as our own files with particular regard to the indication of LDLT for decompensated liver cirrhosis with very severe HPS.
