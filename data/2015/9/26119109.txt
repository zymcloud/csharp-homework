This retrospective study evaluated the ability of the Metroticket model to predict five-yr post-transplant survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based only on explant data. Five-yr survival after transplant was estimated using the Metroticket Calculator, and observed survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Metroticket-predicted survival was compared between deceased and surviving patients using the Mann-Whitney test. The accuracy of Metroticket estimates in discriminating between these two patient groups was assessed using the c-statistic. Median patient age (n = 109) was 55.7 yr, and 72.5% of the sample were men. Metroticket-predicted and observed post-transplant survival at five yr was 71.1% and 58.7%, respectively. Predictions were calculated using the explant data of the 64 survivors and 45 deceased patients. Median five-yr survival was 72.9% in the former and 69.7% in the latter. The c-statistic of the Metroticket model for distinguishing surviving from deceased patients was 0.55. In this cohort, the Metroticket model was unable to accurately predict five-yr post-transplant survival based only on explant data.
