Male breast cancer is a rare malignant disease characterized by hormonal imbalance. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common neoplasm of the liver, and is generally correlated with hepatitis B or C virus-related cirrhosis. While to our knowledge a case with these two malignant diseases in a same male patient in the concomitant period is an exceptional event, rarely reported in literature. In this report, we present a case in which a Chinese patient with hepatitis B developed a tumor mass that originated from segment V of the liver and presented with right breast nodules at the same time. Synchronous mastectomy and hepatectomy were performed, and standard endocrine therapy and chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment were therefore followed. The diverse histogenesis of the two kinds of cancers highlights the need for us to investigate any common physiopathogenetic elements.
Male breast cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; synchronous resection.
