Liver cancer results in enormous human toll worldwide. Over the years, various chemotherapeutic entities have been employed for treatment of advanced HCC; however, as of yet none embody attributes to improve overall survival. Following rapid advancement in nanotechnology, it is envisage that nanoscale systems may emerge as intriguing platforms to improve chemotherapeutic strategies against various cancers including liver cancer; with better insight in the understanding of pathophysiology of liver cancer and material science, the field of nanotechnology may bring newer hope to liver cancer treatment. Reckoning with these, we detailed the arsenal of nanoformulations that are in various stages of clinical development/ preclinical settings for the treatment of liver cancer together with providing a glimpse of the attributes of nanotechnology in revolutionizing the status of chemotherapeutic modalities.
