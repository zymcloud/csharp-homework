Objective:Alterations to the N-glycans in glycoproteins have been suggested to play important roles in the proliferation, differentiation, invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to evaluate the potential prognostic value of β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5) in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after surgical resection.Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 300 patients (156 in the training cohort and 144 in the validation cohort) with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing hepatectomy at a single institution. Mgat5 intensities were assessed by immunohistochemistry in the specimens of patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to compare survival curves. Cox regression models were used to analyze the impact of prognostic factors on overall survival and recurrence-free survival. The concordance index was calculated to assess predictive accuracy.Results:Intratumoral Mgat5 expression was significantly higher than non-tumoral tissues (P Conclusion:Mgat5 expression is a potential independent adverse prognostic biomarker for recurrence and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy.
