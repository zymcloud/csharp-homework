American association for the study of liver diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines recommend biannual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening for noncirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV), yet there are no data estimating surveillance rates or factors associated with surveillance. We performed a retrospective cohort study of US patients using the Truven Health Analytics databases from 2006 to 2010 and identified patients with noncirrhotic chronic HBV. Surveillance patterns were characterized using categorical and continuous outcomes, with the continuous measure of the proportion of time 'up to date' with surveillance (PUTDS), with the 6-month interval following each ultrasound categorized as 'up to date'. During a median follow-up of 26.0 (IQR: 16.2-40.0) months among 4576 noncirrhotic patients with chronic HBV (median age: 44 years, IQR: 36-52), only 306 (6.7%) had complete surveillance (one ultrasound every 6-month interval), 2727 (59.6%) incomplete (≥1 ultrasound) and 1543 (33.7%) none. The mean PUTDS was 0.34 ± 0.29, and the median was 0.32 (IQR: 0.03-0.52). In multinomial logistic regression models, patients diagnosed by a nongastroenterologist were significantly less likely to have complete surveillance (P
