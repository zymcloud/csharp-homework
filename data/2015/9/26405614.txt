Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition where there is excess accumulation of triglycerides in the liver in the absence of excess alcohol consumption. It ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD, one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease in Western populations, is the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and is associated with increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT), insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Studies have also shown that testosterone deficiency is associated with increased VAT and insulin resistance in males while hyperandrogenemia has been associated with increased risk of insulin resistance and VAT in females. Thus, the aims of this review are to discuss the available experimental and epidemiological data evaluating the association between testosterone and NAFLD, to discuss the potential clinical relevance of these data, and to identify gaps in the literature.
