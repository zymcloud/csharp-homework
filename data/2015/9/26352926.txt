The objective of this study was to examine indicators of liver function and inflammation for prognostic value in predicting outcomes to yttrium-90 radioembolization (RE). In a retrospective analysis, markers of liver function and inflammation, biomarkers required to stage liver function and inflammation, and data regarding survival, tumor response, and progression after RE were recorded. Univariate regression models were used to investigate the prognostic value of liver biomarkers in predicting outcome to RE as measured by survival, tumor progression, and radiographic and biochemical tumor response. Markers from all malignancy types were analyzed together. A subgroup analysis was performed on markers from patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. A total of 31 patients received RE from 2004 to 2014. Median survival after RE for all malignancies combined was 13.6 months (95% CI: 6.7-17.6 months). Results from an exploratory analysis of patient data suggest that liver biomarkers, including albumin concentrations, international normalized ratio, bilirubin concentrations, and the model for end-stage liver disease score, possess prognostic value in predicting outcomes to RE.
