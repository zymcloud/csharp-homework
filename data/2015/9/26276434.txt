Hepatitis C is a viral liver infection considered as the major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The HCV NS5B polymerase, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for HCV replication, which is able to catalyze the synthesis of positive (genomic) and negative (template) strand HCV RNA, but has no functional equivalent in mammalian cells. Therefore, the NS5B polymerase has emerged as an attractive target for the development of specifically targeted antiviral therapy for HCV (DAA, for direct-acting antivirals). Recently, a growing number of compounds have been reported as the NS5B polymerase inhibitors, some of which especially have been licensed in clinical trials. This review describes recent advances on the synthesis of the NS5B polymerase inhibitors, focusing on the merits and demerits of their synthetic methods. In particular, inspiration from the synthesis and the future direction of the NS5B polymerase inhibitors are highlighted.
