Lupeol is a naturally available triterpenoid with selective anticancerous potential on various human cancer cells. The present study shows that lupeol can inhibit cell proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HCCLM3 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, through caspase-3 dependent activation and Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Lupeol-induced cell death is associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and ser-9-phosphoryltion of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 Beta (GSK-3β), with concomitant suppression of Akt1, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), β-catenin, c-Myc and Cyclin D1 mRNA expression. Suppressing overexpression of BDNF by lupeol results in decreased protein expression of p-Akt and PI3K (p110α), as well as reactivation of GSK-3β function in HepG2 cells. Lupeol treatment also inhibits LiCl-induced activation of Wnt signaling pathway and exerts the in vitro anti-invasive activity in Huh-7 cells. LiCl-triggered high expression of β-catenin, c-Myc and Cyclin D1 protein is reduced followed by lupeol exposure. The findings suggest a mechanistic link between caspase dependent pathway, BDNF secretion and Akt/PI3K/GSK-3β in HCC cells. These results indicate that lupeol can suppress HCC cell proliferation by inhibiting BDNF secretion and phosphorylation of GSK-3β(Ser-9), cooperated with blockade of Akt/PI3K and Wnt signaling pathway.
