Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Various treatment modalities have been applied to HCC depending on the tumor load, functional capacity of the liver and the general condition of the patient. According to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging strategy and The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines, surgical resection is not advocated in the tretment of multinodular HCC. Despite this, many recent clinical studies show that, resection can achieve good results in patients with multinodular HCC and 5-year survival rate around 40% can be reached. If resection or transplantation is not performed, these patients are usually managed with palliative procedures such as transarterial chemoembolization, radioembolization and cytotoxic chemotherapy and 5-year survival of this group of patients will be extremely low. Although survival rates are lower and complications may be increased in this group of patients, liver resection can safely be performed in selected patients in experienced centers for the management of multinodular HCC.
