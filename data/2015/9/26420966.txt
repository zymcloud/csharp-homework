Aim:To present our extensive experience of hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma using a microwave tissue coagulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of this device.Methods:A total of 1118 cases (1990-2013) were reviewed, with an emphasis on intraoperative blood loss, postoperative bile leakage and fluid/abscess formation, and adaptability to anatomical resection and hepatectomy with hilar dissection.Results:The median intraoperative blood loss was 250 mL; postoperative bile leakage and fluid/abscess formation were seen in 3.0% and 3.3% of cases, respectively. Anatomical resection was performed in 275 cases, including 103 cases of hilar dissection that required application of microwave coagulation near the hepatic hilum. There was no clinically relevant biliary tract stricture or any vascular problems due to heat injury. Regarding the influence of cirrhosis on intraoperative blood loss, no significant difference was seen between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients (P = 0.38), although cirrhotic patients tended to have smaller tumors and underwent less invasive operations.Conclusion:This study demonstrated outcomes of an extensive experience of hepatectomy using heat coagulative necrosis by microwave tissue coagulator.
