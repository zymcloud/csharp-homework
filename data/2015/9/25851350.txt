The G870A polymorphism in the exon 4/intron 4 boundary of CCND1 gene is thought to influence the generation of two mRNAs (cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b). The "A" allele codes for a truncated variant, cyclin D1b, which may have higher transforming activity. Herein, the tumor relevance of G870A polymorphism, the association between cyclin D1 variant expression and G870A genotype, and the oncogenic potential of cyclin D1 variants in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were examined. We found that there is no significant difference of G870A distribution among the HCC, chronic HBV (CHB) infection, cirrhotic CHB, and healthy control groups. Stratification analysis revealed that in younger patients (ages â‰¤ 50), cirrhotic CHB patients with AA genotype had an increased risk of developing HCC with odds ratio of 1.943 (95 % CI 1.022-3.694, p = 0.0411) as compared with AG/GG genotypes. The two variants were both transcripted from "A" and "G" alleles, and neither cyclin D1a nor D1b production was influenced by G870A genotype in HCC. The expression of both cyclins D1a and D1b decreased in HCC tissues (p = 0.003, p = 0.005), while increased in adjacent nontumor tissues as compared with normal liver tissues (p = 0.045, p = 0.034). Overexpression of cyclin D1a or D1b could promote the cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression in Huh-7 and LO2 cell lines. Collectively, our data suggest that G870A polymorphism has only very limited predictive value for HBV-related HCC. Both cyclins D1a and D1b could promote cell proliferation, which might contribute to the potential oncogenic role of cyclin D1 variants during the precancerous cirrhotic stage of hepatocarcinogenesis.
