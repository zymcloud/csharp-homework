Unfortunately Pakistan carries one of the world's highest burdens of chronic hepatitis along with mortality due to liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Scientists after extensive research have come up with this outcome that host genetics play a vital role in dictating the type of treatment response produced by the patients. In 2009, a genome wide association study (GWAS) revealed that genetic variants in close proximity to the IL28B (IFNL3) gene predicted greater likelihood of achieving sustained virological response (SVR) following treatment with pegylated IFN-alpha (peg INF-α) and ribavirin. IL28B (rs12979860 and rs8099917) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been recently found among the Pakistani population associated with response to chronic HCV infection INF-α + ribavirin therapy. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the IL-28B protein levels in the HCV infected patients. The findings showed that the serum IL28B protein level was higher in HCV infected patients as compared to healthy controls (7.743 ± 1.519 pg/mL versus 1.600 ± 0.06054 [mean ± SEM], p
