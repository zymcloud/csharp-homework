Aim:We aimed to assess the clinicopathological relevance and prognostic significance of expression of the hepatic progenitor cell markers keratin 19 (K19), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and CD117 (c-KIT) in a White series of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of K19, EpCAM and CD117 in 89 surgical specimens of HCC from Greek patients (mean age 66.7±11.3 years, male 75.2%) followed up for 39.6±25.3 months.Results:K19, EpCAM and CD117 expression was detected in tumour cells of 10.11, 15.38 and 3.7% HCCs, respectively. Female sex was correlated with EpCAM immunohistochemical expression (P=0.035), whereas no other significant relationship with clinicopathological parameters was observed. K19 positivity tended to be correlated with microvascular invasion (P=0.054). In univariate analysis, K19 positivity and microvascular invasion were found to be associated with decreased recurrence-free survival (PConclusion:Our study confirms the prognostic significance of K19 expression in Caucasian patients with HCCs, providing further evidence that it may be used to stratify HCC according to tumour aggressiveness.
