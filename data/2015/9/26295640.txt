Objective:The objective of our study was to determine quantitative differences to differentiate low-grade from high-grade dysplastic nodules (DNs) and low-grade from high-grade hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) using gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI.Materials and methods:A retrospective study of 149 hepatic nodules in 127 consecutive patients who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was performed. MRI signal intensities (SIs) of the representative lesion ROI and of ROIs in liver parenchyma adjacent to the lesion were measured on unenhanced T1-weighted imaging and on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in the arterial, portal venous, delayed, and hepatobiliary phases. The relative SI of the lesion was calculated for each phase as the relative intensity ratio as follows: [mass SI / liver SI].Results:Of the 149 liver lesions, nine (6.0%) were low-grade DNs, 21 (14.1%) were high-grade DNs, 83 (55.7%) were low-grade HCCs, and 36 (24.2%) were high-grade HCCs. The optimal cutoffs for differentiating low-grade DNs from high-grade DNs and HCCs were an unenhanced to arterial SI of ≥ 0 or a relative SI on T2-weighted imaging of ≤ 1.5, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 99.2% and accuracy of 88.6%. The optimal cutoffs for differentiating low-grade HCCs from high-grade HCCs were a relative hepatobiliary SI of ≤ 0.5 or a relative T2 SI of ≥ 1.5, with a PPV of 81.0% and an accuracy of 60.5%.Conclusion:Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI allows quantitative differentiation of low-grade DNs from high-grade DNs and HCCs, but significant overlap was seen between low-grade HCCs and high-grade HCCs.
