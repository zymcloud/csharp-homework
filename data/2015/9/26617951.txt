Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common tumor in worldwide and chemotherapy resistant is a severe obstacle in HCC treatment. Annonaceous acetogenins was a nature compound from Uvaria accuminata and it has show the anti-tumor proliferation activity in many types cancer. In this study, we showed that annonaceous acetogenins is correlated with the drug resistance reversal in human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402/5-FU and HepG2/ADM cell lines. We found that cell apoptosis was improved and cell cycle was arrested, further, multidrug-resistance proteins such as MDR1, MRP1, Topo-IIα, GST-π, cyclin D1, Survivin and bcl-2 are down-regulated, however, intracellular Rh-123 and caspase-3/8 was up-regulated by Annonaceous acetogenins treatment. We also found that there was a decreased activity of NF-κB and Akt in Annonaceous acetogenins treatment groups. Therefore, we demonstrate that Akt/NF-κB pathway was involved in Annonaceous acetogenins reverses drug resistance of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
