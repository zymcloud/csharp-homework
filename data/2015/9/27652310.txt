Deciphering genomic diversity could improve clinical care for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, our study group identified 161 putative driver genes and 2 new mutational signatures, and demonstrated that 28% of patients harbor targetable alterations. This could be the first promising step in the development of genome-based clinical trials.
