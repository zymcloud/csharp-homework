Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), with potent water solubility, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity, has emerged as a promising candidate for biomedical applications. In this study, the anti-tumor angiogenesis effects of CMCS were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that CMCS could inhibit the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. CMCS significantly inhibited the growth of mouse hepatocarcinoma 22 tissues and could promote tumor cell necrosis as suggested by pathological observations. The CD34 expression in H22 tumor tissue, the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 in serum was regulated by CMCS treatment. CMCS could significantly improve thymus index, spleen index, tumor necrosis factor α and interferon γ level. In a conclusion, CMCS possessed potent anti-tumor effects by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, stimulating immune functions. Our date provide more foundation for application of CMCS in biomedicine or biomaterials for targeted anticancer drugs delivery.
