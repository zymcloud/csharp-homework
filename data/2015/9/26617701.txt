Objective:Our study investigated the role of microRNA (miR)-200a and its molecular targets in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.Methods:An inhibitor of miR-200a was transiently transfected into the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, MHCC-97L. The effect of this transfection on mRNA levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes was measured by fluorescence-based quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Further, protein levels of EMT-related genes, cell proliferation and apoptosis-related markers were assessed by Western blot analysis in these transfected cells. MTT and wound-healing assay were used to evaluate the proliferation and migration of MHCC-97L cells in presence and in absence of miR-200a inhibitor.Results:Compared with miR-NC control group, qRT-PCR results in anti-miR-200a group revealed a significant reduction in the mRNA levels of E-cadherin, with a concomitant increasing in vimentin mRNA level (all P Conclusion:Our study reveals an important role of miR-200a in inhibiting EMT, proliferation and migration in HCC cells, suggesting the possibility of miR-200a-based therapeutics in HCC.
