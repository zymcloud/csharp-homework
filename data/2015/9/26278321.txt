Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing, but surgical management continues to be underutilized. This retrospective review investigates treatment decisions and survival for early stage HCC.Methods:The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for all patients with curable HCC (Stage I/II) from 1998 to 2011 (n = 43 859). Patient and tumour characteristics were analysed to determine predictors of having surgery and of long-term survival.Results:Only 39.7% of patients received surgery for early stage HCC. Surgical therapies included resection (34.6%), transplant (28.7%), radiofrequency ablation (27.1%) and other therapies. Surgery correlated with improved median survival (48.3 versus 8.4 months), but was only performed on 42% of stage I patients and 50% of tumours smaller than 2 cm. Patients were more likely to receive surgery if they were Asian or white race, had private insurance, higher income, better education, or treatment at an academic centre (P Conclusion:Fewer than half of patients with curable HCC receive surgery, possibly as a result of multiple socioeconomic variables. Past these barriers to care, survival is related to adequate and reliable treatment. Further efforts should address these disparities in treatment decisions.
