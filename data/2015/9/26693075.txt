The apoptotic pathway is important in the control of vital processes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the current study, we aimed to determine whether apoptotic gene-related polymorphisms modified HCC prognosis. We genotyped 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 core genes (TP53, TP53INP1, TP53BP1, CDKN2A, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, MDM2, BAX, CCDN1 and BCL2) in the apoptotic pathway by using DNA from blood samples of 362 HCC patients receiving surgical resection of HCC tumor. The associations between genotypes/haplotypes of the 10 genes and overall survival (OS) of HCC patients were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. We found one CDKN1B haplotype CCT/ACT (constructed by rs36228499 C>A, rs34330 C>T and rs2066827 T>G) significantly associated with decreased OS of HCC patients, compared to the common haplotype ACT/CTT both in univariate analysis (P=0.013, HR=1.198, 95% CI: 1.039-1.381) and multivariate analysis (P=0.006, HR=1.224, 95% CI: 1.059-1.413). We also find two SNPs (rs560191 G>C and rs2602141 T>G) in TP53BP1 shown to be marginally significantly associated with decreased OS of HCC patients. However, none of the other SNPs or haplotypes were significantly associated with HCC OS. Our results illustrated the potential use of CDKN1B haplotype as a prognostic marker for HCC patients with surgical resection of tumor.
