Objective:To investigate the expression of gap junction protein connexin 26(Cx26) in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) and its significance.Methods:The expression of Cx26 in liver tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry staining in 159 paraffin-embeded liver sections, including 20 samples of normal liver tissue, 30 samples of chronic hepatitis, 33 samples of liver cirrhosis, and 76 samples of HCC. Normal hepatic cell line LO2 and HCC cell line SMMC-7721 were used in vitro to verify the characteristics of gap junction and Cx26 expression pattern. The expression and localization of Cx26 were measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay, respectively. The function of gap junction between adjacent cells was detected by dye transfer assay.Results:Compared to normal liver samples, the positive rate of Cx26 was markedly decreased in hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC tissues(all P0.05). Compared with LO2 cells, an aberrant expression and distribution of Cx26 in SMMC-7721 cells was confirmed, which may lead to a decreased function of gap junctions.Conclusions:The aberrant expression and distribution of Cx26 protein may be associated with hepatocarcinogenesis, and the residual gap junction in HCC may provide a new target for treatment of HCC.
