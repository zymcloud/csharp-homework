Hepatocellular carcinoma is a challenging malignancy of global importance. It is the sixth most common solid malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related death, worldwide. Curative treatments at early stages include liver transplantation, resection and percutaneous ablation, while transarterial chemoembolization can improve survival in patients with intermediate tumor stage. Patients with mild, related symptoms and/or macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread are classified under the advanced stage. The standard of care in this group is sorafenib, an inhibitor of Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, whose effectiveness has been proven by 2 recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The aim of this brief review is to highlight the main concerns and pitfalls and to analyze the recent data of literature regarding the efficacy and the management of sorafenib therapy from RCTs to real practice.
