Autophagy is a regulatory pathway in liver fibrosis. We investigated the roles of autophagy in human cirrhotic livers. Cirrhotic and noncirrhotic liver tissues were obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver tissues from live donors served as control. Patients with cirrhotic livers had significantly increased levels of various essential autophagy-related genes compared with noncirrhotic livers. In addition, colocalization of autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) with lysosome-associated membrane protein-1, increased levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2, and increased maturation of lysosomal cathepsin D were observed in cirrhotic livers. By using dual-immunofluorescence staining, we demonstrated that increased LC3B was located mainly in the cytokeratin 19-labeled ductular reaction (DR) in human cirrhotic livers and in an experimental cirrhosis induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), indicating a conserved response to chronic liver damage. Furthermore, an AAF/CCl4-mediated increase in DR and fibrosis were attenuated after chloroquine treatment, suggesting that the autophagy-lysosome pathway was essential for AAF/CCl4-induced DR-fibrosis. In conclusion, we demonstrated that increased autophagy marker positively correlated with DR during the development of cirrhosis. Therefore, targeting autophagy may hold therapeutic value for liver cirrhosis.
