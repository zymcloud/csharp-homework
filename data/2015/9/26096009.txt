Liver cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-associated mortality. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major histological subtype among types of primary liver cancer. China is an area of high incidence of HCC, and >50% of the cases of HCC worldwide are in China. At present, the mechanism underlying the development of HCC remains to be fully elucidated, and previous studies have predominantly focused on HCC in southern and eastern China, with molecular data of the HCC cases in Western China remains limited. In the present study, a panel of 372 cancerâ€‘associated genes were screened using a next generation sequencing platform, which included a total of 12 cases from western China. The results confirmed mutations in previously identified HCC drivers, including p53 and Kras. Additionally, mutations in several cancer genes, which had not been previously associated with HCC, were identified, including RUNX1 and JAK3. The present study provided a mutation spectrum of HCC tissue in cases from western China, assisting in the investigation of the mechanism of liver carcinogenesis.
