Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in adults and develops due to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Sorafenib (SF) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its clinical use is limited by its poor aqueous solubility and undesirable side effects. Monoolein-based liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LCN) are self-assembled structures that have been determined as promising drug-delivery vehicles. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to prepare layer-by-layer (LbL) polymer-assembled SF-loaded LCNs (LbL-LCN/SF) for effective delivery of SF to hepatocellular carcinoma. Results revealed that LbL-LCN/SF presented optimum particle size (∼165 nm) and polydispersity index (PDI, ∼0.14) with appropriate polymer layer assembly confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, LbL-LCN/SF effectively controlled burst release and exhibited pH-sensitive release of SF, thereby increasing drug release in the acidic microenvironment of tumor cells. Compared to free SF and bare LCN, the hemolytic activity of LbL-LCN/SF was significantly reduced (p
