The present study compared the efficacy of hepatic resection (HR) in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and those with multinodular tumor and examined how that efficacy has changed over time in a large medical center.The intermediate stage of HCC comprises a highly heterogeneous patient population. Moreover, official guidelines have different views on the suitability of HR to treat such patients.A consecutive sample of 927 patients with preserved liver function and large and/or multinodular HCC who were treated by initial HR were divided into 3 groups: those with a single tumor â‰¥5 cm in diameter (n = 588), 2 to 3 tumors with a maximum diameter >3 cm (n = 225), or >3 tumors of any diameter (n = 114). Hospital mortality and overall survival (OS) in each group were compared for the years 2000 to 2007 and 2008 to 2013.Patients with >3 tumors showed the highest incidence of hospital mortality of all groups (P 2 to 3 tumors > 3+ tumors (all P 3 tumors show the highest hospital mortality and lowest OS after HR. OS has been improving for all 3 types of HCC at our medical center as a consequence of improvements in surgical technique and perioperative management.
