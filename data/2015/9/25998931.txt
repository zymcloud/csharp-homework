Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Kinesin family member 4A (KIF4A) is a microtubule‑based motor protein, which is upregulated in cervical and lung cancer. However, the expression of KIF4A in HBV‑associated HCC, and the effect of HBV on the expression of KIF4A remain to be elucidated. In the present study, the expression profiles of KIF4A were examined in cancerous tissues and paracancerous tissues from patients with HCC, who presented with histories of chronic HBV infection, and the role of HBV in the induction of the expression of KIF4A was investigated. HepG2 cells were transfected with the pHBV1.3, HBV infectious clone and a construct, which contained the luciferase gene under the control of the KIF4A gene promoter. The results demonstrated that the expression of KIF4A was significantly higher in the HCC tissues than in the paracancerous tissues. HBV activated the KIF4A gene promoter and upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of KIF4A. Furthermore, activation of the gene expression of KIF4A increased in a pHBV1.3 concentration‑dependent manner. These results provide novel insights into the understanding of HCC oncogenesis caused by HBV.
