This chapter covers recent important topics relevant to ensuring safe liver resection. In particular, preoperative and intraoperative techniques, such as 3-dimensional CT, intraoperative ultrasonography with contrast agent and fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green are reportedly useful and have been applied to liver resection and liver transplantation. We, herein, describe the performance of liver resection under the guidance of these techniques and present tips for more accurate intraoperative tumor detection and safer surgical procedures.
