HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk for most types of cancer, including those typically classified as non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). This increased risk is likely multifactorial, but a prominent risk factor for the increased rate of some cancers is co-infection with oncogenic viruses. Anal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma are three of the most common NADCs, and they are associated with co-infection with human papillomavirus, hepatitis B and C, and Epstein Barr virus, respectively. This review will examine the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and future trends around these virally associated NADCs frequently found in HIV-infected individuals.
