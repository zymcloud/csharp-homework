Background and aims:Deletions/mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-S region have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to study the evolutionary changes of pre-S mutations prior to HCC development.Methods:We studied the HBV pre-S sequences at 1 to 10 years preceding diagnosis of HCC in 74 patients with HBV-related HCC (HCC group). 148 chronic hepatitis B patients matched for sex and age in 2:1 ratio, who had been followed up for at least 3 years without HCC (HCC-free group) were recruited as controls. 56 and 47 patients of HCC and HCC-free groups respectively had serially stored sera for longitudinally examination at 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 7-9 years and â‰¥10 years prior to the recruitment of the study.Results:Compared to the HCC-free group, higher frequencies of pre-S deletions and point mutations (at 11 codons) were observed in the HCC group (pConclusions:High prevalence and cumulative evolution of pre-S mutations preceding HCC development suggested a possible carcinogenic role of pre-S mutations and their potential application in HCC risk prediction.
