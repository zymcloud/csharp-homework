Objective:To compare the outcomes of hepatic resection and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatic vein tumor thrombus.Methods:From January 2006 to November 2013, 28 patients initially diagnosed with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma combined with hepatic vein tumor thrombus received hepatic resection. These patients were compared with 56 case-matched controls (1:2 ratio) selected from a pool of 91 patients who received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization as an initial treatment during the same period. Clinical characteristics, adverse events, overall survival and survival-related factors were analyzed.Results:The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 66.5, 37.4 and 28.5% for the hepatic resection group and 32.3, 18.7 and 15.6% for the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization group (P = 0.015), respectively. No significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of complications and mortality. Multivariate analyses revealed combined portal vein tumor thrombosis (HR = 2.116; 95% CI: 1.26-3.57; P = 0.005) and treatment allocation (hepatic resection = 2.289; 95% CI, 1.30-4.02; P = 0.004) as risk factors for overall survival.Conclusions:Hepatic resection provides a good prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with hepatic vein tumor thrombus compared with patients undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, and the most important factor related to survival was co-existence with portal vein invasion.
