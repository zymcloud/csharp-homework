Background:Depiction of the exact arterial liver anatomy as well as identifying potential extrahepatic non-target vessels is crucial for a successful preparation of radioembolization (RE).Purpose:To compare the diagnostic impact of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to digital subtraction angiography prior to RE.Material and methods:DECT was applied in 46 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prior to RE. Eighty kV DE as well as reconstructed 120 kV equivalent DE datasets were evaluated in comparison to correlating digital subtraction angiography (DSA) datasets. Two radiologists evaluated in consensus the delineation of liver arteries and extrahepatic non-target vessels utilizing a 4-point scale (4 = excellent delineation; 1 = non-diagnostic). In addition, the arterial vascularization of liver segment IV was evaluated and classified: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR; liver arteries to adjacent liver tissue) were obtained via ROI analysis.Results:Both imaging techniques (DECT, DSA) enabled high-quality assessment of all analyzed liver arteries. Out of the two CT datasets, 80 kVp-DE datasets offered superior delineation of the right gastric artery (3.5 ± 0.7 vs. 2.5 ± 0.5), the vascularization of segment IV (3.9 ± 0.2 vs. 3.3 ± 0.5) as well as potential extrahepatic non-target vessels (3.9 ± 0.1 vs. 3.3 ± 0.5). In accordance to the results of the qualitative analysis, 80 kVp-DE datasets also yielded higher SNR (34.84 vs. 29.31) and CNR (28.29 vs. 21.8) values in comparison to the 120 kVp datasets.Conclusion:Eighty kVp DECT enables a significantly better assessment of the arteries of the upper abdomen for therapy planning in comparison to correlating 120 kVp datasets. This may allow for identification of potential extrahepatic non-target vessels and assessment of target volume for therapy planning prior to DSA.
