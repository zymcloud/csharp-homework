Background:Although the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody panitumumab is effective in treating colorectal cancer, the occurrence of severe skin disorders often discontinues therapy. Herein, we investigated by a retrospective chart review the effect of prophylactic oral minocycline in combination with skin treatment using moisturizer on the incidence of skin disorders and tumor response in metastatic colorectal cancer patients who received panitumumab.Patients and methods:In a total of 55 patients, 38 patients were eligible, consisting the pre-emptive group (N=25) and reactive group (N=13). Acneiform rash and other adverse events were graded according to the CTCAE v4.0.Results:The occurrence of acneiform rash (grade â‰¥2) was significantly lower in pre-emptive group than in reactive group (44.0% vs. 84.6%, p=0.04). No significant differences in the occurrence of other adverse events were observed between the two groups. Tumor response was not significantly different between the two groups (36.0% vs. 7.7%, OR, 6.75; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.75-60.76, p=0.12). Mean time to treatment failure was 149.7 days and 110.2 days in the pre-emptive group and reactive treatment group, respectively (HR=0.58; 95% CI= 0.26-1.28, p=0.18).Conclusion:Prophylactic oral minocycline combined with skin care reduced panitumumab-induced acneiform rash without a significant influence on tumor response.
