Background: Hepatoid carcinoma (HC) is a rare extrahepatic malignancy that shares many morphological and serological features with hepatocellular carcinoma. HC has been reported to arise from several organs that are derived from the foregut endoderm, including the stomach, gallbladder, and pancreas. We present a case of an elderly man with hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head with duodenal invasion, presenting with pancreatitis and a gastrointestinal bleed. With only 23 reported cases at the time of our literature search, we discuss the presentation, histopathology, and management of such a rare disease. Case presentation: A 71-year-old man presented initially with abdominal pain and was treated conservatively for pancreatitis. Four months later, he presented with melena and anemia. His examination was noncontributory. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a friable ampulla of Vater, and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a 4.5 cm pancreatic head mass. Fine needle aspirate revealed an epithelioid neoplasm with hepatoid morphology. Serum Î±-fetoprotein was normal. Surgical resection confirmed hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with positive lymphadenopathy and negative margins. There was no radiographical or gross evidence of distant spread. Observation and adjuvant gemcitabine were discussed as possible options. The patient elected to receive care closer to home and will continue surveillance imaging. Conclusion: With only 23 reported cases, pancreatic HC represents a rare entity within gastrointestinal oncology. There is no clear postoperative adjuvant standard therapy for this likely heterogeneous group of tumors. Although surgical resection is the mainstay of upfront treatment, metastatic disease to the lymph nodes or liver portends a poor prognosis and may warrant treatment such as transarterial embolization, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy.
