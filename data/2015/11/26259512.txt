Matrine, a sophora alkaloid, has been demonstrated to exert antitumor effects on many types of cancer. However, its bioactivity is weak and its potential druggability is low. We modified the structure of matrine and obtained a new matrine derivative, WM130 (C30N4H40SO5F), which exhibited better pharmacological activities than matrine. In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity and the underlying mechanisms of WM130 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro and in vivo, and found that WM130 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, migration and induced apoptosis of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, after treatment with WM130, the expressions of p-EGFR, p-ERK, p-AKT, MMP-2 and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax were significantly down-regulated, whereas the expression of PTEN was increased in HCC cells. Moreover, WM130 inhibited Huh-7 xenograft tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous administration. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that WM130 treatment resulted in down-regulation of p-EGFR, MMP-2, and Ki67 and up-regulation of PTEN. The findings indicated that WM130 could inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, migration and induced apoptosis in HCC cells by suppressing EGFR/ERK/MMP-2 and PTEN/AKT signaling pathways and may be a novel effective candidate for HCC treatment.
