Background:Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) played an important role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after insufficient radiofrequency ablation (RFA). However, whether sorafenib could be used to suppress the EMT of HCC after insufficient RFA and further prevent the progression of residual HCC remains poorly unknown.Methods:Insufficient RFA was simulated using a water bath (47 Â°C 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 min gradually). MTT assay and transwell assay were used to evaluate the effects of sorafenib on viability, migration and invasion of HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells after insufficient RFA in vitro. After insufficient RFA, the molecular changes in HCC cells with the treatment of sorafeinb were evaluated using western blot and ELISAs. An ectopic nude mice model was used to evaluate the effect of sorafenib on the growth of HepG2 cells in vivo after insufficient RFA.Results:HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells after insufficient RFA (named as HepG2-H and SMMC7721-H) exhibited enhanced viability, migration and invasion in vitro. Sorafenib inhibited the enhanced viability, migration and invasion of HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells after insufficient RFA. Molecular changes of EMT were observed in HepG2-H and SMMC7721-H cells. Sorafenib inhibited the EMT of HepG2-H and SMMC7721-H cells. HepG2-H cells also exhibited larger tumor size in vivo. Higher expression of PCNA, Ki67, N-cadherin, MMP-2 and MMP-9, was also observed in HepG2-H tumors. Sorafenib blocked the enhanced growth of HepG2 cells in vivo after insufficient RFA.Conclusions:Sorafenib inhibited the EMT of HCC cells after insufficient RFA, and may be used to prevent the progression of HCC after RFA.
