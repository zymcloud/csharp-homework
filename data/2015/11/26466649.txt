Hepatitis C is a major worldwide cause of liver morbidity and mortality. A substantial proportion of infected patients will develop chronic disease, which may progress over decades to cirrhosis. This can lead to decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the advent of the direct-acting antivirals, hepatitis C has become increasingly curable with limited adverse events and a shorter duration of therapy. This review discusses the evaluation process of the hepatitis C patient in the direct-acting antiviral era, including screening, clinical evaluation, drug-drug interactions, treatment urgency, and counseling.
