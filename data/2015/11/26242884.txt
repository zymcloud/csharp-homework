A 69-year-old male with a history of hepatitis B-induced cirrhosis underwent segmental liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. At his 12-month follow-up, local recurrence in segment VII was diagnosed, measuring 7.8 by 6.2 cm, with irregular margins and the presence of a tumor thrombus in the portal vein. After evaluation by the multidisciplinary liver team, the patient underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads. Forty-eight hours after his discharge, the patient presented with gangrenous cholecystitis and he underwent an uneventful cholecystectomy. Cholecystitis is a well-documented complication of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization due to inadvertent reflux of the embolic material into the cystic artery. However, super selective embolization significantly reduces the risk of cholecystitis. In most cases, management is conservative and only severe cases require further intervention.
