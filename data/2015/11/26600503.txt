The purpose of our study was to observe the effects of luteolin on the expression of the genes ICAM-1, LFA-3, and PCNA in H22 hepatoma tissue. Sixty ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice with H22 hepatoma were randomly divided into five groups: a normal saline control group, low-, medium-, and high-dose luteolin groups, and a cyclophosphamide group. The mice were euthanized the day after administration withdrawal and subcutaneous tumor tissue was extracted. Quantitative fluorescence RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of ICAM-1, LFA-3, and PCNA in H22 hepatoma tissue in the mice. Luteolin was found to up-regulate the expression of ICAM-1 in H22 hepatoma tissue, of which the middle-dose group had the most obvious effect, showing a significant difference (P
