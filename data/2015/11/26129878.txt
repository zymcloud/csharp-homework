Objectives:Aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic potential of plasma microRNA-122 levels in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatic resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Design and methods:A total of 120 patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatic resection (n=63) or RFA (n=57) were included. The pretreatment plasma microRNA-122 level was assessed using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, and the correlation between microRNA-122 expression and various clinical parameters was investigated.Results:Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that, in all patients, a low platelet count (100) had significantly lower OS on Kaplan-Meier analysis (P=0.042). Furthermore, high microRNA-122 expression (hazard ratio [HR]=2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.12-6.35; P=0.026) and advanced tumor stage (HR=2.27; 95% CI=1.23-4.18; P=0.009) were independent risk factors for poor OS in patients treated with RFA. The combination of microRNA-122 and tumor stage resulted in an area under the curve of 0.818 for predicting 1-year OS in patients who underwent RFA.Conclusions:High plasma microRNA-122 expression was associated with poor OS in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent RFA.
