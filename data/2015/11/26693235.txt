Backgrounds/aims:Liver resection is a curative procedure performed worldwide for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Deciding on the appropriate resection range for postoperative hepatic function preservation is an important surgical consideration. This study compares survival outcomes of HCC patients who underwent anatomical or non-anatomical resection, to determine which offers the best clinical survival benefit.Methods:One hundred and thirty-one patients underwent liver resection with HCC, between January 2007 and February 2015, and were divided into two groups: those who underwent anatomical liver resection (n=88) and those who underwent non-anatomical liver resection (n=43). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regressions were used to compare the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates between the groups.Results:The mean follow-up periods were 27 and 40 months in the anatomical and non-anatomical groups, respectively (p=0.229). The 3- and 5-year DFS rates were 70% and 60% in the anatomical group and 62% and 48% in the non-anatomical group, respectively. The 3 and 5-year OS rates were 94% and 78% in the anatomical group, and 86% and 80% in the non-anatomical group, respectively. The anatomical group tended to show better outcomes, but the findings were not significant. However, a relative risk of OS between the anatomical and non-anatomical group was 0.234 (95% CI, 0.061-0.896; p=0.034), which is statistically significant.Conclusions:Although statistical significance was not detected in survival curves, anatomical resection showed better results. In this respect, anatomical resection is more likely to perform in HCC patients with preserve liver function than non-anatomical resection.
