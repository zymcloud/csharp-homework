We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the association of miR-146a rs2910164 (C>G), miR-149 rs2292832 (T>C), miR-196a2 rs11614913 (T>C) and miR-499 rs3746444 (T>C) polymorphisms with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of 274 patients with HCC were collected between January 2013 and December 2014. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was taken to determine the polymorphism of miR-146a C>G, miR-149 T>C, miR-196a2 T>C and miR-499 T>C. By comparing with control groups, patients with HCC were more likely to be males (OR=2.01, 95% CI=1.38-2.95), have older age (OR=1.52, 95% CI=1.09-2.13), have a history of alcohol drinking (OR=2.09, 95% CI=1.49-2.93), and be infected with HBV (OR=32.98, 95% CI=19.70-55.46) and HCV (OR=56.26, 95% CI=23.28-152.98) infection. By conditional regression analysis, individuals carrying the TC and CC genotypes of miR-196a2 T>C were found to be associated with an elevated risk of HCC compared to the TT genotype, and the adjusted odds ratio were 1.50 (1.03-2.17) and 2.86 (1.60-5.16), respectively. Moreover, the TC+CC genotype was correlated with an increased risk of HCC (OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.19-2.41) compared to the wide-type genotype. In conclusion, our results suggested that miR-196a2 T>C polymorphism is associated with HCC risk in Chinese population.
