This study aims to analyze the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of developing the most common types of cancer in the Brazilian population. It is a case-control study in which the most common types of cancer were considered as cases and non-melanoma skin cancers as controls. Data were routinely obtained by hospital-based cancer registrars. Individuals between 18 and 100 years old, diagnosed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009, with information regarding alcohol consumption, were included. The odds ratio (OR) for each type of cancer was calculated, adjusting for confounding variables. The etiologic fraction (EF) was calculated in cases with statistically significant results. The study included 203,506 individuals (110,550 women and 92,956 men), with an average age of 59 years. A statistically significant association was found between alcohol consumption and increased risk of cancers of the respiratory and digestive systems, prostate, and female breast. The association between alcohol consumption and cancers of the urinary tract, male genital organs, and other neoplasias was not statistically significant. Consumption of alcoholic beverages increased the risk of developing cancer of the nasal cavity, pyriform sinus, oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, lung, esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, breast, prostate, colon and rectum, and anus and anal canal.
