Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in China. It is important to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of HBV-related HCC and to identify new biomarkers for clinical treatment. The important role of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) has been widely recognized in many types of cancers, but the association between FGFR polymorphisms and HCC carcinogenesis has been rarely reported. In this study, 199 patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis, 203 with HBV-associated HCC, and 184 healthy controls with no liver diseases were enrolled as participants. Using SNaPshot assays, five SNPs (rs13317, rs7825208, rs1047057, rs1047111, and rs1966265) of growth factor receptor genes were genotyped. Our results showed that the G/A and G/G genotypes at rs7825208 of FGFR1 were negatively correlated with HBV-related HCC (odds ratio (OR) = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.22-0.93, P = 0.027). However, after Bonferroni correction, these significant differences no longer existed (P > 0.05). Our results indicated that these five polymorphisms of fibroblast growth factor receptor genes do not play any independent roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of HBV-related HCC in Han Chinese patients.
