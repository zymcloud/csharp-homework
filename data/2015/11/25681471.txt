Despite their strong role in human health, poor bioavailability of flavonoids limits their biological effects in vivo. Enzymatically catalyzed acylation of fatty acids to flavonoids is one of the approaches of increasing cellular permeability and hence, biological activities. In this study, six long chain fatty acid esters of quercetin-3-O-glucoside (Q3G) acylated enzymatically and were used for determining their antiproliferative action in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) in comparison to precursor compounds and two chemotherapy drugs (Sorafenib and Cisplatin). Fatty acid esters of Q3G showed significant inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation by 85 to 90% after 6 h and 24 h of treatment, respectively. The cell death due to these novel compounds was associated with cell-cycle arrest in S-phase and apoptosis observed by DNA fragmentation, fluorescent microscopy and elevated caspase-3 activity and strong DNA topoisomerase II inhibition. Interestingly, Q3G esters showed significantly low toxicity to normal liver cells than Sorafenib (P
