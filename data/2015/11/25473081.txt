Background/aims:It is difficult to precisely detect the lateral margin during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for signet ring cell carcinoma (SRC) because SRC often expands to lateral direction through the lamina propria. Thus, the aim of this study was to classify the intramucosal spreading patterns of SRC and to analyze the patients' clinicopathological findings according to the spreading patterns.Methods:The intramucosal spreading patterns of SRC were classified as expansive or infiltrative types. A total of 100 surgical and 42 ESD specimens were reviewed.Results:In the surgical specimens, the proportions of expansive and infiltrative types were 44% and 56%, respectively. The infiltrative type was more commonly associated with old age, atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia in surrounding mucosa and the absence of Helicobacter pylori compared with the expansive type. In ESD specimens, the proportions of expansive and infiltrative types were each 50%. When lateral margin-positive lesions were compared with -negative lesions, larger size, residual lesion, and the lack of a neutrophil infiltration were more significantly associated with lateral margin-positive lesions. All cases with residual tumors in lateral margin-positive lesions were classified as the infiltrative type.Conclusions:SRC surrounded with atrophy and/or intestinal metaplasia often spreads subepithelially in the margin. This finding may suggest that a larger safety margin is necessary in this type during ESD.
