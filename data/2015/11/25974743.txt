Background and aim:Inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis seems to decrease hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after radical therapies; however, data on the adjuvant role of angiotensin II receptor 1 blockers (sartans) are still lacking. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether sartans delay time to recurrence and prolong overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after radiofrequency ablation.Methods:Data on 153 patients were reviewed. The study population was classified into three groups: 73 (47.8%) patients who received neither angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors nor sartans (group 1), 49 (32%) patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (group 2), and 31 (20.2%) patients treated with sartans (group 3). Survival outcomes were analysed by means of Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared with log-rank test.Results:In the whole study population, 85.6% of patients were in Child-Pugh A class and 89.6% in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer A stage. Median maximum tumor diameter was 30 mm (10-40) and alpha fetoprotein was 25 (1.1-2100) UI/mL. No differences in baseline characteristics among the three groups were reported. Median overall survival was 48 months (95% confidence interval: 31-58) in group 1, 72 months (49-89) in group 2, and 84 months (58-92) in group 3 (P = 0.02). Median time to recurrence was 26 (15-42), 44 (33-72), and 69 (44-74) months in the three groups, respectively (P = 0.02). Sartan therapy was a significant predictor of longer overall survival and delayed time to recurrence on multivariate analysis.Conclusion:Sartans significantly improved overall survival and time to recurrence after radiofrequency ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
