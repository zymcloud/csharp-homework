Sorafenib is the first molecularly targeted drug recommended as a treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we report the efficacy of sorafenib for extrahepatic recurrence of HCC. From September 2004 to March 2015, 47 patients who were diagnosed with recurrent HCC after liver resection were treated with sorafenib. The overall response rate was 17.5% (complete response: CR 1, partial response: PR 6, stable disease: SD 17, progressive disease: PD 13, SD beyond PD 3), and the disease control rate was 67.5%. The median time to disease progression, including extrahepatic recurrence, was significantly better than in the group with only intrahepatic metastasis (p=0.034). Therefore, sorafenib might be an effective treatment for extrahepatic recurrence of HCC.
