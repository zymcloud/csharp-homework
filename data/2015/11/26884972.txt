Purpose:The aim of our study was to determine whether using C-arm CT (DYNA CT) during hepatic arteriography imaging assists in TACE treatment.Materials and methods:138 patients with HCC, 69 patients (Group A) underwent DYNA CT and routine digital subtraction angiography (DSA), while another 69 patients (Group B) underwent only DSA, were prospectively studied at a single facility between May 2011 and September 2012. Liver vessels and tumors were displayed by DYNA CT. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the celiac artery shape and branch anatomy were visualized. The number of tumors and arteries which feed these was compared.Results:In Group A, DYNA CT showed that the hepatic artery originated from the celiac artery in 60 patients, while the right hepatic artery originated from the SMA and the left hepatic artery originated from the common hepatic artery in 9 patients. In 10 patients, the phrenic artery provided blood to the tumor. DYNA CT detected 258 lesions, while routine DSA found 178 lesions (PConclusion:DYNA CT has substantial advantages over routine DSA in demonstrating the shape and branches of the target hepatic vessels and the number of tumors. DYNA CT provides important guidance for TACE which simplifies selective catheterization and improves the treatment and quality of TACE.
