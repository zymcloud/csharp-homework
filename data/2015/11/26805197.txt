A 46-year-old woman underwent right hemihepatectomy, cholecystectomy, and sampling of the hilar lymph nodes for combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma. She received oral S-1 after hepatectomy. However, her serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen gradually increased, and solitary paraaortic lymph node recurrence was detected on positron emission tomography-computed tomography 12 months after hepatectomy. The patient underwent paraaortic lymph node dissection. Histologic examination revealed solitary paraaortic lymph node metastasis composed of hepatocellular carcinoma. After paraaortic lymph node dissection, she was administered sorafenib, and she remains alive and healthy with no evidence of disease 17 months after the initial resection.
