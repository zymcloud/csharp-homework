Background:The functions of ghrelin (GHRL) include anti-inflammatory effects, reduction of the fibrogenic response, protection of liver tissue, and regulation of cell proliferation. Genetic variations in the GHRL gene may play an important role in the development of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, we investigated whether GHRL gene polymorphisms and its serum levels are associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related diseases risk in a Chinese population.Methods:176 patients with CHB, 106 patients with HBV-related LC, 151 patients with HBV-related HCC, and 167 healthy controls were recruited in the study. Genotyping of GHRL rs26311, rs27647, rs696217, and rs34911341 polymorphisms were determined with the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing. The serum GHRL concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results:Binary logistic regression analyses adjusting for gender and age revealed that a significant increased risk of LC was found in the GHRL rs26311 GC genotype and combined GC+CC genotypes when compared with the GG genotype (GC vs. GG: OR = 1.671, 95% CI = 1.013-2.757, P = 0.044; GC+CC vs. GG: OR = 1.674, 95% CI = 1.040-2.696, P = 0.034). In subgroup analysis by gender, binary logistic regression analyses adjusting for age showed that the GHRL rs26311 C allele and combined GC+CC genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk to LC in males (C vs. G OR = 1.416, 95% CI = 1.017-1.972, P = 0.040; GC+CC vs. GG: OR = 1.729, 95% CI = 1.019-2.933, P = 0.042). In addition, we found significant decreased serum GHRL levels in LC patients compared with the healthy controls. However, there was no significant association of the GHRL rs26311 polymorphism with serum GHRL levels in LC patients.Conclusions:These observations suggest that the GHRL rs26311 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk to HBV-related LC, especially in men. We also found an inverse association of serum GHRL levels with LC.
