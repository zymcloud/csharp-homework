We report the case of a 77-year-old woman with mediastinal lymph node metastasis of combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma who was successfully treated with S8 segmentectomy and lymphadenectomy. A hepatic nodule was detected in segment 8 during follow-up computed tomography (CT) after left iliac arterial aneurysm repair. The patient was diagnosed with a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was selected for HCC because of the patient's condition. The levels of tumor markers did not change after TACE was performed twice. Therefore, TACE treatment was considered to be ineffective for HCC, and the patient was admitted to our hospital for surgical resection. In addition to the primary lesion, a lymph node with a diameter of 20 mm was detected in the anterior mediastinum using CT and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). We did not find any other metastases, and therefore, S8 segmentectomy and lymphadenectomy in the anterior mediastinum were performed. Recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 12. Based on histopathologic findings, combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma with mediastinal lymph node metastasis was confirmed. Levels of tumor markers normalized, and the patient survived without recurrence for 6 months.
