Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are liver originated malignant tumors. Of the two, ICC has the worse prognosis because it has no reliable diagnostic markers and its carcinogenic mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to integrate metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets to identify variances if any in the carcinogenic mechanism of ICC and HCC. Ten ICC and 6 HCC who were resected surgically, were enrolled. miRNA and mRNA expression analysis were performed by microarray on ICC and HCC and their corresponding non-tumor tissues (ICC_NT and HCC_NT). Compound analysis was performed using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed that among the four sample groups (ICC, ICC_NT, HCC, and HCC_NT) there were 14 compounds, 62 mRNAs and 17 miRNAs with two distinct patterns: tumor and non-tumor, and ICC and non-ICC. We accurately (84.38%) distinguished ICC by the distinct pattern of its compounds. Pathway analysis using transcriptome and metabolome showed that several pathways varied between tumor and non-tumor samples. Based on the results of the PCA, we believe that ICC and HCC have different carcinogenic mechanism therefore knowing the specific profile of genes and compounds can be useful in diagnosing ICC.
