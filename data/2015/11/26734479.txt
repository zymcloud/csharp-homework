Background:Small cell esophageal carcinoma (SCEC) is a highly aggressive and rare neoplasm.Objectives:This study aimed to report the characteristics, prognostic factors, and treatment outcomes of 22 patients with SCEC.Patients and methods:This brief report was carried out by reviewing the medical records of 22 patients with newly histologically proven SCEC that were treated between 2000 and 2010 at 2 tertiary academic hospitals. All the potential prognostic variables, including the patients' characteristics, tumor features, and treatment modalities were analyzed to establish their influence on the patients' survival rates.Results:This study was conducted on 7 males and 15 females with a median age of 61 years. Dysphagia and weight loss were the most prevalent symptoms. According to the results, 14 patients (64%) had limited diseases and 8 cases (36%) had extensive diseases. In those with extensive diseases, liver, lung, and lymph nodes (LNs) were the most metastatic sites. Besides, most tumors were located in lower (50%) and middle (32%) part of the esophagus. Most patients (91%) were treated with sequential (55%) or concurrent (36%) chemoradiation (CRT). Surgical resection was also performed for 7 patients. Chemotherapy regimen consisted of cisplatin and etoposide in 14 patients (64%). The median follow up time was 12 months. The 1, 3, and 5-year overall survival rates were 27%, 14%, and 4%, respectively. Yet, no prognostic factors were found because of the small sample size of the study.Conclusions:Primary SCEC is a rare and highly aggressive tumor. However, prognosis is poor and long-term survival is exceptional. CRT could be an appropriate alternative to operation.
