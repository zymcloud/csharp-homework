We examined patients who were treated for another cancer during treatment for primary and recurrent liver cancer. Case 1: A 71-year-old man underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ten months after the surgery, a pancreatic tumor and multiple liver metastases of HCC were observed. After transarterial chemoembolization was performed to control HCC, the pancreatic cancer was resected. Case 2: A 76-year-old woman underwent liver resection for HCC. Six months after the surgery, gastric cancer and multiple liver metastases of HCC were observed. Transarterial chemoembolization was performed to control HCC, and S-1 was administrated for the gastric cancer. These treatments were repeated for about 1 year with 1 course per 6 week. Case 3: A 59-year-old man underwent hepatectomy for HCC. One year after the surgery, thyroid cancer was detected and was resected. About 7 years after the first surgery, recurrent HCC was noted and resected. Case 4: A 69-year-old man underwent hepatectomy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Two months after the surgery, esophagectomy was performed for synchronous esophageal cancer. Thereafter, hepatectomy was repeated or radiofrequency ablation was performed for liver metastases of ICC. Primary liver cancer is associated with a high recurrence rate. So long as the primary and recurrent liver cancer is properly controlled, treatment for other cancers is possible.
