Background:Malignancy is known to be associated with an increased mortality rate in patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). However, risk factors contributing to the poor prognosis of patients with SJS/TEN with malignancies remain undefined.Objectives:To explore the potential involvement of malignancy and its related factors contributing to the poor outcome of SJS/TEN, in a retrospective study.Methods:In total 517 patients with SJS/TEN were enrolled. Forty-seven who sustained various types of malignancies were analysed for numerous malignancy-related factors, including cancer types, clinical stages and chemotherapies given or not before the onset of SJS/TEN.Results:We found that the mortality rate of patients with SJS/TEN with malignancies was higher than that of patients without malignancies (32%, 15/47 vs. 8Â·5%, 40/470, respectively) (P Conclusions:Our results suggest that several factors related to malignancies, such as specific cancer types, chemotherapy and malnutrition, may contribute to poor prognosis in patients with malignancies developing SJS/TEN.
