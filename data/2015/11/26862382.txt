Background:Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is responsible for chronic, acute, and fulminant hepatitis, which are prevalent worldwide. Chronic HBV may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Several epidemiological studies have indicated that hepatitis B virus is involved in B-cell Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).Objectives:The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between hepatitis B infection and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.Materials and methods:Paraffin embedded of 41 block samples including 12 (29.26%) Hodgkin and 29 (70.73%) non-Hodgkin patients were collected. Next, DNA extraction was carried out for all the samples followed by HBV DNA detection by the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The positive HBV DNA samples were sequenced, and HBV genotypes and HBV subtypes were determined.Results:Three out of 12 (25%) Hodgkin samples and seven out of 29 (24.13%) non-Hodgkin showed positive HBV DNA results. The results of sequencing revealed that the D genotype was predominant among the positive HBV patients. Interestingly an unpredictable amino acid proline was detected in position 88 of the HBs gene, which indicates a new mutation in the "S" region of HBV DNA in patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Conclusions:A high rate of 25% and 24.13% of HBV DNA was detected among patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively.
