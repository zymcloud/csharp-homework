Objective:To explore the different effects in ex vivo bovine liver between multiple cool-tip internally cooled electrodes synchronous radiofrequency ablation via switching controller and conventional single electrode overlapping radiofrequency ablation.Method:The above two methods were used to ablate in ex vivo bovine liver respectively. Electrode exposed end was 3 cm or 4 cm in length. The morphological characteristics of lesions created by two methods were observed, the sizes of the ablated lesions were measured and compared.Result:The formation of lesions ablated by both two methods was ellipsoidal. The longitudinal diameter, transverse diameter, front-end diameter and volume of the lesions ablated 16 mins by multi-electrode synchronous radiofrequency ablation via switching controller were (7.12 ± 0.52) cm, (5.71 ± 0.47) cm, (1.77 ± 0.29) cm, (102 ± 20) cm³, respectively. All of them are larger than the lesions ablated 36 mins by conventional single electrode overlapping radiofrequency ablation (P0.05).Conclusion:Compared with the conventional single electrode overlapping radiofrequency ablation, multi-electrode synchronous radiofrequency ablation via switching controller create larger lesion in the shorter time. It may provide a new attempt for the clinical treatment of large hepatocellular carcinoma.
