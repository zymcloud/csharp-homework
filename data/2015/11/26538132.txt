Recent genome-wide associated studies (GWASs) have revealed several common loci associated with the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)- or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We selected 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through GWASs on HBV- or HCV-related HCC, and genotyped them in two independent Chinese cohorts of chronic HBV carriers, including 712 LC cases and 2601 controls. The association of each SNP with the risk of HBV-related LC was assessed by meta-analysis of the two cohorts. Of the 12 SNPs reported in HBV-related HCC GWASs, five SNPs (rs7574865 in STAT4, rs9267673 near C2, rs2647073 and rs3997872 near HLA-DRB1 and rs9275319 near HLA-DQ), were found to be significantly associated with the risk of HBV-related LC (rs7574865: P = 1.79 × 10(-2), OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.03-1.34; rs9267673: P = 4.91 × 10(-4), OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.15-1.63; rs2647073: P = 3.53 × 10(-5), OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.29-2.06; rs3997872: P = 4.22 × 10(-4), OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.32-2.62; rs9275319: P = 1.30 × 10(-2), OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.06-1.64). However, among the three SNPs associated with the risk of HCV-related HCC in previous GWASs, none of them showed significant association with the risk of HBV-related LC. Our results suggested that genetic variants associated with HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis may already play an important role in the progression from CHB to LC.
