Background:Right hepatectomy (RH) instead of right posterior sectionectomy (RPS) is commonly performed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic livers located lateral to the right hepatic vein in order to ensure adequate resection margin. This potentially increased the risk of postoperative liver failure. This study aims to compare survival outcomes and surgical morbidities between RH and RPS.Methods:All patients between 2003 and 2013 with resection for solitary HCC in cirrhotic livers at segment 6/7 were reviewed. Baseline demographics, liver function, perioperative outcomes, and overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between RH and RPS.Results:Eighty-one patients were included in this study. Thirty-two patients had RH and forty-nine with RPS were selected as controls. Majority of the HCC patients (91.4 %) suffered from chronic hepatitis B. There was no significant difference in age, gender and Child-Pugh grade between the two groups. The median tumour size of RH group was 6 vs. 4 cm in the RPS group (p Conclusion:RPS can achieve similar OS and DFS as RH for HCC, and should be considered as the treatment of choice in order to optimise the postoperative remnant parenchymal liver functions.
