The patient was an 82-year-old man, who contracted chronic hepatitis C in 1977. In 1997, he was diagnosed with intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), and was treated with surgery. In August 2005, cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were detected, and he underwent a subsegmentectomy of the liver. In February 2007, he had a supradiaphragmatic lymph node recurrence of CCC. It was a solitary lesion; therefore, we resected the recurrent tumor by thoracoscopic surgery. In January 2012, squamous cell lung cancer was detected and he had a thoracoscopic operation. Furthermore, in February 2015, 2HCCs were detected in S5 and S5/8 of the liver. He underwent radiofrequency ablation. Over the course of 18 years, this patient developed cancers in his pancreas, intrahepatic bile duct, liver, and lung. However, the patient has survived without recurrence because of aggressive therapy and diligent surveillance after surgery.
