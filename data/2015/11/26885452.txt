MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as key regulators of gene expression and their dysregulation is linked to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. MiR-610 has been implicated as an anti-tumor miRNA in multiple types of cancers. However, its biological role and the underlying mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been well explored. In this study, we report that miR-610 expression is decreased in CRC samples while ectopic expression of miR-610 suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and influences the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins by up-regulating E-cadherin expression and down-regulating vimentin expression. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we reveal that miR-610 directly targets hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) by binding to its 3'UTR. A negative correlation was also observed between miR-610 and HDGF expression in CRC tissues. Further studies show that inhibition of HDGF recapitulates the anti-tumor function of miR-610, whereas re-expression of HDGF partially abrogates the inhibitory effects of miR-610. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-610 exerts its function by directly targeting HDGF. The miR-610/HDGF axis is a novel therapeutic target for CRC.
