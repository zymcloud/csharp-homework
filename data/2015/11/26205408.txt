Chronic hepatitis C virus infection represents a serious global public health problem, typically resulting in fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on our previous discovery of lead compound 2 (Liu et al. J Med Chem 54:5747-5768, 2011), 35 new quinoxalinone derivatives were explored in this study. Outline of the structure-activity relationships (SARs) revealed that compound BH6870 (36) showed high anti-HCV potency ([Formula: see text]) and a good cell safety index (SI [Formula: see text]). SARs analysis indicated that quinoxalin-2(1H)-one containing a 4-aryl-substituted thiazol-2-amine moiety was optimal for antiviral activity. Introducing a hydrogen-bond acceptor (such as ester or amide group) at the C-3 position of quinoxalin-2(1H)-one was beneficial for the antiviral potency, and especially, N,N-disubstituted amide was far superior to N-monosubstituted amide. Incorporation of more than one halogen (fluorine or chlorine atom) or a strong electron-withdrawing group on the benzene ring of the thiazole-phenyl moiety might reduce electron atmosphere density further and resulted in a dramatical loss of activity. The NH-group of the lactam moiety was clearly required for anti-HCV activity. Design and synthesis of quinoxalin-2(1H)-one derivatives as new non-nucleoside small-molecule HCV inhibitors. BH6870 (36), showing higher antiviral potency and a good cell safety index, was identified.
