Primary hepatic malignancies are uncommon in pediatrics. Tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develop typically in the setting of chronic liver disease. The incidence of HCC in Wilson's disease-related cirrhosis is disproportionately lower than in many other forms of end-stage liver disease. A preadolescent girl presented with Wilson's disease cirrhosis and a HCC requiring orthotopic liver transplantation. This case highlights the need to consider hepatic malignancies even in young Wilson's disease patients. Pediatric Wilson's disease and the hepatic tumor literature are reviewed.
