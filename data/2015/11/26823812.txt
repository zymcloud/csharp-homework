Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in many important cellular processes and deregulation of miRNAs is linked to many human diseases including cancer. Although miR-424 has been demonstrated to inhibit progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its expression level in serum samples and the potential clinical values remain unknown.Materials and methods:The expression level of miR-424 in the serum clinical samples from HCC patients and healthy volunteers were determined by qRT-PCR. Then the association of serum miR-424 expression level with various important clinicopathological parameters and survival rates was evaluated. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors for HCC.Results:The expression level of serum miR-424 was significantly decreased in patients with HCC compared with the healthy volunteers (PConclusions:Our findings provide the compelling evidence that the decreased expression of serum miR-424 may serve as a novel biomarker to predict the unfavorable prognosis of HCC patients.
