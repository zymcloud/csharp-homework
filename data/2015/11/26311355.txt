Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with steatohepatitic features (steatohepatitic HCC, SH-HCC) is a histological subset of HCC, highly associated with metabolic disease and underlying steatohepatitis. Although it has distinct clinicopathologic characteristics, little is known about the immunophenotype or genetic characteristics of SH-HCC. We conducted an immunohistochemical analysis on a tissue microarray containing 197 HCCs (70 SH-HCCs and 127 conventional HCCs (C-HCCs)), focusing on proteins associated with genetic subtypes of HCC and those associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or NAFLD-associated HCC. We also investigated CTNNB1 mutations in 84 HCCs (31 SH-HCCs and 53 C-HCCs) to better characterize the SH-HCC. When compared to C-HCC, SH-HCC was characterized by a significantly lower incidence of nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (5.7 vs. 25.2 %, p
