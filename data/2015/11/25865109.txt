Background & aims:Although potentially very useful in optimizing patient selection and follow-up, the individual response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generally unpredictable. The aim of this study was to identify tissue predictors of tumour resistance to TACE for use in clinical practice on pretreatment biopsies.Methods:We investigated the association of residual tumour in post-TACE-resected HCC with pathological and immunophenotypical features, mainly related to hypoxia and angiogenesis. Comparison of tumour phenotype between post-TACE HCC and both paired pre-TACE biopsies and control TACE-untreated HCC was performed. Cases showing >50% residual tumour (RT) were defined as TACE-resistant.Results:A consecutive series of 108 HCC from 41 patients was studied. Overall, 45/108 (44%) HCC were classified as TACE-resistant. Among these, 32 (71%) and 40 (89%) showed diffuse CD34 vascular staining and negative VEGF staining respectively (pConclusions:This study demonstrates the potential value of pretreatment tumour biopsy as predictors of TACE resistance in HCC.
