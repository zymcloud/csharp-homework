Background:Gastric cancer with a high level of serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is uncommon and has unique clinicopathological features and a poorer prognosis. The aim of this research was to elucidate the clinicopathological and prognostic features of gastric cancer with a high level of AFP.Methods:The sera from 1,286 patients with gastric cancer treated at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University from January 2004 to December 2008 were analyzed preoperatively for AFP, CEA and CA19-9 levels after excluding active or chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as preoperative distant metastasis. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 86 serum AFP-positive patients and 1,200 serum AFP-negative patients according to a cutoff of 20 ng/mL. The clinicopathological features and prognostic factors were compared between the groups.Results:A higher incidence of serosal invasion, lymph node metastasis and liver metastasis and poorer prognosis was observed in the AFP-positive group compared with the AFP-negative group (all p<0.05). Serum AFP showed the highest specificity (93.66%) and diagnostic accuracy (92.38%) for predicting liver metastasis among the 3 tumor markers examined. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that AFP positivity was an independent prognostic factor in all 1,286 gastric cancer patients. The prognosis of AFP-positive gastric cancer was poorer than that of AFP-negative gastric cancer (p<0.05).Conclusions:A high level of serum AFP is an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer and can be used for evaluating the prognosis of gastric cancers whether in the presence or absence of liver metastasis.
