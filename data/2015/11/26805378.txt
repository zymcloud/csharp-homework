Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma is rare. There is no consensus on a treatment strategy for metastatic lesions to the liver. We report of a 68-year-old man who received total pancreatectomy for pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. One year after surgery, abdominal enhanced CT showed a small liver tumor in segment 8. We diagnosed this tumor as hepatic metastasis of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, and we resected it via partial liver resection. Pathological studies indicated a metastasis from pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma. The patient has been alive without recurrence for 7 months after the hepatectomy. There is no consensus on surgery for hepatic metastasis of acinar cell carcinoma, but if surgical resection is possible and safe, we consider it an appropriate treatment option.
