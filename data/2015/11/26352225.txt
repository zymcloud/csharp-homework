Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns have been associated with a number of human diseases. Accurate quantitation of miRNA levels is important for their use as biomarkers and in determining their functions. Although the issue of proper miRNA detection was solved with the introduction of standard reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) assays, numerous issues with the selection of appropriate internal control genes remain. U6 (RNU6‑1) snRNA, the most commonly used internal control gene in miRNA RT‑qPCR assays, was shown to be unstable in clinical samples, particularly cancer tissues. Identification of the distribution of U6 in different tissues is the premise of more accurate quantification of miRNAs. However, the distribution of U6 in human carcinoma tissues and corresponding normal tissues is unknown. In the present study, U6 levels were significantly higher in human breast carcinoma tissues compared with the corresponding normal tissues by RT‑qPCR. In the carcinoma or corresponding adjacent normal tissues, the expression levels of U6 in epithelial cells were higher than those in the mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of U6 in the carcinoma tissues of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts were higher than those in the adjacent normal tissues. These results suggest that the expression and distribution of U6 exhibits a high degree of variability among several types of human cells. Therefore, caution is required when selecting U6 as an internal control gene for evaluating expression profiles of miRNAs in patients with carcinoma, particularly carcinoma of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts.
