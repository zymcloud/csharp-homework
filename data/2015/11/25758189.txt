Background:Portal vein occlusion (PVO) is used to increase inadequate future liver remnant volume (FLRV). Impaired liver regeneration has been reported in aged animals. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of patient age on hepatic regeneration.Methods:Sixty patients aged ≥70 years were matched 1:1 with 60 patients aged <70 years. Matching criteria were sex, diabetes, cirrhosis, pre-PVO chemotherapy and bevacizumab administration, and jaundice.Results:The median ages in the older and younger groups were 76 (range 70-83) years and 59 (range 20-69) years, respectively (p < 0.001). Median FLRV following PVO (33.1 ± 6.8 vs. 31.9 ± 6.0 %) and volumetric increase (0.52 ± 0.35 vs. 0.49 ± 0.34) were similar in the two groups. Of the older and younger patients, 10 % and 1.7 %, respectively, did not undergo liver surgery after PVO (p = 0.051). Mortality (5.5 vs. 6.7 %) and major morbidity (25.9.8 vs. 22 %) rates were similar. Liver failure rate was higher in older patients (35.1 vs. 16.9 %, p < 0.026), mainly due to Grade A liver failure (20.3 vs. 8.4 %, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that age ≥ 70 years [odds ratio (OR) 3.03; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.18-7.78; p = 0.020] and biliary cancer diagnosis (OR 4.69; 95 % CI 1.81-12.09; p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for postoperative liver failure.Conclusions:Liver regeneration after PVO is not impaired by age. Nevertheless, liver resection in elderly patients is performed less often after PVO and carries a higher risk of liver failure.
