Chemotherapy is not effective for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC); however, prolonged survival can be expected for patients with multiple metastases who are treated with surgical resection in addition to chemotherapy. We present a case of a 36-year-old woman with hepatitis B who developed HCC with multiple intrahepatic and lung metastases after undergoing resection of HCC in 2010 in Canada. The patient returned to Japan for additional treatment. She was treated with TACE therapy and systemic chemotherapy, but her lung metastases did not improve. The patient's PIVKA-Ⅱ levels remained moderately elevated after initiation of chemotherapy. Therefore, we performed surgical resection of the lung metastases in March 2014. Five months later, the patient received additional TACE therapy when an isolated metastasis was found in the residual liver. Since then, no recurrence of HCC has been found, and the patient's PIVKA-Ⅱ levels have remained in the normal range. This case demonstrates that surgical resection for multiple lung metastases is possible in select patients.
