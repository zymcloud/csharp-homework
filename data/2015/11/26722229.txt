The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression, localization and role of centromere-associated protein E (Cenp-E) in hepatoma cells. The Cenp-E mRNA expression levels in the HepG-2 human hepatocellular carcinoma and LO2 normal hepatic cell lines following treatment with nocodazole were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, the localization and expression of Cenp-E protein in the two cell types was visualized using indirect immunofluorescence. RT-qPCR was also performed to detect the Cenp-E mRNA expression levels in LO2 cells before and after RNA interference. Additional evaluation of the function of interfered cells was performed using indirect immunofluorescence. The results of RT-qPCR demonstrated that the protein expression levels of Cenp-E in the two cell lines prior to treatment with nocodazole were not significantly different (P>0.05). However, the upregulation of Cenp-E expression levels in the LO2 cells was significantly higher compared with that in the HepG-2 cells during cell division (P
