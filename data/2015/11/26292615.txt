Rationale and background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most frequently used palliative therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is a safe and effective procedure with few major and minor complications. Rarely, biliary complications are also encountered following TACE. The goal of our study was to investigate the incidence and the presentation of biliary complications following TACE in patients with HCC.Material and methods:In this retrospective study, data of patients with HCC who underwent TACE between June 2002 to December 2014 were obtained from the records. Their detailed information about the procedure of TACE, diagnosis of biliary complications and subsequent management details were reviewed.Result:One hundred and sixty-eight patients with HCC underwent 305 procedures of TACE. Of these, biliary complications of various severities developed in 6 (3.6%) patients leading to an incidence of 1.9% (6/305). Minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation (IHBD) occurred in three, biliary stricture in one and intrahepatic biloma in two patients. Supportive management was undertaken for IHBD patients while percutaneous aspiration and naso-biliary drainage was performed for the infected bilomas.Conclusion:Biliary complications following TACE are infrequent. Diagnosis should be suspected clinically and confirmed with imaging. Treatment depends on the severity. Enforcing specific measures can minimize its frequency.
