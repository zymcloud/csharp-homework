We report a case of a 62-year-old woman with a growing liver tumor that was difficult to differentiate from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Abdominal CT revealed a hypervascular tumor (36 mm in diameter) in segment 3 of the liver that showed early enhancement and which had grown from 30 mm to 36 mm over the previous year. A fatty liver and gallstones were also detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high intensity staining of the tumor on both T1- and T2-weighted images, and EOB-MRI revealed a mass that showed high signal intensity in the hepatobiliary phase. The imaging findings were not typical for HCC; however, the possibility of malignancy could not be ruled out due to the enlargement of the mass. Therefore, in February 2015, we performed a laparoscopic left lateral segmentectomy with cholecystectomy. After a good postoperative course, the patient was discharged from the hospital 11 days after surgery. Histological assessment revealed the tumor was focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH).
