Diagnosis of malignant portal vein infiltration and especially differentiation from bland thrombosis is challenging for most imaging techniques. The use of contrast-enhanced real-time modern imaging modalities like contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), volume perfusion CT (VPCT), or dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) with dedicated postprocessing tools provides additional support in difficult cases and is therefore recommended.The purpose of this review is to present a practical overview of strengths and limitations of modern imaging techniques in the diagnosis of malignant infiltration of the portal vein by hepatocellular carcinoma and to describe subsequent changes during therapy.
