Background:Long-term nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy may reduce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.Aim:To investigate in a retrospective-prospective study whether this beneficial effect would be reduced in cirrhotic patients who discontinued a successful course of entecavir (ETV) therapy.Methods:The study included 586 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients with compensated cirrhosis, mean age of 53.8 ± 10 years and 81% males, treated with ETV for at least 12 months. After ETV therapy for 46.5 ± 22.9 months, 205 patients who achieved hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA suppression discontinued therapy. The clinical outcomes were assessed and HCC incidence was compared between propensity score (PS)-matched patients who continued and patients who discontinued ETV therapy by Asian Pacific Association for the Study of Liver stopping rule.Results:During a mean duration of 59.3 ± 19 months after start of ETV therapy, nine and six HCC developed in an estimated annual incidence of 2.3% and 1.6% in 154 PS-matched patients who continued and who discontinued ETV therapy, respectively (P = 0.587). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that age (HR 1.065, P Conclusions:The clinical outcomes, including HCC, after cessation of a successful course of entecavir therapy in patients with compensated cirrhosis were comparable to those who continued therapy. The results suggest that this strategy of finite therapy is safe and a feasible alternative to indefinite therapy, especially in a low resources setting.
