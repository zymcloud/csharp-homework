N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) is a nucleolar protein involved in histone acetylation, telomerase activity regulation, DNA damage response and cytokinesis. The expression of NAT10 was found to be enhanced in several types of tumors, suggesting its correlation with tumor development. However, the specific role of NAT10 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of NAT10 in HCC patients and to assess the relationship of NAT10 expression with clinicopathological characteristics and tumor prognosis. We selected 17 pairs of HCC samples and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue for mRNA expression analysis. We also performed immunohistochemistry in 186 HCC samples to evaluate the NAT10 protein expression. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to study the diagnostic and prognostic value of NAT10. The results showed that NAT10 expression was mainly localized in the nuclei/nucleoli and was significantly higher in HCC tissues than peritumoral tissues (P
