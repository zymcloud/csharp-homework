Background:With the improved survival of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients, development of second primary malignancy (SPM) has become an increasingly important issue in these long-term survivors.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study to analyze NHL patients diagnosed between January 1997 and December 2010 in Taiwan. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were applied to compare the risk of SPMs in NHL patients and the general population. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent predictors of SPM.Result:NHL patients have a significantly greater risk of developing SPM [SIR 1.43; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.32-1.55; p Conclusion:This Taiwanese population-based study provides updated data about the risk of SPM in NHL patients, demonstrating an approximately 1.5 time greater risk of SPM compared to the general population. A high risk of SPM for myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma is unique to Asian patients.
