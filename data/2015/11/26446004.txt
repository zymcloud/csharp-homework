Background:Sorafenib might prevent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence caused by the promotion of neoangiogenesis after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Objectives:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE followed by sorafenib for treating advanced HCC.Patients and methods:We retrospectively analyzed 95 advanced HCC patients treated with TACE between July 2008 and December 2012 at our institution. Twenty-four patients received TACE followed by sorafenib within 14 days (S-TACE) and 71 received TACE alone. Progression-free survival (PFS) and cumulative survival from the time of non-responsiveness to TACE were compared between groups and predictive factors for PFS were analyzed.Results:The median patient age was 72.2 years and 74 patients were male (77.9 %). Although median tumor size was similar between groups, the mean tumor number was significantly higher in the S-TACE versus TACE-alone group (16 vs. 8, P = 0.04). The number of prior treatments was significantly higher in the S-TACE group. Other baseline variables were similar. There were two severe adverse events in the S-TACE group and none in the TACE-alone group. Median PFS (189 vs. 106 days, P = 0.02) and median overall survival time (861 vs. 467 days, P = 0.01) from the time of non-responsiveness to TACE were significantly longer with S-TACE than TACE alone. Adjusting for significant factors in univariate analysis, multivariate analysis indicated that sorafenib administration, tumor size, and alanine transaminase were independent predictors of PFS.Conclusion:TACE followed by sorafenib significantly improved PFS and survival in patients with advanced HCC unresponsive to TACE.
