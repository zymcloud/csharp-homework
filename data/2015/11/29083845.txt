Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy of the liver, the sixth most common cause of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Its incidence has increased dramatically throughout the world mainly driven by the increasing numbers of persons with long-standing chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who develop cirrhosis. Although 90% of HCV-associated HCC cases occur concurrently with cirrhosis, 30% to 50% of liver cancers associated with chronic HBV occur in the absence of cirrhosis. Since most people with chronic hepatitis are asymptomatic until cirrhosis or HCC is established, initial diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis rely on primary care physicians to identify and screen high-risk individuals. Studies show that family physicians have inadequate knowledge about screening and counseling for chronic hepatitis and HCC. There is evidence of advances in surgical and nonsurgical therapies in the treatment of HCC, thus different associations have updated their recommendations following these clinical and scientific advances. The aim of this review is to make family physicians familiar with novelties in identifying high-risk patients, implementing an appropriate screening strategy, diagnosis and treatment, and to assist them in the decision-making process according to evidence based data.
