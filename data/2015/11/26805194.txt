Hepatic resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) at the bifurcation of the portal has the potential to cure the disease. Herein, we report 2 cases of HCC with Vp3 treated with a multidisciplinary approach that might include preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or postoperative hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). Case 1: A 73-year-old man was diagnosed with HCC with Vp3 located in segment 1 during follow up that was treated by performing a left hepatectomy with removal of the tumor thrombus. After surgery, the patient underwent HAIC, and he was alive without disease recurrence 2 years and 2 months after surgery. Case 2: A 77-year-old man with cirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis underwent liver resection followed by TACE. However, recurrent HCC with Vp3 was detected in segments 2 and 5, so we performed a repeat liver resection. The patient was alive without disease recurrence 1 year and 8 months after surgery without having received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. In select patients diagnosed with HCC with PVTT (Vp3/4), long-term survival can be obtained with multidisciplinary treatment such as surgery and preoperative TACE or postoperative HAIC.
