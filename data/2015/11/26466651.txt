Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, globally. Most individuals infected with HCV are asymptomatic. The introduction of the newer direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies has led to achievement of treatment success rates of more than 90%. Sustained virologic response is the end point of therapy, and is considered a virologic cure. It is defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after end of therapy. This article reviews current approved non-interferon-based therapy and data from clinical trials in treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV infection.
