CD5(+) B-cell origins and their predisposition to lymphoma are long-standing issues. Transfer of fetal and adult liver BM Pro-B cells generates B cells with distinct phenotypes: fetal cells generate IgM(high) IgD(low) CD5(+) , whereas adult cells IgM(low) IgD(high) CD5(-) . This suggests a developmental switch in B lymphopoiesis, similar to the switch in erythropoiesis. Comparison of mRNA and miRNA expression in fetal and adult Pro-B cells revealed differential expression of Lin28b mRNA and Let-7 miRNA, providing evidence that this regulatory axis functions in the switch. Recent work has shown that Arid3a is a key transcription factor mediating fetal-type B-cell development. Lin28b-promoted fetal development generates CD5(+) B cells as a consequence of positively selected self-reactivity. CD5(+) B cells play important roles in clearance of apoptotic cells and in protective immune responses, but also pose a risk of progression to leukemia/lymphoma. Differential Lin28b expression in fetal and adult human B-cell precursors showed that human B-cell development may resemble mouse, with self-reactive "innate-like" B cells generated early in life. It remains to be determined whether such human B cells have a higher propensity to leukemic progression. This review describes our recent research with CD5(+) B cells and presents our perspective on their role in disease.
