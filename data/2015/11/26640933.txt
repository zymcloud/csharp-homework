Objectives:Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, unless originating from surgery or an intra-abdominal source, is an infection diagnosed by neutrophil counts greater than 250/mm³ in ascites. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is the most common infection among patients hospitalized with cirrhosis, with a prevalence of 9% and a risk of development among all patients with cirrhosis within 1 year of 10%. No valid parameters have been defined to predict the mortality related to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Unless it is treated, the mortality rate as a result of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is 50%, and serious complications may arise.Materials and methods:Medical records from 29 patients on the deceased-donor transplant waiting list and receiving treatment at the Başkent University Hospital Gastroenterology Clinic for cirrhotic ascites infection between 1996 and 2013 were analyzed. Demographic information, paracentesis findings, clinical follow-up, and treatment results were reviewed and collected from patient medical records, with data recorded to the research form.Results:In our patient group, 72.4% were men and the average age was 46.6 years. Most of our patients were at advanced stage, with 55.2% having a Child-Pugh score of C and an average Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 17 ± 4.1. We found that 34.5% of the patients received prophylactic treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, 72.4% received a proton pump inhibitor, and 82.8% had treatment with intravenous albumin support at the time of diagnosis. Albumin treatment showed no effect on mortality. Mortality rate among patients with Child-Pugh score of C was 81.3%.Conclusions:Existence of chronic renal failure, liver graft surgery, and hepatocellular cancer did not seem to have a significant effect on patient mortality. The albumin treatment protocol showed no significant difference despite common belief among physicians.
