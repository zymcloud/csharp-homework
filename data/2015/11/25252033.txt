Background:The prevalence of non-B or non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) has been increasing all over the world. Advanced glycation end products (AGE) play a role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver injury or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Methods:We examined here whether serum levels of AGE were elevated in NBNC-HCC patients compared with NASH subjects without HCC and investigated which anthropometric and clinical variables were independent determinants of AGE.Results:Ninety NBNC-HCC, 56 NASH, and 27 control subjects underwent a complete history and physical examination, determination of blood chemistries, including AGE levels. Serum levels of AGE were significantly higher in NBNC-HCC patients compared with NASH and control subjects [9.1 ± 2.7, 5.2 ± 1.7, 3.5 ± 1.2 (U/ml), respectively, P Conclusion:The present results suggest that AGE might be involved in the pathogenesis of NBNC-HCC, thereby being a biomarker that could discriminate NBNC-HCC from NASH.
