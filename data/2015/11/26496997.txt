In recent years, the spectrum of tissue-based diagnostics of hepatocellular tumours has changed due to novel molecular pathological findings. Innovative radiographics filter out small lesions and ambiguous tumours for bioptical sampling. The spectrum of these tumours includes hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatocellular adenomas, focal nodular hyperplasia and macroregenerative nodules. Primarily, morphological analysis should identify the dignity of a lesion. After exclusion of HCC and reactive liver cell nodules, hepatocellular adenomas should be further subclassified based on immunohistochemical/molecular pathological criteria according to the WHO classification of liver tumours. This procedure provides significant additional information regarding the prognosis and therapeutic implications of hepatocellular adenomas.
