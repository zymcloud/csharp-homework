This review summarizes our current knowledge of the innate and adaptive immune responses induced by hepatitis C virus, and of the genetic polymorphisms that may determine the outcome of the disease. In addition, the authors discuss the role of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress in hepatitis C virus-related pathogenic processess, such as hepatitis, fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, steatosis and insulin resistance.
