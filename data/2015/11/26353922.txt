Objective:To compare surgical outcomes between matched central hepatectomy (CH) and extended hepatectomy (EH) groups.Background:Surgical choices for centrally located liver tumours are limited. The traditional EH harbours substantial risks, whereas CH is an alternative parenchymal-sparing resection that may improve peri-operative morbidity.Methods:A review of 4661 liver resections at a single institution was performed. The cases (CH) were matched in a 1:1 ratio with EH controls.Results:The CH group was matched for demographic, tumour and laboratory factors with either right EH or combined (right/left) EH groups (n = 63 per group). Colorectal liver metastases were the most common diagnosis occurring in 70% of the patients. Higher intra-operative blood loss was observed in the right EH(P = 0.01) and combined EH groups (P < 0.01) compared with the CH group. There was a trend towards lower 90-day morbidity in the CH group (43%) compared with the right EH(59%, P = 0.1) and combined EH groups (56%, P = 0.2). The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the control groups (P < 0.01 for both). The control groups had significantly higher post-operative bilirubin and International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels compared with the CH group. A post-operative bilirubin higher than 4 mg/dl was observed in 2% of the CH group compared with 39% of the right EH group (P < 0.01) and 52% of the combined EH group (P < 0.01). No differences in the rates of bile leak/biloma, post-hepatectomy liver failure or 90-day mortality were found.Conclusions:CH, as compared with EH, was safe and associated with a shorter hospital stay and less post-operative liver dysfunction. CH should be considered in patients with centrally located tumours amenable to such a resection.
