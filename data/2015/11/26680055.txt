The practice of treating candidates for liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with locoregional therapies, is common in most transplantation centers. We present our results using transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as a neo-adjuvant treatment in our center between 2002 and 2013 to determine its effectiveness in downstaging (DS) HCC within the Milan criteria (MC). Clinical variables were recorded of both donors and recipients, such as diagnosis and treatment, variables related to its etiology, the use of TACE as a neo-adjuvant treatment, immunosuppressive therapy, toxicity, recurrence of disease, exitus, and others. Sixty-four patients were analyzed. Median age was 57 (range, 51-64) years. In this study, 84% (54) were male and 16% (10) were women. Etiology of HCC was viral in 47% (30), alcoholic in 25% (16), and other in 28% (18). TACE was conducted in 45 patients (70%). Every patient included in our study presented a T2 stage (of tumor-nodes-metastasis [TNM]) before surgery, thus within the MC. However, DS protocol was performed in 5 patients (7.8%). We performed a bivariate analysis, having assessed that the use of TACE decreases T2 stage into T1-T0 stage (P
