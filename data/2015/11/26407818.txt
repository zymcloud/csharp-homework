Purpose:Ipilimumab (IPI), a monoclonal antibody against immune-checkpoint receptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, is designed to enhance antitumor T cell function. IPI 10 mg/kg plus dacarbazine (DTIC) significantly improved overall survival in a phase 3 study involving predominantly Caucasian patients, with an adverse event (AE) profile similar to that of IPI monotherapy. We conducted a single-arm, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IPI plus DTIC in Japanese patients.Methods:Previously untreated patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma received IPI 10 mg/kg plus DTIC 850 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for four doses (q3w × 4), followed by DTIC q3w × 4 and then IPI every 12 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.Results:All 15 treated patients reported drug-related AEs, the most common of which were increases in alanine aminotransferase (n = 12, 80 %) and aspartate aminotransferase (n = 11, 73 %). Treatment-related serious AEs were reported in 11 (73 %) patients. Nine patients (60 %) discontinued treatment due to drug-related toxicities. Immune-related AEs (irAEs) were reported in 14 patients (93 %). The most frequent irAEs were liver (n = 12, 80 %) and skin (n = 10, 67 %) toxicities. Five deaths were reported; all were caused by progressive disease. Efficacy evaluation showed one complete response, one partial response and four patients with stable disease. Best overall response rate was 13 % (2/15), and the disease control rate was 40 % (6/15). The study was terminated early due to frequent, high-grade liver toxicities.Conclusions:IPI 10 mg/kg plus DTIC 850 mg/m(2) was not considered tolerable in the Japanese patient population.
