Background:Intestinal fibrosis is a process driven by chronic inflammation leading to increased presence of myofibroblasts and collagen deposition. Although strictures are rarely seen in ulcerative colitis [UC], longstanding disease is believed to cause fibrosis resulting in altered bowel function.Methods:The presence of fibrosis was studied in colectomy specimens from patients with recent-onset UC refractory to medical treatment [n = 13] and longstanding UC [n = 16], and colon cancer patients without UC [n = 7] as controls. Severity of inflammation was scored according to the Geboes score on haematoxylin and eosin stainings. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect Î±-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin and collagen I and III.Results:Colectomy specimens from patients with acute UC showed significantly more inflammation than those with longstanding disease [19 vs 9 points, p = 0.01]. Both acute and longstanding UC showed a thicker muscularis mucosa than controls [0.10 vs 0.10 vs 0.05 mm, respectively, p = 0.019]. An increase in collagen I and III deposition in the mucosa was observed in UC compared with controls (40% [30-75] vs 25% [10-25], p = 0.033), but this did not differ significantly among acute and longstanding UC patients.Conclusions:Collagen deposition is enhanced in UC compared with controls. However, UC collagen deposition does not increase significantly over time and does not seem to aggravate the entire fibrotic process.
