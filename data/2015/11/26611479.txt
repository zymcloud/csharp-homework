Pancreatic cancer remains fourth among cancer-related deaths. Its diagnosis is often missed, owing to its vague abdominal symptoms, leading to a diagnosis of stage IV pancreatic cancer. FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy was administered to the patient in this report, resulting in significant improvement based on tests of biological markers as well as radiographic resolution of the metastatic disease. A keen awareness of this condition along with appropriate diagnostic tests can allow for an earlier diagnosis and may impact its high mortality.
