A series of butylphthalide derivatives (BPDs) 1-8 were isolated from the extract of the dried rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. (Umbelliferae). The cytotoxic activities of BPDs 1-8 were evaluated using a panel of human cancer cell lines. In addition, the SAR analysis and potential anti-invasion activities were investigated. The spÂ² carbons at C-7 and C-7a appeared to be essential for the cytotoxic activities of BPDs. BPDs 5 and 6 remarkably inhibited the migration and invasion of cancer cells. The anti-invasion activity of dimer 6 was demonstrated to be significantly higher than monomer 5.
