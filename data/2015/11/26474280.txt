Growing evidences support the concept that peritumoral microenvironment gene expression is an important element for physicians to make an accurate prognosis. Nonetheless, the correlation between peritumoral ubiquitin ligases and the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) survival remains unclear till this present. The expression of intratumoral and peritumoral Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma (Cbl) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) followed by curative resection was assessed by tissue microarray-based immune-histochemistry in two independent cohorts (n = 352). Their respective prognostic values and other clinicopathologic factors were then evaluated. The peritumoral Cbl density, much higher than that in intratumoral tissue, was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P
