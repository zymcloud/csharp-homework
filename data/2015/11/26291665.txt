Disease burden is an important indicator of the state of health of a population. It can be measured as the frequency (eg, incidence and prevalence) of a condition or its effects including fatal and non-fatal health loss from disease (eg, disability-adjusted life years) as well as the financial costs (eg, direct healthcare costs and indirect healthcare expenditures related to lost income because of premature death). Accurate disease burden information is essential for policy-making such as prioritization of health interventions and allocation of resources. Chronic liver disease (CLD) causes substantial health and economic burden in the United States, where nearly 2 million deaths annually are attributable to CLD. In the recent past, overall mortality rate of CLD has been increasing. Viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease are thought to be the most common etiologies of chronic liver diseases. More recently, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is rapidly increasing, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis has become a leading indication for liver transplantation. In this article, we assemble available data on the burden of CLD in the United States, focusing on nonmalignant complications, whereas the impact on mortality and healthcare expenses of hepatocellular carcinoma, an important consequence of CLD, is discussed elsewhere.
