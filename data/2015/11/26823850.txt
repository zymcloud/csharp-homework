Liver cancer, with a very high prevalence, is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Galectin-9, a semi-galactoside-binding protein, was demonstrated to be involved in the formation and metastasis processes of tumors such as breast cancer, and has significant impact on the development and prognosis of tumor. In this study, 90 cases of liver cancer patients who had liver cancer resection surgery treatment, were selected. Samples of liver cancer tissues and cancer-adjacent tissues from the surgery resection of liver cancer patients, which also confirmed by pathology after operation as specimens, were obtained to detect the expression level of Galectin-9 mRNA. The comparing results showed that there were significant differences between the expression of Galectin-9 mRNA in cancer-adjacent tissues and that in cancer tissues (P
