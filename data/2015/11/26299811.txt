Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within proteins, which is controlled by the reciprocal action of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, plays a key role in regulating almost all physiological responses. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that once the balance of tyrosine phosphorylation is disturbed, drastic effects can occur. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a classical non-transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, is a pivotal regulator and promising drug target in type 2 diabetes and obesity. Recently it has received renewed attention in liver diseases and represents an intriguing opportunity as a drug target by modulating hepatocyte death and survival, hepatic lipogenesis and so on. Here, the multiple roles of PTP1B in liver diseases will be presented, with respect to liver regeneration, drug-induced liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Drug-induced liver disease (DILI); Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); Liver regeneration; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B).
