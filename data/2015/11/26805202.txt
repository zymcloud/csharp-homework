A 62 year-old woman was hospitalized with the diagnosis of pneumonia, and a huge mass was recognized in the right lobe of the liver during a CT scan. AFP and PIVKA-â…¡ were elevated to 101.05 ng/mL and 2,177 mAU/mL. The liver function test indicated Child-Pugh classification A, liver damage degree B, and ICG R15 34%. We judged a radical cure resection impossible. We treated the patient with arterial injections of modified new FP therapy. No side effect occurred during the first course. Liver dysfunction with fever and hematuria occurred during the second course, leading to discontinuation of therapy. Because a prominent reduction in the size of the tumor was achieved, liver resection is scheduled. New FP therapy can be expected to attain a favorable result that may allow for curative resection of the tumor.
