F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbxw7), the substrate-recognition component of SCFFbxw7 complex, is thought to be a tumor suppressor involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and survival. Although an increasing number of ubiquitin substrates of Fbxw7 have been identified, the best characterized substrates are cyclin E and c-Myc. Fbxw7/cyclin E and Fbxw7/c-Myc pathways are tightly regulated by multiple regulators. Fbxw7 has been identified as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma. This review focused on the regulation of Fbxw7/cyclin E and Fbxw7/c-Myc pathways and discussed findings to gain a better understanding of the role of Fbxw7 in hepatocellular carcinoma.
