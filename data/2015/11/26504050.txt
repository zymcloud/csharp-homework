Background/aim:It is generally believed that the plasma concentration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is constant when 5-FU is continually administered for chemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to verify whether this is true.Patients and methods:Nine patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled in this study. All patients received chemotherapy; four patients received FOLFIRI (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) and five received FOLFOX (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin). 5-FU was administered continuously (2400 mg/m(2)) for 46 h. Serum was collected at 12 points after the start of administration. The concentration of 5-FU was evaluated using a new immunoassay method and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC/MS) method.Results:The concentrations of 5-FU fluctuated dramatically over time, with greater than 3-fold changes in each individual, and the pattern was not constant.Conclusion:Because the serum concentration of 5-FU fluctuates and displays various patterns, the dosage should not be based on body surface area. A new individualized method for determining the 5-FU dosage should be developed.
