We report a case of locally advanced huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invading the diaphragm and the right lung, which was controlled by sorafenib, thereby allowing curative resection. A 72-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced HCC invading the diaphragm and the right lung. At the time of diagnosis, his tumor was considered unresectable and he underwent transarterial embolization (TAE)/transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) 3 times. Assessment with enhanced CT after TAE/TACE showed that a viable lesion remained. Subsequently, he was treated with sorafenib for 15 months. Reassessment showed that the main tumor remained stable in size, and he was admitted to our hospital for surgery. Preoperative evaluation by enhanced CT and MRI detected an intrahepatic metastasis in segment 4 of the liver. After TACE was performed for this nodule, extended right hemihepatectomy with right diaphragmatic and right lung partial resection was performed. He had no postoperative complications and was discharged 27 days after surgery. He remains alive without recurrence 10 months after surgery.
