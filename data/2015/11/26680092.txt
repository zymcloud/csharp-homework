Guidelines recommend colonoscopy screening for possible asymptomatic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in all patients diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC-IBD warrants regular dysplasia-surveillance colonoscopy. However, no consensus exists regarding follow-up colonoscopy in PSC patients without IBD who remain asymptomatic. We describe a 43-year-old female who had undergone liver transplantation (LT) due to advanced PSC. Previous colonoscopies had been normal. The post-transplantation course was uneventful, with no rejections and signs of PSC recurrence. Immunosuppression was by tacrolimus monotherapy. She was asymptomatic with normal inflammation markers. A protocol colonoscopy, performed as general dysplasia surveillance 8 years post-transplantation, revealed mucopurulent-covered small superficial ulcerations and erythema diffusely distributed from the cecal to sigmoid colon with intervening normal mucosa and rectal sparing. Histologic examination showed patchy chronic colitis with crypt architectural distortion and mild-moderate inflammation activity. Infection samples were negative. Findings complied with de novo IBD, type unclassified. In conclusion, the link between PSC and clinically silent IBD may manifest after the PSC diagnosis and even several years after LT. Given the increased colorectal cancer risk associated with PSC, IBD, and LT, repeat colonoscopy might be warranted in PSC patients without IBD at initial assessment, and also after LT.
