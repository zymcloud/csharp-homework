Background & aims:A broad range of hepatocellular nodules has been reported in hepatic vascular disorders. It is not clear whether hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) in this context share the same characteristics as conventional HCA. The aim of this study was to carry out a retrospective multicenter survey of hepatocellular nodules associated with hepatic vascular disorders.Methods:Forty-five cases were reviewed, including 32 Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Benign nodules were subtyped using the HCA immunohistochemical panel.Results:Nodules with a HCA morphology were observed in 11 cases. Six originated in BCS: two were liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) negative (one with malignant transformation); two expressed glutamine synthetase (GS) and nuclear b-catenin, two expressed C reactive protein (CRP). Among three cases with portal vein agenesis, one nodule was LFABP negative, two expressed GS and nuclear b-catenin, both with malignant transformation. In a Fallot tetralogy case, there were multiple LFABP negative nodules with borderline features and in a hepatoportal sclerosis case, the nodule looked like an inflammatory HCA. Two additional cases had nodules expressing CRP, without typical characteristics of inflammatory HCA.Conclusion:HCA of different immunohistochemical phenotype can develop in hepatic vascular disorders; they may have a different behavior compared to conventional HCA and be more at risk of malignant transformation.
