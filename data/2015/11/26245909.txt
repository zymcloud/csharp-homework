Objectives:Tetrazanbigen (TNBG) is a newly synthesized compound with an isoquinoline moiety, and its antitumour effects were evaluated in in-vitro and in-vivo models.Methods:3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to measure the antiproliferative activity of TNBG on cancer cell lines. Antitumour activity of TNGB in vivo was also assessed in a xenograft model of human hepatocellular carcinoma QGY-7701 cell line. Cell cycle and cell apoptosis analysis was performed.Key findings:TNBG exhibited strong antitumour efficacy against six human cancer cell lines with IC50 range of 2.13-8.01 μg/ml. The IC50 of TNBG on normal hepatic cells was 11.25 μg/ml. Lots of lipid droplets were observed in cytoplasm of human hepatocellular carcinoma QGY-7701 cells after treatment of TNBG. S phase arrest and apoptosis induction by TNBG were also found on QGY-7701 cells. Intraperitoneal injection of TNBG (1.5 mg/kg/day) resulted in significant decreases in tumour volume and tumour weight on nude mice bearing QGY-7701 cells xenografts. Results from pathological analysis in nude mice demonstrated that TNBG could induce lipid accumulation specifically in cancer tissue rather than in other normal organs, tissues and blood.Conclusions:These results suggested that TNBG might exert potent antitumour activity through inducing lipid accumulation in cancer cell.
