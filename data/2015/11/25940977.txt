Aim:An estimated 1.1% of Australian adults are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Many develop chronic liver disease, and some develop liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection in Australian children is poorly defined. We aimed to determine the reported incidence, clinical and epidemiological features of newly diagnosed HCV infection in Australian children presenting to paediatricians.Methods:We undertook prospective active national surveillance, using the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit, of incident HCV cases in children aged Results:There were 45 confirmed cases of newly diagnosed HCV infection over five years ( 14), were exposed through their own IV drug use. No children were co-infected with HIV and only one child was co-infected with HBV. All children were asymptomatic at diagnosis, although many had minor elevations in liver transaminases. Many clinicians reported difficulties with follow-up.Conclusions:Childhood HCV infection is uncommon in Australia, although our data likely underestimate the incidence. Only a small number of children aged
