Nowadays, people pay more and more attention to the natural products based on their multiple targets in the antitumor treatment. In our previous research, Rhizoma paridis saponins (RPS) were regarded as potent anticancer agent that elicits programmed cell death and inhibits metastases in murine lung adenocarcinoma in vivo. In the present study, we set up a rat model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced pulmonary adenoma to evaluate the antitumor effects of RPS again. After 20 weeks treatment, rats were sacrificed in order to perform histopathological examinations, blood biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, western blot, PCR and metabonomics. As a result, DEN induced pulmonary adenoma generation in the lungs and damaged hepatocytes and hepatoma formation in the livers. RPS effectively attenuated hepatotoxic and inhibited pulmonary adenoma through down-regulating expression of MMP-9 and up-regulating level of TIMP-2 in DEN-induced rats. Meanwhile, RPS remarkably decreased energy metabolism, and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism to block the tumor growth. In conclusion, RPS would be a potent anticancer agent used in the prospective application.
