Background:With recent improvements in operative techniques, many studies have reported that resection is safe for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal hypertension (PHT). However, no direct evidence exists to compare resection with ablation in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related PHT.Methods:Of 259 HBV-related PHT patients who met the Milan criteria, 123 patients underwent resection and 136 underwent ablation as a primary treatment. Complications were graded with the Clavien-Dindo system, and oncologic outcomes were analyzed with a propensity score matching (PSM) method.Results:Compared with the ablation group, the resection group showed larger tumors, greater white blood cell counts, greater platelet counts, lower Î³-glutamyltransferase levels, and lower model of end stage liver disease scores (all P .100).Conclusion:Resection is safe and confers a survival advantage over ablation in HBV-related PHT patients. Resection may be recommended as an optimal treatment for these patients.
