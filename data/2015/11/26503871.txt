The number of computed tomography(CT)-guided interventional procedures has increased because they are less invasive and more cost-effective than open surgery. Transarterial chemoembolization(TACE)is a method in which chemotherapeutic drugs are injected into the artery that supplies the tumor. It is also well known that multidetector-CT has tremendously advanced our diagnostic capabilities broadly throughout medicine. These diagnostic benefits have combined with the widespread availability and rapidity of scanning to marked increases in CT use, for example, dynamic contrast-enhanced CT, CT perfusion imaging, and CT during angiography. However, rapidly increasing use of CT has heightened concerns about the high levels of cumulative exposure that may occur in patients undergoing recurrent imaging for chronic conditions such as chronic hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinomas. So far, bone toxicity associated with CT has received little attention. The prevalence of osteoporosis and trabecular microstructural changes using clinical MDCT-based microstructural analysis in patients after TACE with the interventional-CT system to treat hepatocellular carcinoma have been demonstrated here.
