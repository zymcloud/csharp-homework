Background:The value of hepatic resection (HR) for huge hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) (≥ 10 cm in diameter) remains controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hepatic resection (HR) for patients with huge HCC.Methods:A total of 739 patients with huge HCC (≥ 10 cm in diameter) (huge HCC group, n = 244) or small HCC (Results:The hospital mortality of these two groups were similar (P = 0.252). The 5-year OS of huge HCC group and small HCC group were 30.3% and 51.9%, respectively (P Conclusion:HR is a safe and effective approach for the treatment of huge HCC, especially for the uninodular subtype.
