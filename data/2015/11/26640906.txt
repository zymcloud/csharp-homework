Objectives:Liver transplant is one of the few effective treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplant.Materials and methods:In this retrospective study, conducted between October 1988 and March 2015, four hundred seventy-three liver transplants were performed at our institution. Of these, 231 were pediatric and 242 were adult. Among these patients, liver transplant was performed in 58 patients (12.3%) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence was detected in 14 patients (24.1%). Overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates of patients underwent liver transplant beyond the Milan criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma were 50.3% and 43.1%. Overall, 5- and 10-year survival rates of patients underwent liver transplant within the Milan criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma were 78.4% and 72.6%. The main predictive variable was whether the tumor had expensed beyond the Milan criteria.Conclusions:As expected, outcomes were significantly better in the Milan criteria group. Although the overall- and disease-free survival rates were promising in such a group of patients who had no better chance, it could be asserted that liver transplant is a safe and effective treatment option with promising results, even if the tumor expanse is beyond the Milan criteria.
