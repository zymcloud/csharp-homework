Backgrounds:The present study aimed to evaluate benefit of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAI) combined with systemic chemotherapy (SCT) for patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLMs) in a palliative setting.Methods:This was a retrospective single-center study including 43 consecutive patients with CLM after failure of standard SCT. Among them, 20 (47 %) patients underwent HAI combined with SCT (Group A) and 23 historical control patients who had received SCT with or without targeted agent treatment (Group B).Results:The two groups had similar characteristics. Compared with SCT alone, HAI combined with SCT prolonged survival (median 19.8 vs. 9.0 months; P = 0.045). Median hepatic progression-free survival was significantly longer for HAI combined with SCT vs. SCT alone (median 8.1 vs. 4.7 months; P = 0.027), as were response rates (25 and 0 %; P = 0.038) and progression-free survival (median 5.7 vs. 3.0 months; P = 0.02). Three patients (15 %) achieved conversion to potentially curative surgery. Grade 3/4 toxicities for Group A and Group B were neutropenia (5 and 8.7 %, respectively), anemia (5 and 0 %, respectively), and hyperbilirubinemia (0 and 4.3 %, respectively). Other complications were mostly grade 1 or 2.Conclusions:HAI combined with SCT treatment can improve overall survival compared with SCT alone in highly advanced CLM refractory to intravenous chemotherapy.
