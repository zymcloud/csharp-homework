Src, a non-receptor type of tyrosine, was recently reported to modulate multiple signaling pathways in human tumors. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the expression and distribution of Src on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expressions of total Src (t-Src) and an active form of Src [phosphorylated (p-) Y416Src] were analyzed in 52 northern Chinese patients with HCC using immunohistochemistry. The positive expression rates of t-Src and p-Y416Src in HCC tissue were 65.38 and 42.30%, respectively, which is significantly higher than that in adjacent non-tumor tissue (30.76 and 13.46%; P
