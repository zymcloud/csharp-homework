Background/aims:The aim of this study was to evaluate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during telbivudine (LdT) versus entecavir (ETV) treatment in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with underlying comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and cirrhosis.Methods:From 2010 to 2012, 116 CHB patients treated with LdT and 578 treated with ETV were compared in this real-practice cohort. The mean changes in eGFR (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] formula) from baseline to months 6, 12, and 18 were analyzed using a linear mixed model.Results:In LdT-treated patients, the mean eGFR increased by 7.6% at month 18 compared with the eGFR at baseline (MDRD formula in mL/min/1.73 m(2)). However, in ETV-treated patients, the mean eGFR decreased by 4.1% at month 18 compared with the eGFR at baseline. In the LdT-treated patients with DM, hypertension, cirrhosis or low eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2), the mean eGFR showed a steady improvement, whereas the mean eGFR was reduced in the same subgroups of ETV-treated patients.Conclusions:The eGFR gradually increased over time during LdT treatment, especially in patients with mild abnormal eGFR at baseline, and in those with DM, hypertension, and cirrhosis, whereas a reduction in eGFR was seen with ETV treatment.
