Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis. Alisma orientale Juzepzuk is a traditional medicinal herb for diuretics, diabetes, hepatitis, and inflammation. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of methanol extract of the tuber of Alisma orientale (MEAO) against ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. MEAO inhibited the tunicamycin-induced increase in luciferase activity of ER stress-reporter constructs containing ER stress response element and ATF6 response element. MEAO significantly inhibited tunicamycin-induced ER stress marker expression including GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 in tunicamycin-treated Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells and the livers of tunicamycin-injected mice. It also inhibited tunicamycin-induced accumulation of cellular triglyceride. Similar observations were made under physiological ER stress conditions such as in palmitate (PA)-treated HepG2 cells and the livers of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. MEAO repressed hepatic lipogenic gene expression in PA-treated HepG2 cells and the livers of HFD obese mice. Furthermore, MEAO repressed very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) expression and improved ApoB secretion in the livers of tunicamycin-injected mice or HFD obese mice as well as in tunicamycin or PA-treated HepG2 cells. Alismol, a guaiane-type sesquiterpenes in Alisma orientale, inhibited GRP78 expression in tunicamycin-treated HepG2 cells. In conclusion, MEAO attenuates ER stress and prevents hepatic steatosis pathogenesis via inhibition of expression of the hepatic lipogenic genes and VLDLR, and enhancement of ApoB secretion.
