Although the decline in cancer mortality rates with the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in HIV-infected individuals can be mostly explained by a decrease in cancers incidence, we looked here if improved survival after cancer diagnosis could also contribute to this decline. Survival trends were analyzed for most frequent cancers in the HIV-infected population followed in the French Hospital Database on HIV: 979 and 2,760 cases of visceral and non-visceral Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), 2,339 and 461 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), 446 lung, 312 liver and 257 anal cancers. Five-year Kaplan-Meier survival rates were estimated for four periods: 1992-1996, 1997-2000, 2001-2004 and 2005-2009. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare survival across the periods, after adjustment for confounding factors. For 2001-2004, survival was compared to the general population after standardization on age and sex. Between the pre-cART (1992-1996) and early-cART (1997-2000) periods, survival improved after KS, NHL, HL and anal cancer and remained stable after lung and liver cancers. During the cART era, 5-year survival improved after visceral and non-visceral KS, NHL, HL and liver cancer, being 83, 92, 65, 87 and 19% in 2005-2009, respectively, and remained stable after lung and anal cancers, being 16 and 65%, respectively. Compared with the general population, survival in HIV-infected individuals in 2001-2004 was poorer for hematological malignancies and similar for solid tumors. For hematological malignancies, survival continues to improve after 2004, suggesting that the gap between the HIV-infected and general populations will close in the future.
