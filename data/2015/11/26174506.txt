Purpose:To identify prognostic indicators in patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) for metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in abdominal lymph nodes (LNs).Patients and methods:RT was used to treat 65 patients for metastases from HCC in abdominal LNs. Total radiation dose was 30-60 Gy (median 52.8 Gy), with fraction size 1.8-3 Gy. RT was administered five times per week to an equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2; Gy10) of 32.5-65 Gy10 (median 54 Gy10) and an α/βratio for tumor and acute effects of normal tissue of 10.Results:Median overall survival (OS) in all patients was 8.1 months. LN responders had significantly higher median OS than nonresponders (14.5 vs. 3.7 months, p Conclusion:Our data showed that LN response to RT was an independent prognostic factor for OS in advanced HCC patients with abdominal LN metastases, and suggested that RT for metastatic LNs might improve OS in these patients. In addition, our data suggest that Child-Pugh classification, intrahepatic tumor status, and number of metastatic LNs may be useful prognostic and therapeutic indicators for selecting treatment strategies.
