Cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) is a prognostic indicator of recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following radical resection. To investigate the role of CK-19 in assessment of early recurrence and prognosis in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC following radical resection. In total, 235 patients with HBV-related HCC (age, 15-82 years; mean age, 54 Â± 10 years) undergoing radical resection were screened for inclusion from January 2005 to December 2010. Malignant tissues and adjacent non-malignant tissues were sampled during surgery, and CK-19 and Ki-67 expression was determined by tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. CK-19 mRNA levels in 30 randomly selected frozen HCC specimens were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from January 2011 to June 2011. Correlations of CK-19 and Ki-67 expression with tumor recurrence, metastasis, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Elevated CK-19 expression was correlated with early recurrence (P = 0.001), shorter DFS (P = 0.001), and reduced OS (P = 0.010). CK-19 expression was correlated with the Ki-67 index (P = 0.037), histological differentiation (P = 0.016), focal number (P = 0.044), and blood vessel tumor embolism (P = 0.002). Patients with metastasis within 1 year exhibited stronger CK-19 expression than did patients without metastasis (P
