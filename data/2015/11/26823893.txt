Objective:To study the clinical features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinical manifestations, imaging features, pathological subtypes and treatment outcome of two cases with NAFLD-associated HCC were analyzed.Results:In these two cases, both were young, obese male patients, with contrast enhanced CT scan of hemangioma-like features. They had undergone surgical resection and both were reported as well-differentiated HCC pathologically. They were followed-up respectively up to 46 and 36 months post-operatively with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis.Conclusions:NAFLD-associated HCC has different radiological presentations from typical HCC. Incidental finding of any liver occupying lesions in NAFLD patients should raise immediate clinical attention.
