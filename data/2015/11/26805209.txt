Skin metastases from esophageal cancer are comparatively rare but have poor prognosis. Here, we report a case of esophageal cancer metastases to the skin. A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for nodules with ulceration in the nose, and biopsy revealed a metastatic carcinoma. FDG-PET indicated FDG accumulation in the skin, liver, and esophagus, while an endoscopic study of the upper gastrointestinal tract showed a type 3 tumor at the upper mid-thoracic esophagus. We diagnosed the patient with metastatic esophageal cancer and administered chemotherapy. Radiation therapy (40 Gy/20 Fr) was simultaneously administered for the tumor in the nose because the patient's quality of life (QOL) decreased daily owing to pain and bleeding caused by metastatic skin cancer. The radiation therapy reduced the size of the tumor in the nose, but the tumor had remained along with the presence of a scar 3 to 6 months after the start of radiation therapy. Radiation effectively promoted the QOL of our patient with skin metastases.
