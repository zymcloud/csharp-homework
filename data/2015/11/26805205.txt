Laparoscopic surgery is less invasive and provides better cosmetic outcomes than conventional surgery. Laparoscopic liver resection has been covered by insurance since April 2010 and is increasingly performed in many hospitals. However, laparoscopic hepatectomy is sometimes difficult to perform safely in the case of HCC recurrence because adhesions restrict vision and manipulation of forceps. We report the results of laparoscopic hepatectomy for cases of HCC recurrence. From June 2010 through December 2014, 180 laparoscopic hepatectomy procedures for HCC were performed in our hospital; 33 were in patients with HCC recurrence. Of the 33 patients, 26 underwent pure laparoscopic partial hepatectomy. The median operative time was 242 min, the median bleeding amount was less than 5 g, and the median hospital stay after surgery was 12.0 days. In the group that underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy after open liver resection (12 patients), the median operative time was 303.5 min, the median bleeding amount was less than 5 g, and the median hospital stay after surgery was 9.0 days. Among the 21 patients that underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy after laparoscopic liver resection, the median operative time was 248 min (p=0.382), the median bleeding amount was less than 5 g (p=0.112), and the median hospital stay after surgery was 11.0 days (p=0.236). We could perform laparoscopic hepatectomy for cases of HCC recurrence. This procedure can be suitable for HCC recurrence, which sometimes requires poly-surgery.
