ARID1A, encoding a subunit of chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complexes, has recently been considered as a new type of tumor suppressor gene for its somatic mutations frequently found in various human tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role and mechanism of inactivated ARID1A mutations in tumorigenesis remain unclear. To investigate the role of ARID1A inactivation in HCC pathogenesis, we generated hepatocyte-specific Arid1a knockout (Arid1aLKO) mice by crossing mice carrying loxP-flanked Arid1a exon 8 alleles (Arid1af/f) with albumin promoter-Cre transgenic mice. Significantly, the hepatocyte-specific Arid1a deficiency results in mouse steatohepatitis and HCC development. In Arid1aLKO mice, we found that innate immune cells, including F4/80+ macrophages and CD11c+ neutrophil cells, infiltrate into the liver parenchyma, accompanied by the increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, and activation of STAT3 and NF-κB pathways. In conclusion, hepatocyte-specific Arid1a deficiency could lead to mouse steatohepatitis and HCC development. This study provides an alternative mechanism by which Arid1a deficiency contributes to HCC tumorigenesis.
