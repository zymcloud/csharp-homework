Despite recent progress in diagnosis and therapy, hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)remains among the cancers with the poorest prognoses. Vitamin Ks(VKs)have been shown to suppress the growth of HCC cells. Long-term administration of VK2 has established its clinical safety, but it does not appear to exhibit marked anti-tumor effects when administered alone. For more effective use of VK2 against HCC, co-administration of VK2 with other proven anticancer agents or development of a new VK preparation with a modified side-chain should be investigated in the future.
