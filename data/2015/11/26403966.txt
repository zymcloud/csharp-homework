Background and aims:Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in the development and progression of cancer. HtrA1 had been showed to play a modulatory role in metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The relationship between HtrA1 and EMT in HCC was investigated in the present study.Methods:The HtrA1 expression in human HCC tumor tissues and cells was determined by real-time PCR. SiRNA-HtrA1 and pcDNA-HtrA1 were respectively transfected into HepG2 and MHCC97H cells to observe their effects on cell migration and expression of EMT-associated markers Vimentin and E-cadherin. The relationship between HtrA1 and EMT in 60 HCC patients was also investigated.Results:HtrA1 expression of tumor tissues was down-regulated with the increasing of number in lymph nodes metastasis in HCC patients. HtrA1 down-regulation led to the significant increase of cell migration, Vimentin expression and decrease of E-cadherin expression, while HtrA1 overexpression resulted in an opposite function. The HtrA1 expression was positively related to the E-cadherin level (R(2) = 0.5903, P Conclusion:HtrA1 expression was closely related to EMT, which might be a potential mechanism underlying metastasis of HCC.
