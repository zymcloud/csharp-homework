Two new clerodane diterpenoids (1 and 2) and the known compound caseanigrescen D (3) were isolated from the leaves of Casearia grewiifolia by bioassay-guided fractionation. Their structures were determined by analyses of MS and 2D NMR data. The absolute configurations of 1 and 3 were established by analysis of X-ray diffraction data. Compounds 1-3 were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines, KB (mouth epidermal carcinoma cells), HepG-2 (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells), LU-1 (human lung adenocarcinoma cells), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer cells). Caseagrewifolin B (2) had inhibitory activity against KB and HepG-2 cell lines with IC50 values of 6.2 to 7.0 Î¼M, respectively. When tested against the normal cells (NIH/3T3), caseagrewifolin B (2) exhibited a significant selective inhibition against cancer cells in comparison with the normal cells. Caseanigrescen D (3) was cytotoxic against four cancer cell lines; however it had no selective inhibition compared with normal cells.
