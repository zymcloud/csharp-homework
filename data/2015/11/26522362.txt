Objective:To detect the expression of upregulated gene 11 (URG11) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines and study the effect of URG11 on HCC cell growth.Methods:URG11 expression was detected through immunohistochemistry in normal liver tissues, HCC tissues, and matched adjacent non-cancer tissues. URG11 expression in HCC cell lines and control liver cell line was examined by reverse transcription PCR and western blotting. URG11 eukaryotic expression vector and siRNA vector were transfected into QZG cells and HCC cells. Growth of the transfected cells was investigated by MTT assay. Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry.Results:Positive rates of URG11 expression in HCC tissues was 62.35%, in adjacent non-tumor liver tissues was 69.41%, and in normal liver tissues was 18.5%. URG11 expression was higher significantly in HCC tissues as well as adjacent non-cancer tissues than in normal liver tissues. HCC cells were found to be with the highest URG11 expression, while QZG cells were with negative expression. After URG11 expression was upregulated in QZG cells, QZG cell growth was accelerated, while when URG11 was downregulated in HCC cells, HCC cell growth was suppressed.Conclusion:URG11 could promote HCC cell growth and proliferation. It might play an important role in HCC development.
