Hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV), and C (HCV) viruses are common types of viral hepatitis. HBV and HCV infection can lead to liver disease, cancer, and serious health consequences. HAV and HBV infections are high among Asian persons, especially those born outside the United States (1-3). This report provides 2011- 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimates on prevalence of antibody to HAV (from infection or immunization), past or current HBV infection, and current HCV infection, by race and Hispanic origin.
