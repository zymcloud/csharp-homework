Background:Hepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients lead to postoperative hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation (PHR) as well as immunosuppression.Methods:This prospective study involved 135 HBV-related HCC patients and 42 control hepatic hemangioma patients.Results:Among HCC patients, 26 (19.3%) suffered PHR. Risk factors for PHR were HBV-cAg S1 positivity [hazard ratio (HR) = 404.82, P = 0.004], high preoperative total bilirubin level (HR = 186.38, P = 0.036), small preoperative proportions of CD3-CD16 + CD56 + cells (HR = 0.01, P = 0.014) and CD19 + B cells (HR = 0.02, P = 0.016), blood transfusion (HR = 157.03, P = 0.006) and high liver cirrhosis S score (HR = 270.45, P = 0.004). On postoperative day (POD) 3, PHR patients showed much greater immunosuppression than non-PHR patients based on proportions of T cells (CD3+, CD3 + CD4+, CD3 + CD8+), B cells (CD19+) and on levels of IgG, IgA antibodies, complement proteins C3, and C4. By POD 7, PHR patients had partially recovered but not as quickly as non-PHR patients: PHR patients still showed deficits in T cells (CD3+, CD3 + CD4+), CD3-CD16 + CD56+ cells and in levels of IgM, C3, C4, and C-reactive protein.Conclusion:PHR may be associated with resection-induced immunosuppression in patients with HBV-related HCC.
