A 66-year-old man underwent laparoscopic right nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (T2b, N0, M1, clear cell, Grade 3). He was treated with targeted therapy for lung metastases after nephrectomy. Despite the targeted therapy, he was paralyzed in the lower half of the body due to the spinal metastases. Therefore, an osteoplastic laminectomy and domelaminectomy for the spinal metastases was performed. The FDG-PET examination, which was performed after the operation, revealed lung, liver, bone, and small intestinal metastases. After a while, he suffered from continuous massive melena. Double balloon enteroscopy revealed a hemorrhagic tumor in the small intestine, and an emergency operation was performed. A partial resection of the small intestine was performed for the 3 tumors. The histopathological diagnosis was small intestinal metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. It is well known that renal cell carcinoma often develops metastases to the lung, bone, and liver. However, small intestinal metastasis from renal cell carcinoma is rare. Although small intestinal metastasis from renal cell carcinoma often accompanies metastases to other organs, a palliative operation might improve the quality of life in patients with symptomatic tumors.
