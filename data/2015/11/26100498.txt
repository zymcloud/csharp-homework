Background & aims:Effectiveness of surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is controversial. We here explore its effects in "real life" clinical practice.Methods:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed in the period 2005-2012 in five Dutch academic centers were evaluated. Surveillance was defined as â©¾2 screening tests during three preceding years and at least one radiologic imaging test within 18 months before diagnosis.Results:295 (27%) of 1074 cases underwent surveillance. Median time interval between last negative radiologic imaging and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis was 7.5 months. In the surveillance group, cirrhosis (97% vs. 60%, p9 months: adjusted HRs 0.51 and 0.50, 95% confidence intervals: 0.39-0.67 and 0.37-0.69).Conclusions:Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with smaller tumor size, earlier tumor stage, with an impact on therapeutic strategy and was an independent predictor of survival.
