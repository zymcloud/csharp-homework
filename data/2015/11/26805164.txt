Introduction:Reports on pancreas-preserving total duodenectomy (PPTD) for duodenal polyposis (DP) in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients are rare. We herein report a case of PPTD performed by minilaparotomy for DP in an FAP patient.Case:A 27-year-old female FAP patient was diagnosed with Spigelman classification (SC) stage Ⅳ DP on gastroduodenoscopy. She underwent PPTD through a 7 cm upper abdominal incision. All polyps were confirmed as adenomas histopathologically. After 6 months of follow-up, complications related to total duodenectomy, such as weight loss, diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver have not been observed.Discussion:SC stage Ⅳ refers to non-advanced cancers, and PPTD is basically prophylactic surgery. Therefore, pancreatoduodenectomy seems too aggressive for SC stage Ⅳ patients. PPTD by minilaparotomy is suitable for young female patients for its curability, esthetic outcome, and safety.
