The prognosis of HCC with vascular invasion is dismal, but surgery is elected when the hepatic reserve is adequate. The case involved a 68-year-old male HCV carrier. A 10 cm diameter tumor occupying the central 2 segments of the liver and liver metastasis in the left lobe were detected. The patient was diagnosed with multiple HCC with severe vascular invasion of Vp2 and Vv3. The tumor shrunk dramatically after starting HAIC therapy with cisplatin and oral administration of sorafenib. A laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed for the viable lesion. The tumor showed almost complete coagulative necrosis. Multiple hepatic metastases were found 4 months after surgery, but the tumor was under control at 25 months after the first HAIC due to HAIC, oral administration of sorafenib, and RFA. An improved prognosis for multiple HCC with severe vascular invasion can be expected by performing multidisciplinary treatments including surgery.
