Recent studies report that microRNA-519a (miR-519a) is a novel oncomir, which facilitates the onset and progression of human cancers. However, the clinical significance of miR-519a and its functional role and underlying mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are poorly investigated. In the present study, elevated expression of miR-519a was observed in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. The increased level of miR-519a expression was significantly correlated with adverse clinical features of HCC including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, large tumor size, cirrhosis and advanced tumor-node-metastasis tumor stage. Furthermore, high expression of miR-519a was prominently associated with a poorer 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival of HCC patients. Gain- and loss-of function experiments showed that miR-519a overexpression enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis of Huh7 cells. By contrast, miR-519a knockdown inhibited SMMC-7721 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Importantly, up-regulation of miR-519a reduced the expression of FOXF2 mRNA and protein in Huh7 cells, while down-regulation of miR-519a resulted in increased expression of FOXF2 in SMMC-7721 cells. An inverse correlation between mRNA levels of miR-519a and FOXF2 was observed in HCC tissues. Thus, Forkhead box F2 (FOXF2) was identified as a downstream target of miR-519a in HCC. Mechanistically, the effects of miR-519a knockdown on SMMC-7721 cells were abrogated by FOXF2 repression. In conclusion, miR-519a is a novel prognostic predictor for HCC patients and it may potentiate proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of HCC cells by targeting FOXF2.
