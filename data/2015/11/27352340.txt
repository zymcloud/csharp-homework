The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with pingyangmycin-lipiodol emulsion for the treatment of symptomatic giant hepatic haemangioma. Four hospitals (The Second Hospital of Shandong University, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Shandong Provincial Hospital and Jinan Municipal Hospital) participated in this study during 2002-2012. A total of 836 patients with symptomatic giant haemangioma were treated with pingyangmycin-lipiodol emulsion via selective TACE. The patients were followed-up for 12 months-10 years. The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by symptom assessments and upper abdominal magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. TACE was successfully performed for a total of 1120 lesions in 836 patients. Success rate of the procedure was 100 %. The mean diameter of the haemangiomas was significantly reduced after the interventional therapy (mean diameter 9.6 ± 0.8 vs. 3.6 ± 0.5 cm; P
