Rationale and objectives:Tracer kinetic model selection for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data analysis influences its use as a prognostic biomarker. Our aim was to find DCE-MRI parameters that predict 1-year survival (1YS) and overall survival (OS) among patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with antiangiogenic monotherapy by conducting a proof-of-concept comparative study of five different kinetic models.Materials and methods:Twenty patients with advanced HCC underwent DCE-MRI and subsequently received sunitinib. Pretreatment DCE-MRI data were analyzed retrospectively by using the Tofts-Kety (TK), extended TK, two compartment exchange, adiabatic approximation to the tissue homogeneity (AATH), and distributed parameter (DP) models. Arterial flow fraction (γ), arterial blood flow (BFA), permeability-surface area product (PS), fractional interstitial volume (vI), and other five parameters were calculated for each model. Individual parameters were evaluated for 1YS prediction using cross-validated Kaplan-Meier analysis, and for association with OS using univariate Cox regression analysis, with additional permutation testing.Results:For 1YS prediction, the TK model-derived γ (P = .007) and vI (P = .029) and the AATH model-derived PS (P = .005) were significant; all these parameters were lower in the high-risk group. Increase in the AATH model-derived PS and the DP model-derived BFA was associated with significant increase in OS with hazard ratios of 0.766 (P = .023) and 0.809 (P = .025), respectively.Conclusions:The AATH model-derived PS was an effective prognostic biomarker for both 1YS and OS.
