Background:The eIF5A2 gene (encoding the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2) located at 3q26 is a putative oncogene that is overexpressed in colon and rectal carcinomas, lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. EIF5A2 overexpression correlates significantly with tumor metastasis and is an adverse prognostic marker. However, eIF-5A2 overexpression in breast cancer and its effect on chemotherapy are unknown.Methods:We measured eIF-5A2 expression and doxorubicin sensitivity in different human breast cancer cell lines (Bcap-1937, HCC1937, and MCF-7). To investigate a role for eIF-5A2 in chemoresistance, cells were treated with eIF-5A2-siRNA, exposed to various concentrations of doxorubicin, and toxicity was assayed by CCK-8 (cell counting kit).Results:The eIF-5A2 expression levels varied among breast cancer cells. Higher expression levels correlated with decreased doxorubicin sensitivity. Silencing of eIF-5A2 significantly improved doxorubicin toxicity in all three breast cancer cell lines.Conclusion:This study shows that eIF-5A2 plays an important role in doxorubicin chemoresistance in breast cancer cells.
