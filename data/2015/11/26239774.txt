Background:Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a highly complex operation that demands a thorough understanding of the intrahepatic vascular anatomy and skills in parenchymal transection for the in situ split procedure. In order to minimize adhesion formation after the stage I operation and to avoid iatrogenic tumor rupture during right liver mobilization in large tumors, anterior approach appears to be a logical approach for the in situ split procedure. However, in contrast to the anterior approach adopted for the usual right hepatectomy, the right hepatic artery and biliary pedicle remain intact and undivided during the first operation. To address this issue, we hereby reported our experience of the modified 'anterior approach' for the ALPPS procedure that facilitates a complete in situ parenchymal split.Methods:Prospectively collected data of 13 patients who underwent the ALPPS procedure by the modified anterior approach for hepatocellular carcinoma from October 2013 to October 2014 were reviewed.Results:The baseline future liver remnant volume (FLR) was 286 ml. The median tumor size was 6.0 cm. After a median of 8 days from stage I operation, the left FLR hypertrophied by 52.7 % in volume to 482 ml. All patients proceeded to second stage hepatectomy (extended right hepatectomy, n = 5; right hepatectomy, n = 6; right trisectionectomy, n = 2) without significant adhesion encountered. The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 7.7 % (n = 1) and 7.7 % (n = 1), respectively.Conclusion:The modified anterior approach is safe and feasible for complete in situ split in the ALPPS procedure.
