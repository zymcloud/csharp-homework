Introduction:We report the case of a 62-year-old woman diagnosed with sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma.Case presentation:A 62-year-old Asian woman presented with macroscopic hematuria. A histological and immunohistochemical study of a tumor biopsy specimen led to a suspected diagnosis of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma. She underwent surgical tumor resection that included her left kidney. A histological and immunohistochemical study of the resected tumor confirmed the diagnosis of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma. The pathological stage was pT3bpN2, and multiple lung metastases were detected (pT3bpN2cM1; stage IV). Our patient was classified as "poor risk" according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center risk criteria. Interferon-α was administered as adjuvant therapy, and her lung metastases remained stable. However, a computed tomography scan and bone scintigraphy 2 years later revealed multiple bone metastases. External beam radiotherapy was performed for the bone metastases. Despite continuing interferon-α during radiotherapy, multiple skull and liver metastases appeared. Oral administration of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib was initiated as a second-line therapy, and our patient achieved a stable state for 11 months. As the liver metastases progressed and meningeal dissemination newly appeared, oral administration of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus was initiated as a third-line therapy. Our patient remains alive 71 months after diagnosis and has maintained a comparatively good quality of life.Conclusion:A literature review revealed that metastatic sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma has very poor prognosis, with a survival of <1 year despite systemic therapy. Our patient in this present case achieved long-term survival, a rare incidence worthy of report.
