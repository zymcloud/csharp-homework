Background and aims:More data on epidemiology of liver diseases in Europe are needed. We aimed to characterize hospital admissions for liver cirrhosis in Portugal during the past decade.Patients and methods:We analyzed all hospital admissions for cirrhosis in Portugal Mainland between 2003 and 2012 registered in the national Diagnosis-Related Group database. Cirrhosis was classified according to etiology considering alcohol, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.Results:Between 2003 and 2012, there were 63,910 admissions for cirrhosis in Portugal Mainland; 74.4% involved male patients. Etiologies of admitted cirrhosis were as follows: 76.0% alcoholic, 1.1% hepatitis B, 1.4% hepatitis B plus alcohol, 3.6% hepatitis C, and 4.0% hepatitis C plus alcohol. There was a significant decline (PConclusion:Despite the decline in admissions for alcoholic cirrhosis and the increase in those related to hepatitis C, the observed burden of hospitalized liver cirrhosis in Portugal was essentially attributable to alcoholic liver disease.
