A series of side-chain modified taxane analogues were synthesized and their in vitro anticancer activities against four human cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer), PC-3 (human prostatic cancer), HepG2 and H460 (human hepatoma) were studied. The three hydroxyl groups at C-7, C-9 and C-10 enable the behavior of these compounds to be evidently distinct from other similar compounds. The strong cytotoxicity in the four cell lines showed by the newly synthesized taxane analogues 13a and 13d indicated them as potential lead compounds for anticancer drug design.
