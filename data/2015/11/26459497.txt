Taspine has been indicated to be a potential anti‑carcinogenic agent. The present study investigated the effects of TAS9, a modified taspine derivative, on the proliferation and migration of the SMMC‑7721 human liver cancer cell line. First, the effects of TAS9 on SMMC‑7721 cell growth were examined using MTT and colony formation assaya. In vivo Transwell and wound healing assays were then performed to assess the inhibitory effects of TAS9 on cell invasion and migration, respectively. The expression of cell proliferation‑ and migration‑associated signaling molecules was investigated by western blot analysis. The results indicated that TAS9 inhibited SMMC‑7721 cell growth by downregulating the signaling molecules protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ), Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase 2, RAF and c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase‑1, and inhibiting SMMC‑7721 cell migration by suppressing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2, MMP‑9, chemokine (C‑X‑C motif) receptor 4, nuclear factor κB, p38 and p53. Small interfering RNA‑mediated knockdown of PKCβ in the SMMC‑7721 cells significantly attenuated the tumor inhibitory effects of TAS9. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that TAS9 may have inhibitory effects on the proliferation and migration of SMMC‑7721 cells, and may serve as a potential candidate for cancer treatment.
