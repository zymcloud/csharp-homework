Purpose:To compare doxorubicin-loaded HepaSphere transarterial chemoembolization versus conventional transarterial chemoembolization in terms of survival, time to recurrence, acute reversible hepatotoxicity, postembolization syndrome, and chemoembolization-related mortality and morbidity.Materials and methods:One hundred twenty-six patients (103 men, 23 women; mean age, 64.3 y) with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent conventional chemoembolization between January 2007 and March 2011 or drug-eluting embolic (DEE) chemoembolization (after the protocol change) between March 2011 and October 2014 were included in a retrospective analysis. Primary outcome measures were survival and time to recurrence. Secondary outcome measures were frequency of recurrence, technical success, acute reversible hepatotoxicity, postembolization syndrome, and chemoembolization-related mortality and morbidity.Results:The technical success rate was 97.1%. There were no significant differences between the conventional and DEE chemoembolization groups with regard to mean survival duration (39.0 vs 37.4 mo), recurrence (32.9% vs 39.6%), postembolization syndrome (90% vs 89%), and chemoembolization-related mortality (5.5% vs 1.9%) and morbidity (9.6% vs 9.4%; P > .05). The time to recurrence was shorter in DEE chemoembolization-treated patients than in conventional chemoembolization-treated patients (5.0 vs 11.5 mo; P = .006), and acute reversible hepatotoxicity occurred more frequently after conventional chemoembolization (P = .019).Conclusions:Conventional chemoembolization and DEE chemoembolization were safe and effective interventions for unresectable HCC. DEE chemoembolization was not better than conventional chemoembolization in terms of survival and was associated with a shorter time to recurrence. Acute reversible hepatotoxicity occurred more frequently after conventional chemoembolization.
