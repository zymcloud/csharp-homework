Background:Percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization (PTPE) can induce atrophy of the embolized- and hypertrophy of the residual area. These effects are advantageous in patients scheduled for extended hepatectomy.Purpose:To evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of foam sclerotherapy with foam ethanolamine oleate (EO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) for PTPE before hepatectomy.Material and methods:We performed sclerotherapy for PTPE in 15 patients with: hepatocellular carcinoma (HHC; n = 9), bile duct carcinoma (n = 5), or metastatic liver tumor from colon cancer (n = 1). The foam contained 5% EO iopamidol (EOI) and CO2 at a 1:2 ratio. We compared the percentage of the pre- and post-PTPE future liver remnant (FLR) volumes and calculated the percent FLR volume (%FLR) increase after PTPE.Results:The amount of EOI used (range, 14-20 mL; median, 16.8 mL) was based on the volume of the target portal vein. Technical success was achieved in 14 of 15 patients (93%); the other patient presented with computed tomography evidence of recanalization 1 week after PTPE. The FLR volume before and after portal vein embolization was 599 ± 342 and 691 ± 318 cm(3), respectively (P Conclusion:Sclerotherapy using foam EOI and CO2 is clinically safe and effective for PTPE before hepatectomy.
