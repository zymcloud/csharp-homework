Purpose:To evaluate outcomes of yttrium-90 radioembolization performed with glass-based microspheres in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to the hepatitis B virus (HBV).Materials and methods:A total of 675 patients treated between January 2006 and July 2014 were reviewed, of which 45 (age 62 y ± 10; 91% male) received glass-based radioembolization for HCC secondary to HBV. All patients were stratified according to previous therapy (naive, n = 14; 31.1%), Child-Pugh class (class A, n = 41; 91%), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS; 400 ng/mL (n = 17; 38%), and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (A, n = 8; B, n = 9; C, n = 28).Results:A total of 50 radioembolization treatments were performed, with a 100% technical success rate (median target dose, 120 Gy). Clinical toxicities included pain (16%), fatigue (12%), and nausea (4%). Grade 3/4 laboratory toxicities included bilirubin (8%) and aspartate aminotransferase (4%) toxicities. Observed toxicities were independent of treatment dose. The objective response rates were 55% per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors and 21% per World Health Organization criteria, and the disease control rate was 63%. Disease progression was secondary to new, nontarget HCC in 45% of cases. Median time to progression and overall survival were 6.0 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4-8.0 mo) and 19.3 mo (95% CI, 11.2-22.7 mo), respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated ECOG PS ≥ 1 and AFP level > 400 ng/mL to be independent predictors of inferior overall survival.Conclusions:Glass-based radioembolization for HCC secondary to HBV can be safely performed, with favorable target lesion response and overall survival.
