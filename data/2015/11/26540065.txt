Objective:To estimate the disease burden and financial burden attributed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Guangdong Province.Methods:Based on the data of incidence, mortality and healthcare cost of HBV-related diseases and other socio-economic data in Guangdong Province, we estimated deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and economic cost for the three HBV-related diseases-hepatitis B, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer-in Guangdong following the procedures developed for the global burden of disease study. Then disease burden and economic cost attributed to HBV infection was estimated.Results:HBV infection was estimated to have caused 33,600 (95% confidence interval (CI): 29,300-37,800) premature deaths and the loss of 583,200 (95% CI: 495,200-671,100) DALYs in Guangdong in 2005. The greatest loss of deaths and DALYs were from liver cancer. The 45-59 years age group had the greatest burden attributable to HBV infection. The estimated total annual cost of HBV-related diseases in Guangdong was RMB 10.8 (95% CI: 8.7-13.0) billion, the direct and indirect cost were RMB 2.6 (95% CI: 2.1-3.2) and 8.2 (95% CI: 6.6-9.8) billion.Conclusions:HBV infection is a great medical challenge as well as a significant economic burden to Guangdong Province. The results suggest that substantial health benefits could be gained by extending effective public health and clinical interventions to reduce HBV infection in Guangdong Province.
