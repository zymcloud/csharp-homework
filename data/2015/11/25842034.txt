Purpose:Discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) have been identified as tyrosine kinase receptors for collagen, and the overexpression of DDR1 was correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression in vitro. Little is known about DDR2 on HCC cells, and we investigated the expression and function of DDR2 in human HCC cells.Methods:Expression of DDR2 in human HCC cell lines and patient HCC tissues was observed. The suppression of DDR2 by siRNA against DDR2 was performed in vitro and in vivo study.Results:All of HCC cell lines expressed DDR2 mRNA, and all HCC tissues from the ten patients with HCC demonstrated DDR2 mRNA expression. Transfection of DDR2 siRNA significantly inhibits cell growth compared to cells with nontarget siRNA transfection in vitro (P Conclusions:The inhibition of DDR2 by RNA interference suppressed in vivo and in vitro growth of human HCC cells. Our results may support that the use of DDR2 as a novel target of HCC treatment through control of tumor apoptosis, migration, and invasion.
