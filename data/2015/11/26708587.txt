Clinically, peritoneal dissemination of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rarely occurs. We herein report a case that had a good outcome following laparoscopic extirpation of peritoneal dissemination after hepatectomy for ruptured HCC. A 66-year-old man underwent central bisectionectomy 12 days after emergency transcatheter arterial embolization for a ruptured HCC. Thereafter, pulmonary resection was performed twice for lung metastasis. About 8 months after the second pulmonary resection, a mass lesion was detected at the left subphrenic space on CT and (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans. We made a diagnosis of peritoneal dissemination of HCC, and laparoscopic extirpation was performed. The patient is now doing well without any signs of recurrence 2 years after the last operation. Laparoscopic surgical resection for peritoneal dissemination that develops after hepatectomy for HCC may have a beneficial effect as a less-invasive approach and may improve the prognosis in select patients.
