Some patients with unresectable colorectal cancer can be treated by chemotherapy leaving the primary tumor unresected, but indications and implications of a later resection of the primary tumor (RPT) are often controversial. We investigated 5 patients whose primary tumors were resected during chemotherapy, either panitumumab or bevacizumab. The median age of these patients was 63 years and all were men. The unresectable disease was liver metastases in 4 patients and a primary tumor in 2 patients. A diverting stoma was constructed before initiation of chemotherapy in 2 patients. The median interval until RPT was 8.3 months and the reasons for resection were the appearance of obstructive symptoms in 3 patients and a desire for stoma closure in 2 patients. The size of the primary tumor had decreased until RPT in all patients. RPT was performed successfully in all patients, but 2 of the 3 operations that were initiated laparoscopically had to be converted to open surgery. Intensive chemotherapy was resumed in all patients and median survival after RPT was 19 months, including a patient whose liver metastasis was also resected later. RPT can relieve obstructive symptoms and close stomas. Because intensive chemotherapy is still possible and a lengthy survival can be expected after RPT, it should be considered not merely as a palliative option but also as a treatment strategy.
