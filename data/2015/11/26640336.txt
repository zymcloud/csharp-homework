Aim:To achieve a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microRNA expression changes involved in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:In this research process, patients were not treated with antivirals, immunosuppressants or immunomodulators for at least 6 mo before collecting serum. The study population was composed of 35 outpatient hepatitis B virus (HBV) cases and 12 healthy control cases from the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University (Inner Mongolia, China) from July 2013 to April 2014. The 35 HBV cases were divided into two groups: a hepatocirrhosis group with 20 cases and a liver cancer group with 15 cases. All 35 cases carried HBsAg. The diagnostic criteria followed the European Association for the Study of the Liver 2012 (EASL2012) standards. MicroRNA (miRNA) was extracted from a control group of patients, a group with hepatocirrhosis and a group with liver cancer and its quality was analyzed using the human V2 microRNA expression beadchip. Cluster analysis and a radar chart were then applied to the miRNA changes.Results:The miRNA-qualified rate of human serum samples was 93%. The concentration of a single sample was > 200 ng/μL and the volume was > 5 μL. All miRNA serum samples were uncontaminated by the genome. The Mann-Whitney test showed significant differences in miRNA between each group, with a detection P-value of Conclusion:There was a significant relationship between the irreversible up-regulation of miRNA-183/373 and down-regulation of miRNA-129/188/378 and incidences of hepatocirrhosis and liver cancer.
