Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death, and its incidence is increasing in the United States. This analysis describes the association between race, treatment decisions, operative outcomes, and survival for patients with HCC.Methods:The National Cancer Database was queried for all patients diagnosed with HCC from 1998 to 2011 (n = 143,692) who were white (76.9%), black (14.7%), or Asian (8.4%). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine factors that affected the likelihood of having surgery and postoperative mortality, and a Cox regression was performed to evaluate the effect of these factors on survival.Results:The proportion of black patients with HCC increased in the United States during the 13-year period. There were no substantial differences among races in tumor size, grade, or overall clinical stage at the time of presentation; however, black patients were less likely to have surgery (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.72). Of patients who had surgery, there were no significant differences in pathologic stage, margin negative resection rate, or 30-day mortality; however, black patients had the longest interval between diagnosis and surgery, as well as the worst overall adjusted survival (hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.25). These findings were independent of HCC stage, insurance provider, and socioeconomic status.Conclusion:Despite similar clinical presentation of HCC, substantial racial differences exist with regard to management and outcomes. Black patients are less likely to receive surgery for HCC and have worse long-term survival, despite similar perioperative quality metrics. This difference in long-term survival may highlight neighborhood, cultural, or biological differences between races.
