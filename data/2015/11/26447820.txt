Aim:To assess the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content as a noninvasive molecular biomarker in hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCV-HCC).Materials and methods:A total of 135 participants were enrolled in the study. Equal numbers of subjects were enrolled in each of three clinically defined groups: those with HCV-related cirrhosis (HCV-cirrhosis), those with HCV-HCC, and a control group of age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers with no evidence of liver disease. mtDNA concentrations were determined using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.Results:mtDNA content was lowest among the HCV-HCC cases. No statistically significant difference was observed between the group of HCV-cirrhosis and the control group as regards mtDNA level. HCC patients with multicentric hepatic lesions had significantly lower mtDNA content than HCC patients with less advanced disease. When a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used, a cutoff of 34 was assigned for mtDNA content to distinguish between HCV-HCC and HCV-cirrhosis patients who are not yet complicated by malignancy. Lower mtDNA content was associated with HCC risk when using either or both healthy controls and HCV-cirrhosis groups for reference.Conclusions:mtDNA content analysis could serve as a noninvasive molecular biomarker that reflects tumor burden in HCV-HCC cases and could be used as a predictor of HCC risk in patients of HCV-cirrhosis. In addition, the nonsignificant difference of mtDNA level between HCV-cirrhosis patients and healthy controls could eliminate the gray zone created by the use of alpha-fetoprotein in some cirrhotic patients.
