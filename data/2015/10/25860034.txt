Purpose:To assess the diagnostic accuracy, cancer staging, image quality, and radiation dose of 80-kVp computed tomography (CT) images for patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs) using sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE).Methods:Sixty-four consecutive patients (mean weight 62.5 ± 11.3 kg, mean BMI 24.1 ± 3.3 kg/m(2)) with known CRC underwent dual-energy CT. Data were reconstructed as a weighted average (WA) 120-kVp dataset. Both filtered back projection (FBP) and SAFIRE were applied to reconstruct the WA 120-Kvp (Protocol A, B) and 80-kVp (Protocol C, D) image sets. The image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the cancers, the normal reference tissues, and the effective dose for each protocol were assessed. The cancer detection, staging, and image quality were evaluated. Analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis.Results:Compared with the FBP datasets at WA 120-kVp (Protocol A) and 80-kVp (Protocol C), the SAFIRE-reconstructed images (Protocols B, D) demonstrated significantly lower image noise (P < 0.0083). Protocol D yielded significantly higher CNRs and SNRs for the CRCs and normal reference tissues than did Protocols A and C (P < 0.0083). Protocol D also exhibited a significantly higher CNR for the CRC and some normal reference tissues than did Protocol B (P < 0.0083). For hypovascular liver metastases (n = 10), Protocol D yielded better SNRs and significantly higher CNRs than did Protocol A (P < 0.0083). Overall, accuracy for tumor staging and liver metastasis was 95.3% (61/64) and 100%, respectively, in all of the 4 protocols. The mean effective dose decreased 41% from the WA 120-kVp to the 80-kVp protocols (6.23 vs. 3.68 mSv).Conclusions:The 80-kVp technique with SAFIRE provided high SNR, high CNR, and good accuracy for staging in nonobese patients with CRC. Our study results should be extrapolated to patient populations with a high BMI with caution. Further studies of high BMI patients are therefore warranted.
