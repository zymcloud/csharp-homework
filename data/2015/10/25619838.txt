Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is well known to involve in tumor invasion and metastasis. Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) functions as a potent tumor suppressor and also acts as a negative regulator of p-STAT3(Tyr705) oncogenic signaling. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) through which SHP-1 regulates EMT during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Here we first reported that endogenous SHP-1 protein levels were significantly downregulated in cells with mesenchymal characteristics and negatively correlated with p-STAT3(Tyr705) and vimentin but positively correlated with E-cadherin. SHP-1 overexpression abolished transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced p-STAT3(Tyr705) and EMT, as well inhibited migration and invasion but further rescued by signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) overexpression. Depletion of SHP-1 could induce a more increase in TGF-β1-induced p-STAT3(Tyr-705) and EMT characteristics, further supporting the mechanism that suppression of TGF-β1-induced EMT is dependent on SHP-1-mediated STAT3 inactivation. Constitutively overexpressed SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase activity by D61A-mutated SHP-1 markedly reduced TGF-β1-induced p-STAT3(Tyr705) and EMT features but was not altered by C453S catalytic-dead mutant SHP-1. Consequently, SHP-1 acted as a powerful suppressor in preventing EMT by exerting its tyrosine phosphatase activity that directly downregulated p-STAT3(Tyr705). Most notably, we discovered a novel SHP-1 agonist SC-43 better than sorafenib to exert more potent anti-EMT effects in vitro as well as anti-metastatic growth in vivo. In conclusion, SHP-1 is a potent suppressor of HCC EMT and metastasis, thus highlighting that SC-43-SHP-1 axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target that antagonized p-STAT3(Tyr705) and thereby prevented HCC EMT and metastasis.
