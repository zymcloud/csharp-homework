Background:Hepatitis C virus infection is a worldwide health problem and one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, sofosbuvir was introduced to the therapeutic arsenal against this virus, thereby paving the way for all-oral regimen. Aims of the review This study aimed to systematically analyze the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection.Method:PubMed and EMBASE database searches were conducted using "sofosbuvir" as the search term. Phase III clinical studies retrieved from the two databases and resources posted on the Drug@FDA and ClinicalTrials.gov websites were evaluated with regard to outcomes of the efficacy and safety analyses of the drug.Results:Eight Phase III clinical studies compared the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir. When sofosbuvir replaced peginterferon which was used in the previous standard regimen, a superior sustained virologic response, as defined by a viral RNA load less than the lower limit of quantification 12 weeks after cessation of therapy, was obtained (74.3 vs. 66.7%, p Conclusions:Sofosbuvir was safe and effective in the treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 1, 2, 3, or 4 infections. However, the lack of persistence of the sustained virologic response beyond the study duration and long-term safety concerns need to be addressed in future studies.
Adverse events; Hepatitis C virus; Peginterferon; Sofosbuvir; Sustained virologic response.
