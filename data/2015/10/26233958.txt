MiR-17-92 cluster is an oncogenic miRNA cluster that is implicated in several cancers, although its role in hepatocarcinogenesis has not been clearly defined. In this study, we show that the miR-17-92 cluster is highly expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared to the non-tumorous liver tissues by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses. Increased miR-17-92 cluster expression in HCC tissues was further confirmed by analysis of the RNA-sequencing data of 319 patients available from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). To create an animal model that resembles enhanced miR-17-92 in the liver, we developed liver-specific miR-17-92 transgenic mice and the animals were treated with the hepatic carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN). We observed that the liver-specific miR-17-92 transgenic mice showed significantly increased hepatocellular cancer development compared to the matched wild-type control mice. Forced overexpression of the miR-17-92 cluster in cultured human hepatocellular cancer cells enhanced tumor cell proliferation, colony formation and invasiveness in vitro, whereas inhibition of the miR-17-92 cluster reduced tumor cell growth. By analyzing the miRNA and mRNA sequencing data from the 312 hepatocellular cancer patients available from the TCGA database, we observed that the expression levels of the miR-17-92 cluster members and host gene in the tumor tissues are negatively correlated with several target genes, including CREBL2, PRRG1, NTN4. Our findings demonstrate an important role of the miR-17-92 cluster in hepatocarcinogenesis and suggest the possibility of targeting this pivotal miRNA cluster for potential therapy.
