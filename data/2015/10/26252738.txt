MicroRNA-132 (miR‑132) has been reported to play a tumor suppressive role in different human malignancies. However, its role and underling mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly defined due to lack of target gene information. In the present study, we demonstrated that the mean level of miR‑132 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues was significantly lower than that in matched tumor-adjacent tissues, and its expression negatively correlated with tumor differentiation (P
