Marked improvement in the prognosis for patients with liver cancer who undergo liver transplantation has been achieved as a result of advances in liver transplantation techniques. Given the current shortage of organs in China, a favorable long-term survival rate might be achieved with rigorous selection of suitable patients and therefore benefit society the most. Further study of the mechanism of cancer recurrence following liver transplantation, continuing to optimize pretreatment strategies prior to liver transplantation, and paying closer attention to the prevention and treatment of cancer recurrence following liver transplantation are important steps to improve the long-term clinical benefit of liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Perfecting the techniques of liver transplantation using a marginal donor liver is the main way to solve the current problem of an organ shortage for patients with liver cancer.
