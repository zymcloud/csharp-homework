Purpose:Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a multiplex risk factor that arises from insulin resistance accompanying abnormal adipose deposition and function. It is a risk factor for coronary heart disease, as well as for diabetes, fatty liver, and several cancers. Recent studies showed that there was a correlation between inflammatory mediators and MS. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the MS and new inflammatory markers as mean platelet volume (MPV) and red blood cell distribution width (RDW), they are simple and reliable indicators of inflammation.Method:200 patients who met the MS criteria and other 100 age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in this randomized controlled trial. Patients were classified into 2 groups each 100 subjects based on the number of MS criteria: group 1 (patients with 3 MS criteria), group 2 (patients with 5 MS criteria). MPV and RDW were calculated from complete blood count.Results:Patients with MS had significantly higher MPV and RDW correspondingly compared to those without MS. (MPV: 8.4±0.61 v 8.80±0.60, 9.56±0.48, respectively, p<0.001) (RDW:12.38±0.77, 13.15±062, 13.90±0.55). Moreover, patients meeting 5 MS criteria had higher MPV and RDW than those meeting 3 criteria (p<0.001) and 0.000, respectively)Conclusion:The present study indicated, for the first time, a significant correlation between the 2 criteria of MS and inflammation based on these new markers that should be simple and reliable indicator of inflammation.
