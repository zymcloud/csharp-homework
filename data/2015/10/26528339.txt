Introduction:Uncontrolled angiogenesis plays an essential role in the occurrence, metastasis and malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the expression of adrenomedullin (ADM) in human HCC and its correlation with the expression of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), microvessel density (MVD) and the tumor pathological characteristics.Material and methods:Fresh tumor tissues were obtained from 30 HCC patients after hepatectomy. Ten cirrhotic and 10 normal liver tissues were included as controls. Expression of ADM and EPOR was determined by real-time PCR. The MVD was determined by counting the number of microvessels.Results:The MVD and the mRNA levels of ADM and EPOR in cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in the non-cancer tissues (p Conclusions:Our findings suggest that ADM and EPOR may serve as new regulatory factors involved in angiogenesis of HCC and represent novel targets for the treatment of HCC.
