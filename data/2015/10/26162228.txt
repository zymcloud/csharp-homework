Background:Public health education increasingly emphasizes the link of personal lifestyle with cancer risk, which may result in unintended negative social effects such as triggering stigma and/or blame towards cancer patients when their illness is perceived to be caused by personal behaviours or disapproved lifestyles.Objectives:To explore nurses' blame attributions towards patients with different types of cancer and to identify associated factors.Design:Cross-sectional survey.Setting:A tertiary cancer-specialized hospital in Beijing.Participants:317 Chinese oncology nurses working in the cancer hospital.Methods:Participant nurses completed a self-administrated anonymous questionnaire and rated how much they would blame someone with a diagnosis of breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, as well as leukaemia and obesity.Results:More than half of the oncology nurses (57.1%) attributed at least some blame to patients with leukaemia, following with breast cancer (67.5%), cervical cancer (79.2%), liver cancer (79.2%), and colon cancer (78.5%). Lung cancer patients attracted at least some blame by 82.0% of participating nurses. Attributions of blame for patients with lung, cervical, colon and liver cancer were most common among nurses with shorter working experience.Conclusions:This study demonstrated that a high proportion of Chinese nurses attributed at least some blame to patients with different cancers despite being working in a cancer-specialized hospital. Future education and support for nurses are essential to avoid negative attitudes and blame attributions to cancer patients in order to enhance the quality of care.
