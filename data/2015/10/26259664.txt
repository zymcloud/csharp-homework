Background:The clinical and prognostic significance of benign perihepatic lymph nodes enlargement (PLNE) from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relative frequency, incidence and locations of benign PLNE, and the impact on long-term survival of the patients.Methods:A total of 219 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection of HCC between July 2006 and March 2012 in our single institution were divided into two groups according to the presence of PLNE: PLNE group (n = 76), and control group (n = 143). The long-term outcomes were evaluated and compared between the two groups.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 77.2, 60.0, and 38.1 % in the PLNE group and 71.3, 42.5, and 25.0 % in the control group (p = 0.080). Corresponding overall survival rates were 96.0, 84.8, 67.1 % and 93.5, 72.4, 46.9 % respectively (p = 0.041). Patients with benign PLNE were associated with a higher rate of centrally located HCCs or tumors adjacent to the major branch of vascular vessels. Multivariate analysis revealed that benign PLNE was an independent positive prognostic factor affecting the overall survival.Conclusions:According to our analysis, patients of HCC with benign PLNE after curative resection can be expected to have better long-term survival. It is also associated with a lower risk of tumor recurrence, but not significant. This finding may provide new insights into daily clinical practice and the pathophysiological characteristics of HCC development.
