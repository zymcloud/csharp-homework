A socially-housed New Zealand white rabbit presented with a large subcutaneous mass on the ventral thorax approximately 11 mo after the intrahepatic delivery of a suspension of VX2 carcinoma cells to induce hepatocellular carcinoma as part of a nanoparticle study. The mass and closely associated axillary lymph node were removed en bloc. Immunohistochemical staining identified the mass as an undifferentiated carcinoma. The rabbit demonstrated no appreciable pathology at the study end point at 16 mo after VX2 inoculation. An additional rabbit from the same VX2 injection cohort was found at necropsy to have an unanticipated intraabdominal mass, also identified as an undifferentiated carcinoma. This case report summarizes the molecular analysis of both tumors through a novel PCR assay, which identified the delayed and aberrant onset of VX2 carcinoma in an extended timeframe not previously reported.
