Context:Liver enzyme serum levels within and just above the normal range are strong predictors of incident morbidity and mortality in the general population. However, despite the close links between hepatic pathology and impaired bone health, the association of liver enzymes with osteoporosis has hardly been investigated.Objective:The aim of the present study was to clarify whether serum liver enzyme levels in the general population are associated with bone mineral density.Design:This was an observational, cross-sectional study. Participants and Main Outcome: Data on 13 849 adult participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to quantify the independent associations of γ-glutamyltransferase, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase with femoral neck bone mineral density assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.Results:In multiple regression models adjusting for numerous confounding variables, γ-glutamyltransferase showed a weak inverse association with bone mineral density (P = .0063). There also was limited evidence of a nonmonotonous relationship with alanine transaminase, with peak bone mineral density in the second quartile of enzyme activity (P = .0039). No association was found for aspartate transaminase.Conclusion:Although mechanistically plausible associations were found in the present study, the rather weak nature of these patterns renders it unlikely that liver enzyme levels could be of substantial use for osteoporosis risk stratification in the general population.
