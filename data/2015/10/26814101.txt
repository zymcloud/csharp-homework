Objective:To investigate the safety and efficacy of hepatic resection for those patients with large/multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or those involving macrovascular invasion (MVI).Methods:PubMed was systematically searched for studies examining the safety and efficacy of hepatic resection for treatment of HCC involving a single large tumor (>5 cm) or multiple tumors (>2), or those involving MVI.Results:The identified 52 studies involving 14 922 patients that investigated the use of hepatic resection for large/multinodular HCC, and 25 studies with 4 412 patients that investigated hepatic resection for HCC with MVI. Median in-hospital mortality of patients with either type of HCC was significantly lower in Asian studies (2.7%) than in non-Asian studies (7.3%, PConclusions:Hepatic resection is reasonably safe and effective for the treatment of large/multinodular HCC and HCC with MVI. The available evidence argues for expanding the indications for hepatic resection in official treatment guidelines.
