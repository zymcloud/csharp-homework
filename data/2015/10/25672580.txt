Purpose:The purpose of this study is to investigate the dosimetric and clinical influence of computed tomography-based (3-dimensional [3D]) simulation versus conventional 2-dimensional (2D)-based simulation in postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for patients with advanced gastric cancer in terms of parallel opposed anteroposterior-posteroanterior field arrangement.Materials and methods:A retrospective stage-matched cohort study was conducted in 158 patients treated with adjuvant CRT following curative surgery and D2 dissection from 2006 to 2008 at Samsung Medical Center: 98 patients in the 3D group; and 60 patients in the 2D group. For comparison of the dosimetric parameters between 3D plan and 2D plan, second sets of radiation treatment plans were generated according to the same target delineation method used in the 2D group for each patient in the 3D group (V2D). Acute toxicity, recurrence, and survival were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 28 months (range, 5 to 51 months).Results:The 3D group showed better dose-volume histogram (DVH) profiles than the V2D group for all dosimetric parameters, including the kidneys, liver, spinal cord, duodenum, pancreas, and bowel. However, no difference in acute gastrointestinal toxicity and survival outcomes was observed between the 3D group and the 2D group.Conclusion:The 3D plan enabled precise delineation of the target volume and organs at risk by visualization of geometric changes in the internal organs after surgery. The DVH of normal tissues in the 3D plan was superior to that of the V2D plan, but similar clinical features were observed between the 3D group and the 2D group.
