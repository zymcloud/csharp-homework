Background & aims:Hepatitis C viral infection is a significant public health challenge with potential risk of progressing to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Actively infected mothers can transmit the virus to their babies who may develop liver cirrhosis and HCC as young adults. We determined the seroprevalence of HCV, its antigenaemia and associated risk factors among pregnant women.Methods:We recruited 400 pregnant women and tested their serum for HCV antibodies using immune-chromatographic test and determined the HCV core antigenaemia among HCV sero-positives by enzyme-immunoassay (EIA). The bio-socio-demographic variables of the participants were statistically correlated to the test results.Results:Seroprevalence of HCV was 5.8% (23/400) and the prevalence of HCV core antigenaemia was 73.9% (17/23). None of the bio-socio-demographic variables of the participants and other known risk factors evaluated had. significant influence on either seroprevalence of HCV or its antigenaemia. Only the employment status of the participants' husbands (p = 0.01) significantly affected seropositivity of HCV.Conclusion:HCV core antigenaemia is high among pregnant women who have antibodies to HCV in our environment and this signifies an active hepatitis C virus infection.
