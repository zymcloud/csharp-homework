Objective:To compare the efficacies ofentecavir and adefovir in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and cirrhosis when administered as monotherapies using a 240-week course.Methods:Ninety patients diagnosed with CHB and cirrhosis (compensated or decompensated) were randomly divided into two treatment groups for administration of either entecavir (0.5 mg/day, oral; n =38) or adefovir (10 mg/day, oral; n =52) for 240 weeks. All participants underwent B-ultrasound and were tested for levels of HBV-DNA, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and various serological markers of the hepatitis B virus at baseline and at treatment weeks 24, 48, 96, 144, 192, and 240. Instances of drug-related complications and adverse reactions were recorded. Patients who did not achieve complete virological response by treatment week 48 or who experienced virological breakthrough at any time during the study course were recorded and started on an appropriate combination therapy regimen. Statistical analyses were carried out using the t-test, chi-square test, and Cox regression modeling.Results:The dropout rate in the entecavir group was 2.6% and in the adefovir group was 13.5%. At treatment week 240, significantly more patients in the entecavir group had undetectable serum HBV-DNA (91.9% vs. adefovir group: 57.8%; x2=10.362, P=0.001), a negative conversion rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (46.2% vs. adefovir group: 24%; x2=5.055, P=0.025), and rate of HBeAg seroconversion (23.1% vs. adefovir group: 8%, P=0.047).The entecavir group and the adefovir group showed no significant differences upon per-protocol analysis and intention-to-treat analysis, nor in the rates of hepatocellular carcinoma development (entecavir group: 8.1% vs. adefovir group: 6.7%; x2=0.000, P=1.000) or mortality (entecavir group: 8.1% vs. adefovir group: 4.4%; x2=0.051, P=0.821). The possibility of achieving undetectable serum HBV-DNA was 2.761 times higher in the entecavir group than in the adefovir group (95.0% CI: 1.630 to 4.679). The possibility of HBeAg seroconversion was 0.192 times higher for males than for females (95.0% CI: 0.046 to 0.806).Conclusion:Compared to adefovir, entecavir provides high efficiency and rapid viral suppression as a monotherapy for CHB patients when administered in a 240-week course.
