Whereas congenital absence of inferior vena cava observed in paediatric population more often than not, as an isolated or syndromic variety, this is seldom encountered in adult liver transplant recipients. There appear few sporadic reports in the literature on experience of such anomaly in adults. Given the rarity of situation, surprising encounters of such anomalies may pose challenge to the unprepared transplant surgeon and unfavourable outcomes may even have resulted in under-reportage of this condition. In this brief report we document our recent experience with two such cases and this is supplemented with extensive reference to the literature on classification of such anomalies with the endeavour to document implications of such in the adult liver transplant setting.
Absent inferior vena cava; Azygous system; Congenial anomalies; Heterotaxy syndrome; Liver transplant.
