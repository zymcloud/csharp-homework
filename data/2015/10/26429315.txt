Lymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase encoded by protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) gene plays an important regulatory role in T- and B-cell activation. This study investigated PTPN22 -1123G/C and intron 16 T/C polymorphisms in 372 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, 72 HBV infection resolvers and 273 healthy controls. Genotypic association tests between groups assuming codominant, dominant or log-additive genetic models were performed. In recessive model, PTPN22 -1123G/C genotype GG in healthy controls was more frequent than infection resolvers (P=0.037, OR=3.606, 95%CI=1.079-12.053) and this genotype in HBV patients was more frequent than resolvers although the difference was not significant (P=0.059). The PTPN22 intron 16 T/C genotype TC in cirrhosis patients was significantly higher than asymptomatic carriers (ASC) in codominant (P=0.028, OR=9.792, 95%CI=1.281-74.832) and overdominant (P=0.025, OR=10.142, 95%CI=1.332-77.214) models. This genotype in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients was significantly higher than ASC in codominant (P=0.034, OR=9.200, 95%CI=1.176-71.990) and overdominant (P=0.030, OR=9.677, 95%CI=1.241-75.442) models. These findings suggest that PTPN22 polymorphisms may predispose the chronicity or the development of cirrhosis and HCC in HBV infection.
