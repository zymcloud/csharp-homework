Neuroendocrine tumors are a rare type of neoplasms that comprise only 0.5% of all malignancies.¹ They usually arise from the gastrointestinal tract and the lung.¹,² Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the head and neck is a relatively rare malignancy described in the literature. The larynx is the most commonly affected region of the head and neck.³,⁴ Nevertheless, small-cell carcinoma comprises only 0.5% of all laryngeal cancers.⁵ Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the larynx carries variable prognosis depending on the histological subtype.⁶ Typical carcinoid rarely metastasizes, but atypical carcinoid and small-cell carcinoma have high rates of metastasis, usually in the lung and liver.² Cutaneous metastasis from neuroendocrine carcinoma is an extremely rare entity, with only few cases reported in the English literature.⁷,⁸ We report the case of an elderly man with recurrent laryngeal neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastasis to the eyelid.
