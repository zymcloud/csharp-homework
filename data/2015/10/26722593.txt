Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is an important means to treat end-stage liver disease. Although effective immunosuppressant medication greatly assists the survival of patients, it is likely to promote infections and cancer. Acute leukemia (AL) is a rare complication after LDLT and up to now only 1 case of post-transplantation AL has occurred in our liver transplantation center after more than 1,600 LDLT interventions since 1993. In the present report, we describe a rare case of subsequent acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 27 months after LDLT and review the literature of this infrequent complication.
Acute myeloid leukemia; alpha-fetoprotein; hepatic carcinoma; liver transplantation; metastases.
