Aim:To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative/treatment naïve subjects with low hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels (Methods:A total of 226 treatment naïve patients diagnosed with HBV-related HCC, divided into five Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages, were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. Virological parameters including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, HBV DNA levels, and laboratory parameters including ALT and aspartame aminotransferase were accessed at the time of HCC was diagnosed. Comparison between HBeAg positive patients and HBeAg negative patients was performed using a χ(2) test.Results:While laboratory parameters correlated with BCLC stages, virological parameters did not. HBeAg negative patients were more prevalent than HBeAg positive patients (160, 70.8% vs. 66, 29.2%). HBsAg and HBV DNA levels in HBeAg negative patients were significantly lower than that in HBeAg positive patients (all P Conclusions:In treatment naïve patients with HBV-related HCC, the majority (70.8%) were HBeAg negative patients. More than one fifth of HBeAg negative patients had low HBV DNA levels and normal ALT levels, indicating more strict monitoring for HBeAg negative patients is needed.
