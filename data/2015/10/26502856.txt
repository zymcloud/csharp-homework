Objective:The diagnostic value of serum GPC3 levels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis remains controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of serum GPC3 for HCC and liver cirrhosis (LC).Materials and methods:A systematic search was performed for the relevant studies. Sensitivity, specificity and other measures regarding the accuracy of serum GPC3 in the diagnosis of HCC were performed by random-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC) analysis was taken to summarize GPC3's performance.Results:17 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and 95 % confidence intervals (95% CIs) for GPC3 were 56% (53%-59%) and 89% (87%-90%) in specificity. The pooled positive LR and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for GPC3 were 7.82 (3.86-15.85) and 0.48 (0.39-0.59) respectively in negative LR. The summary diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and 95% CIs for GPC3 were 26.73 (10.31-69.26), and the area under sROC (AUC) and 95% CIs for GPC3 were 0.8827 (0.8324-0.9330).Conclusions:GPC3 is acceptable as a serum marker for the diagnosis of HCC, which can elevate the accuracy of diagnosis.
