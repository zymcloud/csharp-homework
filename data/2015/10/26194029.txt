Purpose:To determine MR-imaging features for the differentiation between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign hepatocellular tumors in the non-cirrhotic liver.Material and methods:107 consecutive patients without liver cirrhosis (46 male; 45 Â± 14 years) who underwent liver resection due to suspicion of HCC were included in this multi-center study. The following imaging features were assessed: lesion diameter and demarcation, satellite-lesions, central-scar, capsule, fat-content, hemorrhage, vein-infiltration and signal-intensity (SI) on native T1-, T2- and dynamic-enhanced T1-weighted images (center versus periphery). In addition, contrast-media (CM) uptake in the liver specific phase was analyzed in a sub-group of 42 patients.Results:Significant differences between HCC (n=55) and benign lesions (n=52) were shown for native T1-, T2- and dynamic-enhanced T1-SI, fat-content, and satellite-lesions (all, PConclusion:Independent MRI features indicating HCC are T1-hypointensity, T2-hypo- or hyperintensity, lack of central tumor-enhancement, presence of satellite-lesions and lack of liver specific CM-uptake. These features may have the potential to improve the diagnosis of HCC in the non-cirrhotic liver.
