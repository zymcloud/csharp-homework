Background & aims:Diagnosis of preclinical compensated cirrhosis (occult cirrhosis, OC) is challenging due to lack of clinical findings. We evaluated prevalence and outcomes of OC by transient elastography (TE, Fibroscan(®)).Methods:Eight hundred and seventy-one patients with compensated chronic liver disease (CLD) and TE examination were divided into: (i) OC (TE ≥ 13 kPa and no sign of cirrhosis, including absence of thrombocytopenia and signs of advanced liver disease on ultrasound or gastroscopy); (ii) clinically evident cirrhosis (TE ≥ 13 kPa with signs of cirrhosis); (iii) non-cirrhotic CLD (TE Results:Occult cirrhosis represented 12% of the cohort and 37% of cirrhotic patients. Independent predictors of OC were age [odds ratio (OR) 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.26], HIV co-infection (OR 3.53; 95% CI, 1.85-6.76) and APRI (OR 2.63; 95 CI, 1.87-3.71). During a median follow-up of 24 (interquartile range 20-37) months, OC received less surveillance than clinically evident cirrhosis, with fewer ultrasounds (2.7 ± 1.5 vs 3.6 ± 2; P Conclusions:Occult cirrhosis is a frequent and under-monitored clinical entity associated with short-term risk of outcomes. TE may help early diagnosis, prompt initiation of surveillance and specific therapy for an otherwise unrecognized condition.
