Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer in the world. Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is one of the most serious complications of HCC and is strongly correlated with a poor prognosis for HCC patients. However, the detailed mechanism of PVTT development remains to be explored. In this study, we present a large-scale transcriptome analysis, by RNA sequencing, of 11 patients diagnosed with HCC with PVTT. The dysregulated genes between HCC and PVTT suggested that the extracellular matrix receptor interaction was correlated with the venous metastases of HCC. Among all of the recurrent alternative splicing events, we identified exon 6 skipping of RPS24, which is likely to be a cancer driver. We also identified five common fusion genes between HCC and its corresponding PVTT samples, including ARID1A-GPATCH3, MDM1-NUP107, PTGES3-RARG, PRLR-TERT, and C9orf3-TMC1. All of these findings broaden our knowledge of PVTT development and may also contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of HCC patients with PVTT.
