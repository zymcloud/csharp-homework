Conflict that the derived neutrophil lymphocyte (dNLR) has prognostic value in patients with a variety of cancers exists. The aim of the present study was to devise a monocyte/granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio (M/GLR) which counts as (white cell count - lymphocyte count) to lymphocyte count, and verify its prognostic value in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 1061 HCC patients were retrieved and the associations between M/GLR/NLR/dNLR and clinicopathological variables and survivals (OS and RFS) were analyzed. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the discriminatory ability of M/GLR/NLR/dNLR. The median follow-up period was 947 days, the 1, 3, 5 year OS was 64%, 51%, and 46% respectively, and the median OS was 842 days. The cut-off values were determined by ROC as 2.8, 1.6, and 3.2 for NLR, dNLR, M/GLR respectively. Elevated M/GLR/NLR/dNLR was associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.001, P = 0.009 and P = 0.022 respectively). By time-dependent ROC, the AUC of M/GLR was higher than that of NLR or dNLR, either in whole group or in subgroups according to TNM stages or different treatments. We concluded that elevated M/GLR predicted poor prognosis for patients with HCC and the M/GLR can be used as an alternative to NLR and dNLR.
