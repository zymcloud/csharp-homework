Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and prognosis remains unsatisfactory when the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage. Many molecular targeted agents are being developed for the treatment of advanced HCC; however, the only promising drug to have been developed is sorafenib, which acts as a multi-kinase inhibitor. Unfortunately, a subgroup of HCC is resistant to sorafenib, and the majority of these HCC patients show disease progression even after an initial satisfactory response. To date, a number of studies have examined the underlying mechanisms involved in the response to sorafenib, and trials have been performed to overcome the acquisition of drug resistance. The anti-tumor activity of sorafenib is largely attributed to the blockade of the signals from growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and the downstream RAF/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK cascade. The activation of an escape pathway from RAF/MEK/ERK possibly results in chemoresistance. In addition, there are several features of HCCs indicating sorafenib resistance, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and positive stem cell markers. Here, we review the recent reports and focus on the mechanism and prediction of chemoresistance to sorafenib in HCC.
