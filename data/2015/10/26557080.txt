Small-cell carcinoma (SCC), or high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach, is a rare subtype of extra-pulmonary SCC which is almost invariably lethal. Gastric SCC often presents with local symptoms indistinguishable from other primary stomach cancers; however, both regional and distant spread are common at the initial presentation. Depending on symptoms and patient performance status, treatment typically consists of chemotherapy or resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, as even patients with limited stage gastric SCC likely have micrometastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. In this case report, we describe the long-term survival of a 75-year-old male with recurrent oligometastatic high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach treated with radiation therapy (RT) alone. He presented with abdominal pain and dyspepsia and was found to have a 6 cm locally invasive node-positive gastric SCC initially treated with extensive surgical resection. He was not a candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy, and surveillance imaging subsequently confirmed metachronous liver and local recurrences within 1 year after surgery, which were managed with stereotactic body RT and conventional radiation, respectively. An additional para-aortic nodal recurrence was treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy 7 years after surgery with good response. He tolerated all RT courses without notable radiation-related toxicity and remains in complete remission 11 years after initial diagnosis.
