In clinical practices, the therapeutic outcomes and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with different tumor numbers after surgery are very different; however, the underlying mechanisms of the tumorigenesis and development of HCC with different tumor numbers are still not well understood. Here, we systematically compared the overall proteome profiles between the primary HCC with single and multiple lesions using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics approach. We identified that 107 and 330 proteins were dysregulated in HCC tissue with multiple lesions (MC group) and HCC tissue with a single lesion (SC group), compared with their non-cancerous tissue (MN and SN groups) respectively. The dysregulated proteins in MC group are concentrated in UBC signaling pathway and NFκB signaling pathway, but the dysregulated proteins in SC group are more concentrated in ERK signaling pathway and the NFκB signaling pathway. These information revealed that there might be different molecular mechanisms of the tumorigenesis and development of the HCC with single and multiple lesions. Furthermore, HSD17B13 were only down-regulated in MC group while HK2 were only up-regulated in SC group among these dysregulated proteins. Therefore, the protein HSD17B13 and HK2 might be potential biomarkers for the primary HCC with single and multiple lesions.
