Introduction:The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between 18-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), histological necrosis, and prognosis after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Patients:From January 2007 through December 2013, 81 patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis were included in our liver transplantation program. For this study we selected patients who underwent 18-FDG PET/CT pre-TACE and post-TACE. All patients underwent liver transplantation within 8 weeks after PET/CT.Results:Twenty patients with a median age of 58 years (range, 46-69 years) underwent an 18-FDG PET/CT before and after TACE. The median Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) before TACE was 3.8 (range, 2.6-8.7), with a median post-TACE SUV of 0% (range, 0-4). Among patients whose post-TACE SUV decreased to 70% necrosis was observed upon study of a hepatectomy sample, with a survival rate of 100% and 80% at 1 and 3 years, respectively.Conclusion:In conclusion, performance of an 18-FDG PET/CT before and after TACE with comparison of SUV values among patients with HCC awaiting OLT provided valuable information regarding the effectiveness of TACE.
