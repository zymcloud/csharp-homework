Background:The relevant number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criteria have undergone living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). However, the prognostic factors for these patients with advanced HCC remain unclear.Methods:From March 2005 to May 2013, 280 patients with HCC underwent LDLT at the National Cancer Center. Of these, patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria were retrospectively enrolled. We analyzed the prognostic significance of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) for selecting appropriate candidates.Results:Of the total 280 patients, 147 (52.5%) were confirmed to have HCC beyond the Milan criteria on the basis of pathological reports. The patients who met and exceeded the Milan criteria had 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 87.2% and 64.6%, respectively (P Conclusions:A PET/CT status in LDLT is a useful marker for predicting survival of patients with advanced HCC.
