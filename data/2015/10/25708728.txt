Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and one of its encoded proteins, HBV X protein (HBx), have been shown to induce autophagy in hepatoma cells. Substantial evidence indicates that autophagy is a potent suppressor of inflammation. However, sporadic reports suggest that autophagy could promote pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and inflammation in some biological contexts. Here, we show that overexpression of HBx induces LC3B-positive autophagosome formation, increases autophagic flux and enhances the expression of ATG5, ATG7, and LC3B-II in normal hepatocytes. Abrogation of autophagy by small interfering RNA against ATG5 and ATG7 prevents HBx-induced formation of autophagosomes. Autophagy inhibition also abrogates HBx-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and CXCL2. These findings suggest that autophagy is required for HBx-induced NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production and could shed new light on the complex role of autophagy in the modulation of inflammation.
