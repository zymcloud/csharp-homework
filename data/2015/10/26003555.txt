Purpose:In this study, we explored whether treatment with FGF-21 could prevent diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice.Methods & results:Hepatoma was induced by injection of DEN every three days for 18 weeks. For the prophylactic experiment, mice were firstly injected with FGF-21 for 2 weeks, then FGF-21 was administered to the mice once daily in association with DEN injection till the end of the experiment. The hepatoma incidence of mice treated with FGF-21 was 13.3%, while the incidence of mice treated with saline was 61.5%. To understand the mechanisms, we compared the expression of βklotho (KLB) and oxidative stress level in the livers between the mice treated with FGF-21 and saline. We found that FGF-21 could suppress DEN-induced oxidative stress and up-regulate the expression of KLB in the livers. To confirm these results, we compared the expression of KLB in L02 cells stimulated with or without FGF-21. Besides, we established DEN-induced oxidative stress cell model to affirm the relationship between FGF-21 and DEN-induced oxidative stress in vitro. Results showed that FGF-21 increased the expression of KLB and diminished the DEN-induced oxidative stress in vitro in a dose dependent manner.Conclusion:Systemic administration of FGF-21 can prevent DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via suppressing oxidative stress and increasing the expression of KLB.
