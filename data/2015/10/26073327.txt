Aim:Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is involved in various cellular functions, including cell growth, migration, apoptosis, cytoskeleton architecture and calcium homoeostasis, etc. As an oncogenic kinase, SPHK1 is associated with the development and progression of cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SPHK1 was involved in hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx).Methods:The expression of SPHK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and hepatoma cells were measured using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. HBx expression levels in hepatoma cells were modulated by transiently transfected with HBx or psi-HBx plasmids. The SPHK1 promoter activity was measured using luciferase reporter gene assay, and the interaction of the transcription factor AP2α with the SPHK1 promoter was studied with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The growth of hepatoma cells was evaluated in vitro using MTT and colony formation assays, and in a tumor xenograft model.Results:A positive correlation was found between the mRNA levels of SPHK1 and HBx in 38 clinical HCC samples (r=+0.727, PConclusion:HBx upregulates SPHK1 through the transcription factor AP2α, which promotes the growth of human hepatoma cells.
