Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is generated during a rotational sweep of the C-arm around the patient, and can be a valuable imaging technique, providing in situ cross-sectional imaging. It is easy to evaluate the morphologic characteristics of hepatic arteries from multiple views with the use of various reconstruction techniques, such as maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering. CBCT angiography is capable of providing more information than the standard 2-dimensional angiography in visualizing hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and targeting tumors though precise microcatheter placement in close proximity to HCCs. It can also be useful in evaluating treatment success at the time of the procedure. It is anticipated that CBCT could reduce radiation exposure, the overall procedure time and contrast material use because it allows immediate feedback for an efficient angiographic procedure. Therefore, CBCT angiography is an exciting technology with the potential to significantly impact the practice of interventional radiology. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the principles, clinical applications and technique of CBCT angiography for HCC treatment.
