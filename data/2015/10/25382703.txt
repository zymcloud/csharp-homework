Aim:To evaluate the oncological implications of multiplication of α-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonists-II (PIVKA-II) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Data were prospectively collected from 516 consecutive patients who underwent a curative primary hepatectomy for HCC between 1998 and 2010. The AP-factor (AFP × PIVKA-II) was evaluated in relation to 2-year survival outcomes by receiver-operator curve analysis to determine the cut-off values. Patient survival, recurrence-free survival and risk factors were analyzed in accordance with the preoperative AP-factor.Results:The AP-factor was categorized into three groups depending on the serum concentrations of AFP and PIVKA-II as follows: AP1 (n = 206; AFP Conclusion:The AP-factor is closely related to differentiation and microscopic vascular invasion, and was selected by multivariate analysis as an independent factor for survival and recurrence, in HCC. Patients hopeful of obtaining good outcomes after a hepatectomy could be selected by the AP-factor evaluation.
