Aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh in women. HCC varies widely in incidence through the world, with rising incidence in Egypt. This study aimed to estimate the serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and its substrate galectin-3 in order to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy and their relation to HCC-related clinical features.Methods:For this purpose, serum levels of these biochemical markers were assessed in 50 HCC patients, 30 cirrhotic patients in addition to 10 healthy subjects as a control group using enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).Results:In the present study, circulating level of galectin-3, MMP-9 increased significantly in HCC as compared to the control group (P = 0.044 and 0.04, respectively). However, no significant difference was observed between cirrhotic and HCC patients (P = 0.231 and 0.193, respectively). Our study found that HCC patients with metastatic spread had a significant elevation of both serum galectin-3 and MMP-9 levels (P = 0.028 and Conclusion:MMP-9 and galectin-3 could be used as a guide for prognosis of HCC since they may play a role in HCC progression and metastasis. However, they are not useful markers for HCC diagnosis.
