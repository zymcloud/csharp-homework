CAP2 has been suggested as a potential diagnostic biomarker for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its prognostic significance in HCC remains unclear. Here, we show that CAP2 expression is much higher in HCC tissues than that in paracarcinoma tissues, at both mRNA and protein levels. Data of immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that CAP2 was markedly up-regulated in 77.3% of HCC cases. High CAP2 expression, defined by the median score of IHC, was present in 53.3% of the patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that high CAP2 expression was associated with poor overall survival (P
