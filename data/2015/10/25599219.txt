Background/aims:Iron overload is an increasingly recognized phenomenon in nonhemochromatosis cirrhosis. To evaluate the relationship between iron overload and liver insufficiency and portal hypertension.Patients and methods:Cirrhotics with hepatic hemodynamic and ferritin measurement (within 30 d) were included. Exclusion criteria were malignancy (except hepatocellular carcinoma Milan-in), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute events in the previous 2 weeks, immunosuppression, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or portal vein thrombosis, and end-stage renal disease. Patients were followed-up until death or liver transplant. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used.Results:Fifty-one patients were included (male 61%; median age 57 y; interquartile range, 47 to 66 y); Child-Pugh A 11/B 25/C 15). A positive correlation was observed between ferritin and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein: r=0.273, P=0.06 and aspartate aminotransferase: r=0.302, P=0.035). No correlation between ferritin and hepatic venous pressure gradient was seen. Negative correlations were observed between ferritin and circulatory dysfunction (mean arterial pressure: r=-0.360, P=0.014 and serum sodium: r=-0.419, P=0.002). In contrast, associations to markers of liver failure such as international normalized ratio (r=0.333, P=0.005), bilirubin (r=0.378, P=0.007), albumin (r=-0.265, P=0.082), model for end-stage liver disease (r=0.293, P=0.041), and Child-Pugh score (r=0.392, P=0.009) were observed. No differences in survival according to ferritin was detected.Conclusions:In patients with cirrhosis, serum ferritin levels are associated with markers of liver insufficiency, inflammation, and circulatory dysfunction but not portal hypertension.
