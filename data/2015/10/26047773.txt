Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with intracavitary metastasis to the heart is rare. The incidence of HCC with right atrial metastasis is less than 6% at autopsy. Reports of HCC with right ventricular metastasis without inferior vena cava and right atrial metastasis are rarer. The diagnosis of metastasis of HCC into the cardiac cavity might be overlooked because the symptoms are neither apparent nor specific. Here, we report a patient with metastasis of HCC into the right ventricle cavity. The patient was in a disease-free status and experienced lower limbs oedema and gradual shortness of breath.
Isolated right ventricular tumor; Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma; Right-sided heart failure.
