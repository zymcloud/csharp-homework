A 53-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma was unable to receive transarterial radioembolization and had disease progression despite multiple chemoembolizations and systemic chemotherapy. Transportal radioembolization (TPRE) to maintain transplant candidacy was performed. Two lesions (1.7 cm, 1.4 cm) were treated with a single session of TPRE. Imaging performed at 4 months after TPRE demonstrated complete response in one lesion and stable disease in the other. This case illustrates TPRE as a salvage therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma in select patients.
