Purpose:To identify imaging findings associated with elevated lung shunt fraction (LSF) in patients being considered for yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization.Materials and methods:During the period 2009-2014, 152 consecutive patients underwent planning hepatic arteriography with technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) macroaggregated albumin (MAA) injection. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging performed before the procedure for each patient was assessed for hepatic vein (HV) tumor thrombus or occlusion from external compression by tumor. When imaging was a multiphase CT scan (117 patients), the arterial phase was evaluated for evidence of early HV opacification (relative to unaffected HVs), indicating hepatic venous shunting. These factors were correlated with LSF determined by (99m)Tc-MAA imaging.Results:Median LSF was 6.7% (range, 20%) LSF (P Conclusions:Early HV opacification and HV tumor thrombus or occlusion on cross-sectional imaging performed before radioembolization are associated with elevated LSF, which may contraindicate or limit the dose delivered in (90)Y radioembolization. This information could be helpful during patient counseling for anticipating the most appropriate mode of liver-directed therapy.
