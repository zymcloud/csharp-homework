Despite the theoretical advantages of laparoscopic hepatectomy, it is still not considered the standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma patients because of criticism concerning oncologic stability. This study aimed at examining the short- and long-term follow-up results of laparoscopic hepatectomy versus open hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma and at investigating clinical outcomes, oncologic safety, and any potential advantages of laparoscopic hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. A series of 53 patients who underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy (Lap group) for hepatocellular carcinoma were matched with 53 patients who underwent open hepatectomy during the same time period (Open group). The short- and long-term outcomes were compared between the two groups of patients. The patients who underwent the laparoscopic procedure showed a significantly faster recovery and less blood loss compared with patients who underwent open surgery. No differences were found in 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates. Our results suggested that the laparoscopic approach was as safe as the open alternative. Laparoscopic hepatectomy has been shown to be a favorable surgical option with better short-term outcomes and similar long-term oncological control compared with open hepatectomy.
