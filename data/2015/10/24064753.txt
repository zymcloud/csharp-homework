Objectives:The aim of this prospective study was to reveal the efficacy and safety of Yttrium-90 (Y) radioembolization in Korean patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 40 HCC patients were prospectively recruited from 7 centers. The response to treatment was assessed on the basis of the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. The time to progression and overall survival were also evaluated, and the assessment of safety was done according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria, Version 3.0.Results:Forty-two treatments of Y radioembolization were carried out. Median follow-up was 29 months. At 3 months, the complete response, partial response (PR), and stable disease were seen in 4 (10.0%), 19 (47.5%), and 15 (37.5%) patients, respectively. The response rate was 57.5% (23/40), and disease control rate was 95% (38/40) at 3 months. The response rate at 6 months was 63.9% (23/36), and disease control rate was 83.3% (30/36). The median time to progression was 18 months. During follow-up, 10 HCC-related deaths occurred and the 3-year survival rate was 75%. In 19 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-B stage, the 3-year survival rate was 50%. The tumor number (>5) was the only significant predictor associated with survival. The most common adverse event was abdominal pain of mild to moderate degree, and all the complications were manageable. Twenty-six (65%) patients underwent other treatments such as transarterial chemoembolization because of local progression or remnant viable lesion.Conclusions:Y radioembolization might be a safe and effective treatment modality in intermediate-stage to advanced-stage HCC.
