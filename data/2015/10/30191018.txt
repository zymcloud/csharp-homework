Liver cancer is a heterogeneous group of tumors characterized by significant molecular and genomic heterogeneity. The advent of powerful genomic technologies has allowed detection of recurrent somatic alterations in liver cancer, including mutations, copy number alterations as well as changes in transcriptomes and epigenomes, with the potential to translate these data into clinically relevant predictive and prognostic factors. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the application of high-throughput genomic technologies in liver cancer and the integration of such cancer genome profiling data, highlighting specific relevant subgroups and explain how this knowledge can be used in translational clinical research, 'basket trials', molecular tumor boards, targeted therapy and for personalized genomic medicine applications.
