Intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very heterogeneous tumor in terms of tumor size (>3 cm ∼ over 10 cm), tumor number (4 ∼ over 20) and liver function (Child-Pugh score 5-9). However, transarterial chemoembolization is the only recommended treatment option according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging. Bolondi's subclassification of BCLC B stage is feasible; however, there are several weak points. Therefore, by modifying Bolondi's subclassification, we have proposed a more simplified subclassification, Kinki criteria. The Kinki criteria consist of 2 factors: liver function (Child-Pugh score 5-7 or 8, 9) and tumor status (Beyond Milan and within up-to-7 criteria; IN and OUT). The Kinki criteria classifies BCLC B stage from B1 (Child-Pugh score 5-7 and within up-to-7), B2 (Child-Pugh score 5-7 and beyond up-to-7) and B3 (Child-Pugh score 8, 9 and any tumor status). These criteria are simple and easy to apply to clinical practice. Therefore, these criteria will stratify the heterogeneous population of BCLC B group patient well and give the treatment indication according to each substage. These criteria should be further validated both retrospectively and prospectively.
