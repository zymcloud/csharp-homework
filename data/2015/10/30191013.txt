Neil Theise speaks to Georgia Patey, Commissioning Editor: Neil Theise is a diagnostic liver pathologist, adult stem cell researcher and complexity theorist in New York City, where he is a Professor of Pathology at the Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He received his medical degree from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he also received his training in Anatomic Pathology. Subspecialty training was pursued in gastrointestinal (NYU), liver (Royal Free Hospital) and liver transplant (Mount Sinai, NYC) pathology. His earliest research focus was on defining the premalignant dysplastic nodules in human chronic liver disease. He revised understandings of human liver microanatomy, which in turn, led directly to identification of possible liver stem cell niches and the marrow-to-liver regeneration pathway. He is considered a pioneer of multiorgan adult stem cell plasticity. His publications on these topics in model systems and human liver stem cells have been highlighted on a record five covers of Hepatology.
