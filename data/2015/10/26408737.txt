Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations between clinicopathological findings, laboratory data and survival outcome in patients undergoing curative laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC).Patients and methods:Clinicopathological findings and laboratory data, including tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and systemic inflammatory response indicators, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and modified Glasgow prognosis score (mGPS), for 204 patients (tumor stage I-III) undergoing laparoscopic curative surgery for CRC were collected.Results:Elevated CA19-9 and mGPS, and body mass index (BMI) <20 kg/m(2) were significant indicators of poorer overall survival, while CA19-9 and BMI were validated as independent predictors of overall survival. In addition, BMI <20 kg/m(2) was a significant independent factor predictive of poorer disease-free survival. BMI significantly negatively correlated with NLR, which reflects the patients' immune response.Conclusion:Lower BMI is a promising predictor of recurrence and poor prognosis in patients treated by laparoscopic surgery for CRC with curative intent.
