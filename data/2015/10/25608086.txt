The FIB-4 index is a simple formula using age, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and platelet count to evaluate liver fibrosis. We investigated the ability of the FIB-4 index for hepatocarcinogenesis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers with normal ALT levels. A total of 516 patients with ALT levels persistently at or below 40 IU/L during an observation period of over 3 years were included. Factors associated with the development of HCC were determined. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed in 60 of 516 patients (11.6%). The incidence rate of HCC at 5 and 10 years was 2.6% and 17.6%, respectively. When patients were categorized according to the FIB-4 index as ≤ 2.0 (n = 226), >2.0 and ≤ 4.0 (n = 169), and > 4.0 (n = 121), the cumulative incidence of HCC at 5 years was 0.5%, 1.3% and 8.0%, respectively, and 2.8%, 25.6% and 37.1% at 10 years, respectively. Patients with FIB-4 index >4.0 were at the highest risk (P 2.0 (hazard ratio (HR), 7.690), FIB-4 index >4.0 (HR, 8.991), α-fetoprotein (AFP) >5 ng/mL (HR, 2.742), AFP >10 ng/mL (HR, 4.915) and total bilirubin >1.2 mg/dL (HR, 2.142). A scoring system for hepatocarcinogenesis that combines the FIB-4 index and AFP predicted patient outcomes with excellent discriminative ability. The FIB-4 index is strongly associated with the risk of HCC in HCV carriers with normal ALT levels.
