Intra-tumoral arterio-hepatic venous shunting (AHVS) poses an impediment to transarterial chemoembolization of liver tumors. Not only does it present a potential hazard for systemic shunting and embolization, but also the altered flow dynamics may also result in poor delivery of drug/embolics to the target tumor bed. Current available techniques to overcome AVHS include arterial embolization (particles, coils, glue, etc.) or temporary venous occlusion using balloons. We hereby illustrate the use of radiofrequency ablation to obliterate a complex AHVS consisting of a varix-like venous aneurysm.
