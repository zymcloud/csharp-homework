Pancreatic hepatoid carcinoma (HC) is an extremely uncommon neoplasm of pancreas that resembles hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report a case of incidentally detected pancreatic HC combined with a serous microcystic cystadenoma, in a 47-year-old man, while he was being evaluated for renal calculi. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of abdomen revealed a lesion with mild heterogeneous enhancement in the tail of pancreas and another proximal lesion having moderate enhancement, and a calculus in the neck of gallbladder. Serum chromogranin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 levels were within normal limits. He underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Pathologically the distal tumor was encapsulated and characterized by eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nucleus with prominent nucleolus and intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions. The cells were arranged in trabecular pattern separated by sinusoids. Canalicular and intercellular bile plugs were seen. On immunohistochemistry tumor cells were positive for hepatocyte specific antigen and weakly positive for alpha fetoprotein (AFP). The proximal tumor showed features of serous microcystic adenoma. Based on these findings, the case was diagnosed as hepatoid tumor of pancreas combined with serous microcystic cystadenoma. Post operative AFP was 1.75 IU/mL. The patient is on follow up for the last eight months and there is no evidence of recurrence.
