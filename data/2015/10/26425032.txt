A growing body of evidence suggests that epigenetic modifications are promising potential mechanisms in cancer research. Among the molecules that mediate epigenetic mechanisms, histone deacetylases (HDACs) are critical regulators of gene expression that promote formation of heterochromatin by deacetylating histone and non-histone proteins. Aberrant regulation of HDACs contributes to malignant transformation and progression in a wide variety of human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers. Thus, the roles of HDACs have been extensively studied because of their potential as therapeutic targets. However, the underlying mechanism leading to deregulation of individual HDACs remains largely unknown. Some reports have suggested that functional microRNAs (miRNAs) modulate epigenetic effector molecules including HDACs. Here, we describe the oncogenic or tumor suppressive functions of HDAC families and their regulatory miRNAs governing HDAC expression in hepatocarcinogenesis.
