Gastrointestinal (GI) metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma is very rare. This is the first report of post-transplantation gastric metastasis. A 43-year-old man with a history of hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the right anterior segment of the liver received an orthotopic liver transplant. Three months after the transplantation, pulmonary metastasis was found by chest computed tomography, and he received 1 course of gamma knife treatment. He complained of melena with anemia 17 months post liver transplantation. Abdominal CT scan showed new occupying lesions in the liver and a mass in the stomach and around the spleen with embolus in the splenic vein. Endoscopy revealed a large irregular cauliflower-like mass in fundus with ulceration and bleeding on the surface. He received symptomatic treatment, but died of cancer-related bleeding 4 months later. GI bleeding may due to gastric metastasis after liver transplantation.
