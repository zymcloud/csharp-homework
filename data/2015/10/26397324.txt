Objective:This article reviews the development of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in Japan, particularly ethiodized oil-based conventional TACE, from historical, strategic, and technical points of view. We also present the current status of standardized conventional TACE.Conclusion:Conventional TACE has been developed toward a more-selective and hemodynamic-conscious method, along with technical innovation and knowledge accumulation. Standardization of this method is necessary for further scientific evaluation.
