We describe a case of acquired hepatocerebral degeneration (AHD) presenting with confusion and worsening memory problems since her discharge from the gastroenterology units. Cases of AHD are rare and are frequently confused with hepatic encephalopathy and Wilson's disease. There are no proven pharmacological therapies for AHD. Information regarding the effect of orthotopic liver transplant on AHD is limited and conflicting. Most patients eventually die from the systemic complications of cirrhotic liver failure including infection, hepatic coma and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Acquired hepatocerebral degeneration; Liver cirrhosis.
