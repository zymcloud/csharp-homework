Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fifth most common cancer in the world, shows increasing incidence worldwide. Curative treatments such as hepatectomy, liver transplantation, and radiofrequency ablation are applied in only 30%-60% of cases. Most remaining patients receive transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Patients with intermediate-stage HCCs are regarded as good candidates for TACE. However, the intermediate stage includes non-homogeneous patients. Some movements are underway to stratify patients using prognostic factors to identify patient groups exhibiting greater benefit from TACE than other patient groups. This review describes two substaging systems that subclassify intermediate-stage HCCs and discusses the importance of dividing intermediate-stage patients.
