While the roles of HMGB1 in inflammation and cell differentiation have been previously reported, its role in tumor cell migration and invasion, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has remained elusive. The present study reported that the expression of HMGB1 in HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in matched tumor‑adjacent tissues (P
