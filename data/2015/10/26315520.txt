Accurate tests for at-risk populations are available for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Effective treatments for all three diseases exist if diagnosed early. New antivirals are making a significant impact on HCV. Liver transplant is curative for early HCC and is prioritized by the United Network for Organ Sharing in the United States. Screening and surveillance for deadly disease only makes sense if there are identifiable populations at risk for the condition, there are sensitive and specific low-cost tests available for the condition, and there are effective treatments for the condition.
