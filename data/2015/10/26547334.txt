Objective:To evaluate the association between SLC22A1 expression and the outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:A tissue microarray of 303 HCC and matched adjacent noncancerous liver tissues (ANLTs) were constructed. The expression of SLC22A1 was tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scored by two pathologists according to a 12-score scale (a score>6 was defined as high expression, and a scoreâ‰¤6 as low expression). The correlation of SLC22A1 expression with the clinicopathological features and the patients' outcome was analyzed.Results:All the ANLTs had a IHC score of 12, as compared to only 29 (9.6%) of the HCC tissues. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the IHC scores: 59% (180/303) in low expression group and 41% (123/303) in high expression group. The disease-free survival (DFS) rates and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly lower in low SLC22A1 expression group than in the high expression group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS rates were 43%, 31% and 27% in the low expression group, and were 58%, 47% and 43% in the high expression group, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 66%, 38% and 32% in low expression group, and were 80%, 57% and 50% in the high expression group, respectively. A low expression of SLC22A1 was positively correlated with the tumor diameter, BCLC stage, tumor differentiation, and AFP levels (PConclusions:Down-regulation of SLC22A1 is a malignant feature and a potential prognostic marker of HCC.
