Specific and effective delivery of drugs and genes to cancer cells are the major issues in successful cancer treatment. Recently, targeted cancer gene therapy has been emerged as a main technology for the treatment of different types of cancers. Among various synthetic carriers, polyethylenimine is one of the most well-known polymers for gene delivery. In this study, we conjugated phage-derived peptide (DMPGTVLP) to polyethylenimine (10 kDa) via disulfide bonds for targeted gene delivery into breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). As negative-control cells, we used non-related hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). Peptide-conjugated polyplex exhibited low cytotoxicity and significantly increased the transfection efficiency in comparison with unmodified polyethylenimine. Therefore, the peptide-modified vector can be used as a good targeting agent for gene or drug delivery into breast adenocarcinoma cells.
