Background:No staging systems of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are tailored for assessing recurrence risk. We sought to establish a recurrence risk scoring system to predict recurrence of HCC patients receiving surgical curative treatment (liver resection or transplantation).Methods:We retrospectively studied 286 HCC patients with preserved liver function receiving liver resection (n=184) or transplantation (n=102). Independent risk factors were identified to construct the recurrence risk scoring model. The recurrence free survival and discriminatory ability of the model were analyzed.Results:Total tumor volume, HBsAg status, plasma fibrinogen level were included as independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival and used for constructing a 3-factor recurrence risk scoring model. The scoring model was as follows: 0.758 x HBsAg status (negative: 0; positive: 1) + 0.387 x plasma fibrinogen level (≤ 3.24 g/L: 0; >3.24 g/L: 1) + 0.633 x total tumor volume (≤ 107.5 cm3: 0; > 107.5 cm3: 1). The cut-off value was set to 1.02, and we defined the patients with the score ≤ 1.02 as a low risk group and those with the score > 1.02 as a high risk group. The 3-year recurrence-free survival rate was significantly higher in the low risk group compared with that in the high risk group (67.9% vs 41.3%, P Conclusion:Our recurrence risk scoring model is effective in categorizing recurrence risks and in predicting recurrence-free survival of HCC before potential surgical curative treatment.
