Due to the limited treatment options hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related death, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major risk factor for development of HCC worldwide. HCC is typically preceded by chronic inflammation, but may also develop in the absence of liver disease on the basis of HBV infection and even when virus replication is controlled by antivirals. In this situation, HBV antigen expression persists and direct oncogenic effects of HBV are integration of the viral DNA into the host genome as well as direct effects of viral proteins. These factors have to be taken into account in order to personalize HCC surveillance in CHB and unravel novel therapeutic approaches.
