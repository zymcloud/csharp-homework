Background:Despite recent clinical trials, the sensitivity and resistance of metastatic gastric cancer to anti-HER2 and anti-EGFR therapy are still unclear.Materials and methods:To clarify the HER2 and EGFR expression status in the metastatic sites, we immunohistochemically compared HER2 and EGFR expression between primary and metastatic tumors from 52 gastric cancer patients with liver metastases and 85 patients with peritoneal metastases.Results:The HER2 positivity rate of primary and metastatic tumors in patients with liver metastases, especially with intestinal-type histology (70.6 and 80.0 %, respectively), was significantly higher than in primary and metastatic tumors (22.4 and 16.4 %, respectively) in patients with peritoneal metastases. HER2 positivity of the primary tumor and liver metastases showed good concordance (87.5 %) in patients with liver metastases. In contrast, the EGFR positivity rate of metastatic tumors (70.1 %) in patients with peritoneal metastases was significantly higher than that of metastatic tumors (37.5 %) in patients with liver metastases. HER2 and EGFR expression tended to be mutually exclusive, and HER2/EGFR double-positive cases were rare in patients with liver or peritoneal metastases. In four such patients with HER2/EGFR double-positive primary tumors, the HER2- and EGFR-positive areas were separate, and corresponding liver metastasis was only positive for HER2 and peritoneal metastasis only positive for EGFR.Conclusion:These results indicate that HER2 and EGFR are preferentially expressed in the liver and peritoneal metastases, respectively, which would be potential targets for anti-HER2 and anti-EGFR molecular therapy in metastatic gastric cancer patients.
