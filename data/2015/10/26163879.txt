The growth arrest special 5 (GAS5) is known to be involved in various cancers. However, its expression regulation remains unclear. Polymorphisms in the promoter region of GAS5 may affect its expression and be associated with cancer susceptibility. In this research, we first evaluated the association of a 5-base pair indel polymorphism (rs145204276) in the promoter region of GAS5 with hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility in Chinese populations. Logistic regression analysis showed that the deletion allele of rs145204276 significantly increased the risk of HCC in two independent case control sets (1034 HCC and 1054 controls). Further genotype-phenotype association analysis revealed that the deletion allele was markedly correlated with higher expression of GAS5 in HCC tissues. The luciferase activity analysis in an in vitro reporter gene system suggested that the deletion allele improved an increased expression of GAS5 in three hepatoma cell lines. Intriguingly, overexpression of GAS5 displayed an anti-apoptosis effect in HCC cell lines, GAS5 knockdown could partially revert this anti-apoptosis effect, suggesting that GAS5 may act as a proto-oncogene in HCC, in contrast with its inhibitory role in other cancers. Further pyrosequencing revealed that the genotypes of rs145204276 were associated with methylation status of GAS5 promoter region. Taken together, our findings provided evidence that rs145204276 may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis by affecting methylation status of the GAS5 promoter and subsequently its transcriptional activity thus serving as a potential therapy target for HCC.
