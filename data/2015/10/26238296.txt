Helicobacter pylori is a well-known causative organism of chronic gastric diseases and has been found in many hepatic carcinoma samples. To explore the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and carcinoma development in H. pylori-infected livers, we utilized BALB/cAnSlac mice to establish an H. pylori-infected model by oral inoculation and orthotopic grafts of hepatic tumors by H22 cells, respectively. We found that H. pylori colonies could not be cultured from all liver and tumor samples. However, its 16S rRNA was detectable in 85.3% of livers and 66.7% of tumors in the infected mice. Inflammatory cells were observed and thinly distributed in the lobule portions of the liver, and H. pylori mainly existed in the infected hepatic sinusoids and the necrotic areas of the infected tumors. No significant difference was found in liver to body weight ratio between the infected and uninfected. Moreover, the pathological tumor difference was unremarkable between the two. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression in the infected tumors was significantly higher and lower, respectively, than those of the uninfected tumors. However, no significant difference in Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) expression existed. The results indicate that H. pylori found in the livers which were infected by H. pylori oral inoculation could contribute to the infiltration of inflammatory cells in livers. Although H. pylori has no significant impact on the liver to body weight ratio or tumor Bcl-2 expression, it may upregulate PCNA expression and downregulate Bax expression, respectively. All our findings show that H. pylori may promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells.
