Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease and has led to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma in a majority of infected individuals. We have previously demonstrated that the HCV alternate reading frame protein (F protein) is related to Th1/Th2 bias in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, and we aimed to explore the relative molecular mechanisms here. A total of 104 cases including CHC patients and healthy donors were enrolled. T-bet and GATA-3 expression levels were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1/-6(STAT1/6) and phosphorylated STAT1/6(pSTAT1/6) in PBMCs were measured by Western blotting. Our results showed that the levels of T-bet in PBMCs, as well as the levels of gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) in sera, were decreased in anti-F protein antibody seropositive patients compared with anti-F protein antibody seronegative patients, whereas the levels of GATA-3 did not show difference between the two groups. Moreover, the decreased pSTAT1 and increased pSTAT6 were observed in PBMCs by HCV core/F protein stimulation with constant STAT1/6 expression. Taken together, it suggested that T-bet may be involved in Th1/Th2 bias induced by HCV F protein, and the disruption of STAT phosphorylation may participate in this mediation.
