Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a worldwide malignance and displays marked vascular abnormalities and active metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in regulating tumor properties in cancer, however, whether miR-497 contributes to HCC angiogenesis or metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we found that miR-497 was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissue samples and cell lines. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies revealed that miR-497 could repress both the pro-angiogenic and metastatic ability of HCC cells. Subsequent investigations disclosed that miR-497 directly inhibited the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1). Furthermore, overexpression of these targets antagonized the function of miR-497. Based on nude mouse models, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-497 significantly repressed microvessel densities in xenograft tumors and reduced pulmonary metastasis. In conclusion, our findings indicate that miR-497 downregulation contributes to angiogenesis and metastasis in HCC.
