Background:Traditional open liver resection remains the classic procedure for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located in the posterosuperior segments of the liver (segments I, IVa, VII, and VIII). This study compared the perioperative and oncologic results for laparoscopic versus open liver resection of HCC located in the posterosuperior segments, especially in patients with cirrhosis.Methods:This study included 41 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) and 86 who underwent open liver resection (OLR) for HCC in the posterosuperior segments between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. There perioperative course and oncologic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated.Results:There were no significant differences between the LLR and OLR groups in length of operation (242.41 ± 73.69 vs. 235.38 ± 65.80 min), transfusion rate (7.3 vs. 14.0 %), R0 resection rate (100 vs. 97.7 %), or tumor size (4.22 ± 2.05 vs. 4.30 ± 1.49 cm). In contrast, postoperative hospital stay (9.44 ± 2.72 vs. 14.53 ± 6.03 days) was significantly shorter, and postoperative complication rates (17.1 vs. 37.2 %) and intraoperative blood loss (272.20 ± 170.86 vs. 450.12 ± 344.70 mL) significantly lower in the LLR than in the OLR group. In addition, there was no significant difference between the two groups (LLR vs. OLR) regarding 1-year overall survival rate (95.1 vs. 89.5 %), 3-year overall survival rate (78 vs. 76.7 %,), 1-year disease-free survival rate (87.8 vs. 82.6 %,), and 3-year disease-free survival rate (70.7 vs. 68.6 %).Conclusions:LLR for selected patients with HCC in the posterosuperior segments may offer the same oncologic outcomes as conventional procedures, while being associated with such advantages as lower blood loss, fewer postoperative complications, and shorter hospital stay.
