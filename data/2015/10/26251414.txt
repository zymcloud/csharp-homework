This study evaluated the predictive value of 18F-FDG PET for distant metastasis-free survival and peritoneal recurrence-free survival as well as recurrence-free survival and overall survival after curative surgical resection in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC).Methods:Two hundred seventy-nine patients with AGC who underwent preoperative 18F-FDG PET and subsequent curative surgical resection were included. The tumor-to-normal liver uptake ratio (TLR) of cancer lesions was measured, and the prognostic significance of TLR and tumor factors for distant metastasis-free survival, peritoneal recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival was assessed.Results:The 5-y recurrence-free survival, peritoneal recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival rates were 46.9%, 68.5%, 76.0%, and 58.1%, respectively. Depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, and TLR were independent prognostic factors for both recurrence-free survival and overall survival (P<0.05). For distant metastasis-free survival, lymphovascular invasion and TLR were independent risk factors (P<0.05). In patients with a TLR of 2.0 or less, the 5-y distant metastasis-free survival rate was 95.5%; in patients with a TLR greater than 2.0, the 5-y distant metastasis-free survival rate was 68.8%. For peritoneal recurrence-free survival, TLR showed no statistical significance (P=0.7) whereas pT stage, lymph node metastasis, Lauren classification, and Bormann type were independent prognostic factors (P<0.05).Conclusion:18F-FDG uptake of AGC is an independent prognostic factor for distant metastasis-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. The possibility of distant metastasis during follow-up should be considered in patients with high 18F-FDG uptake.
