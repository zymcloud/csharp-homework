Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common biliary malignancy and the second most common hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a tandem-repeat-type galectin that has recently been shown to exert antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. Therefore, the present study evaluated the effects of Gal-9 on the proliferation of human cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro as well as the microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with the antitumor effects of Gal-9. Gal-9 suppressed the proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma cell lines in vitro and the growth of human cholangiocarcinoma cell xenografts in nude mice. Our data further revealed that Gal-9 increased caspaseâ€‘cleaved keratin 18 (CCK18) levels, and the expression of cytochrome c increased in Gal-9-treated cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. These data suggested that Gal-9 induced cholangiocarcinoma cell apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway mediated by caspase-dependent or -independent pathways. In addition, Gal-9 reduced the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), hepatocyte growth factor receptor and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). These findings suggest that Gal-9 can be a candidate of therapeutic target in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.
