Purpose:We applied whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to children diagnosed with neoplasms and found to carry apparently balanced constitutional translocations to discover novel genic disruptions.Methods:We applied the structural variation (SV) calling programs CREST, BreakDancer, SV-STAT, and CGAP-CNV, and we developed an annotative filtering strategy to achieve nucleotide resolution at the translocations.Results:We identified the breakpoints for t(6;12)(p21.1;q24.31), disrupting HNF1A in a patient diagnosed with hepatic adenomas and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Translocation as the disruptive event of HNF1A, a gene known to be involved in MODY3, has not been previously reported. In a subject with Hodgkin lymphoma and subsequent low-grade glioma, we identified t(5;18)(q35.1;q21.2), disrupting both SLIT3 and DCC, genes previously implicated in both glioma and lymphoma.Conclusion:These examples suggest that implementing clinical WGS in the diagnostic workup of patients with novel but apparently balanced translocations may reveal unanticipated disruption of disease-associated genes and aid in prediction of the clinical phenotype.
