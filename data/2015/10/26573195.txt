Objective:To investigate the relationship between SREBP-1c and the risk of liver disease associated with the triacylglyceride lipase PNPLA3 I148M variant using a human hepatoma cell line model transfected with recombinant lentiviruses.Methods:Huh7 cells were transfected with control lentivirus or lentivirus containing the PNPLA3 I148M variant (variant). The two cell groups were compared to assess differences in triglyceride content (using oil red O staining), levels of triglyceride and cholesterol (using automated biochemical analyzer), expression of SREBP-lc mRNA (using fluorescence quantitative PCR), and expression of SREBP-1c protein (using western blot.Results:Cells expressing the PNPLA3 I148M variant showed higher triglyceride content (0.54+/-0.03 mmol/L vs. control cells: 0.23+/-0.02 mmol/L; t=22.58, P<0.001), cholesterol level (0.28+/-0.03 mmol/L vs. control cells: 0.13+/-0.02 mmol/L; t =11.83, P<0.001), SREBP-1cmRNA expression (13.59+/-0.60 vs. 11.81+/-0.82; [The abstract and text in the paper say variant increases, but the data shown says the higher value is in the control cells. Please correct to properly express the data.] P=0.001), and SREBP-1c protein expression. The level of SREBP-1c was positively correlated with serum triglyceride in the cells expressing the PNPLA3 I148M variant (r=0.912, P<0.01).Conclusion:The risk of liver disease associated with the PNPLA3 I148M variant, which increases lipogenesis, may involve SREBP-1c and a pathway that increases triglycerides.
