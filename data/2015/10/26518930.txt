Background:We describe an observational, retrospective study that included patients who underwent a liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in our center between 2004 and 2012.Methods:Clinical variables were recorded for donors and recipients as diagnosis and treatment, immunosuppressive therapy, toxicity, graft dysfunction, recurrence, and exitus. Fifty-eight patients were analyzed. The mean age was 57 Â± 8 years. The viral etiology of HCC was 50% (n = 29), alcoholic 26% (n = 15), and others, 24% (n = 14). Regarding initial immunosuppressive strategy (IS), 51 patients (87.9%) were treated with standard regimen with corticosteroids (CS) and tacrolimus (TA), compared with 7 patients with impaired renal function (12.1%) who underwent a delayed therapy with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) + mycophenolate mophetil (MMF) + CS. Concomitant use of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies was less than 10%. Regarding maintenance, 43 patients (74.1%) were treated with MMF + CNI versus 15 treated only with TA (25.9%).Results:Recurrence of HCC was approximately 12%: 7 patients (2 hepatic only, 5 also extra-hepatic). Exitus was established in 19 patients (32.75%); only 3 patients (5.17%) were attributable to HCC. Bivariate studies were conducted according to the initial IS (standard regimen versus delayed therapy) and maintenance therapy (MMF + TA versus TA alone), with no differences in any of them in recurrence, treatment toxicity, graft rejection, and dysfunction.Conclusions:In our experience with the IS, we found no differences in the development of recurrent disease, treatment toxicity, development of graft dysfunction, or rejection. We believe that individualized immunosuppressive therapy in these patients is safe and effective.
