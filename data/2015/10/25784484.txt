Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface glycoprotein overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and may serve as a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention. This study evaluated the prognostic significance of serum GPC3 in HCC patients receiving curative surgery. A novel sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the quantitative and sensitive determination of serum GPC3 N-terminal subunit antigen (sGPC3N) was developed and used to measure sGPC3N levels in 25 healthy volunteers and 115 HCC patients who underwent curative partial hepatectomy. The relationships between sGPC3N and clinicopathologic features were analyzed and the prognostic impact on overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) was also investigated. Mean and median levels of sGPC3N in healthy controls were 110.12 and 115.95 pg mL(-1) , respectively, with 185.52 pg mL(-1) (mean + 2 SD) being set as the upper limit of the normal range. In HCC patients, sGPC3N levels were significantly increased (mean/median, 405.16/236.19 pg mL(-1) ) compared to healthy controls (p
