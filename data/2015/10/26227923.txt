Background:Biliary cystic tumours (BCT) [biliary cystadenoma (BCA) and cystadenocarcinoma (BCAC)] warrant complete resection. Simple liver cysts (SLC) require fenestration when symptomatic. Distinguishing between BCT and atypical SLC with pre-operative imaging is not well studied.Methods:All patients undergoing surgery for a pre-operative suspected SLC or BCT between 1992 and 2014 were included. Peri-operative data were retrospectively reviewed. A blind radiological review of pre-operative imaging was performed.Results:Ninety-four patients underwent fenestration (n = 54) or complete excision (n = 40). Final pathology was SLC (n = 74), BCA (n = 15), BCAC (n = 2) and other primary malignancies (n = 3). A frozen section (FS) was performed in 36 patients, impacting management in 10 (27.8%) by avoiding (n = 1) or mandating a liver resection (n = 9). Frozen section results were always concordant with final pathology. Upon blind review, a solitary lesion, suspicious intracystic component, septation and biliary dilatation were associated with BCT (P < 0.05). Diagnostic sensitivity was high (87.5-100%) but specificity was poor (43.1-53.4%). The diagnostic value of imaging was most accurate when negative for BCT (negative predictive value: 92.5-100%).Conclusion:Radiological assessment of hepatic cysts is relatively inaccurate as SLC frequently present with concerning features. In the absence of a strong suspicion of malignancy, fenestration and FS should be considered prior to a complete resection.
