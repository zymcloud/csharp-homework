Objective:To analyze the impact of interleukin-37 (IL-37) on proliferation, migration and invasion of SMMC-7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and the related molecular mechanism.Methods:SMMC-7721 cells cultured in vitro were divided into the (50, 100, 200, 500) ng/mL recombinant human IL-37 (rhIL-37) treated groups and control group. Cell proliferation ability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Wound healing assay was used to observe cell migration ability. Transwell(TM) assay was performed to test the cell invasion ability. The levels of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) were determined using Western blotting.Results:CCK-8 assay showed that rhIL-37 inhibited the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells. Wound healing assay revealed that rhIL-37 inhibited the migration of SMMC-7721 cells. Transwell(TM) indicated that rhIL-37 inhibited the invasion of SMMC-7721 cells. Western blotting demonstrated that rhIL-37 down-regulated the expressions of p-STAT3 and MMP-2.Conclusion:IL-37 can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of SMMC-7721 cells. It may be related with the down-regulation of p-STAT3 and MMP-2.
