Purpose:The purpose of this study is to examine whether epirubicin loaded DC Bead 300-500 μm in size can pass through a 1.8-Fr ultraselective microcatheter in ex vivo study.Methods:Epirubicin (25 mg/1 mL) loaded 100-300 and 300-500 μm DC Bead were tested. Both sizes were diluted 5, 10, and 30 times using contrast material. Ultraselective microcatheter with the outer diameter of 1.8 Fr and the inner diameter of .017 inch (431.8 μm) was used. The diluted DC Bead was injected at a speed of 1 mL/min, and the pressure was continuously measured. The microspheres' shapes after ejection were observed by a stereomicroscope.Results:The maximum pressure of contrast material alone was 8.40 ± 0.21 psi. The maximum pressure in 5, 10, and 30 times dilution groups of 100-300 μm were 9.67 ± 1.18, 9.25 ± 0.25, and 9.71 ± 0.28 psi, respectively, whereas 21.10 ± 10.2, 10.48 ± 2.14, 10.09 ± 0.37 psi, respectively in 300-500 μm groups. The maximum pressure in 5 times dilution group of 300-500 μm was significantly higher than the other groups (P Conclusions:Epirubicin loaded DC Bead 300-500 μm in size can pass through a 1.8-Fr ultraselective microcatheter. To avoid high resistance due to microspheres' aggregation, dilution more than 10 times is needed.
