Background & aims:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects and replicates in quiescent hepatocytes, which are deficient in dNTPs, the critical precursors of HBV replication. Most tumor viruses promote dNTP production in host cells by inducing cell proliferation. Although HBV is known as a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, it does not lead to cellular proliferation. Instead, HBV acquires dNTPs by activating the expression of the R2 subunit of the Ribonucleotide Reductase (RNR) holoenzyme, the cell cycle gene that is rate-limiting for generation of dNTPs, without inducing the cell cycle. We wished to elucidate the molecular basis of HBV-dependent R2 expression in quiescent cells.Methods:Quiescent HepG2 cells were transduced with an HBV-containing lentiviral vector, and primary human hepatocytes were infected with HBV. DNA damage response and RNR-R2 gene expression were monitored under this condition.Results:We report here that HBV-induced R2 expression is mediated by the E2F1 transcription factor, and that HBV induces E2F1 accumulation, modification and binding to the R2 promoter. We found that Chk1, a known E2F1 kinase that functions in response to DNA damage, was activated by HBV. In cells where Chk1 was pharmacologically inhibited, or depleted by shRNA-mediated knockdown, HBV-mediated R2 expression was severely attenuated. Furthermore, we found that HBV attenuates DNA repair, thus reducing cellular dNTP consumption.Conclusions:Our findings demonstrate that HBV exploits the Chk1-E2F1 axis of the DNA damage response pathway to induce R2 expression in a cell cycle-independent manner. This suggests that inhibition of this pathway may have a therapeutic value for HBV carriers.
