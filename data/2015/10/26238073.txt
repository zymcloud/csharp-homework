The Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) gene is related to various biological processes including stem cell reprogramming and tumorigenesis. In this study, we identified and characterized a non-coding transcript of KLF4, which was designated KLF4‑003, in human liver tissue samples. KLF4‑003 was identified in a number of cell lines by reverse transcription PCR and DNA sequencing. Its expression levels were determined in 54 pairs of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and a number of HCC cell lines by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Methylation status of KLF4‑003 CpG islands was determined by bisulfite sequencing. The regulatory effect of KLF4‑003 CpG islands hypermethylation in Hep3B cells was then validated by the 5-aza-dC demethylation treatment, followed by RT-PCR analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was created to evaluate the diagnostic value for differentiating between HCC cancer and benign diseases. The association study between KLF4‑003 expression level and clinical traits of HCC patients was performed with SPSS. We found that KLF4‑003 was downregulated in 46 out of 54 HCC samples compared with their adjunct normal tissues. The reduced KLF4‑003 expression was significantly associated with HCC recurrence (P=0.045) in the follow-up of 31 HCC patients. Significant differences were detected between the methylation status of HCC specimens and their adjacent normal controls. Demethylation treatment significantly rescued the expression of KLF4‑003 in Hep3B cells. Such observation indicated that the CpG island hypermethylation was at least partially responsible for the downregulation of KLF4‑003 in HCC. The area under ROC curve for the prediction of HCC reached 0.803 (95% CI=0.719-0.886, P
