Background:The frequency of simultaneous liver kidney transplantation (SLKT) has been increasing over the past decade. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Given the rising prevalence of HCV-related SLKT, it is important to understand the impact of HCV in this patient population.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry to assess adult patients undergoing SLKT in the United States from 2003 to 2012. Patient survival following SLKT was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Results:Patients infected with non-HCV have significantly lower survival following SLKT compared to non-HCV patients at three (three-yr survival: 71.0% vs. 78.9%, p Conclusions:Hepatitis C infection is associated with lower patient survival following SLKT.
