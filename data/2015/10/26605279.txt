Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with or without underlying liver disease can be treated by surgical resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, morbidity and mortality of a laparoscopic approach in cirrhotic patients with HCC.Methods:From 2004 to September 2014, 90 patients underwent a laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for HCC. Data were collected in a prospectively maintained database since 2001. Preoperative patient evaluation was based on a multidisciplinary team meeting assessment.Results:Median age was 63 years; 67 (74.4%) patients were male. Median body mass index (BMI) was 26.7. Underlying liver disease was known in 68 patients: in 46 patients' hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related, in 15 patients to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related, in 5 patients alcohol-related. Child-Pugh Score was of grade A in 85 patients and of grade B in 5 patients; 63 patients had a Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) 10. A total of 18 left lateral sectionectomies, 1 left hepatectomy and 71 wedge resections or segmentectomies were performed. Conversion to laparotomy was necessary in 7 (7.7%) patients (five cases for bleeding and two cases for oncological reasons). In 90 patients, 98 HCC nodules were resected: 79 patients had one nodule, 8 patients had two nodules and 1 patient had three nodules. HCC nodules medium diameter was 29 mm (range, 4-100 mm) with median value of 25 mm. Tumor margins distance was 16 mm (range, 0-35 mm) with a median of 5 mm. Seventy nodules were located within the anterior sectors and 28 nodules within the posterior sectors.Conclusions:LLR for HCC can be performed with acceptable morbidity in patients with underlying liver disease. The use of laparoscopic surgery in cirrhotic patients may be proposed as the first-line treatment for HCC or as bridge treatment before liver transplantation.
