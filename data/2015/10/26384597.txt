Transarterial chemoembolization is a minimally invasive procedure that deprives the tumor of its blood supply, and is especially used for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Metabolic evaluation of interventional therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma is proving to be a valuable tool in choosing therapies that are better targeted to patients, especially because of its likely contribution in predicting treatment response in unresectable lesions after these therapies.
