The increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is well established; however, long-term risk estimates are needed. Recently, it has been suggested that HBV is associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and pancreatic cancer (PC). The aim of this Danish nationwide cohort study was to evaluate the association between HBV infection and all-type cancer, HCC, NHL and PC. A cohort of patients infected with HBV (n = 4345) and an age- and sex-matched population-based comparison cohort of individuals (n = 26,070) without a positive test for HBV were linked to The Danish Cancer Registry to compare the risk of all-type cancer, HCC, NHL and PC among the two groups. The median observation period was 8.0 years. Overall, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for all-type cancer among HBV-infected patients was 1.1 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.9-1.3). The IRR of HCC was 17.4 (CI 5.5-54.5), whereas the IRR of PC and NHL was 0.9 (CI 0.3-2.5) and 1.2 (CI 0.4-3.6), respectively. HBV-infected patients had a 10-year risk of 0.24% (Cl 0.12-0.44) for HCC, whereas the comparison cohort had a 10-year risk of 0.03% (Cl 0.02-0.07) for HCC. The risk of all-type cancer, NHL and PC was not higher in the HBV-infected cohort compared to non-HBV infected. We found a 17-fold higher risk of HCC for HBV-infected individuals.
