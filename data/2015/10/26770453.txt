MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in cancer biology, and some distinctive serum miRNAs could be useful for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, little is known about whether serum miR-96 is a satisfactory biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four hundreds and fourteen participants were enrolled in this study, and they were divided into four age- and gender-matched groups, including the HCC group (n = 104), liver cirrhosis (LC) group (n = 90), chronic hepatitis B (CHB) group (n = 100) and healthy control group (n = 120). Serum miR-96 was measured by real-time PCR, the levels of which were calculated by the 2(-Î”Ct) method. Serum miR-96 levels in the HCC patients were remarkably higher than in the other groups (P
