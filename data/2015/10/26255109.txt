Purpose:To describe the prevalence of choroidal nevus in the US population and identify possible associated factors.Design:Cross-sectional study.Participants:A total of 5575 participants aged ≥40 years from the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) who underwent retinal imaging examination.Methods:Predictor variables included a spectrum of demographic, ophthalmic, dermatologic, systemic, socioeconomic, or occupational factor variables available in NHANES.Main outcome measures:Choroidal nevus on retinal imaging.Results:The prevalence of choroidal nevus was 4.7% overall and increased with age (4.7%, 3.1%, 5.4%, 6.6%, and 7.5% in subjects aged 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and ≥80 years, respectively). The prevalence was 5.0% in men, 4.4% in women, 5.6% in whites, 2.7% in Hispanics, 0.6% in blacks, and 2.1% in others. After adjusting for age and race, the odds of choroidal nevus were 10-fold higher in whites than in blacks, 5-fold higher in Hispanics than in blacks, 4-fold higher in others than in blacks, and 2-fold higher in whites than in Hispanics. Choroidal nevus was associated with hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.98); psoriasis (OR, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.57-9.66); lower high-density lipoprotein (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99); higher uric acid (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22); working in installation, maintenance, or repairs (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.96); and having never worked (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.03-2.37; P = 0.04). There was no association with visual symptoms, visual functioning, visual acuity, refractive error, visual field, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, or elevated cup-to-disc ratio on retinal imaging. There was no association with skin melanoma, other cancers, lung/liver/kidney/thyroid disease, alcohol/drug use, income/education, hemoglobin A1C, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, electrolytes, or urine albumin.Conclusions:Among US adults, the prevalence of choroidal nevus located within two 45° areas centered on the macula and optic disc is 4.7%. The prevalence increases with age, is highest among whites (5.6%), is lowest among blacks (0.6%), and has been previously under-recognized among Hispanics (2.7%). Extrapolating to the entire fundus, the true prevalence of choroidal nevus is even higher but difficult to accurately estimate. Possible associations with cardiovascular, renal, autoimmune, and occupational risk factors warrant further investigation.
