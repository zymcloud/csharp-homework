Here we reported that association between drug resistance and carcinomatosis in advanced liver cancer cases. All subjects (n=4) were periodically received chemotherapeutic agents when clinical manifestation being defined serologically. Hepatic specimen was harvested via biopsy and further prepared as paraffin-slice before conducting immunohistochemistry. As a consequence, more detectable biomarkers, such as AST, AFP, GGT2, were high expressed in plasma when compared to clinical standards. DNA topoisomerase II (TOPO II), Ki-67 were immunoreactively labeled in cytoplasm/membrane and nucleolus of liver cancer cells, while hepatocellular tumor protein p53 was negative or non-detected. Additionally, we found that hepatobiliary cancer showed epithelial differentiation with pronounced CK19 immunoreactivity when metastasizing. Our clinicopathologic findings demonstrate that correlation between carcinomatous proliferation/metastasis and drug resistance protein expression. Furthermore, these evidences indicate that TOPO II may be a biomarker for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patient receiving chemotherapeutics.
