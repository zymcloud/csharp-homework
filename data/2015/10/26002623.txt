Objective:To determine the value of advanced virtual monoenergetic images (mono+) from dual-energy computed tomography (CT) of hyperattenuating and hypoattenuating liver lesions in various phantom sizes and patients in comparison with standard monoenergetic images (mono).Materials and methods:Anthropomorphic phantoms simulating 4 patient sizes (S, 300 × 200 mm; M, 350 × 250 mm; L, 400 × 300 mm; and XL, 600 × 450 mm) with a liver insert containing both hyperattenuating and hypoattenuating iodine-containing lesions were imaged with dose-equivalent dual-energy (100/150 Sn kilovolt [peak] [kV{p}]) and single-energy (120 kV[p]) protocols on a 192-slice dual-source CT system. In addition, 4 patients with 3 hypoattenuating and 3 hyperattenuating hepatocellular carcinoma were included and underwent dual-energy CT imaging with the same scanner at similar kV(p) settings (100/150 Sn kV[p]). Images were reconstructed with standard mono and with the mono+ algorithm at 10-kiloelectron volt (keV) intervals from 40 to 190 keV. Attenuation of the liver and lesions were measured, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Lesion conspicuity was rated by 2 blinded independent readers in all mono and mono+ data sets from 40 to 190 keV using a 5-point Likert scale (1, lowest conspicuity; and 5, highest conspicuity).Results:Attenuation in the liver and in both hyperattenuating and hypoattenuating lesions did not differ between mono and mono+ (P = 0.41-0.49). Noise on mono+ was significantly lower than on mono for all phantom sizes (P Conclusion:Our ex vivo and patient data demonstrate added value for imaging of both hyperattenuating and hypoattenuating liver lesions with advanced virtual monoenergetic dual-energy CT by decreased noise, increased CNR, and higher lesion conspicuity, although with limitations in XL body sizes.
