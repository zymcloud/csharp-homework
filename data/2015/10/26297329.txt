Licorice, the root and stolons of the Glycyrrhiza plant (Fabaceae), has been used for centuries as a food additive (sweetener), in cosmetics, and in traditional medicine. In this research, we provide evidence that licorice extract activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and, as identified through HPLC fractionation and mass spectroscopy, one of the activating phytochemicals is glabridin. Glabridin was shown to bind to and activate PPARγ. It was also shown to activate PPARγ-regulated gene expression in human hepatoma cells similar to known PPARγ ligands and that the expression was blocked by a PPARγ specific antagonist.
