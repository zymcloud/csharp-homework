Objective:To investigate whether SIS3, a specific inhibitor of Smad3 phosphorylation, can reverse the stemness of multidrug-resistant(MDR) hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Methods:MDR HCC Huh7.5.1/ADM cell lines were developed by exposing parental cells to stepwise increasing concentrations of ADM. CCK-8 assay was used to determine the cellular sensitivity of various anticancer drugs. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to analyze the expression level of cancer stem cell marker CD133. Clone formation assay and mouse subcutaneous xenograft tumors were used to investigate the tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Western blotting (WB) was used to analyze the changes of expressions of CD133, Smad3, Bcl-2, Bax and p-Smad3 in different conditions.Results:ADM treatment of HCC cells in vitro resulted in a development of subline, Huh7.5.1/ADM cells, with CSC phenotypes: stable MDR phenotype (besides ADMc Huh7.5.1/ADM cells were also more resistant to some other anticancer drugs including VCR, MMC and CTX ) (IC50: 0.215 ± 0.018 vs. 0.123 ± 0.004, 0.145 ± 0.009 vs. 0.014 ± 0.002, 1.021 ± 0.119 vs. 0.071 ± 0.006, 27.007 ± 1.606 vs. 1.919 ± 0.032) (unit: µg/ml) (PConclusion:SIS3 as a specific inhibitor of Smad3 signal is involved in the stemness of multidrug resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
