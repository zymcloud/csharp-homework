5-FU is a common first-line chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. However the development of acquired resistance to 5-FU confines its clinical usages. Although this phenomenon has been the subject of intense investigation, the exact mechanism of acquired resistance to 5-FU remains elusive. Here, we report that over-expression of GRP78 contributes to acquired resistance to 5-FU in HCC by up-regulating the c-Src/LSF/TS axis. Moreover, we found that the resistance to 5-FU conferred by GRP78 is mediated by its ATPase domain. The ATPase domain differentially increased the expression of LSF, TS and promoted the phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. We further identified that GRP78 interacts physically with c-Src through its ATPase domain and promotes the phosphorylation of c-Src, which in turn increases the expression of LSF in the nucleus. Together, GRP78 confers the resistance to 5-FU by up-regulating the c-Src/LSF/TS axis via its ATPase domain.
