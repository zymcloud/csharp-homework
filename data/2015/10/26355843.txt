The insufficient cellular uptake of nanocarriers and their slow drug release have become major obstacles for achieving satisfactory anticancer outcomes in nano-medicine therapy. Because of the slightly acidic extracellular environment (pHe≈ 6.5) and a higher glutathione (GSH) concentration (approximately 10 mM) in tumor tissue/cells, we firstly designed a novel d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000-poly(β-amino ester) block copolymer containing disulfide linkages (TPSS). TPSS nanoparticles (NPs) with pH- and redox-sensitive behaviors were developed for on-demand delivery of docetaxel (DTX) in hepatocellular carcinoma. DTX/TPSS NPs exhibited sensitive surface charge reversal from -47.6 ± 2.5 mV to +22.5 ± 3.2 mV when the pH decreased from 7.4 to 6.5, to simulate the pHe. Meanwhile, anabatic drug release of DTX/TPSS NPs was observed in PBS buffer (pH 6.5, 10 mM GSH). Due to the synergism between the pHe-triggered charge reversal and the redox-triggered drug release, enhanced drug uptake and anticancer efficacy were observed in HepG2 and SMMC 7721 cells treated with DTX/TPSS NPs. The positively charged NPs exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, promoted cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and increased the rate of apoptosis. More importantly, based on the higher tumor accumulation of TPSS vehicles in vivo, a significant suppression of tumor growth, but without side-effects, was observed when DTX/TPSS NPs were injected intravenously into HepG2 xenograft tumor-bearing mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the newly developed dual-functional TPSS copolymer may be utilized as a drug delivery system for anticancer therapy.
