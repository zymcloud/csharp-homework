Hepatocellular carcinoma is the major complication of chronic liver diseases and particularly of cirrhosis whatever its etiology. Once encountered mainly in the endemic countries of hepatitis B and C, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (6/100,000) is parallel to the global development of diabetes, overweight and alcohol consumption. Little progress has been made for this cancer, whose mortality is 100 % at 10 years. Liver transplantation is the only truly curative treatment (survival more than 50 % at 10 years) since it allows the eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma and its essential cause, cirrhotic liver. This is the only possible therapy when liver function is impaired. It has little impact since in the richest countries, less than 10 % of cases can be transplanted. Surgical resection and percutaneous destruction methods (uni- and multipolar radiofrequency, microwave, cryotherapy, electroporation) are the preferred treatments (survival less than 50 % at 5 years) but are only applicable for moderate tumour masses and in the absence of adjuvant therapy, are effective only in the medium term. Most patients received chemoembolization through hepatic artery, whose action is modest. Radiotherapy is widely used in Asia but almost non-existent in Western countries in this indication. Sorafenib is the only effective drug but its impact is modest. Therapies combining two modalities (embolization and radiotherapy; embolization and radiofrequency) seem promising and deserve wider testing. Screening and monitoring of cirrhosis is probably the major measure for potentially curative therapies.
