Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is an inflammatory lung disease involving the distal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, bronchiolar ducts, and alveolae. The etiology is usually unknown; however, there are several known causes and associated systemic diseases. Corticosteroid therapy is the best treatment option and the prognosis of COP is good, with recovery in up to 80% of patients. We described a patient with in-operable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing chemoembolization with doxorubicin in a drug-eluting bead (DEB). COP developed in the patient after chemoembolization but resolved spontaneously in several months.
