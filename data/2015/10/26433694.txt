More than 160 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma induced by HCV infection are life-threatening diseases. HCV takes advantage of many aspects of lipid metabolism for an efficient propagation in hepatocytes. Due to the morphological and physiological similarities of HCV particles to lipoproteins, lipid-associated HCV particles are named lipoviroparticles. Recent analyses have revealed that exchangeable apolipoproteins directly interact with the viral membrane to generate infectious HCV particles. In this review, we summarize the roles of lipid metabolism in the life cycle of HCV.
