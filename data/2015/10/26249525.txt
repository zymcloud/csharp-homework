We report the first case of initially unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein and hepatic venous tumor thrombosis and multiple lung metastases that allowed for curative hepatectomy after multidisciplinary treatment including sorafenib. A 54-year-old male presented with a large HCC in the right liver with tumor thrombosis of the left portal vein and middle hepatic vein (MHV) as well as multiple lung metastases. His serum alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated at 52,347 ng/mL and palliative treatment with sorafenib was initiated. One month later, a significant reduction in the serum AFP level, decrease in the tumor size with recanalization of the portal vein and the absence of lung metastases were noted. Three months after the start of sorafenib treatment, external-beam radiotherapy was performed to treat enlargement of the area of MHV thrombosis, and the thrombosis regressed. Five months after the initiation of sorafenib treatment, central bisegmentectomy associated with removal of the tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava was performed. A microscopic examination revealed complete necrosis of the tumor. Sorafenib treatment may be a bridge to curative resection in selected patients with initially unresectable advanced HCC, even in cases involving multiple extrahepatic metastases.
