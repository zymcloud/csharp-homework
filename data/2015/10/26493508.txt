Gastric cancer frequently disseminates to the liver, lung, and bone via hematogeneous, lymphatic, or peritoneal routes. However, gastric adenocarcinoma that metastasize to the colon and that shows typical linea platisca pattern on colonofiberscopy has rarely been reported. Recently, the authors experience a case of advanced gastric cancer with colonic metastases in a 55-year-old female patient. Multiple colonic lymphoid hyperplasias were detected on colonofiberscopy and biopsy revealed metastatic gastric cancer to the colonic wall. She was treated with mFOLFOX (5-FU, oxaliplatin, leucovorin) and has achieved stable disease status without disease progression. Herein, we report a rare case of signet ring-cell gastric cancer which metastasized to the colon in the form of multiple colonic lymphoid hyperplasias.
