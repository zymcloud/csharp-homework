Hydatid cyst is a parasitic infestation caused by Echinococcus granulosus. Lungs are the second most common site of involvement after liver. The diagnosis of complicated pulmonary hydatid cysts may not be easy because hydatid cyst disease mimics tuberculosis, lung cancer, empyema, or abscess. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of the infestation by visualization of hydatid cyst membrane. Here, we report the case of a 33-year-old woman who presented with hemoptysis and chest discomfort and was diagnosed with a hydatid cyst by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
