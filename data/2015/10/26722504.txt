The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship among MTA2, Ki-67 and HCC patient prognosis. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of MTA2 and Ki-67 in HCC samples and corresponding adjacent samples. We found MTA2 and Ki-67 were both increased in HCC tissues than those in adjacent tissues and nuclear MTA2 was associated with Ki-67 (P = 0.019). Moreover, nuclear MTA2 was a risk factor of distant metastasis in patients with HCC andKi-67 showed a negative correlation with histological grade (P
