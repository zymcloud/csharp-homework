Background:Craniofacial resection (CFR) has been regarded as a standard treatment for various tumors involving the anterior skull base. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of CFR for the patients with anterior skull base malignancies in our hospital.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 17 patients with anterior skull base malignancies treated with CFR between 2001 and 2012. Mean follow-up duration was 41 months (range, 2-103 months).Results:Intracranial involvement was found in 11 patients (65%) and orbital extension in 6 patients (35%). Classical bifrontal craniotomy was combined with endoscopic endonasal approach in 14 patients and external approach in 3 patients. Vascularized flap was used for reconstruction of the anterior fossa floor in 16 patients (94%). The most common pathological type was squamous cell carcinoma (6 patients). Gross total resection was achieved in all cases. Postoperative complications developed in 4 patients (24%) and included local wound problem and brain abscess. One patient with liver cirrhosis died from unexpected varix bleeding after the operation. Although postoperative treatment, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, was performed in 14 patients, local recurrence was seen in 6 patients. The mean overall survival time after the operation was 69.0 months (95% confidence interval: 47.5-90.5 months) with a 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rate of 82.3%, 76.5%, and 64.7%, respectively. Postoperative radiotherapy was found to be the powerful prognostic factor for favorable survival.Conclusion:Considering the higher local control rate and acceptable complication or mortality rate, CFR with adjuvant radiotherapy is a gold standard treatment option for malignant tumors involving anterior skull base, especially with extensive intracranial involvement.
