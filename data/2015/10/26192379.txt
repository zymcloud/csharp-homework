Background:Few studies have investigated infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected liver transplant patients. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence, time of onset, mortality of infectious complications, other than hepatitis C virus (HCV), and to identify risk factors for their development in a large single-center cohort of HIV-infected liver transplant patients.Methods:We studied 109 consecutive HIV-infected patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT) between 1999 and 2010 and followed until December 2012.Results:The median age was 44 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41-49), 82.6% were male, and the median follow-up was 45.7 months (IQR 14-65). The major indications for LT were HCV cirrhosis (61%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (19%). Forty patients (37%) developed at least 1 infection during the first year after LT. Twenty-eight (26%) patients had an episode of bacteremia. Five (4.6%) patients developed a cytomegalovirus infection. Fungal infections occurred in 5 (4.5%) patients. Four (3.6%) patients developed an HIV-related opportunistic infection. A total of 43 (39.4%) patients died during follow-up. Mortality related to infection occurred in 9 (7%) cases, and 20 (42.5%) patients died because of HCV recurrence. No patients died from opportunistic infections. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score >17 was associated with a 2-fold higher risk (hazard ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval 1.01-3.80) of developing infectious complications.Conclusions:Infections are not a major cause of mortality after LT in HIV patients and opportunistic infections of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are infrequent. A MELD score >17 increased the risk of developing post-LT infectious complications. Recurrence of HCV infection remains a major cause of mortality.
