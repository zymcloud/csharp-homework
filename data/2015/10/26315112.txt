Transactivators encoded by HBV, including HBx and preS2, play critical role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). YAP, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis mediated by HBx. Here, we investigated whether preS2, another transactivator encoded by HBV, regulates the Hippo pathway to promote HCC. We found that preS2 overexpression upregulated TAZ, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, at protein level but not at mRNA level. preS2 suppressed miRNA-338-3p expression in HCC cell lines. miRNA-338-3p mimics downregulated TAZ, while miRNA-338-3p inhibitor restored the expression of TAZ, suggesting that TAZ is a direct target of miRNA-338-3p. TAZ overexpression stimulated growth of HCC cell lines. Knockdown of TAZ dampened preS2-promoted HCC proliferation and migration. Thus, preS2 upregulates TAZ expression by repressing miRNA-338-3p. TAZ is necessary for preS2-promoted HCC proliferation and migration.
