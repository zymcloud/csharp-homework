Aims:Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-positive human Mac-2-binding protein (WFA(+) -M2BP) is a new glycol marker related to liver fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate WFA(+) -M2BP as a predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis C.Methods:This case-control study included 14 patients with chronic hepatitis C who developed HCC and 52controls, matched for age, gender, and fibrosis stage. WFA(+) -M2BP was measured at biopsy and follow-up. Time zero was set at the date of liver biopsy.Results:WFA(+) -M2BP increased stepwise with progression of liver fibrosis (p Conclusions:WFA(+) -M2BP measurements and time-course changes in WFA(+) -M2BP can be used to identify patients at high risk of HCC development. Real-time monitoring of WFA(+) -M2BP can be a novel predictor of HCC development.
