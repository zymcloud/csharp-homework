Introduction:Osteopontin (OPN) mediates metastasis and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), found in green tea, suppresses HCC tumor growth in vitro. We sought to investigate the role of EGCG in modulating OPN in cell lines of metastatic HCC.Methods:Experimental HCC cell lines included HepG2 and MHCC-97H HCC cells, which express high levels of OPN, and the Hep3B cells, which express lesser levels of OPN. Cells were treated with EGCG (0.02-20 μg/mL) before measurement of OPN with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Scratch assay measured cell migration. Binding of the OPN promoter to RNA pol II was evaluated by the use of Chromatin-IP assay after EGCG treatment. Transcriptional regulation of OPN was investigated with luciferase reporter plasmids containing various deletion fragments of the human OPN promoter. Measurement of the half-life of OPN mRNA was conducted using actinomycin D.Results:Treatment of MHCC-97H and HepG2 cells with 2 μg/mL and 20 μg/mL EGCG caused a ∼6-fold and ∼90-fold decrease in secreted protein levels of OPN (All P Conclusion:We provide evidence that EGCG decreases OPN mRNA and secreted OPN protein levels by decreasing the half-life of OPN mRNA in MHCC-97H cells. The translatability of EGCG for patients with HCC is promising, because EGCG is an inexpensive, easily accessible chemical with an extensive history of safety.
