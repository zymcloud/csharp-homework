Cripto-1 could promote tumorigenesis in a wide range of carcinomas, yet little is known in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of Cripto-1 and MMP-9 were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 205 HCC specimens. The correlation between Cripto-1 and MMP-9, clinicopathological/prognostic value in HCC was examined. Cripto-1 overexpression was correlated with larger tumor, TNM stage, BCLC stage and tumor recurrence. In multivariate analyses, Cripto-1 was an independent predictor for overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR). Cripto-1 expression was increased in TNM and BCLC stage-dependent manner. Cripto-1 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in patients subgroups stratified by tumor size, tumor differentiation, TNM and BCLC stage. In addition, Cripto-1 was positively correlated with MMP-9 among 205 HCC samples. Patients with Cripto-1 upregulation had poor OS and shorter TTR in low and high aggressiveness groups. Furthermore, Cripto-1 had predictive validity for early and late recurrence in HCC patients. Combination of Cripto-1 and serum AFP was correlated with OS and TTR. In conclusion, Cripto-1 overexpression contributes to aggressiveness and poor prognosis of HCC. Cripto-1/AFP expression could be a potential prognostic biomarker for survival in HCC patients.
