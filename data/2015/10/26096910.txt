Background:The aim of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes and perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) with those of open liver resection (OLR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between well-matched patient groups.Methods:Hepatocellular carcinoma patients underwent primary liver resection between 2000 and 2010, were collected from 31 participating institutions in Japan and were divided into LLR (n = 436) and OLR (n = 2969) groups. A one-to-one propensity case-matched analysis was used with covariates of baseline characteristics, including tumor characteristics and surgical procedures of hepatic resections. Long-term and short-term outcomes were compared between the matched two groups.Results:The two groups were well balanced by propensity score matching and 387 patients were matched. There were no significant differences in overall survival and disease-free survival between LLR and OLR. The median blood loss (158 g vs. 400 g, P Conclusion:Compared with OLR, LLR in selected patients with HCC showed similar long-term outcomes, associated with less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and fewer postoperative complications.
