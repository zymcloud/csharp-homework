Variants of the Helicobacter pylori cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI) and certain virulence genotypes have been proposed to be associated with different gastric disorders. In the present study, we designed a new PCR-based strategy to investigate the intactness of cagPAI in Iranian patients using highly specific primer sets spanning the cagPAI region. The possible relationship between the cagPAI status of the strains and clinical outcomes was also determined. We also characterized virulence genotypes (cagL, cagA, vacA, babA2 and sabA) and variants of CagA EPIYA motifs in these strains. H. pylori was detected in 61 out of 126 patients with various gastroduodenal diseases. The cagL, cagA, vacA s1m1, vacA s1m2, vacA s2m2, babA2, and sabA genotypes were detected in 96.7%, 85.2%, 29.5%, 45.9%, 24.6%, 96.7%, and 83.6% of the strains, respectively. Among the 52 cagA-positive strains, EPIYA motifs ABC, ABCC, ABCCC, and mixed types were orderly detected in the 39, 7, 1, and 5 strains. The cagPAI positivity included both intact and partially deleted, with the overall frequencies of 70.5% and 26.2%, respectively. The majority of the strains from patients with PUD (87.5%), gastric erosion (83.3%) and cancer (80%) presented an intact cagPAI, while a lower frequency of cagPAI intactness was detected in gastritis patients (61.1%). However, no significant relationship was found between the possession of intact cagPAI and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we found that cagA and vacA s1m1 genotypes were significantly correlated with intact cagPAI (P=0.015 and P=0.012). A significant correlation was also found between EPIYA-ABC and intact cagPAI (P=0.010). The proposed PCR-based scheme was found to be useful for determining the intactness of cagPAI. Our findings also indicate that the cagPAI appears to be intact and rather conserved in majority of Iranian strains. Finally, our study proposed that H. pylori strains with partially deleted cagPAI were less likely to cause severe diseases in comparison with those carrying intact cagPAI.
