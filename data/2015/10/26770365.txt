Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common primary malignant tumors of the liver worldwide; however, despite its significance, there is a lack of treatment methods and clear prognoses. MicroRNA-9 (miR-9) is known to play an important role in tumor tumorigenesis and progression. Talin-1, which plays a significant role in regulating the transmutation of carcinoma, has been demonstrated to be downregulated by miR-9 in epithelial ovarian cancer. In the present study, we researched the potential role of miR-9 in the prognosis of HCC. The expression levels of miR-9 and Talin-1 mRNA in HCC tissues (n = 60), adjacent non-cancerous tissues (n = 60), and normal liver tissues (n = 20) were detected using a real-time quantitative assay; protein expression levels of Talin-1 were detected using western blot. The expression levels of miR-9 were significantly higher in HCC tissues (P
