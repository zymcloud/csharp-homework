Objectives:To assess and compare the accuracy and inter-observer agreement for the detection of liver lesions using Primovist magnetic resonance imaging (pMRI) and computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP).Methods:Patients evaluated at St George Hospital Liver Unit for colorectal liver metastases (CRCLM) underwent CTAP as part of standard staging. pMRI was added to the pre-operative assessment. Two radiologists reported CTAP and two reported pMRI. The sensitivity and specificity of CTAP and pMRI were calculated using histopathology as the gold standard.Results:Complete data were available for 62 patients corresponding to 219 lesions confirmed on histopathology. Agreement on the detection of lesions between the two radiologists that reported pMRI was higher than for CTAP (Kappa = 0.80 versus 0.74). Specificity of lesion detection for pMRI was 0.88 and 0.83 for CTAP (P = 0.112). Sensitivity for pMRI was 0.83 and 0.81 for CTAP. For patients who had chemotherapy before evaluation, pMRI had a significantly higher specificity than CTAP (0.79 versus 0.63, P = 0.011).Conclusions:pMRI is less invasive, has a good inter-observer agreement, has comparable sensitivity and specificity to CTAP in the pre-chemotherapy population and demonstrates better specificity in patients assessed post-chemotherapy. pMRI is a valid alternative to CTAP in the assessment of CRCLM.
