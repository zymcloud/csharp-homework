The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has progressively increased in recent years and is now the fifth and the second most common cancer in the World and in Egypt, respectively. Much work has focused in the development of assays for detecting hepatic carcinogensis before the observance of hepatic focal lesions. Particular attention has been directed towards HCC-specific biomarkers for use in the early diagnosis of HCC and in the confirmation of radiological studies. Although a number of biomarkers have been identified, none have been considered reliable indicators of early HCC lesions. This review presents a few of the most relevant HCC biomarkers and suggests improvements to the accuracy of diagnostic assays through their combined use. Furthermore, we present an algorithm for the biomarker-based diagnosis of HCC and highlight its important role in the early prediction of HCC.
