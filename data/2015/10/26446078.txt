Background:Sini-San (SNS) is a formulation of four Traditional Chinese Drugs that exhibits beneficial therapeutic effects in liver injury and hepatitis. However, there are no reports describing its effects on the hepatitis B X-protein (HBx)-induced invasion and metastasis in hepatoma cells, and the detailed molecular mechanisms of its actions are still unclear.Methods:In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying SNS-mediated inhibition of HBx-induced cell invasion and the inhibition of secreted and cytosolic MMP-9 production, using gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Relative luciferase activity was assessed for MMP-9, NF-κB, or AP-1 reporter plasmid-transfected cells.Results:SNS suppressed MMP-9 transcription by inhibiting activator protein (AP)-1 and nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB) activity. SNS suppressed HBx-induced AP-1 activity through inhibition of phosphorylation in the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. SNS also suppressed HBx-induced inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation through IκB and suppressed HBx-induced activation of ERK/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt upstream of NF-κB and AP-1.Conclusions:SNS suppresses the invasiveness and metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by inhibiting multiple signal transduction pathways.
