Objectives:Several studies revealed that the proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without hepatitis virus infection (NBNC-HCC) is increasing. On the other hand, epigenetic alterations are reportedly responsible for HCC development. Here, we identified HCC risk factors that are associated with DNA methylation in the background liver tissue of NBNC-HCC patients.Methods:We performed methylation analysis in 37 pairs of virus-positive and 22 pairs of NBNC-HCC and non-cancerous livers using a HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. After the selection of differentially methylated CpGs (DM-CpGs) in cancerous and non-cancerous livers, we analyzed DNA methylation of DM-CpGs within the adjacent non-cancerous liver tissue that is affected by specific HCC risk factors.Results:A total of 38,331 CpGs were selected as DM-CpGs using the following criteria: difference of β-value between HCC and non-cancerous liver ≥0.15 and false discovery rate (FDR) q Conclusions:Hepatitis viruses affect the methylation profiles within background liver tissues. However, difference in background methylation was mostly associated with age in NCBC-HCC patients; some age-related methylation events could contribute to emergence of NBNC-HCC in elderly individuals.
