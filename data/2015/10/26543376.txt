Transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE) is one of the most effective approaches for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who are not suitable for surgical therapy. Lidamycin (LDM), a potent antitumor antibiotic, demonstrates good antitumor efficacy in various tumor types, both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the antitumor efficacy of LDM combined with TOCE against the rabbit VX2 tumor was assessed. A toxicity assay with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) demonstrated that a combination of LDM with lipiodol did not impair the cytotoxicity of LDM against HepG2 cells in vitro. Using TOCE in rabbit VX2 tumor models, LDM showed a more powerful inhibitory effect against the tumor and lowered the expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared to Adriamycin (ADM); moreover, this improvement was not accompanied by an increase of hepatotoxicity as shown by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. These results suggested that LDM combined with TOCE may be a feasible strategy in HCC therapy in the future.
