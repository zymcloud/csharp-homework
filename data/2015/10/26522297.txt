Objective:To study the inhibition effect of siRNA on the expression of Wisp-1 gene in Hca-F of mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells strain and also its effect on the proliferation, migration and adhesion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Methods:Three expression vectors of siRNA were constructed. Lipo2000 was employed to transfect Hca-F cells and Western blot was used to detect the inhibition effect of siRNA on the expression of Wisp-1 gene. Afterward, CCK8 was adopted to detect the effect of Wisp-1 siRNA on the proliferation of Hca-F cells; Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining flow cytometry was used to detect the effect of Wisp-1 siRNA on the apoptosis of Hca-F cells; Transwell was used to detect the effect of Wisp-1 siRNA on the migration of Hca-F cells. The in vitro cell adhesion kit was used to detect of Wisp-1 siRNA on the change in the components of extracellular matrix to which Hca-F cells adhered. Western blot was used to detect the activation of protein kinase B (AKT)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathway and the expression of downstream target protein p53 and matrix metalloproteinases-2.Results:The siRNA showed interference effect on the expression of Wisp-1 gene. Compared with the control group, after being transfected to cells, Wisp-1 siRNA could significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration and adhesion of Hca-F cells and also promote the cell apoptosis, which was related to the down-regulated phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase-3β and the expression of p53 and matrix metalloproteinases-2 (P Conclusions:The inhibition of Wisp-1 expression can reduce the proliferation, migration and adhesion of mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which is related to the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase-3β pathway. Wisp-1 gene may be the potential target to cure the hepatocellular carcinoma.
