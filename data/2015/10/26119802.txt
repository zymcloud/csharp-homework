Purpose:To compare low b value (10s/mm(2)) spin-echo echo-planar (SE-EP) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquired with respiratory-triggering (RT), triggering and tracking navigator (TT), tracking only navigator (TRON) techniques for image quality and focal liver lesions (FLL) detection in non-cirrhotic patients.Material and methods:This bi-centric study was approved by the institutional review boards; informed consent was obtained. Eighty-three patients were prospectively included and SE-EP-DWI with RT, TT and TRON techniques were performed. DWI sequences were randomized and independently analyzed by two readers. The qualitative evaluation was based on a 3-point score for axial artifacts (motion, ghost, susceptibility artifacts and distortion) and stair-step artifacts. Sensitivity of FLL detection was calculated for all lesions together and after lesion size stratification (â‰¤ 10 mm, >10-20mm and >20mm). The standard of reference consisted of a retrospective reading of the conventional MRI, the three DWI sequences and by follow-up (12 months): a total of 409 FLL were detected. Data between sequences was compared with non-parametric tests. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used for inter-observer agreement.Results:Image quality was comparable for RT and TT. TRON showed statistically significantly more axial artifacts for the two readers (pConclusion:Image quality was better for RT and TT compared to TRON. Overall sensitivities for FLL detection were comparable between techniques and readers.
