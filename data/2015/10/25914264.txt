Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly associated with inflammation. Myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, are abundant in the HCC microenvironment and are often associated with poor prognosis. Myeloid cells in HCC play a vital role in supporting tumor initiation, progression, angiogenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Here, we summarize our current knowledge about myeloid cells in HCC and focus on their immune-suppressive activities and tumor-promoting functions, as well as the relevance to potential new therapies in HCC.
