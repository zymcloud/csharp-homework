Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Interferon-alpha (IFN-Î±) has recently been recognized to harbor therapeutic potential in prevention and treatment of HCC. IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is an ubiquitin-like molecule that is strongly upregulated by type I interferons as a primary response to diverse microbial and cellular stress stimuli. Several studies have shown that the overexpression of ISG15 is correlated with multiply tumor types. However, the role of ISG15 in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC remains undetermined. ISG15 expression was found to be obviously higher in HBV-related HCC tissues than that in non-tumor tissues. ISG15 is a novel prognostic marker for predicting 5-year overall survival of HBV-related HCC patients. Overexpression of ISG15 was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and poor patient outcomes. ISG15 may serve as a novel prognostic marker for HBV-related HCC. Therefore, ISG15 may represent a novel HCC marker with prognostic significance and may be helpful in selecting patients for and predicting response to the treatment of HBV-related HCC.
