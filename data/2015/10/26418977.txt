OBJECTIVE To assess the association of copy number variations (CNVs) in chromosome 17q with the overall survival(OS) of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), and to screen for target genes contained in the OS-related CNVs. METHODS A total of 174 HCC cases were enrolled. For 66 patients, the follow-up data was available. High-resolution Agilent Hu-244A array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays were used to detect CNVs and gene expression of genes from the 17q region, respectively. The association of CNVs and OS was assessed with Log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models. The gene expression in HCCs with 17q gain, HCCs without, and non-tumor liver tissues were compared with a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS Univariate association analysis showed that copy number gain in 17q25.1-25.3 was significantly associated with reduced OS (Log-rank test, P = 0.00002), and HCC cases with 17q25.1-25.3 gain had a 4.76-fold (95%CI: 2.31-9.81) increased hazard ratio (HR) for death from HCC, as compared to those without the gain. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed 17q25.1-25.3 gain to be an independent prognostic marker for poor OS (HR = 3.17, 95%CI: 1.39-7.26, P = 0.006). The expression levels of 18 genes in 17q25.1-25.3 including SLC9A3R1, GRB2, and TK1 were significantly increased in HCCs with gain than in those without (all P
