Association of Notch-1 expression with prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to reevaluate the association of Notch-1 expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of HCC. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched to look for relevant studies. The association between Notch-1 expression and clinicopathological parameters and overall survival (OS) was then reassessed using the meta-analysis for odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of seven studies, including 810 HCC patients, were eligible for the meta-analysis. Our data showed that high Notch-1 expression was able to predict poor OS (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17-1.83, P=0.0001). The pooled OR showed that high Notch-1 expression was significantly associated with tumor metastasis (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.86, P=0.02) and tumor size >5 cm (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.88, P=0.02). In contrast, there was no association between high Notch-1 expression and tumor differentiation, late TNM stage, tumor number, and portal vein invasion of HCC. In conclusion, Notch-1 overexpression might predict poorer survival and more aggressive behavior in patients with HCC.
