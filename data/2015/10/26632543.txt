Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a minimally invasive procedure to restrict a tumor's blood supply, and TACE has an established role in cancer therapy. An embolic material in the form of microspheres (such as drug-eluting beads) and transarterial radioembolization is effective at treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Endovascular therapy offers promise for the treatment of tumor thrombi in the portal vein. Many researchers are anticipating an era of TACE with microspheres. This review aims to provide an overview of advances in endovascular therapy to treat primary HCC.
