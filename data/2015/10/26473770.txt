Background:This study aims to assess if radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has any oncological superiority over transarterial chemoembolization(TACE) on post-hepatectomy recurrence.Methods:From 2002 to 2011, 60.15% of 823 patients developed recurrence after hepatectomy for HCC. One hundred and two patients with recurrence underwent RFA (n = 42) or TACE (n = 60) for tumour size ≤5 cm and number of lesions ≤ 3 when tumours were not resectable or transplantable. Those with renal impairment, portal vein thrombosis and poor liver reserve were excluded. The primary outcome was overall survival, which was determined using log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier plots performed. Categorical data were analysed using the chi-square test and continuous variable were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test.Results:Demographics and primary tumour characteristics were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Overall survival (OS) after an initial hepatectomy and salvage treatment for recurrence was similar (P > 0.05) in both groups with a 5-year OS after salvage treatment for RFA and TACE at 24.1% and 25.7%, respectively. For patients with the second recurrence after salvage treatment, an interchangeable treatment strategy of RFA and TACE conferred a better survival outcome than a stand-alone treatment with RFA or TACE (P Conclusions:RFA and TACE may be equally effective for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy when the tumour size is ≤ 5 cm and ≤ 3 lesions when re-resection or salvage transplantation is not considered feasible.
