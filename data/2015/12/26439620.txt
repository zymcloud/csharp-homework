A 68-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of left upper quadrant pain. Contrast enhanced computed tomography showed a low density mass with delayed contrast effects as well as para-aortic node swelling with homogenous contrast effects. Histological examination of specimens obtained by endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration revealed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) G2, according to the World Health Organization 2010 classification, and lymph node metastasis. Distal pancreatectomy and lymph node dissection were performed. On histological examination, the tumor showed well-differentiated morphology with an organoid pattern. The Ki67 labeling index was 21.6 %, and the mitotic count was 25/10 high power fields. As mentioned above, we made a final diagnosis of the lesion as "NET G3," because the tumor presented with well-differentiated morphology. Chemotherapy with Everolimus was administered. Liver metastasis occurred 11 months after the first operation, and a partial hepatectomy was performed. Histological findings were similar to those of the first operation. Herein we present a case of pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with a high proliferative rate referred to as "NET G3," and review the relevant literature.
