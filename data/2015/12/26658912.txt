Background:Needle core biopsy (NCB) is one of the most widely used and accepted methods for the diagnosis of focal hepatic lesions. Although many studies have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of NCB in predicting the tumor grade, it is still under debate.Objective:To identify the influence of number of biopsies on NCB diagnostic accuracy.Methods:153 patients with HCC were selected from patients who received preoperative NCB under the guidance of ultrasonography in our hospital. The diagnostic reference standard was the surgical pathologic diagnosis.Results:Using a 3-tier grading scheme (well, moderate and poor), the accuracy of NCB has no significant differences among different number of passes in HCC ≤5 cm. For HCC >5≤8 cm, the increasing number of passes could increase the diagnostic accuracy (63.3%, 81.8%, and 84.8% for passes one, two, and three, respectively). While in HCC>8 cm, the diagnostic accuracy of passes one, two, and three were 62.1%, 69%, and 75.8%, respectively.Conclusions:The accuracy of NCB in assessing tumor grading associated with tumor size and number of passes. Meanwhile, a minimum of two passes should be performed to get better accuracy in patients with HCC >5 cm.
