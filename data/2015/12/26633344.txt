Three series of curcumin derivatives including phosphorylated, etherified, and esterified products of curcumin were synthesized, and their anti-tumor activities were assessed against human breast cancer MCF-7, hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2, and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Compared with curcumin, compounds 3, 8, and 9 exhibited stronger antitumor cell line growth activities against HeLa cells. Compound 12 also showed higher antitumor cell line growth activities on MCF-7 cells than curcumin. Among them, 4-((1E,6E)-7-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3,5-dioxohepta-1,6-dienyl)-2-methoxyphenyl dihydrogen phosphate(3) showed the strongest activity with an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6.78 µM against HeLa cells compared with curcumin with an IC50 of 17.67 µM. Stabilities of representatives of the three series were tested in rabbit plasma in vitro, and compounds 3 and 4 slowly released curcumin in plasma. The effect of compound 3 on HeLa cell apoptosis was determined by examining morphological changes by DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining as well as Annexin V-FITC/ Propidium Iodide (PI) double staining and flow cytometry. The results showed that 3 induced cellular apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Together our findings show that 3 merits further investigation as a new potential antitumor drug candidate.
