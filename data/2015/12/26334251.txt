Background:Delayed postoperative arterial bleeding is rare and may be life-threatening. When the bleeding source is the hepatic artery, complete ligation or embolization from the proximal to the distal area of the ruptured lesion usually results in complete occlusion of hepatic arterial flow.Methods:To evaluate the frequency and severity of ischemic liver injury following complete hepatic artery occlusion, a retrospective study was conducted. Patients who underwent complete hepatic artery occlusion in the treatment of delayed postoperative arterial bleeding between January 2007 and December 2014 in our institution were reviewed. Changes of hepatic function and rates of associated complications and prognosis were analyzed.Results:A total of 24 patients experienced 26 episodes of bleeding. Nineteen experienced transient liver enzyme elevation alone. There were no signs of acute liver failure after complete hepatic artery occlusion. The rates of liver infarction and liver abscess were 23.8 % (5/21) and 19 % (4/21), respectively. The 30-day mortality rate was 8.3 % (2/24).Conclusion:Complete occlusion of the hepatic artery does not always result in severe hepatic ischemic injury. As a common cause of delayed postoperative bleeding, intra-abdominal infection may be fatal when it is not controlled successfully.
