Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health burden in Europe, being one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Properties of the HCV disease burden are heterogeneous across the European continent, with differences in incidence, prevalence, diagnosis and treatment rates, transmission routes, and genotype distribution. Recent estimates expect an increase in HCV-related morbidity and mortality in most European countries until 2030 even when current treatment options are taken into account. The European perspective on hepatitis C virus infection is summarized herein.
Cirrhosis; Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA); European guidelines; Hepatitis C virus (HCV); Interferon-free.
