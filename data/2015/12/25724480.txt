Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a disease composed of different risk factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes or dyslipidemia. The prevalence of this syndrome is increasing worldwide in parallel with the rise in obesity. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most frequent chronic liver disease in western countries, affecting more than 30% of the general population. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver manifestations ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis, which may ultimately progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. There is accumulating evidence supporting an association between NAFLD and MetS. Indeed, NAFLD is recognized as the liver manifestation of MetS. Insulin resistance is increasingly recognized as a key factor linking MetS and NAFLD. Insulin resistance is associated with excessive fat accumulation in ectopic tissues, such as the liver, and increased circulating free fatty acids, which can further promote inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. This in turn aggravates and maintains the insulin resistant state, constituting a vicious cycle. Importantly, evidence shows that most of the patients developing NAFLD present at least one of the MetS traits. This review will define MetS and NAFLD, provide an overview of the common pathophysiological mechanisms linking MetS and NAFLD, and give a perspective regarding treatment of these ever growing metabolic diseases.
