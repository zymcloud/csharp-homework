Aim:The assessment of renal function is of vital importance in management of patients with cirrhosis. While serum creatinine (Cr) is routinely used for this purpose, Cr-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) does not reflect true renal function because of muscle wasting and impaired liver function. By contrast, cystatin C (CysC) is unrelated to muscle volume and liver function. In this study, we examined whether CysC-based GFR estimation is beneficial in assessment of renal function in patients with cirrhosis.Methods:First, we assessed the performance of GFR-predicting equations based on serum Cr or CysC in 14 patients with cirrhosis, by comparison with inulin clearance as a gold standard of GFR (measured GFR [mGFR]). Next, in 49 patients with cirrhosis, we examined serum Cr and CysC at baseline, and examined which GFR-predicting equations were more suitable for predicting the outcome.Results:In the first experiment, mGFR was 54.3 Â± 23.0 mL/min, and CysC-based GFR-estimating equations had better performances compared with Cr-based equations in terms of bias, precision and accuracy. Cr-based estimated GFR (eGFRcreat) was significantly different from mGFR (P Conclusion:These results suggest that eGFRcys could estimate renal function and predict outcome more accurately compared with Cr-based eGFR in cirrhotic patients.
