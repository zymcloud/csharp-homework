Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality and continues to increase. Current standard of care for patients with HCC only provides limited therapeutic benefit. Development of innovative strategies is urgently needed. Experience with immunotherapy in HCC is quite early, but rapidly rise in the recent 15 years. Multifaceted immune-based approaches have shown efficacy in achieving disease regression, representing the most promising new treatment approach. Here, we classify the ongoing or completed clinical trials in HCC in terms of the immune strategies to be used and assess their clinical outcomes. The generated information may be helpful in the design of future immune-based therapies for achieving ideal tumor control and maximizing anti-tumor immunity.
