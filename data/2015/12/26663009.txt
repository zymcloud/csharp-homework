Background:It has been found that microRNA-423-5p (miR423-5p) is an oncogenic factor and frequently upregulated in gastric carcinoma. However, the involvement of miR423-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been rarely reported. The aim of this study was to assess whether miR423-5p is aberrantly expressed in HCC tissues, and to characterize its roles in the cancerous biology of HCC.Methods:HCC and corresponding nonmalignant tissues were obtained from 115 patients during liver transplantation to detect the expression level of miR423-5p. The miR423-5p mimic and inhibitor were transfected into LM3 cell line. Cell viability assay, cell cycle analysis, transwell invasion and migration experiments were used to evaluate the oncogenic role of miR423-5p.Results:miR423-5p was significantly upregulated in HCC compared with nonmalignant tissues, and this upregulation was negatively associated with recurrence-free survival. For patients beyond the Milan criteria, low expression of miR423-5p was correlated with better prognosis. Functional analysis showed that miR423-5p enhanced the proliferative, invasive and migratory capacity of HCC cells.Conclusions:miR423-5p contributed to the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. It could be a new predictor in HCC patients beyond the Milan criteria and would help to improve patient outcomes and enlarge recipient pools of liver transplantation.
