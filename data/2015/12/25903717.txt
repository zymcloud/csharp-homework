Objectives:To introduce a modified transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, percutaneous transhepatic balloon-assisted TIPS (BA-TIPS), and to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy in patients with chronic totally occluded portal vein thrombosis (CTO-PVT) with symptomatic portal hypertension.Methods:Eighteen patients (12 men, six women; mean age 49 years [range, 34-68 years]) with CTO-PVT with symptomatic portal hypertension undergoing BA-TIPS between July 2011 and June 2014 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Rates of technical success, efficacy, and complications were evaluated, and pre- and post-procedure portosystemic gradients compared. Clinical follow-up and periodic assessment of TIPS for patency were performed.Results:BA-TIPS was successful in fourteen patients and converted to open portosystemic shunt placement in four. Mean portosystemic pressure gradient fell from 24.1 ± 2.3 mmHg to 12.1 ± 3.5 mmHg after BA-TIPS (P Conclusions:BA-TIPS is feasible, safe, and effective for CTO-PVT with symptomatic portal hypertension.Key points:• Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is an important treatment for portal vein thrombosis (PVT). • TIPS is challenging for patients with chronic totally occluded portal vein thrombosis (CTO-PVT). • The use of a balloon increased the technical success of portal puncture. • Balloon-assisted TIPS (BA-TIPS) is feasible, safe, and effective for CTO-PVT.
