An 81-year-old man was referred to our department because of suspected factor VII (FVII) deficiency. His FVII activity was under 1%, whereas the FVII activity levels of his son and granddaughter were 65 and 109%, respectively. The nucleotide at position 3886 of his FVII gene was homozygous for G. A single T to G substitution results in the replacement of wild-type Cys at residue 22 by Gly. His son was heterozygous for G and T at position 3886, whereas his granddaughter was homozygous for wild-type T. These results suggest that he was homozygous for FVII Cys22Gly. He underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma, receiving 20 μg/kg of recombinant FVIIa prior to RFA and 10 μg/kg of recombinant FVIIa twice after RFA. He showed no bleeding tendency; however, a myocardial infarction was diagnosed and percutaneous coronary intervention was performed.
