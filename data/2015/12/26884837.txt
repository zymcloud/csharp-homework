The incidence and mortality of liver cancer increased year by year. Our country presents high incidence of liver cancer. MicroRNAs have tissue sensitivity as tumor biomarkers that play a role by promoting tumor growth as oncogenes or inhibit malignant cell growth as tumor suppressor genes. Studies showed that miR-15b abnormal expression in the tumor and can be treated as one of the tumor molecular markers. However, miR-15b expression and role in the liver cancer cells have not been elucidated. This study intended to explore the mechanism of miR-15b effect on liver cancer occurrence and development. Liver cancer cell line HepG2 was transfected with miR-15b mimic or inhibitor. Real-time PCR was applied to detect miR-15b expression. MTT was used to test cell proliferation. Transwell assay was performed to determine cell invasive ability. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect BCL2 expression. MiR-15b mimic transfection promoted miR-15b overexpression and inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation significantly (P 0.05). MiR-15b can inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation and down-regulate BCL2 mRNA and protein expression.
