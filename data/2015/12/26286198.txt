Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with sarcomatous change (SC) is a rare malignancy associated with high aggressiveness and poor prognosis; however, its prognostic significance remains unclear.Methods:From January 1994 to April 2012, surgically resected HCCs with SC (n = 52) at West China Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. HCC with SC was defined as the concomitant presence of the sarcomatous component occupying at least 10 % (but not predominantly) of the HCC-bearing tissue. To validate its prognostic significance, we compared the clinicopathological features and survival rates of these patients with a cohort of 214 randomly selected ordinary HCC patients during the same period.Results:The clinicopathological characteristics of HCC with SC were similar to those of ordinary HCC, with the exception of capsule formation, adjacent organ invasion, lymph node metastasis, and TNM staging. A total of 45 (86.5 %) HCC patients with SC experienced a recurrence, with a median time to recurrence of 6.0 months. Overall survival (OS) rates in the sarcomatous HCC group at 1, 2, and 3 years were 55.8, 25, and 17.3 %, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the ordinary HCC group (p Conclusions:The presence of SC in HCC was uncommon, and was associated with much poorer prognosis than ordinary HCC. Radical resection with negative margin is essential for improving the prognosis. Future prospective studies are warranted to determine if recurrent patients can benefit from postoperative adjuvant therapies.
