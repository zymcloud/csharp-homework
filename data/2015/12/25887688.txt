Background:The role of CD44v6 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. To clarify the association of CD44v6 with survival in HCC, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature with meta-analysis.Methods:Trials were selected for further analysis if they provided an independent assessment of CD44v6 in HCC and reported the survival data in the context of CD44v6 status. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the patient's disease stage, IHC cut-off value, and ethnicity.Results:A total of nine trials, which comprised 942 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The combined hazard ratio (HR) of 2.13 [95% CI, 1.58-2.88; test for heterogeneity P=0.061] suggests that high CD44v6 expression has an impact on patient survival. When the studies were restricted to Chinese patients, high levels of CD44v6 expression were correlated with reduced survival (HR 2.27, 95% CI=1.79-2.86; P=0.544 for heterogeneity). In addition, the heterogeneity disappeared when the analysis was restricted to Chinese.Conclusion:CD44v6 expression is associated with poor prognosis for Chinese HCC patients.
