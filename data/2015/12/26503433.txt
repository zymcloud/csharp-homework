A method for the detection of fucosylated glycans from haptoglobin in patient serum has been developed that provides enhanced sensitivity. The workflow involves isolation of the haptoglobin using an HPLC-based affinity column followed by glycan removal, extraction, and desialylation. The fucosylated glycans are then derivatized by Meladrazine, which significantly enhances the detection of the glycans in electrospray ionization. The separation of the derivatized glycans in a HILIC column shows that eight glycans from haptoglobin can be detected using less than 1 μL of a serum sample, with excellent reproducibility and quantitation, where without derivatization the glycans could not be detected. The ratio of the fucosylated peaks to their corresponding nonfucosylated forms shows that the fucosylated glycans are upregulated in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples versus cirrhosis samples, where the relatively low abundance bifucosylated tetra-antennary form can be detected and may be a particularly good marker for HCC.
