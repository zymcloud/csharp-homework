Case description:A 16-year-old 6.8-kg (15-lb) castrated male domestic shorthair cat was evaluated because of a 3 Ã— 6-cm mass in the right medial lobe of the liver.Clinical findings:The cat had a history of frequent vomiting and anorexia along with 10% weight loss over the past year.Treatment and outcome:Transcatheter arterial embolization was selected because surgery (standard first-line treatment) was declined and only 1 vessel feeding the tumor was apparent on contrast-enhanced CT. A 4F sheath was placed in the left carotid artery, and a 3.3F guide catheter was advanced into the celiac artery. A 0.014-inch guidewire and 1.7F microcatheter were inserted into the hepatic artery through the guiding catheter and advanced into the feeding vessel. A mixture of polyvinyl alcohol particles and contrast agent was injected for embolization. A hypoechoic area in the tumor was identified on ultrasonography on posttreatment day 6, and necrotic and degenerated cells in the area were identified cytologically. By posttreatment day 71, vomiting had resolved and CT revealed decreased tumor size, but altered attenuation suggested a more solid mass on day 205. No feeding vessel for embolization was found on contrast-enhanced CT, so ultrasonic emulsification to remove the tumor was performed on day 231. No recurrence was seen on contrast-enhanced CT on day 420 or day 721.Clinical relevance:Findings suggested that transcatheter arterial embolization may be suitable for treating hepatic tumors in cats, but alternative approaches are needed in cats, compared with dogs, owing to anatomic differences.
