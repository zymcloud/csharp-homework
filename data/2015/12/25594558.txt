Aim:Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are known to be involved in alternative pre-mRNA splicing, RNA metabolism and cancer development. SRrp35 is a member of this family that antagonizes classical SR proteins in the regulation of splicing. However, the function of SRRP35 in cancer remains unclear to date. This study aims to investigate SRrp35 function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:SRrp35 expression was accessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 32 pairs of clinical HCC samples and 12 kinds of HCC cell lines. The biological roles of Srrp35 were analyzed using cell viability, colony formation and soft agar growth assays in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice model.Results:SRrp35 was frequently downregulated in 62.5% (20/32) of HCC specimens and most of HCC cell lines. Enhanced expression of SRrp35 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation in an anchor-dependent and -independent manner, whereas knockdown of SRrp35 by RNA inference resulted in the opposite effects. In vivo, SRrp35 plays a suppressive role in developing tumor xenografts in line with the function in vitro.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that SRrp35 suppresses cell proliferation and malignancy in HCC and could be a potential therapeutic target for this disease.
