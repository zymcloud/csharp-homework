CLKT and sequential KALT are decided on a case-by-case basis in children for special indications such as ARPKD or PH1. We report on 21 children who underwent CLKT or KALT at our hospital between 1998 and 2013. Eleven children were diagnosed with PH1 and six with ARPKD. Other diagnosis were Joubert syndrome (n = 1), nephronophthisis (n = 1), CF (n = 1), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1). Children (12 males, nine females) were aged 7.8 ± 6.2 yr (range, 10 months to 18 yr) at time of transplantation. Average wait time was 1.9 ± 0.9 yr (range, four months to 2.3 yr). Fifteen patients received dialysis prior to transplantation. In PH1 patients, four children received CLKT, five received KALT, and two infants have received only an LTx, whereas all six patients with ARPKD received CLKT. In patients with other indications, CLKT was performed in three cases and KALT in one girl. Cumulative 10-yr survival of all 21 patients was 78.4%. At the time of transfer into adult care, 13 patients retained stable liver and kidney function. Regardless the underlying diagnosis, CLKT and KALT can be performed in children with good surgical outcomes and long-term survival.
