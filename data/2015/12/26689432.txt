Background:Oncolytic virus which arms the therapeutic gene to enhance anti-tumor activity is a prevalent strategy to improve oncovirotherapy of cancer. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a naturally oncolytic virus used for cancer therapy. Previously, we generated a mouse-human chimeric HAb18 antibody (cHAb18) against tumor-associated antigen CD147 and demonstrated the inhibition of invasion and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Here, we constructed a recombinant NDV carrying intact cHAb18 gene (rNDV-18HL) based on Italien strain using a reverse genetics system.Method:Recombinant rNDV-18HL was generated using reverse genetics technology. The characteristics of virally expressed cHAb18 antibody were identified by western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, transwell invasion assay, and surface plasmon resonance technology. The biodistribution of recombinant rNDV-18HL using orthotopic xenograft mouse model was assessed with living imaging and immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test were performed to analyze the anti-tumor activity of rNDV-18HL.Results:The cHAb18 was produced in rNDV-18HL-infected cells followed by releasing into the supernatant by cytolysis. The rNDV-18HL-encoded cHAb18 antibody kept affinity for CD147 and showed inhibiting the migration and invasion of HCC cells. Viral replication and virulence were not attenuated by the incorporation of cHAb18 gene which significantly enhanced the suppression of relict tumor cell migration. The rNDV-18HL selectively replicated in orthotopic HCC xenografts leading to cHAb18 expression in situ, which induced the tumor necrosis, reduced the intrahepatic metastasis, and prolonged the survival in mice.Conclusions:This study provides a new strategy of arming oncolytic NDV with therapeutic antibody to enhance anti-tumor efficacy of cancer therapy.
