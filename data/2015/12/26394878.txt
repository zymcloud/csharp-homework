The impact of the tumor location on the outcome after hepatic resection (HR) in multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of HR patients with multifocal tumors meeting the Milan criteria and tumors located in the same or different sections. A total of 219 consecutive HR patients with multifocal tumors meeting the Milan criteria were divided into group SS (n = 97; same section) and group DS (n = 122; different sections) according to their anatomical location (Couinaud's segmentation). The prognostic predictors were evaluated, and a subgroup analysis was performed. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were significantly higher in group SS than group DS. The subgroup analysis showed that patients with two tumors in the same section and patients undergoing en bloc resection had better OS and RFS. A multivariate analysis revealed that tumors located in different sections and macrovascular invasion were independent predictors of poor prognosis. In HCC patients with multifocal tumors meeting the Milan criteria, tumors located in the same hepatic section may lead to better long-term survival and lower HCC recurrence rates than tumors in different sections after HR.
