Liver resection for patients with cirrhosis remains a challenging operation. The presence of thrombocytopenia and portal hypertension could lead to severe bleeding during hepatectomy. The enthusiasm of laparoscopic hepatectomy has been growing and many studies have reported their initial favorable results for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The advancement in technology, better understanding of the use of pneumoperitoneum pressure and more experience accumulated make laparoscopic liver resection for patients with cirrhosis possible. Favorable outcome may be achieved if the patients are carefully selected and carried out in high volume centers.
