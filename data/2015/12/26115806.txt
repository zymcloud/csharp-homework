Background:Although the short-term adverse effects of sorafenib are well known, few data exist on long-term toxicity. The objective of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of pancreatic atrophy among a cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were treated with sorafenib for ≥2 y.Methods:Between March 2007 and December 2013, 31 patients with HCC who were treated with sorafenib for ≥2 y were identified. The effect of pancreatic atrophy and enhancement on incidence of adverse events, tumor response, and overall survival (OS) were assessed.Results:Thirty-one patients with HCC were treated with sorafenib for ≥2 y and met inclusion criteria; 11 patients (35.5%) were Barcelona-clinic liver cancer stage B, whereas 20 patients (64.5%) were Barcelona-clinic liver cancer stage C. Median duration of treatment with sorafenib was 35.2 mo. Pancreatic atrophy and a decrease in pancreatic enhancement occurred in 24 patients (77.4%) and 15 patients (48.4%), respectively. On the basis of the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, four patients (12.9%) had a complete response, 10 patients (32.3%) had a partial response, and 17 patients (54.8%) had stable disease. Patients treated with sorafenib with pancreatic atrophy had a median OS of 49.4 mo (95% confidence interval, 41.2-57.5 mo) compared with 31.2 mo (95% confidence interval, 25.7-36.7 mo) among patients who did not develop pancreatic atrophy (P = 0.009). In contrast, survival was not associated with decreased versus normal enhancement of the pancreas (OS, 47.7 mo versus 41.7 mo, respectively; P = 0.739).Conclusions:Pancreatic atrophy occurred in many HCC patients after 2 y of treatment with sorafenib. Patients who experienced pancreatic atrophy had a better tumor response and OS.
