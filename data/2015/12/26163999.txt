We investigated the association between serum interleukin (IL)-8 levels and post-transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) outcomes in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC. We enrolled 119 TACE-treated patients with HBV-associated HCC; TACE refractoriness and liver transplantation (LT)-free survival were evaluated during follow-up. Pre-TACE serum levels of various cytokines (epidermal growth factor [EGF], fibroblast growth factor 2, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF], interferon-γ, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17A, interferon-γ-inducible protein-10, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-α and vascular endothelial growth factor) were analyzed. During a mean follow-up of 24.3 (1-79) months, 91 patients (76.5%) exhibited TACE refractoriness. In multivariate analyses, multiple tumors (hazard ratio [HR], 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.39; P=0.006), large tumor size (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.38-4.03; P=0.002), and combination of alpha-fetoprotein and IL-8 levels (AFP>400 ng/mL or IL-8>32 pg/mL; HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.03-2.85; P=0.037) independently predicted overall TACE refractoriness. Higher EGF (>35 pg/mL) and lower G-CSF levels (⩽ 12.5 pg/mL) were associated with early TACE refractoriness (32 pg/mL; HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.09-2.59; P=0.020) was associated with poor LT-free survival. In conclusion, pretreatment serum IL-8 is a useful prognostic marker for TACE refractoriness and LT-free survival in TACE-treated patients with HBV-associated HCC.
