Aim:To study the correcting effects of microgranulated HSGD enterosorbent on hematological, morphological and biochemical indices of paraneoplastic syndrome in mice with highly angiogenic variant of Lewis lung carcinoma LLC/R9.Methods:The study was performed on male С57/ВL6 mice with transplanted LLC/R9. Enterosorbent HSGD was administered daily at a dose of 0.625 g/kg for 2 weeks starting from 7(th) day after tumor cell transplantation. When enterosorption was completed, an analysis of peripheral blood, biochemical indices and morphological structure of tumor, lung, liver, spleen and thymus was carried out by standard methods.Results:It has been shown that administration of enterosorbent did not affect LLC/R9 growth but resulted in nearly two fold decrease of the volume of lung metastases (p < 0.05). Erythrocyte number and hemoglobin level were higher by 30.0% (p < 0.05) and 23.3% (p < 0.05), respectively, in mice treated with enterosorbents as compared to untreated animals. In addition sorbent treatment completely normalized the thrombocyte index resulting in elevation of platelet number by 54.5% (p < 0.01) up to their level in intact mice. The morphological examination of liver and biochemical analysis of peripheral blood evidenced on significant positive correcting effect of enterosorption on histological structure of this organ and its functional activity. Normalization of total proteins and serum albumin level as well as significant decrease of total lipid concentration by 29% (p < 0.01) in blood of treated mice were observed.Conclusion:Positive influence of microgranulated carbon sorbent on some hematological, morphological and biochemical indices of tumor associated symptoms in LLC/R9-bearing mice denotes that enterosorption-based therapy can be considered as a prospective treatment for correction of some paraneoplastic syndrome signs in cancer patients.
