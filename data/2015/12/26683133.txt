This retrospective study investigated the clinical application of sequential therapy with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using a bipolar needle in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors of different sizes. The study included patients (N = 46) with HCC from Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University who had received TACE and RFA from November 2012 to November 2013. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-1, a Child-Pugh grade of A-B, and no contradictions for TACE and/or RFA. Fifty one hepatic lesions of varying sizes were treated with TACE followed by RFA. Clinical response and 1- and 2-year survival rates were assessed. The frequency of complete and incomplete ablation following therapy was significantly different across the varying RFA pin numbers and the maximum diameter of the lesion (p ≤ 0.001). A greater percentage (97.3%) of lesions that were ≤3 cm in diameter were completely ablated compared with lesions that were 3-5 cm (88.9%) and >5 cm in diameter (20%). The median survival time of patients was 16.5 months, and the 1- and 2-year survival rates were 95.7% and 69.3%, respectively. There were only a limited number of complications, all of which were minor. These included hemothorax (4.3%), abdominal hemorrhage (10.9%), and abdominal hemorrhage with minor pneumothorax (2.2%). This study found that the sequential treatment with TACE and CT-guided RFA using a bipolar needle is effective and well tolerated in patients with HCC and that the effectiveness of treatment is dependent on tumor size.
