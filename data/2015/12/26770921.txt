Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using doxorubicin-eluting beads (DEBs) have been introduced as a novel device which ensures more sustained and tumor-selective drug delivery and permanent embolization compared to conventional TACE with lipiodol. Studies highlighting the use of TACE with DEBs for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have shown similar or better results compared to conventional TACE with lipiodol. TACE with DEBs is increasingly being performed interchangeably with conventional TACE. This review assessed the characteristics, clinical outcomes and future direction of TACE with DEBs compared to conventional TACE.
