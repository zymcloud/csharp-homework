Increased peritumoral ductular reaction (DR) is related to poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but the mechanism is unclear. Nuclear translocation of β-catenin is correlated with HCC metastasis and recurrence. Thus, we aim to explore whether there is a relationship between peritumoral DR and tumoral nuclear translocation of β-catenin in HCC. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients (n=120) were enrolled into this study from January 2003 to December 2007. Clinicopathological variables were collected and immunohistochemistry staining for cytokeratin 19 (CK19), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), β-catenin, phosphorylated-Smad2 (PSmad2) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were performed in tumor and/or peritumor liver tissues. Peritumoral DR is significantly correlated with local inflammation (P
