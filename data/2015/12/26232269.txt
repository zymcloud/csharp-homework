Background & aims:The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of ablative margin (AM) grading by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Gd-EOB-DTPA administered prior to radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and to identify factors for achieving a sufficient AM and predictors for local tumor progression.Methods:A total of 124 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were treated by RFA after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration. MRI and enhanced CT were performed within seven hours and one month after RFA. The AM assessment was categorized using three grades: AM (+), low-intensity area with continuous high-intensity rim; AM zero, low-intensity area with discontinuous high-intensity rim; and AM (-), low-intensity area extends beyond the high-intensity rim. Patients were followed and local tumor progression was observed.Results:AM (+), AM zero, AM (-), and indeterminate were found in 34, 33, 26, and 31 nodules, respectively. The overall agreement rate between MRI and enhanced CT for the diagnosis of AM was 56.8%. The Îº coefficient was 0.326 (pConclusion:Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI enabled an early assessment of RFA effectiveness in the majority ofHCC nodules. Local tumor progression was not detected in AM (+) nodules during the follow-up.
