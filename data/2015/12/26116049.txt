Background:The risk factors for incisional hernia (IH) and the association between liver fibrosis and IH after hepatic resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with liver cirrhosis (LC) are still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the rate of IH and to assess the effect of perioperative factors, including serum markers for liver fibrosis, on the risk of IH.Methods:A total of 192 patients with HCC with LC who received hepatectomy were retrospectively analyzed. The primary end point was the incidence rate of IH and the secondary end points were associations between IH and 22 clinical factors.Results:IH was diagnosed in 60 (31.3%) patients. The estimated incidence rates were 19.8% at 12 months, 32.5% at 36 months, and 38.8% at 60 months. In multivariable analysis, the presence of postoperative intractable ascites (odds ratio 24.83, P = .0003), abdominal wall closure by a single-layer mass closure with a continuous running suture (odds ratio 4.59, P = .0143), preoperative body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m(2) (odds ratio 3.36, P = .0025), and preoperative serum N-terminal pro-peptide of type IV collagen 7S domain (P4NP 7S) levels ≥ 5 ng/mL (odds ratio 3.13, P = .0234) were independent risk factors.Conclusion:There are several risk factors for IH after hepatic resection in HCC patients with LC. Preoperative serum P4NP 7S levels ≥ 5 ng/mL are a useful predictive marker, and abdominal wall closure with a continuous running suture by a single-layer mass closure should be avoided.
