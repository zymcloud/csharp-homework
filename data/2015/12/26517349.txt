Leucine-rich-alpha-2-glycoprotein1 (LRG1) is a novel oncogene-associated protein which has been clarified vital to the progression of human cancers, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we showed that the expression of LRG1 was noticeably increased in HCC tissues, compared to the nontumorous tissues. High LRG1 expression was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.004), tumor differentiation (P = 0.010), TNM stage (P
