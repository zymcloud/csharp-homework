Background:In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), resistance to single-agent targeted therapy may be overcome by co-targeting of compensatory signaling pathways.Methods:A targeted drug screen with 120 combinations was used on 9 HNSCC cell lines.Results:Multiple novel drug combinations demonstrated synergistic growth inhibition. Combining the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitor, BMS754807, with either the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-family inhibitor, BMS599626, or the Src-family kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, resulted in substantial synergy and growth inhibition. Depending on the cell line, these combinations induced synergistic or additive apoptosis; when synergistic apoptosis was observed, AKT phosphorylation was inhibited to a greater extent than either drug alone. Conversely, when additive apoptosis occurred, AKT phosphorylation was not reduced by the drug combination.Conclusion:Combined IGF-1R/HER family and IGF-1R/Src family inhibition may have therapeutic potential in HNSCC. AKT may be a node of convergence between IGF-1R signaling and pathways that compensate for IGF-1R inhibition.
