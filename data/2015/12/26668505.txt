Aim:To investigate small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype formation in human HepG2 cells.Methods:Total RNA was extracted from human HepG2 or LO2 cells. NF-κB/p65 mRNA was amplified by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by sequencing. NF-κB/p65 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Specific-siRNA was transfected to HepG2 cells to knock down NF-κB/p65 expression. The effects on cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis were assessed, and the level of NF-κB/p65 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was quantitatively analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:HepG2 cells express NF-κB/p65 and express relatively less phosphorylated p65 (P-p65) and little P-gp. After treatment of HepG2 cells with different doses of doxorubicin, the expression of NF-κB/p65, P-p65, and especially P-gp were dose-dependently upregulated. After HepG2 cells were transfected with NF-κB/p65 siRNA (100 nmol/L), the expression of NF-κB/p65, P-p65, and P-gp were downregulated significantly and dose-dependently. The viability of HepG2 cells was decreased to 23% in the combination NF-κB/p65 siRNA (100 nmol/L) and doxorubicin (0.5 μmol/L) group and 47% in the doxorubicin (0.5 μmol/L) group (t = 7.043, P Conclusion:Knockdown of NF-κB/p65 with siRNA is an effective strategy for inhibiting HepG2 cell growth by downregulating P-gp expression associated chemosensitization and apoptosis induction.
