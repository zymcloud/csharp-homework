MicroRNA-154 (miR-154) has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several types of human cancers; however, its clinical significance and function in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinical significance and cellular function of miR-154 in HCC patients. The data showed that miR-154 expression was consistently lower in HCC tissues and cell lines compared to that in matched tumor-adjacent tissues and a normal hepatic cell line, and its expression was negatively correlated with tumor differentiation (P
