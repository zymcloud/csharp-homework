Background:Chronic infections with HCV (CHC) induce a chronic inflammation which can lead to liver fibrosis and subsequently cirrhosis. A recent study suggests a role of IL-17 polymorphism and serum IL17 in hepatitis B related HCC. These data indicate that the IL-17 G-197A polymorphism may be a good indicator for susceptibility to cancer development.Aim:To investigate the role of the IL17A gene polymorphism, serum IL17 and total IgE in Egyptian population with chronic infections with HCV and HCC.Subjects and methods:This study was carried out on 40 patients with chronic HCV, 35 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 20 healthy persons as control. All subjects were submitted to History taking, clinical examination, abdominal ultrasound, laboratory tests including CBC, liver function tests, alpha fetoprotien, determination of IL17gene polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP, IL17 by ELISA and IgE by immunonephelometric assay.Results:In reference to AA genotype, the frequencies of GG, GA+GG genotypes in the cases with HCC were significantly different from that of the controls (p=0.012, 0.011) and carry 6.12,4.9 respectively fold increase for HCC risk and that of chronic HCV without HCC (p=0.005, 0.004) respectively. However, there was no significant difference in allele frequency in the studied groups (p=0.095). Cases with HCC significantly have higher levels of serum IL17 and IgE than both healthy control and chronic HCV. In conclusion, the present study showed the GG, GG+GA genotypes of IL17A gene is a risk factor for HCC development may be through increased IL17 and IgE and further studies with larger sample size and different populations are recommended.
