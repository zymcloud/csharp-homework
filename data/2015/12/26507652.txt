Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a worldwide high incidence and mortality. For this reason, it is essential to invest in new therapies for this type of cancer. Our team already proved that human amniotic membrane (hAM) is able to inhibit the metabolic activity of several human cancer cell lines, including HCC cell lines. Taking into account the previously performed work, this experimental study aimed to investigate the pathways by which hAM protein extracts (hAMPEs) act on HCC. Our results showed that hAMPE reduce the metabolic activity, protein content and DNA content in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all HCC cell lines. This therapy presents selective cytotoxicity, since it was not able to inhibit a non-tumorigenic human cell line. In addition, hAMPE induced cell morphology alterations in all HCC cell lines, but death type is cell line dependent, as proved by in vitro and in vivo studies. In conclusion, hAMPE have a promising role in HCC therapy, since it is capable of inducing HCC cytotoxicity and cell death.
