High incidence of intrahepatic recurrence is a major surgical limitation following hepatectomy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was intended to investigate the effects of adjuvant intrahepatic injection of iodine-131-lipiodol on disease recurrence and survival in patients with HCC who underwent resection. A computerized literature search was performed to identify relevant articles. Data synthesis was performed using Review Manager 5.0 software, and results are presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals. Two randomized controlled trials and three case-control studies with a total of 334 participants were analyzed. Iodine-131-lipiodol treatment achieved significantly lower rates of intrahepatic recurrence (OR = 0.48, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) = 0.30-0.74; P = 0.001) and early recurrence (
