Background:The up-regulation of hepatic Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is associated with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the exact mechanism and clinical values of its diagnosis and prognosis still need to be clarified.Objectives:To investigate the clinical values of abnormal liver or circulating GP73 expression and their effect on HCC diagnosis and prognosis.Materials and methods:The expression of GP73 was investigated in 88 cancerous and self-control non-cancerous tissues using tissue microarrays with immunohisto- chemistry and was confirmed by Western blotting. Circulating GP73 levels were detected in the sera of 281 patients with liver diseases using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:The levels of circulating GP73 expression in the HCC group were higher than those in any group of benign liver diseases or controls. No significant difference was found between GP73 expression and patients' sex or age, tumor size, or AFP level except for those with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or distal metastasis (P Conclusions:Abnormality of hepatic or circulating GP73 expression should be regarded as an emerging biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis.
