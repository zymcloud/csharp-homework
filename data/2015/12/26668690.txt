Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the predominant subject of liver malignancies which arouse global concern. Advanced studies have found that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are differentially expressed in HCC and implicate they may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis and metastasis of HCC. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this review, we summarized the functions and mechanisms of those known aberrantly expressed lncRNAs identified in human HCC tissues. We hope to enlighten more comprehensive researches on the detailed mechanisms of lncRNAs and their application in clinic, such as being used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and the targets for potential therapy. Although studies on lncRNAs in HCC are still deficient, an improved understanding of the roles played by lncRNAs in HCC will lead to a much more effective utilization of those lncRNAs as novel candidates in early detection, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of HCC.
