Background:Liver biopsy (LB) has been used as diagnostic modality in liver diseases (LD). Over last two decades, there has been remarkable improvement in understanding of natural history, molecular diagnostics of viral hepatitis, genetic of LD, and also limitations of LB. There is current trend in avoiding LB in the management of various LDs.Aim:To determine utility of LB in clinical practice.Material and methods:In a prospective study, 2413 patients of LD were followed up, 219 (9%) were acute, and remaining 2194 (90.9%) were chronic LD. Patients were evaluated by biochemical parameters, virological studies, and imaging endoscopy as and when required. LB was performed in 176 (7.2%) patients when no conclusion could be drawn from the noninvasive workup. Patients with platelet count Results:LB changed the diagnosis in 55 (31.2%). These were cryptogenic LD in 24 cases, portal hypertension 15, elevated liver enzymes 11, and 5 others. In remaining, LB confirmed clinical diagnosis and helped in making management decisions.Conclusion:LB was required in 7.2% of patients with chronic LD. In 31.2% cases, LB changed the diagnosis. LB was a safe procedure even in presence of low platelet count and abnormal INR.
