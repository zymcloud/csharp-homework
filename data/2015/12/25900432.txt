Background & aims:Incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing globally, but varies between countries and regions. To target scarce resources to most need, clinical services must be informed by regional epidemiology. Using population-based data, we sought to document the incidence and mortality of HCC in Queensland, Australia, a state occupying a vast land area with diverse at-risk subpopulations.Methods:Using population-based data from 1996 to 2011, the age-standardised incidence rate (ASR), annual percentage change (APC) and survival of HCC in Queensland were assessed with negative binomial regression, Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analysis. Spatial patterns of HCC incidence and survival and relevant predictors were mapped.Results:Thousand six hundred and twenty HCCs were diagnosed during this study period, with an overall ASR of 2.00-cases/1000 population. ASR increased by 3.5% per year, (95% CI: 2.1 to 5.0), P Conclusions:Over this study period, HCC incidence increased significantly. HCC survival improved but remains poor. Social determinants are critical to HCC epidemiology.
