Although interleukin (IL)-23 receptor (IL-23R) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple cancers, its association with cancer risk is inconsistent across different studies. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis with the aim of resolving the relationship among the 3 common polymorphisms of IL-23R (rs6682925, rs10889677, rs1884444) and cancer risk.Case-control studies evaluating the association between IL-23R polymorphisms (rs6682925, rs10889677, rs1884444) and cancer risk were searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI databases.Data were included in the meta-analysis if they were from original studies adopting a case-control design investigating the association between IL-23R polymorphisms and risk of any cancer; all cancer cases must have been confirmed by histology or pathology, and controls selected from noncancer individuals. Case-only studies and review papers were excluded.Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the relationship of IL-23R polymorphisms (rs6682925, rs10889677, rs1884444) with cancer risk. A random-effects model or fixed-effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity of the data.Ultimately, 15 studies, involving 8784 cancer patients and 10,321 cancer-free controls, were included in our meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, the rs10889677 polymorphism was associated with breast cancer (BC) under the allelic, homozygous, dominant, and heterozygous models. Rs1884444 polymorphism was relevant to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under the homozygous, recessive, and allelic models. However, no evidence of a relationship between IL-23R polymorphisms (rs6682925, rs10889677, rs1884444) and cancer risk was found in the overall population.Our meta-analysis provides no evidence supporting a global association of IL-23R polymorphisms (rs6682925, rs10889677, rs1884444) with the risk of cancer. However, rs10889677 may be associated with BC susceptibility and rs1884444 had association with HCC risk. Further large and well-designed studies are warranted to confirm this finding.
