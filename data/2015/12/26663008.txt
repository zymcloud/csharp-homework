Background:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is related to a high intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR) rate, and the associations between IDR and relevant imaging features have not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to determine both clinical and imaging risk factors of IDR after complete RFA for HBV-related small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (â‰¤ 3 cm).Methods:Thirty-five patients (29 men and 6 women; mean age 60.7 years) with 40 HBV-related small HCCs who underwent complete RFA were included in our study. The incidence and potential clinical and MR imaging risk factors for IDR after RFA were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test and a stepwise Cox hazard model.Results:The median follow-up period was 25 (4-45) months, and IDR was observed in 20 (57.1%) patients. The 12- and 24-month cumulative IDR-free survival rates were 76.7% and 61.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that pretreatment albumin Conclusions:Patients with HBV-related small HCC had a high IDR rate after RFA. The risk factors included low serum albumin, multiple nodules, lesions with no or disrupted periablational enhancement and persistent hyperintensity in the central ablative zone on T1WI within 1 month after RFA.
