Multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (MRP3) is a carrier-type transport protein belonging to the ABC transporters. In this study, we investigated the safety and immunogenicity of a MRP3-derived peptide (MRP3765) as a vaccine and characterized the MRP3-specific T cell responses induced. Twelve hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) were enrolled. The MRP3-derived peptide was emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and administered via subcutaneous immunization three times weekly. No serious adverse drug reactions to the peptide vaccine were observed, and the vaccination was well tolerated. The vaccination induced MRP3-specific immunity in 72.7% of the patients. In a phenotypic analysis, the largest post-vaccinated increase in MRP3-specific T cells was due to an increase in cells with the effector memory phenotype. Among the 12 patients, one patient showed a partial response, nine showed a stable disease, and two showed a progressive disease. The median overall survival time was 14.0 months. In conclusion, the safety, effects of immune boosting, and possible prolongation of overall survival by the MRP3-derived peptide demonstrate the potential of the peptide to provide clinical benefit in HCC patients.
