Aim:To report a single-centre experience with the novel Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) technique and systematically review the related literature.Methods:Since January 2013, patients with extended primary or secondary liver tumors whose future liver remnant (FLR) was considered too small to allow hepatic resection were prospectively assessed for the ALPPS procedure. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Library Central.Results:Until July 2014 ALPPS was completed in 9 patients whose mean age was 60 ± 8 years. Indications for surgical resection were metastases from colorectal cancer in 3 cases, perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in 3 cases, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in 2 cases and hepatocellular carcinoma without chronic liver disease in 1 case. The calculated FLR volume was 289 ± 122 mL (21.1 ± 5.5%) before ALPPS-1 and 528 ± 121 mL (32.2 ± 5.7%) before ALLPS-2 (p Conclusion:The ALPPS technique effectively increased the resectability of otherwise inoperable liver tumors. The postoperative morbidity in our series was high in accordance with the data from the systematic review. Age, liver fibrosis and presence of biliary stenting were predisposing factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality.
