Purpose:To quantitatively measure the hemodynamic change of hepatic artery before and after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by quantitative color-coding analysis (QCA).Materials and methods:This prospective study registered 64 consecutive HCC patients who underwent segmental or subsegmental TACE with epirubicin and lipiodol at level 2 or 3 of the subjective angiographic chemoembolization endpoint. QCA was used to determine the maximal density time (T(max)) of selected intravascular region of interest (ROI). Relative T(max) (rT(max)) was defined as the T(max) at the selected ROI minus the time of contrast medium spurting from the catheter tip. The rT(max) of hepatic arteries was analyzed before and after embolization.Results:The pre- and post-treatment rT(max) of the landmarks at the treated segmental artery were 1.96 ± 0.48 and 3.14 ± 1.77 s, p Conclusions:The QCA is feasible to quantify embolization endpoints by comparing the rT(max) in selected hepatic arteries before and after TACE. The rT(max) of treated segmental artery was significant prolonged after optimized procedures.
