Objective:To explore the effects of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on cisplatin (DDP)- induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell and the underlying mechanisms.Methods:Hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells were divided into a control group, a LMWH group, a DDP group and a LMWH plus DDP group. The effect of the drugs on proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells were evaluated by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di- phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay, and the apoptosis were detected by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double fluorescence method and flow cytometry method. The expression levels of apoptosis-related protein Fas, Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot.Results:Compared with the control group, the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells was inhibited in the DDP group and the LMWH plus DDP group (both P0.05). The Fas level was increased obviously (P0.05). Compared with the control group and the DDP group, the Bcl-2 level was reduced significantly in the LMWH plus DDP group (both P0.05).Conclusion:LMWH can enhance the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells, which might be related to activation of mitochondrial pathway.
