Osteopontin (OPN) is a multi-functional cytokine involved in cell survival, migration and adhesion. Increasing evidence has elucidated its role in tumorigenesis, progression and metastasis. However, the role of OPN in chemoresistance of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we examined the expression of OPN in human HCC samples before and after cisplatin-treatment, the results showed that OPN was significantly increased in cisplatin-resistant specimens. We then studied the effect of cisplatin on OPN expression in HCC cells, after exposure to cisplatin, the expression of OPN in HCC cells was elevated compared to control cells. We also found that PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was also activated by cisplatin and this effect was induced by the OPN pathway. To study the effect of OPN on chemoresistance, HCC cells were treated with cisplatin along with OPN. Incubation with OPN enchanced the chemoresistance of HCC cells to cisplatin. In contrast, blockage of OPN pathway promoted the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin. Our results suggest that OPN enhanced chemoresistance of cisplatin in HCC cells by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, blocking the OPN pathway might be a novel way to overcome the disease.
