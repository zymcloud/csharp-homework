Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignant tumor worldwide and the most common primary liver cancer. Liver resection or liver transplantation is the therapeutic gold standards in patient with HCC related with or without underline liver disease. We present a video case of a 68-year-old woman admitted to our surgical and liver transplantation unit for HCC on liver segment VII. Patient has HCV cirrhosis. Patient underwent to previous right portal vein embolization. Model of end staged liver disease was 7. Body mass index (BMI) was 26.3 and ASA score was 2. Alpha-fetoprotein was 768. According with our multidisciplinary group, we suggest a laparoscopic right hepatectomy for the patient. Operation time was 343 min and blood loss estimation was 200 CC. No transfusion was required. Post-operative course was uneventful, grade 0 of Clavien-Dindo Classification. Patient was discharged in day 7. Pathology report describes a 17 mm Ã— 15 mm HCC grade 4, pT2N0. Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for HCC should be performed by dedicated surgical teams in hepatobiliary and laparoscopic surgery. The use of LLR in cirrhotic patients is in many centers proposed as the first-line treatment for HCC or as bridge treatment before liver transplantation.
