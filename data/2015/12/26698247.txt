Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent tumor types and the third most common form of morbidity in cancer-related deaths worldwide. Lentinan isolated from Lentinus edodes, is known to be a biologically active macromolecule with extremely strong activation of the human immune system such as host-mediated anti-cancer activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the immunoprophylaxis effect of the antigens induced by lentinan on murine hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:The antigens were prepared by a co-culture method (HCL) and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation precipitation (Z1, Z2, Z3). The effects of antigens on murine hepatocellular carcinoma immunoprophylaxis were determined in vivo. The cellular immunity of the immunized mice was tested by spleen lymphocyte proliferation tests and peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis assays. The tumor-specific antigen was confirmed by Western blot analysis.Results:Results in vivo revealed that the antigens (HCL/Z1) activated immunoprophylaxis against hepatocellular carcinoma with a better survival status. The survival rates (60%, 100%) of the HCL/Z1 group were better than the model group (p Conclusions:The newly generated tumor-specific antigen played a key role in the anti-tumor immune response and in activating the immune system. Our results suggest that this protein could serve as a tumor vaccine, and it could generate new ideas for tumor immunoprophylaxis.
