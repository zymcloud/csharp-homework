Background:Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare variant of hepatocellular carcinoma that commonly affects young individuals without a prior history of liver disease. The principal differential diagnosis is conventional hepatocellular carcinoma especially the scirrhous variant. Despite their distinctive appearance, recent studies have demonstrated a lack of consistency in how FL-HCC are diagnosed by pathologists.Aim:To investigate the diagnostic utility of CD68 in differentiating between FL-HCC and scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma.Patients and methods:In our retrospective study, we reviewed four cases of FL-HCC that were diagnosed at the pathology department of Mongi Slim hospital over a thirteen-year period (2002-2014). Relevant clinical information and microscopic slides were available in all cases and were retrospectively reviewed. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using the avidin-biotin complex technique with antibodies against CD68 and CK7.Results:Our study group included one man and three women (sex ratio M/F=0.33) aged between 23 and 34 years (mean=28 years). All cases arose in non-cirrhotic liver. Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for CK7 and for CD68 (n=4).Conclusions:CD68 immunostaining is a sensitive marker for FL-HCC that may be of use in routine diagnostic surgical pathology. Lack of CD68 staining should suggest caution in making a diagnosis of FL-HCC.
