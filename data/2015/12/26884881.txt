This study aimed to assess the diagnostic value of the latent transforming growth factor-beta binding protein-1 (LTBP-1) in distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from patients with hepatitis or liver cirrhosis. The protein levels of LTBP-1 or AFP in circulating plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or chemiluminescence in four cohorts: HCC (n = 167), liver cirrhosis (n = 50), chronic hepatitis B (CHB, n = 50), and healthy individuals (n = 104). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the curves (AUC) of the proteins were calculated. Results showed that plasma levels of LTBP-1 were significantly higher in HCC patients than those in other three groups. LTBP-1 showed a better diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.67-0.80) in distinguishing HCC from the CHB or cirrhosis patients, compared to AFP (AUC = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.52-0.65). In the early-stage HCCs investigated, diagnostic performance of LTBP-1 (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.84) remained better than that of AFP (AUC = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.52-0.69). Combination of LTBP-1 and AFP showed increased diagnostic efficiency than any of the two proteins performed alone, for both all HCC (AUC = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.72-0.83) and early-stage HCC (AUC = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.74-0.87). These findings proposed that LTBP-1 may be a promising biomarker for distinguishing HCC from the CHB or liver cirrhosis patients, especially for the early-stage HCC.
