Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health threat; with 240 million people are chronic carriers of the virus. The infection can cause acute and chronic liver disease including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). On the basis of disease burden and the availability of safe and effective vaccines, World Health Organization has recommended that hepatitis B vaccine be incorporated into routine infant and childhood immunization programs for all countries. The efficacy of universal immunization has been proven in many countries, with substantial reductions of the prevalence of HBV carriage in children, adolescents and young adults. Most important, hepatitis B vaccination can protect them from HCC, as has been demonstrated in Taiwan and other countries. Nevertheless, the implementation of worldwide vaccination against HBV indeed requires more effort to overcome the social and economic challenges. To have a global control of HBV infection, we have to continue the universal HBV vaccination, interrupt the possible transmission routes and treat eligible patients with antiviral agents. However, current treatments are still far from ideal as they cannot eradicate intrahepatic HBV cccDNA, and lifelong administration of these agents will pose a major economic burden, especially in the endemic Asia-Pacific region. Thus we need innovative treatment strategies and novel agents with difference modes of action to overcome the unmet medical need for an efficient HBV cure with subsequent global eradication of HBV infection, hopefully by the first half of 21st century.
