Background:This study was designed to compare perioperative and oncologic outcomes between minimally invasive liver resection (MILR) and conventional open liver resection (COLR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a propensity-score matched analysis.Methods:Ninety-nine patients who received MILR were matched with 198 patients treated with COLR out of 928 patients with HCC who received curative liver resection from 2002 to 2012. A multivariable logistic model based on factors related to the patient, tumor, and surgical procedure was used to estimate a propensity score.Results:The MILR group experienced significantly less intraoperative blood loss (mean: 389.55 vs 580.66 mL; P = 0.008), lower complication rates (13.1% vs 24.7%; P = 0.020), and a shorter length of hospital stay (mean: 8.40 vs 13.39 days; P Conclusions:MILR produced better perioperative and comparable oncologic outcomes than COLR for HCC.
