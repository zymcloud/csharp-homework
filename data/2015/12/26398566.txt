Notch1 has previously been implicated in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of Notch1 in early stage HCC patients after hepatectomy. The differential expression of Notch1 in paired tumor and non-tumorous tissue was evaluated by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The correlation between Notch1 expression and the surgical outcome of patients at BCLC stage 0/A and its ≤5 cm subgroup was retrospectively investigated in 206 patients from the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (training cohort), and prospectively validated in 185 patients from the same center and retrospectively verified in 129 patients from the Fujian Medical University (validation cohort 1 and 2, respectively). Compared with paired non-tumorous tissues, loss of Notch1 was observed in tumor tissue. Patients with normal Notch1 had better prognosis than those with loss of Notch1 in the training cohort and ≤5 cm subgroup (time to recurrence: 38.5±6.1 vs. 16.0±3.2 months, P
