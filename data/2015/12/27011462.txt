The objective of this study was to explore the value of spleen-remnant liver volume ratio for hepatocellular carcinoma surgery and liver reserve assessment. Spleen-remnant liver volume ratio postoperation was measured with imageological methods and water displacement, and the liver function postoperation and hospital stay of patients with different spleen-remnant liver volume ratios were compared. Spleen-remnant liver volume ratio was closely related to liver function assessment postoperation. The higher the ratio, the higher the assessment score of liver function postoperation would be. When spleen-remnant liver volume ratio was ≤0.9, the patients had a fast recovery and short hospital stay. Spleen-remnant liver volume ratio can effectively predict the recovery and liver reserve of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma postoperation. When postoperative spleen-remnant liver volume ratio is predicted to be ≤0.9, the operation can be performed; and when the ratio is predicted to be ≥1.2, the operation is not suggested.
