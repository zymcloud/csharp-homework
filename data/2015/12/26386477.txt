We aim to assess the role and degree of contrast washout in the differential diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Fifty-six histopathology-confirmed ICC nodules and 184 HCC nodules were included in this study. The nodules' washout degree on CEUS at 1, 2 and 3 min was semi-quantitatively and qualitatively assessed using gray-scale video signal intensity. Semi-quantitative assessment showed that the washout degree of ICCs at 1, 2 and 3 min were significantly lower than those of HCCs (p
