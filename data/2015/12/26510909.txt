Objectives:To determine the safety of Puquitinib Mesylate (XC-302), an oral inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, in treating relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).Methods:Between October 2013 and July 2015, 21 patients from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were treated twice daily on each day of a 28-day cycle (median number of cycles, 2; maximum, 20) with XC-302 at a post prandial dose of 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg. Adverse events (AEs), AUClast and Cmax, response rates, and overall survival were assessed.Results:Patients had received a median (range) of 1 (1 to 3) previous cancer treatments. At the latest follow-up, two patients were still benefitting from the study. The most common drug-related AEs were elevations in alanine transaminase (ALT, 14 of 21 patients) and aspartate transaminase (AST, 7 of 21 patients). Four patients, both in the-50-mg group, had dose-limiting toxicities, and therapy was discontinued in a fifth because of persistent abnormal liver function. The overall response rate was 2 of19. Serum concentrations of XC-302 increased in a dose-dependent pattern. Median progression-free survival in all patients was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.0) months.Conclusion:XC-302 has an acceptable safety profile and offers potential therapeutic value to patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
