Background/aims:The primary aim of this study was to characterise the blood metabolic profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a rat model, and the secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of the quinolone, norfloxacin on metabolic profiles and exploring the role that gut sterilisation may have on HCC development.Methods:HCC was induced in 10 Fischer rats by administration of intra-peritoneal diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and oral N-nitrosomorpholine. Plasma was collected upon sacrifice. Five of these rats were concomitantly administered oral norfloxacin. Six Fischer non-treated rats acted as healthy controls. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired using a 600 MHz NMR system.Results:Control animals were 120 g heavier than diseased counterparts. Proton NMR spectra from diseased rats displayed significant decreases in lipoproteins, unsaturated fatty acids, acetyl-glycoprotein, acetoacetate, and glucose (P â‰¤ 0.001). Plasma citrate and formate levels were increased (P = 0.02). Norfloxacin appeared to abrogate this effect slightly.Conclusion:The spectral profiles of plasma in rats with HCC display marked changes with relation to lipid metabolism and cellular turnover. Norfloxacin appears to moderate these metabolic alterations to a small degree.
