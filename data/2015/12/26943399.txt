Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) of the liver is a rare and benign nodular lesion. It remains difficult to distinguish RLH from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite recent advances in imaging modalities. We report five cases of RLH that required differential diagnosis of HCC preoperatively. These cases all occurred in middle-aged women and were associated with autoimmune disease in 40% (2/5). The diameter of the nodule was less than 2 cm in all five of our cases. Four cases had a preoperative diagnosis of HCC. When a liver nodule is found in middle-aged women with an autoimmune disease, the possibility of RLH should be considered.
