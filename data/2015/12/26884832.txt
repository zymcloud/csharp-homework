Background:MiR-30a-5p has been reported to play vital roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of various malignancies via different molecular mechanisms. However, the role and target genes of miR-30a-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain still unclear. In silico analysis finds that there are complementary sequences between the 3'-untrasnlated region of astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG-1) and miR-30a-5p. Herein, we investigated the biological function of miR-30a-5p, as well as the potential molecular mechanism via targeting AEG-1 in HCC cells.Materials and methods:MiR-30a-5p inhibitor, miR-30a-5p mimic, AEG-1 siRNAs, as well as their negative controls were transfected into HCC cell lines HepG2, SMMC-7221, HepB3 and SNU449. Then, the in vitro influence and mechanism of miR-30a-5p on cell viability, proliferation, caspase-3/7 activity and apoptosis were studied, as assessed by different methods, including spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, fluorescence microscopy of Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide double chromatin staining, western blot and dual luciferase reporter assay, respectively.Results:MiR-30a-5p mimic markedly inhibited cell growth, also induced caspase-3/7 activity and apoptosis in all four HCC cell lines tested. The strongest effect was observed in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. However, this effect was slightly weaker than that of AEG-1 siRNAs. Transfection of miR-30a-5p mimic led to a markedly reduced AEG-1 protein level and further dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that AEG-1 was one of the target genes of miR-30a-5p in HCC cells.Conclusions:MiR-30a-5p may play an essential role in the cell growth and apoptosis of HCC cells, partially via targeting AEG-1.
