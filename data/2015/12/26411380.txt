Rationale and objectives:The aim of this study was to determine the optimal arterial phase delay for computed tomography imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before and after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using a low iodine dose protocol.Materials and methods:A total of 39 patients with known HCC were imaged with dynamic computed tomography of the liver (40-second scan duration, 60 mL of contrast medium), both on the same day before TACE and 1 day after TACE. Time attenuation curves of vessels, nonmalignant liver parenchyma, and 62 HCCs were normalized to a uniform aortic contrast arrival and analyzed.Results:Maximal arterial phase HCC to liver contrast was reached between 13 and 17 seconds after aortic contrast arrival, both before and after TACE.Conclusions:Using our low iodine dose protocol, arterial phase imaging of HCC should be performed between 13 and 17 seconds after aortic contrast arrival, both before and after TACE.
