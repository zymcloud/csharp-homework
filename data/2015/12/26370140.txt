Glypican-3 has been reported to be one of the most promising serum markers for hepatocellular carcinoma. This study aimed to assess the clinical utility of serum glypican 3 for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. We recruited consecutive patients on a large scale, 283 with hepatocellular carcinoma, 445 with chronic hepatic diseases, and 162 normal controls, to assess the diagnostic accuracy of serum glypican 3 for hepatocellular carcinoma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, we further analyzed the relationship between the serum levels of α-fetoprotein and glypican-3 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The results indicated that serum glypican 3 was elevated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (0 ng/mL, range = 0-14.0 ng/mL, P = .033) and liver cirrhosis (0 ng/mL, range = 0-12.5 ng/mL, P = .001) compared to the levels in normal control (0 ng/mL, range = 0-4.3 ng/mL), but there was no difference between hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis (P = .097). The area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristics curve for hepatocellular carcinoma versus all controls was 0.519, with a sensitivity of 39.9%, a specificity of 60.6%, and an optimal cutoff value of 0.002 ng/mL. The positive and negative predictive values were 32.0% and 68.3%, respectively. No significant correlation in serum levels was observed between glypican 3 and α-fetoprotein (P > .05). The diagnostic sensitivity for hepatocellular carcinoma increased to 72.8% (206 of the 283) when glypican 3 was combined with α-fetoprotein. Glypican 3 was not a promising serum maker for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma alone, but it could be complementary to α-fetoprotein and elevate the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis.
