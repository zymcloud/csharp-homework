Clinically, we often encounter cancer patients who also have cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease. We experienced a case of severe coronary artery disease and a large hepatocellular carcinoma in a 69-year-old man. To reduce the risk of a perioperative cardiovascular event during mesohepatectomy, an elective intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was used. After an uneventful recovery, the patient was discharged on day 15. While IABP is frequently introduced in cardiac surgery, there have been few reports of its use during liver surgery. Here, we present IABP-assisted major hepatectomy as an option in a patient with both cancer and coronary artery disease.
