Background:Patients with liver cirrhosis have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Implantation metastasis following diagnostic biopsy is a well-known complication. Therefore, primary resection of a hypervascularised tumour suspicious for HCC is often performed with curative intent.Case report:An exophytically growing mass was diagnosed between liver segments III and IVb by means of ultrasound in a 53-year old male patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Computed tomography confirmed a 3.5 cm large hypervascularised tumour with given resectability. Intraoperatively, the tumour appeared like a HCC. Thus, an atypical resection was performed. Histopathology revealed ectopic spleen tissue without any signs of malignancy. As enquiries revealed, the patient had undergone splenectomy after a blunt abdominal trauma 9 years prior to admission.Conclusion:In the present patient, hepatic splenosis in a cirrhotic liver was misinterpreted as HCC. In patients with a history of traumatic rupture of the spleen or splenectomy, splenosis has to be considered as a potential differential diagnosis of a hypervascularised tumour. Specific diagnostics should be performed to rule out splenosis.
