Background:To study the role of LZTS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and the molecular mechanism involved.Methods:LZTS1 expression was studied in 10 HCC cell lines and 1 normal hepatocyte cell line by western blot analysis and qRT-PCR. One HCC cell line was selected and transfected with LZTS1 lentivirus. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were then determined by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. LZTS1, cyclin D1, CDK1, Cdc25C, pS473 Akt, and pT308 Akt mRNA and protein expressions were measured. PS473 Akt and pT308 Akt expression level was also compared with the HCC cells treated with LY294002.Results:Compared with the normal hepatocyte cells, LZTS1 expression in HCC cells was significantly lower. After the transfection with LZTS1 lentivirus, HCC cell proliferation ability decreased markedly and HCC cells were blocked at G2/M phase. Cyclin D1 and CDK1 expression were both decreased but not significantly. Cdc25C expression was increased significantly. PS473 Akt and pT308 Akt expression level was increased significantly as well, which were almost the same with those transfected with LY294002.Conclusion:LZTS1 could inhibit HCC cell proliferation by impairing PI3K/Akt pathway.
