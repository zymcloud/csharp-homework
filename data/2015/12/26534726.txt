Colorectal tumor represents in Europe the second most common cause of cancer death. Surgical resection in case of colorectal liver metastasis remain for patients the only cure. In 2003, Jaeck et al. described a one or two-stage hepatectomy combined with PVE for initially non-resectable colorectal liver metastases. The aim of our study was to retrospectively review all patients who underwent to a two-stage hepatectomy for CLM and evaluate the safety and feasibility of the procedure. We review all patient who underwent two-stage hepatectomy for CLM in our center. From 2004 to March 2014, 57 patients were candidate for a two-stage hepatectomy for CLM. Thirty-two patients (55.9 %) were men and twenty-five women (44.1 %). Median age was 60.9 years old. In forty-six cases, the two-stage hepatectomy was completed. Of these 46 patients, 38 patients completed the procedure with a PVL and 8 underwent a secondary PVE. Seven patients were planned but did not performed PVL after intraoperative evaluation and neither PVE after secondary evaluation due to disease progression. Five cases were treated with a laparoscopic approach for the first step procedure. We had no death in this series. Ten patients developed complications after the first-stage operation and 18 patients had complications after the second stage. The median interval between the two stages was 66 days. Long-term overall survival was 52 months from the first liver surgery. This study demonstrated the feasibility of two-stage hepatectomy without postoperative mortality. In our last experience in selected patient, a laparoscopic first step should be performed. Patients selection is extremely important to propose the best therapeutic option for each one.
