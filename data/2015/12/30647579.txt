Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is regarded as one of the most common malignancies and among the leading causes of cancer death in the whole world. Apoptosis is a fundamental process controlling cell death and plays a critical role in normal development of multicellular organisms. When abnormalities occur in apoptosis, a variety of diseases are caused, including cancer. The aim of the current study was to determine the serum expression of Cytochrome c and PDCD4 among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic hepatitis.Patients and methods:A total of 40 serum and tissue samples (17 samples from chronic hepatitis and 23 samples from HCC patients) were collected. Apoptotic markers in serum were carried out using the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique.Results:We found that serum levels of PCDC4 and Cytochrome c were increased in patients with HCC when compared to chronic hepatitis patients. They were also increased in patients with chronic hepatitis when compared to controls (p < 0.05, significant). Analyzing the impact of HCC characters on serum values of PDCD4 and Cytochrome c revealed that the mean values of both PDCD4 and Cytochrome c are significantly higher in cases with single lesion of HCC (p < 0.05, significant). Right lobe location of HCC lesions has the highest mean values of PDCD4 (p < 0.05, significant). As regards grade of differentiation, grade ÐŸ has higher mean values of Cytochrome c (p < 0.05, significant).Conclusion:Serum levels of Cytochrome c and PDCD4 are increased in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and could be used as diagnostic aid for HCC.
