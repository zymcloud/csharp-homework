This prospective study aimed to elucidate the effect of phase-related quantitative parameters of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with perflubutane microbubble agent to assess the cellular differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Intensity was analyzed in 94 lesions (19.4 Â± 4.9 mm, 86 patients), 47 well-differentiated HCCs (wHCCs) and 47 moderately-differentiated HCCs (mHCCs): I(e) (early phase) = I(te) (tumor) - I(le) (liver), I(p) (post-vascular phase) = I(tp) (tumor) - I(lp) (liver), I(ep) = I(e) - I(p). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with the best cutoff value (I(e), 13.2, I(p), -4.5, I(ep), 21.3) for discriminating between wHCC and mHCC was 0.6922 for Ie, 0.7680 for Ip and 0.7925 for Iep, which indicated a significantly greater ability to differentiate between wHCC and mHCC compared with visual/qualitative assessment (early phase, 0.6170, p = 0.04; post-vascular phase, 0.6702, p = 0.01; both phases, 0.7021, p = 0.04). In conclusion, I(ep) was found to have the highest diagnostic ability, suggesting it is a promising parameter for the cellular differentiation of HCCs with CEUS.
