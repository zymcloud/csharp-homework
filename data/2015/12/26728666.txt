Purpose:To improve patient comfort and reduce complications, clinical benefit of a transradial approach for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was evaluated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 284 patients with HCC for TACE was divided into transradial approach group (n = 126) and transfemoral approach group (n = 158). These two groups of cases were retrospectively compared with regard to complications, the procedural time, X-ray exposure time, length of hospitalization, and hospital costs.Results:There were lower incidence rates of complications including abdominal distension (42.85% vs. 87.97%, P> 0.001), vomiting (53.17% vs. 77.22%, P Conclusions:Transradial approach for TACE improves quality of life in patients with HCC by offering fewer complications and lower costs compared with transfemoral approach.
