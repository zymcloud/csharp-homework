Objective:To explore the impact of microwave dealing with cutting surface on perioperative liver function recovery and recurrence and metastasis after hepatectomy for HCC.Methods:Clinical data of 133 patients with HCC from March 2009 to November 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into the conventional surgery group (66 cases) and microwave treatment group (67 cases). A domestic ECO-100 microwave knife was inserted into the liver cutting surface 0.5 cm from the cutting edge, and repeated multi-point burning with an average time of 25 minutes in the microwave treatment group. Then the perioperative liver function recovery and recurrence and metastasis in the two groups were compared.Results:The operation time of conventional surgery group was (158.0 ± 31.0) minutes, and that of microwave treatment group was significantly longer (181.0 ± 28.0) minutes (P=0.027). There were no significant differences in the liver function recovery between the two groups (P>0.05). There were 6 cases of recurrence and metastasis after 6 months and 9 cases after 12 months in the microwave treatment group, while there were 15 cases of recurrence and metastasis after 6 months and 20 cases after 12 months in the conventional surgery group, showing a significant difference (P=0.034 and 0.022, respectively).Conclusions:Microwave dealing with the cutting surface has no significant effect on perioperative liver function recovery in hepatectomy. However, microwave treatment can reduce the in situ recurrence in HCC patients within the first year after surgery, indicating a good clinical application value.
