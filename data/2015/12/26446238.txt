Background:The survival benefit of combining sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy compared with sorafenib monotherapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and main portal vein tumor thrombosis (MPVTT) is unclear.Methods:Between January 2009 and June 2013, 183 consecutive patients with advanced HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C) and MPVTT were retrospectively reviewed. Of these, 89 patients with advanced HCC and MPVTT were enrolled in this study: 45 were treated with combination therapy (sorafenib-TACE group), and the other 44 treated with sorafenib monotherapy (sorafenib group).Results:The mean number of TACE sessions per patient was 2.6 (range: 1-5). The median duration of sorafenib in the sorafenib-TACE group and sorafenib group was 5.6 months and 5.4 months, respectively. The disease control rate was similar between the two groups. Median time to progression was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.2, 3.7) in the sorafenib-TACE group, and 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.1, 3.8) in the sorafenib group (p = .924). Median overall survival was 7.0 months (95% CI: 6.1, 7.8) and 6.0 months (95% CI: 4.7, 7.3) in the sorafenib-TACE group and the sorafenib group, respectively (p = .544). The adverse events related to sorafenib were comparable between the two groups. Twenty-one adverse events of grade 3-4 related to TACE occurred in 12 patients (26.7%), and 2 of them died (4.4%).Conclusion:This study demonstrated no advantage of combination therapy over sorafenib monotherapy. Considering the patients' morbidity after TACE, sorafenib monotherapy is appropriate for managing patients with advanced HCC and MPVTT.
