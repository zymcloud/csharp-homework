Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms which can arise from almost any location in the body. Diagnosing them pre-operatively is difficult as they mimic features of other hepatic neoplasms including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), fibrolamellar HCC, and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) among others. The unique feature of these tumors is the coexpression of muscle and melanocytic markers. These are identified immunohistochemically by the expression of Human Melanin Black-45 (HMB-45), Melan-A and Smooth Muscle Antigen (SMA) which are seen in the majority of tumors. The liver is uncommonly associated with a PEComa and the approach to a patient with hepatic PEComa is not well described. There is no consensus regarding the neo-adjuvant/adjuvant therapy in these patients. The natural history of this condition is not well documented making it an unpredictable disease. Here we have discussed a case and reviewed the literature concerning these rare tumors.
