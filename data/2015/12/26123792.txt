In our previous studies, injectable chitosan-based hydrogel (CH) was prepared and its application in surgery removal of tumor was studied. In this study, the antitumor and antimetastasis effects of the macerating solutions from CH were investigated. Our in vitro results showed that macerating solutions from CH significantly increased the proliferation of human normal liver L02 cells. In contrast, macerating solutions from CH showed significant inhibitory effects on the growth of human hepatoma Bel-7402 cells. In a mouse H22 tumor model, intraperitoneal injection of macerating solutions from CH decreased tumor growth and prevented tumor diffusion. Tumor weight was decreased dramatically in mice treated with macerating solutions from CH. The thymus index and spleen index were significantly increased by treatment with macerating solutions from CH. Administration of macerating solutions from CH also remarkably increased serum levels of TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, and decreased serum VEGF content as compared with the control group treated with saline. The antimetastasis studies showed that the number of pulmonary nodules, pulmonary metastases index, and lymph nodes index were significantly decreased in experimental groups treated with macerating solutions from CH. This study provided more supporting data for the potential clinical application of CH after surgical removal of tumor.
