Background and objectives:We studied the effect of achieving sustained virological response (SVR) on the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C receiving anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. Avoiding HCC is considered the main long-term benefit of successful antiviral treatment.Methods:Our literature search extended up to June 2015. We identified all studies that assessed the risk of HCC in patients achieving or not achieving SVR. Meta-analysis was based on a standard random-effect model. The end-point was occurrence of HCC compared between patients with and without SVR; this end-point was expressed as an odds ratio and percent reduction in risk and was also presented separately for patients with and without cirrhosis. All results estimates presented with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). The presence of any temporal trend in these indexes was investigated by standard meta-regression.Results:Our search identified 25 observational studies (19,822 patients). The odds ratio of HCC for SVR versus no-SVR was 0.19 (95 % CI 0.15-0.24) in the overall series of 25 studies. The difference in this index between patients with any stage of fibrosis/cirrhosis and those with cirrhosis was small. With regard to risk difference, the 25 studies indicated an overall reduction of 10 % (95 % CI 8.00-12.0); this effect was much less pronounced in the group with any stage of fibrosis/cirrhosis (risk difference 6.7 %) than in the selected group with cirrhosis (risk difference 22 %). Meta-regression showed no temporal trend.Conclusion:Our analysis was successful in providing an updated overview on this controversial topic. Some pharmacoeconomic assessments are also presented to interpret the clinical results of our analysis.
