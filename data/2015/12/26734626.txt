The learning curve for laparoscopic liver surgery is infrequently addressed in current literature. In this paper, we explored the challenges faced in embarking on laparoscopic liver surgery in a unit that did predominantly open liver surgery. In setting up our laparoscopic liver surgery program, we adopted skills and practices learnt during fellowships at various high volume centers in North America and Australia, with modifications to suit our local patients' disease patterns. We started with simple minor resections in anterolateral segments to build confidence, which allowed us to train the surgical and nursing team before progressing to more difficult resections. Inter institutional collaboration and exchange of skills also enabled the synergistic development of techniques for safe progression to more complex surgeries. Multimedia resources and international guidelines for laparoscopic liver surgery are increasingly accessible, which further guide the practice of this emerging field, as evidence continues to validate the laparoscopic approach in well selected cases.
