Aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer worldwide. IFN-α has been used in clinics as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat HCC. In spite of the therapeutic effects, IFN-α caused many side effects due to its short half-life and high dose. Here, we aim to detect the anti-tumor effect of a novel gene delivery system - IFN-α2b gene-modified human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in HCC.Main methods:Two HCC cell lines, HepG2 and Huh7 were used in the current study. The secretion of IFN-α2b in the BMSC cultured conditioned media (CM) was measured by ELISA. The cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. The Xenografted NOD/SCID mouse tumor model was generated by subcutaneous inoculation with HepG2 cells.Key findings:We found that the IFN-α2b-modified BMSC (BMSC/IFN-α2b) could express IFN-α2b stably. The CM from BMSC/IFN-α2b inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells with a much lower growth rate compared with BMSC/vector-CM or DMEM culture group. We further demonstrated that the population of G2/M phase was higher in BMSC/IFN-α2b-CM treated cells than the other two groups. In addition, BMSC/IFN-α2b could significantly inhibit tumor growth in NOD/SCID mice. Moreover, we found that BMSC/IFN-α2b-CM could significantly decrease the mRNA and protein levels of Notch signaling molecules of HCC in vitro and in vivo.Significance:Our data demonstrated that BMSC/IFN-α2b could significantly inhibit HCC cell growth through negatively regulating the Notch signaling, which suggested that IFN-α2b-modified BMSC may be used as an effective therapeutic strategy for hepatomas.
