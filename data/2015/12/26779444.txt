Purpose and methods:The ability of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to differentiate between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is still controversial. We reviewed the CEUS imaging of 819 patients (HCC=546, ICC=273) with an established pathological diagnosis. The enhancement patterns of lesions and the diagnostic performance of CEUS were analyzed.Results:Arterial hyperenhancement followed by washout was observed in 92.3% (504/546) of the HCC lesions and 85.7% (234/273) of the ICC lesions on CEUS (pConclusions:Although ICC may show the typical enhancement pattern of HCC on CEUS, peripheral rim-like enhancement and quick contrast washout show high efficiency in the differentiation of HCC from ICC.
