Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a high rate of mortality worldwide. Here, we investigated the effect of combination treatment with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on HCC cells. HepG2, SMMC7721, and BEL7402 cells were treated with SAHA and/or 5-FU and subjected to cell viability, colony formation, and soft agarose assays; cell cycle, apoptosis, and reverse transcription-PCR analyses; western blotting; immunohistochemistry; and xenograft tumorigenicity assay. SAHA and 5-FU inhibited the proliferation of the three cell lines, and combination treatment with SAHA and 5-FU resulted in a combination index 1, indicating a synergistic effect. Co-treatment with SAHA and 5-FU caused G0/G1 phase arrest and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, inhibiting tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. 5-FU upregulated thymidylate synthase, whereas SAHA downregulated its expression. Our results indicate that SAHA and 5-FU act synergistically to inhibit cell growth and tumorigenicity in HCC via the induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis through a mechanism involving the inhibition of thymidylate synthase, suggesting that combination treatment with 5-FU and SAHA may be beneficial for the treatment of inoperable HCC.
