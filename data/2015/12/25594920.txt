Aim:Assessment of the microvessel density (MVD) may yield important information leading to an effective antiangiogenic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The intratumoral MVD of 136 HCC patients was retrospectively evaluated using CD34. The correlation between the MVD and clinicopathological findings was assessed. In addition, the prognostic factors influencing the 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.Results:The MVD of each tumor size group (5 cm) was 196 ± 51, 181 ± 63 and 147 ± 69. The MVD of each histological grade (well-, moderately and poorly differentiated) was 200 ± 56, 184 ± 61 and 114 ± 55. The optimum cut-off values of the MVD for the 2-year DFS and OS were 118.3 and 112.7, respectively. For the 2-year DFS, high tumor marker levels (α-fetoprotein >100 ng/mL and protein induced by vitamin K absence/antagonist-II >100 mAU/mL), poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a high Ki-67 index (>20%), a large tumor size (>5 cm), vascular invasion, high tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (III/IV) and a low MVD were the significant unfavorable prognostic factors. For the OS, a high Ki-67 index, a large tumor size, vascular invasion, high TNM stage and a low MVD were the significant risk factors for death. By the multivariate analysis, a low MVD was identified as an independent predictor of the 2-year DFS as well as the OS.Conclusion:A low MVD can be used to predict an unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients.
