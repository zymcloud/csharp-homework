Highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) is a novel promising noninvasive biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a kind of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). But traditional methods limited HULC clinical detection for ownself drawbacks. Development a new HULC detection approach is urgent and necessary. Electrochemical nucleic acid sensor based on different signal amplification strategies with high sensitivity, fast, simple, and convenient, may solve this problem. Herein, we propose a novel strategy based on Pt-Pd bimetallic nanodendrites/nanoflower-like clusters on graphene oxide/Au/horseradish peroxidase (PtPd BND/BNF@GO/Au/HRP) to enhance the catalytic efficiency and sensitivity. And Au particles were simultaneously and separately capped with thionine or detection probe, which increase the binding amount of detection probe and decrease the electronic background. The results indicated that the catalytic effect was noticeably elevated and that the biosensor provides ultrasensitive detection for the lncRNA HULC. The linear calibration of the biosensor ranged from 1.00×10(-3) to 1.00×10(3) pM/mL, and the limit of detection was 0.247 fM/mL. The lncRNA biosensor based on the PtPd BND/BNF@GO/Au/HRP/Au/thionine exhibited acceptable reproducibility and clear selectivity. This strategy may provide a new alternative for clinical HCC diagnosis through the detection of HULC.
