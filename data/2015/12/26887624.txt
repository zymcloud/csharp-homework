Objective:To explore the value of ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in designing the indication, treatment protocol and operational skills for patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) near the liver surface.Methods:Sixty-one HCC patients with 69 lesions, confirmed by clinical examination and pathology, underwent percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. The study included 40 cases of liver function Child-Pugh grade A and 21 cases of grade B. The average size of tumors was (3.8 ± 1.2) cm, tumor diameter ≥ 4 cm accounted for 39.1% (27/69 lesions), and the average age was 58.2 years (range, 35-76 years). Taking comprehensive measures, such as intraperitoneal injection of saline adjacent to the tumor before RFA, increasing the puncture sites on the surface of tumor to avoid overlapping of the central portion of tumor, repeated ablation of the needle track to reduce needle tract metastasis, avoid vertical puncture, and other additional measures, to improve the inactivation of tumors adjacent to the liver surface. Enhanced CT/MRI was performed to evaluate the curative effect at 1, 3, 6 and 24 months after the treatment.Results:The inactivation rate of tumor was 98.6% (68/69 lesions) and local recurrence rate was 5.8%(4/69) after RFA. The tumor-related marker AFP was 1 000-1 500 ng/ml before and reduced to (98.5 ± 42.5) ng/ml after radiofrequency ablation, among them returned to normal in 13 cases (21.3%). Since the ablation area was rather small, the level of serum alanine aminotransferase was elevated only to (148.5 ± 38.5) U/ml at one week after RFA and returned to normal at (1.8 ± 0.6) week after RFA. No patient experienced severe liver dysfunction. The local HCC recurrent rate after RFA was 5.8%(4/69 lesions) and intrahepatic heterotopic recurrence rate was 24.6% (15/61). The 20-61 months follow-up showed that the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rate was 83.6%, 57.3% and 44.2%, respectively.Conclusions:Ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation provides an effective minimally invasive treatment for primary HCC near the liver surface. Taking some additional measures such as intraperitoneal injection of saline, increase of percutaneous puncture sites, and avoiding vertical needle puncture, may reduce complications and improve the therapeutic outcome. RFA is one of effective and minimally invasive treatment and causing less liver damage for primary HCC near the liver surface.
