In this article, we report the case of a newborn who presented a life-threatening hepatomegaly with respiratory distress at 12 days of life, complicating a metastatic neuroblastoma. Low-dose liver radiotherapy was performed in emergency in order to decompress. Chemotherapy has also been delivered due to a tumoral relapse 1 month after radiotherapy. After a follow-up of 20 years, this young woman is still in complete remission, with no long-term sequelae.
