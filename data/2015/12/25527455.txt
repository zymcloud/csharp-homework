Purpose:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) are prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The impact of these tumor markers in recurrent HCC on the prognosis remains to be fully elucidated.Methods:Two hundred and seventeen patients whose AFP and DCP levels were measured at recurrence were enrolled in the present study. AFP levels >10 ng/mL and DCP levels ≥40 mAU/mL were defined as AFP positive (AFP+) and DCP positive (DCP+), respectively. The patterns of tumor markers were scored as AFP-/DCP-, 0; AFP+/DCP- or AFP-/DCP+, 1 and AFP+/DCP+, 2.Results:The median survival period after recurrence in patients with a score of 2 (26.6 months) was significantly lower than that in patients with scores of 1 or 0 (43.5 months, P Conclusions:The present study shows that measurements of both AFP and DCP are useful for predicting the prognosis of recurrent HCC.
