MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in the initiation and progression of several types of human cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is one of the most common types of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs play a vital role in HCC, hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, liver cell development and the metabolic functions of the liver. The aim of the present review was to summarize the most recent findings on the functions of miRNAs in the liver and discuss their potential roles in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of HCC.
