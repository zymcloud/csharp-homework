Oxidative stress is important for the initiation and progression of cancers, which confers the cells with a survival advantage by inducing oxidative adaption and drug resistance. Therefore, developing strategies to promote oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity could be important for cancer therapy. Herein, we found that H2O2-mediated oxidative stress increases TRPV2 expression in human hepatoma (HepG2 and Huh-7) cells. This occurred at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. The significance of TRPV2 in promoting H2O2-induced cell death was demonstrated in gain and loss of function studies with overexpression and knockdown of TRPV2, respectively. Mechanistically, H2O2-induced cell death involves inhibition of pro-survival signaling proteins (Akt, Nrf2) and activation of pro-death signaling proteins (p38, JNK1). Overexpression of TRPV2 in H2O2-treated hepatoma cells aggravates the inhibition of Akt and Nrf2, while it enhances the activation of p38 and JNK1 at the early stage of cell death. Interestingly, increased expression of TRPV2 in HepG2 cells improved the efficacy of stress-associated chemicals to induce cell death. Our findings suggest that TRPV2 acts as an important enhancer for H2O2-induced cytotoxicity. This process occurred by the inhibition of Akt and Nrf2 as well as the early activation of p38 and JNK1. These findings have important implications for inhibition of oxidative adaption and drug resistance.
