Background:The number of elderly patients who undergo hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been increasing. Therefore, criteria for selection of an appropriate hepatectomy procedure are required.Patients and methods:Two hundred and twenty-nine HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy were enrolled in the present study. Patients were classified into two groups: the elderly group (age â‰¥75 years, n=34) and the non-elderly group (age Results:The incidence of non-anatomical resection was higher (p=0.015) and the weight of resected specimens was lower (p=0.019) in the elderly group than in the non-elderly group. No significant difference was observed in the postoperative complication rate between the two groups. The 5-year survival rates were comparable between the two groups.Conclusion:Favorable short- and long-term outcomes can be obtained based on cautious selection criteria for hepatectomy procedures, while considering patient age, in the treatment of elderly patients with HCC.
