Background:Complications are possible following percutaneous enteral feeding in head and neck cancer patients and otolaryngologists should be aware of these as well as the possibility of liver metastases from these cancers.Case report:A 53-year-old lady was treated by our service for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary origin. During radiotherapy treatment, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was inserted to facilitate patient feeding. Severe abdominal pain developed and persisted around site of PEG tube insertion, the cause of which was discovered to be newly developed liver metastases from the tumor being compressed by the tube.Conclusion:Liver metastases should be considered in patients developing persistent abdominal pain after PEG insertion.
