Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignancy of global importance and is associated with a high rate of mortality. Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease make it imperative to update the recommendations on the management of the disease. In order to draw evidence-based recommendations concering the diagnosis and management of hepatocellular carcinoma, the Brazilian Society of Hepatology has sponsored a single-topic meeting in Jo√£o Pessoa (PB). All the invited pannelists were asked to make a systematic review of the literature and to present topics related to the risk factors for its development, methods of screening, radiological diagnosis, staging systems, curative and palliative treatments and hepatocellular carcinoma in noncirrhotic liver. After the meeting, all panelists gathered together for the discussion of the topics and the elaboration of those recommendations. The text was subsequently submitted for suggestions and approval of all members of the Brazilian Society of Hepatology through its homepage. The present paper is the final version of the reviewed manuscript containing the recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Hepatology.
