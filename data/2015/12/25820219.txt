Background/aim:The definition of muscle atrophy (pre-sarcopenia) and its diagnostic criteria have not been well reported. To elucidate the frequency of pre-sarcopenia in chronic liver disease (CLD), we examined clinical features of Japanese CLD patients using abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings.Methods:We enrolled 988 CLD (736 with naïve hepatocellular carcinoma) and 372 normal control subjects (NCs). The psoas muscle area index [PI, psoas muscle area at the mid-L3 level in CT (cm(2))/height (m)(2)] was calculated using personal computer software. The cut-off level for pre-sarcopenia was defined as less than two standard deviations (SDs) below the mean PI value in the NCs under 55 years old [males, 45.6 ± 5.7 years (n = 61), 4.24 cm(2)/m(2); females, 47.0 ± 6.1 years (n = 49), 2.50 cm(2)/m(2)]. Elderly was defined as 65 years or older. Clinical features were retrospectively evaluated.Results:In the CLD group (HCV:HBV:HBV and HCV:alcohol:non-HBV and HCV = 652:88:7:82:159), pre-sarcopenia was observed in 15.3% of patients with chronic hepatitis (CH), 24.4% of those with liver cirrhosis (LC) Child-Pugh A, 37.7% of those with LC Child-Pugh B, and 37.1% of those with LC Child-Pugh C. A comparison between NC and CH by age (Conclusion:Retrospective evaluate for pre-sarcopenia was easy to perform with CT findings. Nutrition and exercise instruction should be considered for early stage and even non-elderly CLD as well as LC.
