Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3% of all cancer cases. RCCs usually metastasize to the lungs, bones, liver, or brain. Only <1% of patients with bone metastases manifested clavicular RCC metastases. Thus, clavicular metastasis as the initial presentation of RCC is extremely rare. We report a patient with RCC metastasis to the left clavicle, which was first presented with pain caused by a pathological fracture. Magnetic resonance image revealed a renal tumor, and technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy showed multiple osseous metastases. The patient eventually underwent surgery to remove the lateral end of the left clavicle and right kidney. Histopathology revealed renal tumor and clear cell carcinoma in the clavicle. Finally, we review 17 cases of clavicular metastases originating from different malignancies.
Clavicle; metastasis; pathological fracture; renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
