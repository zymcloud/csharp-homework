Prophylactic gastroduodenal artery (GDA) and right gastric artery (RGA) embolization for prevention of gastric ulceration in patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer undergoing Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) are relatively safe. Herein, we present a case of gastric perforation following prophylactic embolization of the GDA and RGA for SIRT in a 43-year-old male with sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma and multiple hepatic metastases.
