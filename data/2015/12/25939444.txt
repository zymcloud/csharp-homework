Background & aims:To investigate the role of post-operative intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients receiving narrow-margin hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located close to the major vessels.Methods:This exploratory study involved 181 HCC patients. Of them, 116 were treated with narrow-margin (Results:The 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 89.1 and 64.2% in Group A, 67.7 and 52.2% in Group B and 86.0 and 60.1% in Group C respectively. The OS and DFS of Group A and Group C patients surpassed those of Group B patients (Group A vs. B, P = 0.009 and P = 0.038; and Group C vs. B, P = 0.002 and P = 0.010). Patients in Groups A and C experienced significantly fewer early recurrences than did patients in Group B (P = 0.002). Furthermore, patients in Groups A and C experienced substantially fewer intrahepatic marginal (P = 0.048) and diffuse recurrences (P = 0.018) and extrahepatic metastases (P = 0.038) than did patients in Group B. No patient developed radiation-induced liver disease.Conclusions:Post-operative IMRT following narrow-margin hepatectomy may be a favourable therapy for both its safety profile and clinical benefit in patients with HCC located close to the major vessels.
