To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and treatment of human primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is important to explore novel HCC-associated genes. In the present study, we examined the expression of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14) in patients with HCC using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical techniques. The expression of USP14 in tumor tissues of patients with HCC was significantly higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous and normal liver tissues. It was also determined whether the expression profile of USP14 was associated with the clinical characteristics of HCC. Increased USP14 expression was associated with some clinicopatho-logical variables, such as advancing tumor stage. A Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that patients with HCC having a high USP14 expression had a significantly poorer prognosis after surgery than patients with lower USP14 expression levels. Knockdown of USP14 with the lentiviral vector delivery of shRNA in human hepatocarcinoma SMMC7721 cells suppressed cell proliferation, altered the cell cycle and induced cell apoptosis. Additionally, the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway was activated in HCC patients with USP14 overexpression. These findings strongly suggested that USP14 activation plays an oncogenic role in promoting tumor progression in HCC. Thus, our findings suggested that USP14 is involved in the progression of HCC and may be a useful therapeutic target in HCC. These findings likely reflect the key role that USP14 plays in the pathogenesis of HCC. Therefore, the identification of USP14 and USP14-driven genes may promote the investigation of its functional role to develop more effective therapies for HCC, especially advanced HCC.
