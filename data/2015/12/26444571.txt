Hepatitis E is a not uncommon cause of viral hepatitis globally but is relatively rare in Australia. Here, we report a case of acute hepatitis E that was acquired in Sydney and was part of a cluster believed to be infected locally. This is to our knowledge the first known outbreak of locally acquired hepatitis E in Australia. We discuss pathogenesis, clinical features and means by which further spread of infection can be limited.
