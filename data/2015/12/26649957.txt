Chronic hepatitis B has a complex natural history. The age at infection, comorbidities, coinfections, and other, yet to be identified factors, determine the probability of developing a chronic infection. The HBV virus can never be completely eliminated and remains in the hepatocytes for life. However, to reach an inactive carrier status is a realistic goal of the therapy. For HBV treatment, pegylated interferon and direct antivirals are available. To screen persons at risk and to vaccinate all of the population are important prophylactic measures. Chronic hepatitis C infection leads, in 30% of cases, to liver cirrhosis. Treatment is recommended from fibrosis stage Metavir 2. New DAA allows short treatment, with a high response rate and very few adverse effects.
