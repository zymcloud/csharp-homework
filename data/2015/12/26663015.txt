According to the most recent WHO classification of hepatocellular adenomas, a small percentage of inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas presents with mutation in the beta-catenin gene and are at higher risk of malignant transformation. It has been recognized that adenoma-like hepatocellular neoplasms with focal atypia, or in unusual clinical context present with similar cytogenetic and immunohistochemistry characteristics to well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas. We report a case of a well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasm with Dubin-Johnson-like pigment displaying histological features overlapping with a beta-catenin mutated inflammatory adenoma and a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma in a non-cirrhotic liver. The patient was a 48-year-old woman, who was asymptomatic, and had a clinical history of intra-uterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol, previous cancers and past oral contraceptive use. The recently proposed term "well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential" should be applied in such cases to highlight the different pathogenesis and risk of malignancy compared to the typical adenomas, and to suggest a careful and customized clinical management.
