Purpose:To evaluate and compare outcome of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), yttrium-90 radioembolization, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as bridge to liver transplant (LT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods and materials:We retrospectively reviewed patients treated at our institution with SBRT, TACE, RFA, or yttrium-90 as bridge to LT between 2006 and 2013. We analyzed radiologic and pathologic response and rate of failure after bridge therapy. Toxicities were reported using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 4.0. Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival after LT.Results:Sixty patients with a median age 57.5 years (range, 44-70) met inclusion criteria. Thirty-one patients (50.7%) had hepatitis C cirrhosis, 14 (23%) alcoholic cirrhosis, and 8 (13%) nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis. Patients received a total of 79 bridge therapies: SBRT (n = 24), TACE (n = 37), RFA (n = 9), and Y90 (n = 9). Complete response (CR) was 25% for TACE, 8.6% for SBRT, 22% for RFA, and 33% for Y90. Grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity occurred following TACE (n = 4) and RFA (n = 2). Transplant occurred at a median of 7.4 months after bridge therapy. Pathological response among 57 patients was 100% necrosis (n = 23, 40%), >50% necrosis (n = 20, 35%), Conclusion:All bridge therapies demonstrated good pathological response and DFS after LT. SBRT and Y90 demonstrated significantly less grade â‰¥3 acute toxicity. Choice of optimal modality depends on tumor size, pretreatment bilirubin level, Child-Pugh status, and patient preference. Such a decision is best made at a multidisciplinary tumor board as is done at our institution.
