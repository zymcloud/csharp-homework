Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is probably the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. The correct identification of HCV genotype has important clinical implications as a marker of responsiveness to antiviral therapy and serves as a guideline for the duration of treatment. The VERSANT HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay failed to detect HCV genotype 2k/1b. HCV genotype 2k/1b detection requires NS5B sequencing.
