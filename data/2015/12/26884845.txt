Objective:An investigation of the role of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and its associated miRNAs in vasculogenic mimicry (VM) in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The Bcl-2 expression plasmid was constructed for transfection into the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. Changes in the expression profiles of the miRNAs induced by Bcl-2 overexpression and their relationships with vasculogenic mimicry were analysed. Real-time PCR was performed in frozen tissue specimens from 42 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma to analyse the relationship between Bcl-2 and miR-27a; Immunohistochemical staining was performed in paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 97 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma to analyse the relationship between Bcl-2 expression and the expression of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) related molecules VEGF and HIF1A, which were target genes of the Bcl-2 related miRNAs.Results:Overexpression of Bcl-2 results in a significant change in the expression of a wide range of miRNAs, and the target genes of these miRNAs are composed of various vasculogenic mimicry related genes; Bcl-2 expression was positively correlated with the expression of the miRNA target genes VEGF and HIF1A. The expression of VEGF and HIF1A was significantly and positively correlated with VM and poor prognosis of patients.Conclusion:Bcl-2 may play a role in vasculogenic mimicry through miRNAs by targeting angiogenesis associated genes.
