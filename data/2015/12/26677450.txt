IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated fibroinflammatory disorder that can occur in almost all systemic organs and generally responds to corticosteroid treatment. We report a rare case of an IgG4-related intrapelvic mass lesion that responded to steroid therapy but caused a fistula between the sigmoid colon and bladder. A 71-year-old man was followed after treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) incidentally depicted left hydronephrosis with an ill-demarcated intrapelvic mass lesion. This lesion was histologically diagnosed as IgG4-RD by open biopsy, and peroral steroid therapy was initiated. One month after starting steroids, a colovesical fistula was detected by follow-up CT. A colostomy and urethral catheterization were emergently performed. The patient recovered and the mass lesion was drastically minimized by the initiation of glucocorticoids; however, he still needs urethral catheterization. IgG4-RD develops in various systemic organs and generally responds well to steroids. Clinicians must be watchful for the complications of responses to corticosteroids, such as fistulization, when the mass lesion of IgG4-RD is adjacent to multiple luminal organs.
