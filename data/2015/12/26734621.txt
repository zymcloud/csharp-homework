Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and oncological outcomes after laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) in patients with hepatitis B and C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with Child B or C cirrhosis.Methods:Between January 2004 and December 2013, LLR was performed in 232 patients with HCC. Of these, 141 patients also had pathologically proven cirrhosis. Sixteen patients with hepatitis B and C virus-related HCC with Child B or C cirrhosis were included in the study. Thirteen (81.3%) patients had Child B disease and three (18.8%) patients had Child C disease.Results:The median operation time was 215 min, the median estimated blood loss was 350 mL, and the median hospital stay was eight days. Three patients (18.8%) experienced complications after surgery. There was no postoperative mortality or reoperation. The mean follow-up period was 51.6 months. HCC recurred in eight (50%) patients: seven intrahepatic recurrences and one extrahepatic recurrence. The treatments for recurrence were laparoscopic reoperation in one (6.3%) patient, trans-catheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) in one (6.3%) patient, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in one (6.3%) patient, and combined TACE and RFA in four (25%) patients. The five-year postoperative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 84.4% and 41.7%, respectively.Conclusions:This study demonstrates that LLR can be safely used in patients with hepatitis B and C virus-related HCC and Child B or C cirrhosis, with acceptable survival outcomes.
