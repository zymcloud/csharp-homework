A novel aptamer-based amperometric nanobiosensor was designed for the sensitive and selective detection of A549 human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. The cytosensing was performed using a MUC1 aptamer probe with a bioconjugate, where the probe was fabricated by the covalent immobilization on a conducting polymer nanocomposite formed through the self-assembly of 4-([2,2':5',2''-terthiophen]-3'-yl) benzoic acid (TTBA) on AuNPs. A bioconjugate composed of hydrazine and aptamer attached on AuNPs was used to reveal the selectively amplified detection signal. The cells were quantitatively analyzed using chronoamperometric measurements, and the results were further compared and confirmed using microscopic and DPV methods based on silver staining cytosensing experiments. The proposed aptasensor showed a high affinity for MUC1 positive lung cancer cells (A549) compared with the other control cancer cells, including human prostate (PC3), MUC1 negative normal lung (MRC-5), and liver tumors (HepG2) cells. An excellent dynamic range of the proposed method was obtained from 15 to 1Ã—10(6) cells/mL with a detection limit of 8 cells/mL.
