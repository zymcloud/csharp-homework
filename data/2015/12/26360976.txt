The purpose of this study was to clarify the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with perflubutane in determining the histologic grade in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 147 surgically resected HCCs were dichotomized as well differentiated HCC (wd-HCC) and moderately- or poorly-differentiated HCC (mp-HCC). CEUS findings were evaluated during the arterial phase (vascularity, level and shape of enhancement), portal phase (presence or absence of washout) and post-vascular phase (echo intensity and shape). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the diagnosis of mp-HCC yielded area under the ROC curve (Az) values for arterial phase vascularity and portal phase washout of 0.910 and 0.807, respectively. The Az value for the combination of vascularity and washout for the diagnosis of mp-HCC was 0.956 (95% confidence interval, 0.910-0.979), corresponding to high diagnostic value. In conclusion, CEUS can provide high-quality imaging assessment for determining the histologic grade of HCCs.
