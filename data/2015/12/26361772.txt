Background:With technological innovations especially newer parenchymal transection devices, improved understanding of hepatic anatomy facilitated by better imaging, and reconstructions along with experiences gained from advanced minimal invasive procedures, laparoscopic liver surgery is gaining momentum with more than 5300 reported cases worldwide. Most of the published literature comprises nonanatomical and segmental resections with only few case series having major hepatic resections performed by minimally invasive approach. Aim of this article is to share our technique and experience of total laparoscopic major hepatectomy.Methods:It is a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of 56 patients, who underwent laparoscopic major hepatectomy for various indications during 2001 to 2013.Results:Of 56 patients operated, 37 had malignant disease and 19 had benign lesions with mean size of 6.0 ± 2.8 cm. Thirty-four patients underwent right hepatectomy and 22 left with mean age of 54.8 ± 15.3 years. Mean operating time was 227.4 ± 51.8 min with mean blood loss 265.5 ± 143.4 ml and transfusion needed in 10.7 %. Pringle's maneuver was used in 19.6 % with mean occlusion time of 34.0 ± 11.4 min. Liver-specific complications were observed in 12.5 % and overall complications in 19.6 %. Mean resection margin length in malignant lesions was 2.1 ± 0.9 cm, with Conclusion:Laparoscopic major liver resection is a formidable task. It requires considerable expertise in both, advanced laparoscopy, and liver surgery. It can be feasible, safe, and oncologically adequate in well-selected cases in experience hands.
