Approximately 20% of patients with colorectal cancer have metastatic disease at time of diagnosis, and another 25-35% develop metastases during the course of their disease. Liver, peritoneum, and lungs are the most common sites of metastases. We report the case of a 60-year-old female who presented with ocular metastasis 4 years after her initial curative-intent treatment for T3N1M0 rectal adenocarcinoma. After local eye radiation therapy, she received palliative systemic chemotherapy and enjoyed a good quality of life for 32 months before succumbing to progressive disease. Ocular metastasis of colorectal cancer is rare. When present, it usually occurs in the setting of diffuse hematogenous spread. In addition to local therapy, systemic chemotherapy should also be considered.
