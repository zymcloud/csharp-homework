Objective:To investigate the effect of Cdc42-shRNA plasmid to proliferation, migration, invasion and other malignant biological behavior in hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells.Methods:Cdc42-shRNA interfering vector transfected to SMMC-7721 cells with liposome method. The growth curve of transfected cells SMMC-7721, U6-control, Cdc42-shRNA2 was detected by MTT. The cells mobility was detected by wound healing experiment. Transwell chamber experiments to observe the cell migration and invasion. Detected AFP and PCNA expression level by Western blot.Human hepatoma SMMC-7721 transplanted subcutaneously in nude mouse, detected the expression of Cdc42 of the tumor by immunohistochemistry.t test was used to analyze the data between two groups.Results:The doubling time of Cdc42-shRNA2, U6-control and SMMC7721 was 42.7 h, 34.9 h and 35.1 h. The relative migration distance of Cdc42-shRNA2 and U6-control on 36 h was (47.1 ± 4.1)% and (86.6 ± 5.3)% (t=-10.21, PConclusion:Cdc42 interfere with plasmid significant changes in human malignant biological behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and reduces liver cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis of capacity.
