Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths around the world. Due to late diagnosis and development of drug resistance in patients suffering from HCC, development of more effective therapeutic strategies is inevitable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined apoptotic effect of 5'-Azacytidine (5'-AzaC) and alendronate (ALN) on Huh-7 HCC cell line and to explore differential expression at genomics and proteomics level. Incubation of HCC cell line with 5'-AzaC alone showed cell death in a time and dose dependent manner while in combination with ALN, increased cytotoxicity was observed. Up-regulation of CASP7(Caspase7) and LZTS1 (leucine zipper, putative tumor suppressor 1) and down-regulation of DNMT1(DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1) was noted in treated cells. Proteomic studies on the treated cells revealed altered expression of different proteins including peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), Annexin 5 (Anx5), Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP), Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein (TNF), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), Glutathione S transferase (GSTP1) and Heat shock protein60 (HSP60). Our study demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of 5'-AzaC and ALN drug combination on Huh-7 HCC cells suggesting such combinations may be explored as a possible therapeutic approach. Current study revealed that Huh-7 HCC cells are sensitive to 5'-AzaC and ALN drug combination and such combination approaches could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, we also report the expression of Anx5 exclusively in untreated cancerous cell line indicating the possibility of being used as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker.
