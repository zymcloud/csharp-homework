Atypical hepatocellular neoplasm (AHN) is an adenoma-like hepatic tumor that even occurs in noncirrhotic liver of males (any age) or females ≥ 50 years old, or associates focal atypical features. In this article, 2 unusual cases diagnosed in elderly cirrhotic patients, unrelated to steroids, are presented. The first case was incidentally diagnosed in an 83-year-old female. During laparoscopic surgery for cholecystectomy, hemoperitoneum was installed and laparotomy was necessary to remove a 70-mm nodular encapsulated hepatic tumor that was microscopically composed by hepatocyte-like cells with clear cytoplasm, arranged in 1- to 2-cell-thick plates and intermingled with areas of peliosis, negative for alpha fetoprotein (αFP), p53, and keratin 7, with low Ki67 index and intact reticulin framework. The second case was incidentally diagnosed at ultrasound examination in a 66-year-old male. The surgical specimen was a 50-mm solid multinodular tumor that microscopically consisted of 3-cell-thick plates of hepatocyte-like cells with acinar, pseudoglandular, and trabecular architecture, intermingled with peliotic areas, without nuclear atypia and disintegrated reticulin framework. Both of the cases occurred in cirrhotic liver. The tumor cells were marked by AE1/AE3 keratin, displayed a Ki67 index
