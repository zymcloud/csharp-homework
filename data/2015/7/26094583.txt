The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus has been increasingly used as immunosuppressants for recipients of solid organ transplants. Over the years, potential advantages unique to this class of immunosuppressants have been recognized, including chemoprevention by virtue of their antiproliferative effects. Prevention of malignancy after transplant through mTOR inhibitor-based immunosuppression may have a specific practical application in transplant recipients with preexisting malignancy including hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma. This review will reveal how the biochemistry of the mTOR pathway, as it pertains to chemoprevention, can support a clinical role for mTOR inhibitors in the prevention of malignancies, recurrent or de novo, after solid organ transplantation in selected patients.
