Aim:To assess serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) as a marker of cirrhosis and risk of progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A COMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to test 187 patients with chronic liver diseases at the time point of first evaluation. The selected patients included 72 with chronic hepatitis B infection, 75 with chronic hepatitis C infection, 22 with primary biliary cirrhosis, 7 with autoimmune hepatitis type 1, and 11 with alcoholic liver disease. Demographic, biochemical, histological and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded at the first evaluation. One hundred and forty-seven patients were followed for a median [interquartile range (IQR)] duration of 96.5 (102) mo. The clinical, biochemical and histological data, as well as the development of cirrhosis, HCC according to internationally accepted criteria and in case of death, a liver-related cause during the follow-up period, were recorded at the electronic database of our clinic. COMP determination was also performed in 43 healthy individuals who served as the control study group.Results:COMP positivity (> 15 U/L) was detected in 22%-36% among chronic liver disease groups. Strikingly, almost 83% of COMP-positive patients were cirrhotic at baseline, independently of cause of liver disease. Among the patients who developed HCC during follow-up, 73.7% (14/19) were COMP positive at baseline. COMP positivity was significantly associated with older age (P Conclusion:Elevated COMP levels are strongly associated with cirrhosis and HCC progression. Serum COMP is a new promising non-invasive biomarker for HCC risk assessment in surveillance programs.
