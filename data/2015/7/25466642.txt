To retrospectively compare the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound (US)- and computer tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) in treating patients with non-operation hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Forty patients with non-operation HCC who were treated with US-guided PRFA (20 patients with 24 HCC lesions) or CT-guided PRFA (20 patients with 27 HCC lesions) were enrolled in this study. Follow-up was performed with US and CT/MRI. Complete ablation rate, local recurrence rate, and overall survival rate were used to evaluate the efficacy of the two therapeutic choices. The PRFA-related complications including hilar bile duct injury, sepsis, liver failure, renal dysfunction, peritoneal hemorrhage, and skin burn were assessed. The operation time of CT-guided group was significantly longer than that of the US-guided group (P 0.05). The differences in complete ablation rate (79.2 vs. 88.9 %, P > 0.05) and local recurrence rate (16.7 vs. 14.8 %, P > 0.05) between US- and CT-guided groups were not statistically significant. In the US-guided group, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 85, 74, and 68 %, respectively, while they were 84, 72, and 58 % in the CT-guided group. The differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). No severe complications were found in the two groups. Both US- and CT-guided PRFA are safe and effective therapies for patients with HCC when surgical options are precluded.
