Autophagy is a highly-regulated, conserved cellular process for the degradation of intracellular components in lysosomes to maintain the energetic balance of the cell. It is a pro-survival mechanism that plays an important role during development, differentiation, apoptosis, ageing and innate and adaptive immune response. Besides, autophagy has been described to be involved in the development of various human diseases, e.g., chronic liver diseases and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver diseases. It has recently been described that HCV, like other RNA viruses, hijacks the autophagic machinery to improve its replication. However, the mechanisms underlying its activation are conflicting. HCV replication and assembly occurs at the so-called membranous web that consists of lipid droplets and rearranged endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes including single-, double- and multi-membrane vesicles. The double-membrane vesicles have been identified to contain NS3, NS5A, viral RNA and the autophagosomal marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, corroborating the involvement of the autophagic pathway in the HCV life-cycle. In this review, we will highlight the crosstalk of the autophagosomal compartment with different steps of the HCV life-cycle and address its implications on favoring the survival of infected hepatocytes.
