Despite significant reduction of cardiovascular events by statin treatment, substantial residual risk persists, driving emerging needs for the development of new therapies. We identified a novel cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, K-312, that raises HDL and lowers LDL cholesterol levels in animals. K-312 also suppresses hepatocyte expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), a molecule that increases LDL cholesterol. We explored the underlying mechanism for the reduction of PCSK9 expression by K-312. K-312 inhibited in vitro human plasma CETP activity (IC50; 0.06 Î¼M). Administration of K-312 to cholesterol-fed New Zealand White rabbits for 18 wk raised HDL cholesterol, decreased LDL cholesterol, and attenuated aortic atherosclerosis. Our search for additional beneficial characteristics of this compound revealed that K-312 decreases PCSK9 expression in human primary hepatocytes and in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. siRNA silencing of CETP in HepG2 did not compromise the suppression of PCSK9 by K-312, suggesting a mechanism independent of CETP. In HepG2 cells, K-312 treatment decreased the active forms of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1 and -2) that regulate promoter activity of PCSK9. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that K-312 decreased the occupancy of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 on the sterol regulatory element of the PCSK9 promoter. PCSK9 protein levels decreased by K-312 treatment in the circulating blood of cholesterol-fed rabbits, as determined by two independent mass spectrometry approaches, including the recently developed, highly sensitive parallel reaction monitoring method. New CETP inhibitor K-312 decreases LDL cholesterol and PCSK9 levels, serving as a new therapy for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease.
