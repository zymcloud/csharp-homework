Background:Some studies have linked colorectal cancer to metal exposure.Aims:Our objective was to evaluate the element distribution in colorectal adenocarcinoma biopsies, adjacent non-tumour tissues, and healthy controls.Methods:The study is a case-control study which compared the element distribution in colon biopsies from two groups of patients: with colorectal cancer (2 types of samples: colorectal cancer biopsies and adjacent non-tumour tissues) and healthy controls. Fifteen metal concentrations (Aluminium, Boron, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Nickel, Lead, Selenium, Silicon, Titanium, Vanadium, and Zinc) were quantified by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry.Results:104 patients were included: 76 in the colorectal cancer group, 28 in the healthy control group. Among the 15 elements analyzed, only boron, chromium, zinc, silicon and magnesium were found at clearly detectable concentrations. Colorectal tumour biopsies had significantly higher concentrations of magnesium as compared to adjacent non-tumour or healthy tissues. Zinc concentration followed the same trend but differences were not statistically significant. In addition, concentration of silicon was higher in colorectal cancer tissue than in healthy non-cancer tissue, while chromium was mostly found in adjacent non-tumour tissue.Conclusion:Magnesium, chromium, zinc and silicon were found in noteworthy concentrations in colorectal tumour. Their potential role in colorectal carcinogenesis should be explored.
