Background:The role of liver resection (LR) of hepatocellular carcinoma with macroscopic vascular thrombosis (MVT) remains controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the presence of MVT should still be considered a contraindication for LR.Methods:Retrospective study was carried out on 62 patients who underwent LR and thrombectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by MVT. Of the 62 patients, 15 (36.5%) had tumor thrombus (TT) in the peripheral portal vein (Vp1), 5 (12.2%) in second branch (Vp2), and 21 (51.3%) in the first branch/portal vein trunk (Vp3), while on the hepatic/cava vein side, 8 (12.9%) had TT in the main trunk of the hepatic veins (Vv2) and 3 (4.8%) had TT reaching the vena cava/right atrium (Vv3).Results:Perioperative major morbidity was 14.5%, while in-hospital mortality was 4.8%. Overall, 1, 3, and 5-year survival rates were 53.3%, 30.1%, and 20%, and disease-free survival rates were 31.7%, 20.8%, and 15.6%, respectively. There were no differences in survival about the MVT localized in Vp1, Vp2, or Vp3 (P = .77), while we found a statistical trend between patients with Vv2 and Vv3 (P = .06).Conclusion:Surgical resection seems to be justified in these patients, and the presence of MVT should no longer be considered an absolute contraindication for LR.
