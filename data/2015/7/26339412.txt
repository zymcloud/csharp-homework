Objective:To investigate the diagnostic values of soluble cluster of differentiation 163 (sCD163) in patients with liver failure or various inflammations.Methods:Serum samples were collected from patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University from October 2013 to January 2015 for treatment of with liver diseases, including liver failure (n=38), hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced liver cancer (HBsAg positive) (n=40), HBV-induced hepatic cirrhosis (HBsAg positive) (n=40), chronic hepatitis B (n=38), HBV carrier (n=40), fatty liver patients without HBV infection (n=40), chronic glomerulonephritis (n=38), community acquired pneumonia (n=38) and acute pancreatitis (n=38). The CD163/sCD163 was determined using commercial ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.Results:Significant decrease was noticed in the sCD163 in patients with fatty liver and HBV carrier compared with that of patients with chronic hepatitis B (P < 0.05). Compared with the healthy controls, the level of sCD163 was remarkably increased in the other groups (P < 0.05). The serum sCD163 in patients with HBV-induced liver cancer showed statistical difference compared with those of the patients with fatty liver, HBV carrier, as well as those with liver failure (P < 0.05). The expression of sCD163 was remarkably elevated in patients with liver failure compared with the patients with liver cancer, HBV-induced hepatic cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, fatty liver, or HBV carrier (P < 0.05). No significant difference was noticed in the sCD163 in patients with chronic hepatitis B, community acquired pneumonia, chronic glomerulonephritis, and acute pancreatitis (P > 0.05).Conclusions:sCD163 is a sensitive marker protein for liver failure. The elevation of sCD163 was closely related to the progression of the liver failure. No statistical difference was noticed in the sCD163 in patients with inflammatory disorders, indicating sCD163 showed no organ specificity.
