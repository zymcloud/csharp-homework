Background and aims:Limited data is available from India on outcome and efficacy of tenofovir and entecavir in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis when used for prolonged time. We report the long-term efficacy and outcome of these antiviral drugs in patients with chronic HBV infection, with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed laboratory and clinical data of 400 HBV-related cirrhotic patients without access to liver transplantation, who were treated with tenofovir/entecavir therapy, from January 2007 to January 2014. Two hundred and ten (52.5 %) patients had at least one of the components of decompensation at baseline. Two hundred and twenty (55 %) and 180 (45 %) patients were initiated tenofovir and entecavir, respectively. Follow up period was 45 (12-68) months for tenofovir and 36 (11-60) months for entecavir.Results:At the end of 1 year, levels of HBV DNA Conclusion:Tenofovir and entecavir were effective and potent drugs for prolonged treatment of HBV cirrhosis and improved the overall clinical course.
