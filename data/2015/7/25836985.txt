Background & aims:Despite the significant association between obesity and several cancers, it has been difficult to establish an association between obesity and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC often have ascites, making it a challenge to determine body mass index (BMI) accurately, and many factors contribute to the development of HCC. We performed a case-control study to investigate whether obesity early in adulthood affects risk, age of onset, or outcomes of patients with HCC.Methods:We interviewed 622 patients newly diagnosed with HCC from January 2004 through December 2013, along with 660 healthy controls (frequency-matched by age and sex) to determine weights, heights, and body sizes (self-reported) at various ages before HCC development or enrollment as controls. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the independent effects of early obesity on risk for HCC and patient outcomes, respectively. BMI was calculated, and patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or greater were considered obese.Results:Obesity in early adulthood (age, mid-20s to mid-40s) is a significant risk factor for HCC. The estimated odds ratios were 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.4), 2.3 (95% CI, 1.2-4.4), and 3.6 (95% CI, 1.5-8.9) for the entire population, for men, and for women, respectively. Each unit increase in BMI at early adulthood was associated with a 3.89-month decrease in age at HCC diagnosis (P Conclusions:Early adulthood obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing HCC at a young age in the absence of major HCC risk factors, with no effect on outcomes of patients with HCC.
