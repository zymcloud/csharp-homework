Objective:The purpose of this study was to describe the technique for evaluating hepatic arterial blood pressure changes during lobar chemoembolization using antireflux devices. Intraprocedural femoral and hepatic arterial blood pressures were measured and chemoembolization terminated when significant reduction in the difference occurred. Liver toxicity was evaluated. Eleven patients underwent 24 lobar chemoembolization procedures. Early termination of delivery occurred in 11 of 24 (46%) procedures in which the mean relative reduction in systemic-hepatic arterial pressure differential was 48%. The mean liver toxicity score was 1.2. This compares to delivery of the entire dose in 13 of 24 (54%) procedures in which the mean relative reduction in systemic-hepatic arterial pressure differential was 12% with a mean liver toxicity score of 1.2.Conclusion:When antireflux devices are used, intraprocedural assessment of hepatic artery blood pressure changes may be a useful embolization safety endpoint.
