Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as tumor suppressors and might provide an efficient strategy for annihilating tumor cells. Nevertheless, the potential role of miR-325 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown.Methods:Using RT-PCR, immunoblots invasion assays and bioinformatics strategies, we investigated the potential role of miR-325 in HCC.Results:We showed that miR-325 was decreased and HMGB1 was increased in 99 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. MiR-325 inhibition promoted cell invasion and proliferation, while miR-325 upregulation inhibited cell invasion and proliferation by using transwell and CCK8 assays. We further showed that HMGB1 might be a direct target of miR-325 and is negatively regulated by miR-325. Down-regulation of miR-325 predicts poor prognosis for HCC patients.Conclusions:These findings implied that miR-325 regulates cell invasion and proliferation via targeting HMGB1 and may be a potential prognostic marker for HCC.Virtual slides:The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/4655707031717989.
