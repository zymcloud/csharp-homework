Objectives:To evaluate the prognostic significance of the pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who underwent salvage chemotherapy.Methods:We reviewed 200 metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients who received salvage chemotherapy at our five affiliate institutions between 2003 and 2011. The associations of pretreatment clinicopathological factors, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, with cancer-specific survival and overall survival from the start of chemotherapy were assessed. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis.Results:A total of 15 cases with missing data were excluded. Among the remaining 185 patients, 157 died during follow up, with a median survival of 13.0 months. Multivariate analysis showed that the pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ≥3, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2 and liver metastasis were independent poor prognostic factors, both for cancer-specific survival and overall survival. A prognostic model predicting overall survival was constructed based on the number of these three variables (0, 1 and ≥ 2). The classified patients showed significantly different overall survival (each P < 0.0001, log-rank test), with Harrell's concordance index as high as 0.81.Conclusions:Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio elevation was an independent poor prognostic factor for metastatic urothelial carcinoma undergoing salvage chemotherapy. Our newly constructed prognostic model including the pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio proved to be an excellent discriminator of overall survival.
