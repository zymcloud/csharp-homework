Background & aims:In patients with cirrhosis, the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depends upon age, gender and the etiology of liver disease. Few studies are available in Caucasian patients with alcoholic or metabolic cirrhosis without viral hepatitis.Methods:Cross-sectional clinical data from 905 HCV- and HBV-negative Caucasian patients with alcoholic or metabolic cirrhosis were prospectively collected in four French centres. The risk factors for HCC were identified by logistic regression analysis in the whole population and in a nested case-control study.Results:The etiology of cirrhosis was alcoholic (48%), metabolic (7%) or mixed (45%). Patients were predominantly male (80%), mean age 62 years old and 31% had HCC. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 27 ± 5 and 30% were obese at inclusion. The maximum BMI reached throughout life was 31 ± 6 and 63% had been obese. Ninety percent of the population had daily alcohol consumption, 73% were smokers. Hepatocellular carcinoma was independently related to male gender (P Conclusions:Beside diabetes, male gender and age, a past history of obesity, but not an existing overweight, as well as exposure to tobacco and elevated transaminases were three risk factors which could improve the strategy for HCC screening in Caucasian cirrhotic patients without hepatitis B or C.
