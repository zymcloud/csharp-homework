The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) relies on imaging tools and biopsy. It usually does not present to be a challenge.Here we report the case of a 69-year-old patient with HCC, initially mistaken for a gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma (HAC), with a favorable outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The initial presentation (clinical signs, morphological features, and histological findings) led to the diagnosis of a gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy by epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine protocol was administered. Biological (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] decreased by a factor of 10), radiological (-35% RECIST), and histological (20% of necrosis) responses were observed. Complete surgical resection was then performed. The final pathological diagnosis was a well-differentiated HCC, staged pT4 N0 (0/24) R0.There are no guidelines as to how such tumors should be managed. Nonetheless, neoadjuvant chemotherapy yielded a good outcome. This observation stresses the importance of the final pathological findings and addresses the issue of neoadjuvant therapy in some cases of HCC.
