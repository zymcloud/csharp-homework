Aim:To describe a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accompanied by hypersplenism and portal hypertension caused by macroglobulinemia, who underwent splenectomy followed by hepatectomy.Case report:A 74-year-old man was admitted to our Hospital. He had previously developed primary macroglobulinemia, which had been completely cured by chemotherapy. At admission, he had a low platelet count (52 × 10(3)/μl), and his liver function was impaired. Imaging showed a 5-cm-sized tumor, an esophageal varix, and splenomegaly, but not liver cirrhosis. The patient underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism and portal hypertension; the weight of his spleen was 2,400 g. After splenectomy, his platelet count increased to 259 × 10(3)/μl and his liver function was improved. He safely underwent hepatectomy for HCC. The patient was discharged 14 days later without morbidity.Conclusion:These findings suggest that hepatectomy following splenectomy for hypersplenism and portal hypertension caused by macroglobulinemia, may effectively cure HCC in patients with liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia.
Splenectomy; hepatocellular carcinoma; hypersplenism; primary macroglobulinemia.
