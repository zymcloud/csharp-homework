Background and aims:Researches have shown that miRNAs have been proposed as novel diagnostic biomarkers for classification and prognostic stratification of HCC. However, whether or not miR-431 contributes to the progression of HCC remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of miR-431 in HCC.Methods:MiR-431 expression in 95 HCC cases and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, statistical analysis was performed to identify the correlations between expression of miR-431 and a variety of clinicopathological parameters and patient recurrence. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of miR-431 as a biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prediction of disease deterioration.Results:MiR-431 was markedly down-regulated in the HCC samples (1.1885 ± 0.75867) compared with corresponding adjacent tumor tissues (1.7957 ± 0.89333, P Conclusions:The down-expression of miR-431 is partially responsible for a series of clinicopathological features which may be tightly correlated with the progression of HCC. Thus, expression of miR-431 may be proposed as a new factor in association with the progression of HCC.
