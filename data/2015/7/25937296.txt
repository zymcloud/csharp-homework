Purpose:To compare the utility of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA), a liver-specific magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agent, versus gadobutrol for treatment response evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radioembolization.Materials and methods:This prospective study included 50 patients with HCC undergoing radioembolization. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and MR imaging with gadobutrol and Gd-EOB-DTPA on 2 consecutive days before radioembolization and 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 270 days after radioembolization. The standard of reference indicating tumor progression was CT combined with either α-fetoprotein or γ-glutamyltransferase. Gadobutrol-enhanced MR imaging, Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging without late phase imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-), and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging with late phase imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA+) were evaluated by 2 radiologists in consensus using a 4-point scale: 1 = definitely no tumor progression; 2 = probably no tumor progression; 3 = probably tumor progression; 4 = definitely tumor progression. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed with receiver operating characteristic analysis.Results:Tumor progression was detected in 14 of 82 study visits according to the reference standard. Pairwise comparison of the area under the curve showed a tendency toward a larger area under the curve for Gd-EOB-DTPA+ compared with gadobutrol (P = .056). Sensitivity and specificity were higher in Gd-EOB-DTPA+ (0.929 and 0.971) than in Gd-EOB-DTPA- (0.786 and 0.941) or gadobutrol (0.643 and 0.956). In 2 cases, tumor progression was detected by Gd-EOB-DTPA+ and by an increase in α-fetoprotein, but not by CT, gadobutrol, or Gd-EOB-DTPA-.Conclusions:Gd-EOB-DTPA+ MR imaging was not inferior to gadobutrol-enhanced MR imaging in therapy response evaluation after radioembolization and may allow a more accurate detection of early HCC recurrence in single cases.
