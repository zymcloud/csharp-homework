Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are normally expressed in testis and overexpressed in various tumor types. However, their biological function is largely unknown. OY-TES-1, one of cancer/testis (CT) antigens, is reported overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). And we assumed that OY-TES-1 contribute to oncogenesis and progression of HCC. In this study, we knocked down OY-TES-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) in HCC cell lines (HepG2 and BEL-7404) to verify this assumption and evaluate its potential as therapeutic targets for HCC. We showed that down regulation of OY-TES-1 decreased cell growth, induced the G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis, and prevented migration and invasion in the two HCC cell lines. Further analysis revealed that down regulation of OY-TES-1 increased expression of apoptosis-regulated protein caspase-3, and decreased expression of cell cycle-regulated protein cyclin E, migration/invasion-regulated proteins MMP2 and MMP9. These findings may shed light on the gene therapy about the OY-TES-1 expression in HCC cells.
