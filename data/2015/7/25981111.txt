Objective:To determine whether the necrotic tumor cell-stimulated macrophages (NTCSM) could elicit specific immune response.Methods:Mice were immunized with the necrotic H22 tumor cell lysate-stimulated macrophages and the specific immune responses against the same tumor challenge were examined. The morphologic characteristics were observed with the transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscopy. The expression of CD14, CD68, CD80 and CD86 were detected with the flow cytometer. The cytotoxicity and cytokine production of splenocytes were measured with the MTT assay and ELISA assay respectively.Results:Our research results reveal that NTCSMs are larger cells which generally generate spherical and elongated protrusions, folding membrane, and vesicles on their surface. Also, abundant lysosomes, secondary lysosomes, phagosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and lipid bodies were found in their cytoplasm. The flow cytometry results show that the necrotic H22 tumor cell lysate could enhance the expression of CD14 and CD86 molecules and the NTCSM was characterized by the expression of CD14+/-CD68+CD80-CD86+. After the mice were vaccinated with NTCSMs, the tumor forming rate, tumor volume and weight of the NTCSM-vaccinated group were significantly lower than those of the sterile saline-injected group and untreated macrophage-vaccinated group (pConclusion:Our results indicated that NTCSMs could elicit specific cellular immune responses in vivo.
