Mortalin is a stress chaperone belonging to the Hsp70 family of proteins. Frequently enriched in cancers, it is a multifunctional protein and regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, mitochondrial functions, and the activity of tumor suppressor protein p53. In the present study, we investigated circulating mortalin and its autoantibody in normal, cirrhosis, and cancerous liver. We found that although mortalin is enriched in liver cancer cells and tumors, it is not detected in the serum of either the liver cirrhosis or cancer patients. In contrast, mortalin autoantibody was detected in patients' sera and showed significant correlation with the occurrence of cirrhosis. It is suggested as a potential noninvasive marker for liver cirrhosis.
