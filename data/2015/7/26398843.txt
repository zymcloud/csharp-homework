Objective:To evaluate the characteristics of primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) teed by the right renal capsular artery(RRCA) and to assess the technical success rate,tumor response and complications in patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) via the RRCA with or without other extrahepatic arteries and/or intrahepatic arteries.Methods:From July 2010 to February 2014,23 patients were treated by TACE via the RRCA. We evaluate the characteristics of tumor, the blood supply situation of RRCA and the technical success rate, complications and tumor response of TACE via the RRCA.Results:Tumor size was 90.60+/-48.23 mm. Of the 23 rumors,3 were located in segment V, 11 in segment VI and 9 in segment VII.8 cases were found to have RRCA supply at the first TACE session. The technical success rate was 100%.No severe complication occurred in 23 patients. Among the 23 patients, CR, PR, SD and PD were achieved in 3(13.0%), 10(43.5%), 2(8.7%), 8(34.8%) respectively. The objective response rate was 56.5%. The overall cumulative 6 month, 1-3-and 5-year survival rates and the median survival time were 82.6%, 52.2%,21.7%, 17.4% and 16.8 months, respectively.Conclusion:RRCA can participate in tumor blood supply when it located in the right hepatic lobe and with a larger diameter, or it was small but located in the bare area.Superselective intubation of RRCA with microcatheter and precise TACE via right renal capsular artery is safe ,effective and feasible.
