Purpose:To compare the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features, including those on diffusion-weighted (DW) and T2-weighted images, in differentiating between hypovascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and dysplastic nodules seen as hypointense nodules at hepatobiliary phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging.Materials and methods:The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the need to obtain informed patient consent. There were 53 patients (39 men and 14 women; age range, 32-75 years) with histologically proven hypovascular HCCs (n = 25) and/or dysplastic nodules (n = 31) who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging at 3.0-T between March 2011 and January 2014. Images of 25 HCCs and 31 dysplastic nodules were analyzed for nodule size; signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted, portal venous phase, and DW (b value = 800 sec/mm(2)) images; and intralesional fat. Correlations between the hyperintensity grade of lesions and the liver-to-lesion signal intensity ratio at T2-weighted and DW imaging were determined by means of analysis with generalized estimating equations.Results:Hyperintensity at T2-weighted and DW imaging and hypointensity in the portal venous phase were significant features for differentiating hypovascular HCCs from dysplastic nodules (P Conclusion:Hyperintensity at DW imaging could be a useful MR imaging feature for differentiating hypovascular HCCs from dysplastic nodules seen as hypointense nodules at gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging.
