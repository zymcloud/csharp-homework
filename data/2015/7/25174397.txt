Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is linked to tumor progression, metastasis and poor survival rates. Here we report the role of Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) in the regulation of NSCLC cell invasiveness and tumor metastasis. CIP4 was highly expressed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines and normal lung epithelial cell lines. Stable knockdown (KD) of CIP4 in lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells, expressing wild-type EGFR, led to increased EGFR levels on the cell surface and defects in sustained activation of Erk kinase in H1299 cells treated with EGF. CIP4 localized to leading edge projections in NSCLC cells, and CIP4 KD cells displayed defects in EGF-induced cell motility and invasion through extracellular matrix. This correlated with reduced expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in CIP4 KD cells compared with control. In xenograft assays, CIP4 silencing had no effect on tumor growth but resulted in significant defects in spontaneous metastases to the lungs from these subcutaneous tumors. This correlated with reduced expression of the Erk target gene Zeb1 and the Zeb1 target gene MMP-2 in CIP4 KD tumors compared with control. CIP4 also enhanced rates of metastasis to the liver and lungs in an intrasplenic experimental metastasis model. In human NSCLC tumor sections, CIP4 expression was elevated greater than or equal to twofold in 43% of adenocarcinomas and 32% of squamous carcinomas compared with adjacent normal lung tissues. Analysis of microarray data for NSCLC patients also revealed that high CIP4 transcript levels correlated with reduced overall survival. Together, these results identify CIP4 as a positive regulator of NSCLC metastasis and a potential poor prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma.
