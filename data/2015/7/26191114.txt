Background:Obstruction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is infrequent, membranous obstruction of the IVC (MOIVC) being one of its rare causes. Early diagnosis is important, as it can lead to hepatic congestion, cirrhosis and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and can predispose to development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in severe cases.Case report:We report a case of membranous IVC obstruction at the junction of hepatic and suprahepatic segments in a young male with extensive collateralization and venous aneurysms. Unique findings involved antegrade and retrograde flow during respiration in the upper part of intrahepatic IVC proximal to a large collateral vein as well as prostatic and urethral congestion leading to intermittent urinary hesitancy, which have not yet been described in such cases.Conclusions:MOIVC is a rare cause of IVC obstruction with typical radiological features. Early diagnosis and management is required due to risk of cirrhosis and HCC. Antegrade and retrograde flow may be seen in incomplete MOIVC above the level of a large collateral vein and it may lead to prostatic and urethral congestion.
