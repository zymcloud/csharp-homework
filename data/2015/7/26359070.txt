Objective:To investigate the risk factors of Budd-Chiari syndrome (B-CS) complicated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinical data of 30 patients with B-CS complicated with HCC treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from December 2012 to November 2014 were analyzed retrospectively, 106 another patients were selected randomly as control group in the same term. Gender, age, medical history, type of B-CS, hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, Child-Pugh classification, portal vein diameter, HBV infection and drinking history were recorded and analyzed between the two groups. Univariate analysis and unconditional Logistic regression model were performed to screen corresponding risk factors. Area under curve (AUC) was calculated according to receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the diagnostic value of each indicator.Results:Univariate analysis showed that there were no statistical differences in gender (χ² =0.001), age (t=0.317), medical history (t=-0.906), type of B-CS (χ² =2.894), ALT (t=-1.581), Child-Pugh classification (Z=-0.777), HBV infection (χ² =0.016) and drinking history (χ² =0.285) between the two groups (all P > 0.05), but the hemoglobin (t=3.370) and albumin (t=2.152) in HCC group were lower and AST (t=-2.425) and portal vein diameter (t=-2.554) were higher than that in the other group, and the differences were statistically significant (all P Conclusion:Hemoglobin, AST and portal vein diameter are independent risk factors of B-CS complicated with HCC.
