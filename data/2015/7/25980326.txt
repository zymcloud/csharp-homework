Objectives:Appropriate patient selection is important to achieving good outcomes and obviating futile surgery in patients with huge (≥10 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors of futile outcomes, defined as death within 3 months of surgery or within 1 year from early recurrence following hepatectomy for huge HCC.Methods:The outcomes of 149 patients with huge HCCs who underwent resection during 1995-2012 were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify preoperative independent predictors of futility.Results:Independent predictors of 3-month mortality (18.1%) were: total bilirubin level >34 μmol/l [P = 0.0443; odds ratio (OR) 16.470]; platelet count of Conclusions:According to the present data, among patients submitted to hepatectomy for huge HCC, those with a high bilirubin level, low platelet count and portal vein thrombosis are at higher risk for futile surgery. The presence of portal vein tumour thrombosis should be regarded as a relative contraindication to surgery.
