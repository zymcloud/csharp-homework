Background and study aims:Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is one of the alternative methods for tissue sampling of liver solid mass. However, the diagnostic efficacy using cytology alone was limited. In this study, we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) as a percutaneous biopsy rescue for liver solid mass.Patients and methods:The EUS-FNB using core biopsy needle for liver solid mass was performed prospectively for patients who were failure to acquire a tissue or achieve a diagnosis using percutaneous liver biopsy. The primary outcome was the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNB for malignancy and specific tumor type. The secondary outcomes were the median numbers of passes required to establish a diagnosis, the proportions of patients in whom immunohistochemical (IHC) stain was possible and obtained adequate specimen, and safety of EUS-FNB.Results:Twenty-one patients (12 women; mean age, 63 years [range, 37-81]) underwent EUS-FNB for solid liver masses. The median number of needle passes was 2.0 (range, 1-5). On-site cytology and cytology with Papanicolaou stain showed malignancy in 16 patients (76.2%) and 17 patients (81.0%), respectively. In histology with HE stain, 19 patients (90.5%) were diagnosed malignancy and optimal to IHC stain. The overall diagnostic accuracy for malignancy and specific tumor type were 90.5% and 85.7%, respectively. No complications were seen.Conclusions:EUS-FNB with core biopsy needle for solid liver mass may be helpful in the management of patients who are unable to diagnose using percutaneous liver biopsy.
