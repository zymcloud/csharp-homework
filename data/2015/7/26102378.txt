Objective:The purposes of this article are to describe the pathologic and radiologic features of small nodular lesions and to offer insight into the multistep process of hepatocarcinogenesis by describing the progression of imaging changes that link dysplastic nodules and early hepatocellular carcinoma, (HCC) to small HCC that has progressed.Conclusion:Nodules larger than 1 cm found during ultrasound surveillance of a cirrhotic liver should be investigated further with diagnostic imaging. Contrast-enhanced CT and dynamic MRI are the primary diagnostic studies for the diagnosis of HCC; contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be used as an alternative test. If a nodule has the typical hallmark of hypervascularity in the hepatic arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phase, a definitive diagnosis of HCC can be made. Nodules found during ultrasound surveillance that are smaller than 1 cm can be followed with ultrasound examinations at intervals of 3-6 months.
