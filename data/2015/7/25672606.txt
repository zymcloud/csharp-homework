A high preoperative peripheral blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been reported to be a predictor of poor survival in patients with various cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive significance of the NLR in patients undergoing hepatectomy for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). From 2005 to 2011, 322 patients who underwent hepatectomy for ICC were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinicopathological parameters, including NLR, were evaluated to identify predictors of overall and recurrence-free survival after hepatectomy. The best cutoff for NLR was 2.49, and 177 of 322 patients (54.9 %) had an NLR â‰¥ 2.49. The 5-year survival rate after hepatectomy was 51.1 % in patients with NLR
