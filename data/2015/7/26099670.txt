Fludeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT has not been shown to offer additional benefit in the initial diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, but studies show benefit of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in initial staging and patient prognosis. There is evidence for (18)F-FDG PET and (18)F-FDG PET/CT in staging and prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer. (18)F-FDG PET/CT has shown promise in staging liver malignancies by detecting extrahepatic metastasis. There is evidence supporting the ability of PET/CT in predicting prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Evidence is evolving for the role of (18)F-FDGPET/CT in predicting prognosis and survival in patients with colorectal liver metastasis.
