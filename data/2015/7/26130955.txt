The role of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is still controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate surgical downstaging after concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) for LAPC by measuring the objective changes after treatment. From January 2003 through July 2011, 54 patients with LAPC underwent neoadjuvant CCRT. Computed tomography findings of the tumor size, including major vessel invasion, were analyzed before and after CCRT. Among the total recruited patients, 14 had borderline resectable malignancy and another 40 were unresectable before CCRT. After CCRT, a partial response was achieved in four patients. Stable disease and further disease progression were achieved in 36 and 14 patients, respectively. Tumor size showed no significant difference before and after CCRT (3.6 ± 1.1 vs. 3.6 ± 1.0 cm, P = 0.61). Vessel invasion showed improvement in two patients, while 13 other patients showed further tumor progression. Thirty-nine patients with unresectable malignancy and 11 patients with borderline resectable malignancy at time of initial diagnosis remained unchanged after CCRT. Four patients with borderline pancreatic malignancy progressed to an unresectable stage, whereas one unresectable pancreatic malignancy improved to a borderline resectable stage. Only one patient with borderline resectable disease underwent operation after CCRT; however, curative resection failed due to celiac artery invasion and peritoneal seeding. The adverse events associated with CCRT were tolerable. In conclusion, preoperative CCRT in LAPC rarely leads to surgical downstaging, and it could lower resectability rates.
