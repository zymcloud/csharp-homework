Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection leads to intrahepatic inflammation and liver cell injury, which are considered a risk factor for virus-associated hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Inflammatory cytokines are critical components of the immune system and influence cellular signaling, and genetic imbalances. In this study, we found that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were significantly induced by HCV infection and HCV NS5A expression, and induction of COX-2 correlated with HCV-induced IL-8 production. We also found that the ERK and JNK signaling pathways were involved in the regulation of IL-8-mediated COX-2 induction in response to HCV infection. Using a promoter-linked reporter assay, we identified that the C/EBP regulatory element within the COX-2 promoter was the dominant factor responsible for the induction of COX-2 by HCV. Silencing C/EBP attenuated HCV-induced COX-2 expression. Our results revealed that HCV-induced inflammation promotes viral replication, providing new insights into the involvement of IL-8-mediated COX-2 induction in HCV replication.
