The present study aimed to investigate the effects of cinobufacini injection on the proliferation and expression of topoisomerases in human HepG-2 hepatocarcinoma cells. The cells were divided into a control group and an experimental group, in which 0.105, 0.21, 0.42 mg/l cinobufacini was injected. Cell proliferation was assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, levels of apoptosis were detected using annexin V/propidium iodide staining and cell cycles were analyzed using flow cytometric analysis. The mRNA and protein expression levels of topoisomerase (TOPO) I and TOPO II were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. Cinobufacini injection significantly inhibited the proliferation of the HepG-2 cells (P
