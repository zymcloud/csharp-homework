Primary liver cancer, mostly hepatocellular carcinoma, remains a difficult-to-treat cancer. Incidence of liver cancer varies geographically and parallels with the geographic prevalence of viral hepatitis. A number of staging systems have been developed, reflecting the heterogeneity of primary liver cancer, regional preferences, and regional variations in resectability or transplant eligibility. Multimodality treatments are available for this heterogeneous malignancy, and there are variations in the management recommendations for liver cancers across specialties and geographic regions. Novel treatment strategies have merged with the advance of new treatment modalities. This work focuses on reviewing the incidence, staging, and treatment of liver cancer.
