Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide especially in China. This article aimed to evaluate the influence of body mass index (BMI) and waistline on complications, postoperative death, and long-term survival in patients undergoing surgery for HCC.Material and methods:136 patients were enrolled and divided into 4 groups: group A, BMI Results:There were no significant differences in postoperative complication rate and postoperative death between group A and group B, although pulmonary infection showed a significant difference between 2 groups (P=0.017). Vascular invasion, waistline, and BMI are the independent prognostic factors for long-term survival. The disease-free survival curves after hepatectomy showed no statistically significant difference between group A and group B. Group C had the better overall survival than group D, and group A had the better overall survival than group B.Conclusions:BMI and waistline are both independent prognostic factors for long-term survival of HCC after hepatectomy. Waistline is more important than BMI in predicting the disease-free survival of HCC after hepatectomy.
