Stem cell transplantation is well established in humans for the treatment of hematopoietic disease, including hematopoietic malignancies. Similar direct transplant procedures can readily be performed in mice; these procedures can be paired with retroviral infection to introduce exogenous genes or to silence endogenous genes in a subset of cells in the murine hematopoietic system. The resulting mice are chimeric for cells bearing a specific alteration. This approach has the advantage of examining tumorigenesis on a largely wild-type background (if only a subset of cells are infected), a situation that more accurately parallels the human situation. Additionally, tumor development occurs within the appropriate native microenvironment. Here, we describe the isolation and retroviral infection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as well as the reconstitution and monitoring of tumor formation in lethally irradiated recipient mice. This protocol requires a source of long-term HSCs; these can include either stimulated adult bone marrow or fetal liverâ€”the site of primitive hematopoiesis.
