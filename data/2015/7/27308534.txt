Tumor heterogeneity hinders the discovery of true cancer driver genes. The recently identified role for YY1-associated protein 1 (YY1AP1) as a critical oncoprotein that is activated in a particular subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was elucidated through integrative genomic profiling followed by functional studies. This strategy proved effective for finding a functional cancer driver with prognostic impact.
