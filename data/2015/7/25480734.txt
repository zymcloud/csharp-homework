Liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the world. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main pathological types in liver cancer, which amounts to 70-85 % of primary liver cancer in the world and 90 % in China. The aim of this study was to establish a PPI network and a pathway crosstalk network to isolate important dysfunctional pathways which play an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC. System biology approach was used in this research. A PPI network was firstly built and then a dysfunctional crosstalk network of HCC related pathways was constructed. Several important significant dysfunctional crosstalk pathways were identified. Basal transcription factors (hsa03022), Glycerophospholipid metabolism (hsa00564) and Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 (hsa00980) were significantly interact with Pathway in cancer (hsa05200). Besides, pathway Axon guidance (hsa04360) was also dysfunctional crosstalk with Pathway in cancer (hsa05200). The crosstalks among these pathways reveal some evidence that the pathways closely cooperated and play important tasks in HCC progression. Besides, the pathway hsa04360 dysfunctional crosstalk with the hsa05200 indicates there would be a same mechanism for HCC invasion and migration.
