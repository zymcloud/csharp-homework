The selection of liver transplantation (LT) candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently validated based on Milan criteria. The use of extended criteria has remained a matter of debate, mainly because of the absence of prospective validation. The present prospective study recruited patients according to the previously proposed total tumor volume (TTV; ≤115 cm(3) )/alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; ≤400 ng/mL) score. Patients with AFP >400 ng/mL were excluded, and, as such, the Milan group was modified to include only patients with AFP Conclusion:Based on the present prospective study, HCC LT candidate selection could be expanded to the TTV (≤115 cm(3) )/AFP (≤400 ng/mL) criteria in centers with at least 8-month waiting time. An increased risk of dropout on the waiting list can be expected, but with equivalent and satisfactory post-transplant survival.
