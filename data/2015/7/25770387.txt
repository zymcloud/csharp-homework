Background:Surgical resection of a tumor with thrombus formation extending from the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the right atrium can be performed without the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass. However, this technique is not widely known or used by general surgeons. Our aim was to present our experience in a general surgical unit setting and to present a literature review.Methods:Retrospective analysis of 3 cases with successful cavoatrial thrombectomy without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass by a transabdominal, transdiaphragmatic, and transpericardic approach. We also performed a review of the English literature of this procedure.Results:Three cases are presented: right-sided hepatocellular carcinoma, a right renal carcinoma, and a recurrent hepatic hydatid cyst all which required surgery. An approach from the right atrium to the IVC was used, and then, after cavoatrial occlusion, a cavotomy was performed to carry out the thrombectomy. In all cases, a transesophageal echocardiography was performed during surgery. We only found 6 other similar cases that were performed successfully in current medical literature.Conclusions:Our own experiences and cases identified through a literature review demonstrate that a thrombectomy for IVC thrombus in the setting of abdominal pathology can be performed successfully in selected cases without the support of cardiopulmonary bypass.
