Aim:To investigate whether expression of selected miRNAs obtained from fibrotic liver biopsies correlate with fibrosis stage.Methods:Altogether, 52 patients were enrolled in the study representing various etiologic backgrounds of fibrosis: 24 cases with chronic hepatitis infections (types B, C), 19 with autoimmune liver diseases (autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, overlapping syndrome cases), and 9 of mixed etiology (alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatosis, cryptogenic cases). Severity of fibrosis was determined by both histologic staging using the METAVIR scoring system and noninvasive transient elastography. Following RNA isolation, expression levels of miR-21, miR-122, miR-214, miR-221, miR-222, and miR-224 were determined using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays applying miR-140 as the reference. Selection of miRNAs was based on their characteristic up- or downregulation observed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Relative expression of miRNAs was correlated with fibrosis stage and liver stiffness (LS) value measured by transient elastography, as well as with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level.Results:The expression of individual miRNAs showed deregulated patterns in stages F1-F4 as compared with stage F0, but only the reduced level of miR-122 in stage F4 was statistically significant (P Conclusion:Reduced expression of miR-122 in advanced fibrosis and its correlation with fibrosis stage and LS values seem to be characteristic of hepatic fibrosis of various etiologies.
