Purpose:This clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety and short-term outcomes of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan.Materials and methods:The study was designed in a prospective setting. Five patients (3 men and 2 women; mean age, 66.6 ± 5.8 years) with 6 HCCs were enrolled and treated using percutaneous ultrasound (US)-guided IRE. Safety was assessed based on adverse events and laboratory values. Local control was assessed using contrast-enhanced US with a perflubutane microbubble contrast agent, contrast-enhanced multiphase CT, and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) at designated points.Results:The tumors ranged in diameter from 11 to 28 mm (mean diameter, 17.5 ± 6.3 mm). Five of the 6 tumors (83 %) were successfully treated, with no local recurrence to date (mean follow-up 244 ± 55 days). In 1 lesion located in liver segment 1, residual tumor was diagnosed at 7 days after intervention by follow-up EOB-MRI. No serious complications related to the IRE procedure were observed.Conclusion:The results of this study suggest that image-guided percutaneous IRE can achieve satisfactory local disease control, particularly for small HCCs, and is well tolerated by patients.
