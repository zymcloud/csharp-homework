Purpose:The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver exclude any role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) while the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver suggests its use for larger HCC. This study evaluated the accuracy of CEUS in comparison with computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of HCC and of residual of HCC after treatment.Materials and methods:We retrospectively evaluated 124 patients with 148 HCC nodules: 34 small (â‰¤20 mm) and 114 large nodules (>20 mm). Ninety-three patients underwent treatment [one resection, 23 transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE), 37 radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 32 TACE/RFA combined with sorafenib]. The diagnosis of HCC on CEUS was confirmed by the typical pattern of arterial enhancement and portal and/or venous phase washout.Results:We performed 90 CEUS for the initial diagnosis of HCC in 85 patients and 107 CEUS for the diagnosis of residual HCC after 1-month treatment in 92 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value of CEUS and CT in the initial diagnosis of HCC were: 63 vs 92, 100 vs 100, 100 vs 100, 9 vs 25 for small HCC; 77 vs 92, 100 vs 100, 100 vs 100, 13 vs 22 for large HCC. In the diagnosis of residual of HCC, CEUS had a sensitivity of 70 % for small nodules and 76 % for large nodules, with an overall specificity of 100 %.Conclusion:CEUS is useful in the initial diagnosis and in the assessment of necrosis after RFA and TACE of HCC nodules.
