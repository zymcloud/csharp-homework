Objective:To validate two previously published models (REACH-B score and CU-HCC score) for predicting the risk of developing hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In-patients of the Liver Center of First Affiliated Hospital Fujian Medical University who tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg;more than 6 months) and were admitted for treatment between October 1,2004 and May 1,2014 were enrolled for study. The 627 study participants were grouped according to presence of HCC (151 in the HCC case group, and 476 in the non-HCC control group). Relevant clinical data from 3 and 5 years prior to the current hospital admission were collected retrospectively and assessed using the REACH-B and CU-HCC scoring systems. A subset of the study participants (65 HCC cases, and 94 non-HCC controls) was used for the verification analysis of prediction for 5-year risk of HBV-related HCC.T-test, rank sum test, chisquare test and the receiver operating characteristic curve were used for statistical analyses.Results:For the REACH-B score,prediction of 3-year risk of developing HCC had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78,a sensitivity of 73.00% and a specificity of 78.70%.In male patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than or equal to 45 U/L, the REACH-B score prediction of 3-year risk of developing HCC had an AUC of 0.89, a sensitivity of 87.09% and a specificity of 83.86%. The REACH-B score prediction of 5-year risk of HCC had an AUC of 0.79,a sensitivity of 73.60% and a specificity of 75.53%; the CU-HCC score prediction of 5-year risk of HCC had an AUC of 0.76, a sensitivity of 78.40% and a specificity of 77.40%.Conclusion:Both the REACH-B and CUHCC scoring systems can be used for HCC prediction among patients at the First Affiliated Hospital Fujian Medical University. For male patients with ALT more than or equal to 45 U/L,the REACH-B score may be a more sensitive predictor for 3-year risk of developing HBV-related HCC.
