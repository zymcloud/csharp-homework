Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death. The current view of cancer progression and malignancy supports the notion that cancer cells must undergo through a post-translational modification (PTM) regulation and a metabolic switch or reprogramming in order to progress in an unfriendly environment. NEDDylation is a post-translational modification of the proteins involved in several processes such as cell growth, viability and development. A ground-breaking knowledge on a new critical aspect of HCC research has been to identify that NEDDylation plays a role in HCC by regulating the liver oncogenic driver Hu antigen R (HuR). HuR is a RNA-binding protein that stabilizes target mRNAs involved in cell dedifferentiation, proliferation, and survival, all well-established hallmarks of cancer. And importantly, HuR levels were found to be highly representative in liver and colon cancer. These findings open a completely new area of research, exploring the impact that NEDDylation plays in liver diseases and paving the way for novel therapeutical approaches.
