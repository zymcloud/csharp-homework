It has been demonstrated that liver microRNA-125a-5p (miR-125a-5p) is correlated with disease progression in different liver diseases, including liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study investigated whether serum miR-125a-5p correlated with the progression of different liver diseases. Serum samples were obtained from healthy individuals, patients with chronic hepatitis B who had undergone a liver biopsy, and patients with HCC and were analyzed for the levels of miR-125a-5p. Compared with the healthy controls, the serum levels of miR-125a-5p were significantly higher in the liver fibrosis serum, and were reduced in HCC. With the development of liver fibrosis, there was a significant increase in the expression of miR-125a-5p (P
