Background:For patients with liver metastases from gastric cancer (LMGC), combination chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidines and platinum agents has been recognized as standard treatment. However, the prognosis of hepatic progression after first-line treatment failure remains poor. When hepatic progression occurs, hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy may be helpful for preventing disease progression.Purpose:To retrospectively assess the feasibility and efficacy of HAI chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and mitomycin C (FEM) for patients with LMGC after failure of systemic S-1 plus cisplatin.Material and methods:We reviewed the records of patients who received HAI chemotherapy using FEM for LMGC that progressed during systemic S-1 plus cisplatin treatment while extrahepatic disease was decreased or did not appear. HAI chemotherapy was given as second-line therapy using 5-fluorouracil (330 mg/m(2) weekly), epirubicin (30 or 40 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks), and mitomycin C (2.7 mg/m(2) biweekly).Results:Fourteen patients were analyzed. Toxicity of HAI chemotherapy was generally mild. The objective response rate was 42.9%, including a complete response rate of 14.3%. Median times to hepatic and extrahepatic progression were 9.2 and 7.4 months, respectively. Of 12 patients with documented progression after HAI chemotherapy, 10 patients (83.3%) received additional treatment, including irinotecan or taxanes. Overall, median survival was 12.7 months.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that HAI chemotherapy using FEM is a feasible and effective treatment for patients with LMGC after failure of systemic S-1 plus cisplatin. HAI chemotherapy employed in the second-line setting is useful for achieving long-term disease control of LMGC.
