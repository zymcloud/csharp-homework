Recurrence after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequent. Currently, there are no recommendations on therapeutic strategy after recurrence of HCC. Whereas the 5 year-recurrence rate after resection of HCC is 100%, this drops to 15% after primary liver transplantation. Repeat hepatectomy and salvage liver transplantation (SLT) could be performed in selected patients to treat recurrent HCC and enable prolonged overall survival after treatment of recurrence. Other therapies such as local ablation, chemoembolization or sorafenib could be proposed to those patients unable to benefit from resection or SLT. A clear definition of the place of SLT and "prophylactic" liver transplantation is required. Indeed, identifying risks factors for recurrence at time of primary liver resection of HCC may help to avoid recurrence beyond Milan criteria and non-resectable situations. In this review, we summarize the recent data available in the literature on the feasibility and outcomes of repeat hepatectomy and SLT as treatment for recurrent HCC.
