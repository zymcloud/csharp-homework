Nanoparticles (NPs) have received much attention in recent years for their diverse potential biomedical applications. However, the synthesis of NPs with desired biodistribution and pharmacokinetics is still a major challenge, with NP size and surface chemistry being the main factors determining the behavior of NPs in vivo. Here we report on the surface chemistry and in vitro cellular uptake of magnetic iron oxide NPs coated with zwitterionic dopamine sulfonate (ZDS). ZDS-coated NPs were compared to similar iron oxide NPs coated with PEG-like 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (MEEA) to investigate how surface chemistry affects their in vitro behavior. ZDS-coated NPs had a very dense coating, guaranteeing high colloidal stability in several aqueous media and negligible interaction with proteins. Treatment of HepG2 cells with increasing doses (2.5-100 μg Fe/mL) of ZDS-coated iron oxide NPs had no effect on cell viability and resulted in a low, dose-dependent NP uptake, inferior than most reported data for the internalization of iron oxide NPs by HepG2 cells. MEEA-coated NPs were scarcely stable and formed micrometer-sized aggregates in aqueous media. They decreased cell viability for dose ≥50 μg Fe/mL, and were more efficiently internalized than ZDS-coated NPs. In conclusion, our data indicate that the ZDS layer prevented both aggregation and sedimentation of iron oxide NPs and formed a biocompatible coating that did not display any biocorona effect. The very low cellular uptake of ZDS-coated iron NPs can be useful to achieve highly selective targeting upon specific functionalization.
