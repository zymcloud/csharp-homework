Purpose:To evaluate the frequency, risk factors, and clinical significance of aggressive intrasegmental recurrence (AIR) found after radiofrequency (RF) ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study. Between March 2005 and December 2010, 539 patients (414 men, 125 women; mean age, 57.91 years; age range, 30-82 years) underwent ultrasonography-guided percutaneous RF ablation as a first-line treatment for a single HCC classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 or A. AIR of HCC was defined as (a) initial tumor recurrence with disease-free status at least 6 months after initial RF ablation and (b) the simultaneous development of multiple nodular (at least three) or infiltrative tumor recurrence in the treated segment. Patients were stratified into two groups: those with AIR (n = 20) and those without AIR (n = 519) during follow-up. Risk factors for AIR were assessed with logistic regression analysis, and risk factors for long-term overall survival were assessed with time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models.Results:In a median follow-up period of 49 months (range, 6-95 months), AIR was observed in 3.7% of the patients (20 of 539 patients), with the frequency increasing to 15% in the subgroup with periportal HCC (11 of 72 patients). AIRs manifested as either multiple nodular type (n = 14, BCLC stage A or B) or diffusely infiltrative type with tumor thrombus formation (n = 6, BCLC stage C). At multivariate analysis, periportal tumor location and younger patient age were significant risk factors for AIR. The presence of AIR during the follow-up period has a significant effect on the overall survival rate (hazard ratio = 5.72, P = .002).Conclusion:The overall frequency of AIR after RF ablation for HCC was low, with periportal location and patient age showing a significant relationship to the development of AIR. The occurrence of AIR had an adverse effect on overall survival rate.
