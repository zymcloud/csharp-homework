Approximately 3% of the world×³s population suffers from chronic infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Although current treatment regimes are capable of effectively eradicating HCV infection from these patients, the cost of these combinations of direct-acting antivirals are prohibitive. Approximately 80% of untreated chronic HCV carriers will be at high risk for developing severe liver disease, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. A vaccine is urgently needed to lessen this global burden. Besides humans, HCV infection can be experimentally transmitted to chimpanzees, and this is the best model for studies of HCV infection and related innate and adaptive immune responses. Although the chimpanzee model yielded valuable insight, limited availability, high cost and ethical considerations limit their utility. The only small animal models of robust HCV infection are highly immunodeficient mice with human chimeric livers. However, these mice cannot be used to study adaptive immune responses and therefore a more relevant animal model is needed to assist in vaccine development. Novel strains of immunodeficient mice have been developed that allow for the engraftment of human hepatopoietic stem cells, as well as functional human lymphoid cells and tissues, effectively creating human immune systems in otherwise immunodeficient mice. These humanized mice are rapidly emerging as pre-clinical bridges for numerous pathogens that, like HCV, only cause infectious disease in humans. This review highlights the potential these new models have for changing the current landscape for HCV research and vaccine development.
