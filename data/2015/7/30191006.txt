The best results in surgical resection are obtained in patients with solitary tumors without clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient >10 mmHg). In such settings, 5-year survival rates exceed 70%. When portal hypertension exceeds this cut-off value, 5-year survival decreases to 55%, as is also the case in patients with more than one nodule. Surgery may be technically feasible, in other words, with acceptable 30-day mortalities although the clinically relevant survival outcome is significantly reduced. In such instances, patients may be better served by liver transplantation. If this option is not available, the outcome may not differ to that obtained by ablation for small solitary hepatocellular carcinoma or for chemoembolization for those patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma within the Milan criteria. This philosophy is the backbone for the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer decision-making process.
