Introduction:The liver hosts a variety of benign and malignant tumors. Accurate diagnosis can be challenging in certain cases, especially in patients with a history of malignancy or in those with underlying liver pathology, such as cirrhosis.Objectives:To evaluate the added clinical value of multi-modality liver imaging utilizing PET/Ce-CT/DW-MRI for characterization of hepatic focal lesions (HFL) and compare it with each diagnostic modality when interpreted alone.Methods:The study included 35 patients with HFL. They were 7 females & 28 males; their age ranged from 41 to 78years, all patients underwent PET/Ce-CT and DW-MRI scans. Ce-CT, PET and DW-MR images were reviewed independently, and then combined PET/Ce-CT, PET/DW-MRI and PET/Ce-CT/DW-MRI scans were analyzed. The results were correlated with histopathology or clinical/imaging follow-up.Results:The 35 patients had 98 focal lesions. Fifty-three lesions were finally diagnosed as primary hepatocellular carcinoma, 18 lesions were metastases, 7 lesions were lymphoma and 20 lesions were benign. On a patient based analysis; the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were 100%, 67%, 94%, 100% and 94% for PET/Ce-CT compared to 97%, 83%, 97%, 83% and 94 % for DW-MRI, respectively. Combined PET/Ce-CT/DW-MR scans raise those parameters up to 100%. On a lesion based analysis; the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy were 94%, 75%, 94%, 75%, 90% for PET/Ce-CT compared to 94%, 95%, 99%, 97% and 94 % for DW-MRI, respectively. All these parameters were 100 % with PET/Ce-CT/DW-MRI.Conclusions:The addition of DW-MRI to PET/Ce-CT is valuable in the characterization of hepatic focal lesions.
