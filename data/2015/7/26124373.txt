Background:This retrospective study investigated outcomes after laparoscopic hepatectomy in the semi-prone position compared to open hepatectomy in the conventional supine position, for HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) located in segment 6, 7, or 8.Patients and methods:Patients were divided into two groups according to the surgical approach. The clinicopathological and surgical outcomes were analyzed.Results:There were no significant differences in patient-related or tumor-related factors between the two groups. The laparoscopic-hepatectomy group had significantly less blood loss, fewer postoperative complications, and a shorter hospital stay than the open-hepatectomy group. There were no in-hospital deaths. The postoperative change in the serum C-reactive protein was a significantly larger decrease in the group treated with laparoscopic hepatectomy than that in the open-hepatectomy group.Conclusion:Laparoscopic hepatectomy in the semi-prone position for HCC is safe and minimally invasive, and can reduce intraoperative bleeding, postoperative complications, and hospital stay compared to open hepatectomy.
