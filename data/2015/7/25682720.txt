Background and aim:Whether an antiviral interferon (IFN)-based therapy (IBT) after curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) improves the prognosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC remains to be elucidated.Methods:A total of 178 patients within the Milan criteria underwent curative treatment for HCV-related HCC. Both the time to beyond the Milan criteria (TTBMC) and overall survival (OS) were compared between the sustained virologic response (SVR) (IFN with SVR, n = 22), non-SVR (IFN without SVR, n = 19), and non-IBT (control, n = 82) groups using propensity score matching analysis. Prognostic factors to predict survival were also determined by the Cox proportional-hazards model.Results:TTBMC in the IFN with SVR group was significantly longer than those in the control and IFN without SVR groups (P Conclusion:Elimination of HCV after curative treatment of patients with HCC within the Milan criteria inhibits recurrence and contributes to a preferential prognosis.
