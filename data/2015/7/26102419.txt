Objective:The purpose of this article is to discuss the use of contrast-enhanced ultra-sound (CEUS) in focal liver lesions.Conclusion:Focal liver lesions are usually detected incidentally during abdominal ultrasound. The injection of microbubble ultrasound contrast agents improves the characterization of focal liver lesions that are indeterminate on conventional ultrasound. The use of CEUS is recommended in official guidelines and suggested as a second diagnostic step after ultrasound detection of indeterminate focal liver lesions to immediately establish the diagnosis, especially for benign liver lesions, such as hemangiomas, avoiding further and more expensive examinations.
