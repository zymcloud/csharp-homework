MicroRNAs (miRs) have a major role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis is a highly tumorigenic pathway in HCC, the present study attempted to target it with miRs. Potential targeting of crucial members of the IGF axis by miRNAs at the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) was predicted using bioinformatic tools, such as microrna.org, Diana lab and Targetscan, while 5'-UTR targeting was predicted using bibiserv software. Expression profiling of obtained miRNAs was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 22 non-metastatic HCC biopsy samples and 10 healthy tissues. To investigate the impact of miRNAs on their potential downstream targets, transfection of miRNAs was performed in HuH-7 cells and the targets' expression was quantified using qPCR. Transcripts of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and IGF-II were found to be potentially targeted at the 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR regions by the single clustered hepatic metastamiRs miR-96-5p and miR-182-5p. The two miRNAs showed a similar expression pattern in HCC tissues compared to those in healthy tissues. Forced expression of miR-96-5p and miR-182-5p in the HCC cell line HuH-7 had inducing effects on IGFBP-3 and IGF-II transcripts. Of note, the two miRs had differential effects on IGF-1R, where miR-96-5p induced IGF-1R mRNA expression and miR-182-5p inhibited its expression. The present study revealed the pleiotropic impact of the single clustered hepatic metastamiRs miR-96-5p and miR-182-5p on IGF-1R, and an inducing effect on IGF-II and IGFBP-3 in hepatocellular carcinoma.
