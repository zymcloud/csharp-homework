Background:The staging laparoscopy has been used in the management of gastrointestinal cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of staging laparoscopy, in comparison with computed tomography (CT) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging in staging patients with gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) and gastric cancers.Methods:The data were collected for patients between 1996 and 2013 undergoing investigation and treatment for GOJ and gastric cancers at a single institute. The pre-operative data (staging data), intraoperative details, post-operative course and follow-up were analysed for individual cases.Results:Staging laparoscopy altered management plan in 64 (17 %) of 387 patients with negative staging CT and FDG-PET scan. Twenty-seven (7 %) patients with GOJ cancer (types I, II and III) were identified with pathological intraperitoneal nodes, 15 (4 %) gastric cancer with metastatic intraperitoneal deposits and liver metastases and 3 % gastric cancers with positive ascitic fluid for cancer cells. Ten (3 %) of patients were downstaged and were offered curative resection. Patients with metastatic disease were referred for palliative chemotherapy. The overall sensitivity of staging laparoscopy in diagnosing intraabdominal pathology was 86 % in comparison with CT (81 %) and FDG-PET (78 %).Conclusions:The diagnostic laparoscopy is useful for detecting and confirming nodal involvement and distant metastatic disease not evident on the staging CT scan and FDG-PET. This could potentially alter treatment and prognosis in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer. The diagnostic laparoscopy should be performed as part of investigation and treatment planning for patients suffering from GOJ and gastric cancers. This can help to avoid surgery in patients with advanced disease.
