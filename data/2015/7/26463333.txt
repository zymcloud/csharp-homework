Objective:This study was aimed to understand the clinical characteristics and prognosis in Uighur patients with Non-B Non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and virus-related HCC.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 301 Uighur HCC patients, among them, there were 145 NBC-HCC cases and 156 virus-related HCC cases. The overall survival rates of the patients were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method, and the factors that may influence the prognosis and survival of NBC-HCC patients were analyzed using univariate (Log rank test) and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model.Results:The differences of the gender, living region, history of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), history of cirrhosis, TNM stage, Child-Pugh scores, total bilirubin, and AFP level between the NBC-HCC group and viral-HCC group were statistically significant (P 0.05). Multivariate analysis by Cox model showed that age, TNM staging, PVTT, Child-Pugh scores, TACE combined with radiotherapy or RFA were significant independent prognostic factors (all P Conclusions:The clinical characteristics in Uighur patients with non-B non-C HCC and hepatitis virus-related HCC are not all the same and HCC in Xinjiang region has certain regional characteristics and features. Age, TNM stages, portal vein tumor thrombus, Child-Pugh scores, and TACE combined with radiotherapy or RFA are significant independent prognostic factors.
