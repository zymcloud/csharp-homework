Background:Recurrence patterns after hepatic resection has been poorly understood in view of tumor blood flow drainage (TBFD) area. Our goal was to clarify the recurrence patterns after anatomical versus nonanatomical hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 424 consecutive patients with HCC, who were treated by curative resection (R0) at our hospital from 2001 to 2012, were evaluated. Among these, we compared the outcomes of the anatomical resection group (AR group, n = 243) and the nonanatomical resection group (NR group, n = 181). We performed an analysis of the recurrence patterns of HCC based on the preoperative CT during hepatic arteriography in these 424 patients.Results:Preoperative liver function was better in the AR group than the NR group (P Conclusions:The incidence and patterns of HCC recurrence were similar between the anatomical and nonanatomical resection. Recurrence by local dissemination may be considered to be negligible in both surgical methods.
