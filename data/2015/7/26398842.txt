Objective:To identify risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:A total of 715 cirrhotic patients with CHB were recruited from the Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University and enrolled in this case-control study between January 2009 and September 2014. All participants were Chinese Han residing in Shanghai and the surrounding areas. The patients were divided into a cirrhosis group (n =281) and a HCC group (n=434). History of hepatitis B infection and HCC, as well as clinical data from serological, imaging and pathological examinations were collected for analysis.SPSS software, version 19.0, was used for all statistical comparisons.Results:Single factor analysis indicated that development of HCC in cirrhotic patients with CHB was significantly associated with male sex, age of 50 years or more, family history of HCC, alcohol consumption,fatty liver, detectable levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and history of HBV infection without effective antiviral treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age of 50 years or more (P =0.005, odds ratio [OR] =1.766), history of alcohol consumption (P =0.002, Or = 2.570), family history of HCC (P =0.014, Or = 2.268), fatty liver (P =0.023, Or = 3.390), and history of HBV infection without effective antiviral treatment (P Conclusion:Risk factors of HCC in cirrhotic patients with CHB include age,drinking history,family history of HCC, fatty liver, and ineffective antiviral treatment of CHB.Family history of HBV infection or HCC, and fatty liver disease, were significantly associated with HCC development after SVS in patients with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis.
