Aim:To determine the impact of maximal cytoreductive surgery on overall survival in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.Patients and methods:We retrospectively reviewed medical data of patients submitted to primary cytoreductive surgery for advanced epithelial cancer in the Fundeni Clinical Hospital between 1 January 2002 and 1 April 2014.Results:A total of 338 patients were eligible for the study. Complete cytoreduction was achieved in 242 patients and was associated with a significantly improved survival (p<0.001), when compared to patients in whom incomplete debulking surgery was performed. Other prognostic factors associated with an improved survival were stage by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics and the preoperative biological status of the patient.Conclusion:A more extensive surgical approach is perfectly justified and associated with improved survival in patients with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer. However, patient selection should be performed carefully because the general preoperative status can significantly impact survival.
Epithelial ovarian cancer; complete cytoreduction; multivisceral resection; overall survival.
