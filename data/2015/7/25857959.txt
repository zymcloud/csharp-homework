Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), one of the most important water soluble chitosan derivatives, has great potentials in biomedical applications due to its excellent water solubility, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity. In the present study, the anti-tumor metastasis effect of CMCS on hepatic tumors was evaluated using human hepatic cancer cell BEL-7402 and mouse hepatoma 22 cells. The results suggested that CMCS could significantly inhibit tumor cell migration in vitro, and reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in BEL-7402 cells in a dose-dependent manner (P
