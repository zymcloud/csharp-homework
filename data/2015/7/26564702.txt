Objective:To investigate the relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype, the mutation in basic core promoter (BCP) region/pre-core (Pre-C) region and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Fusui county of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), a area with high incidence of HCC.Methods:In this case-control study, 53 HCC patients and 70 asymptomatic HBV carriers were enrolled. Blood samples were collected from them for serum separation and HBV DNA extraction. The DNA sequences of the S region and BCP/Pre-C region of HBV was determined by direct sequencing following nested-PCR amplification. The relationship between the genotype, gene mutation of HBV and the incidence of HCC was analyzed.Results:The mutation rates of the A1762T/G1764A in the BCP region and the T1858C in the Pre-C region of HBV were significantly higher in HCC group than in control group (94.3% vs. 75.7%, P = 0.006; 50.9% vs. 31.4%, P = 0.029). The mutation rate of A1775G was significantly higher in control group (28.6%) than in HCC group (13.2%) (P = 0.041). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that A1762T/G1764A and T1858C mutations are the risk factors for the development of HCC (OR = 5.459, 95% CI: 1.397-21.332, P = 0.015; OR = 3.881, 95% CI: 1.462-10.305, P = 0.006). A1775G is the protective factor in the development of HCC (OR = 0.192, 95% CI: 0.059-0.622, P = 0.006).Conclusion:The present investigation showed that BCP A1762T/G1764A, A1775G and Pre-C T1858C mutations are correlated with the incidence of HCC in Fusui county of Guangxi.
