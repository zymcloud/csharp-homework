The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Between July 2008 and May 2011, 50 patients with unresectable HCC were enrolled and assigned to receive TACE combined with sorafenib in the present study. The primary outcomes were considered as time to disease progression (TTP) and sorafenib-related AEs. In the present study, 34 of 50 patients had disease progression with a median TTP (mTTP) of 210 days. The most common AEs included hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), fatigue, diarrhea and hypertension. The mTTP of patients with HFSR extended 140 days compared to that of the patients without HFSR. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for mTTP between the two groups of patients. This difference was statistically significant when analyzed by the univariate COX proportional hazards regression model. In conclusion, TACE in combination with sorafenib had an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of unresectable HCC. Additionally, it also revealed that HFSR served as a good prognostic predictor in using combination therapy. Therefore, discontinuation of sorafenib treatment should be prevented to avoid disease progression.
