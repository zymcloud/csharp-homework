Aim:To evaluate the indication and outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver transplantation (LT) in the era of newer antiviral agents.Methods:We collected data on all patients who underwent transplantation at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center. These data included demographic, perioperative and long-term postoperative follow-up data including viral serological markers, HBV DNA, and repeated liver imaging. Between January 1990 and January 2012, 133 patients (106 males and 27 females) underwent LT for HBV-related cirrhosis at our center. All patients were followed up frequently during the first year following transplantation, according to our standard protocol; follow-up visits occurred every 3-6 mo thereafter. Breakthrough infection was defined as re-emergence of HBV-DNA or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) while on treatment. Five patients transplanted prior to 1992 did not receive immediate posttransplant anti-HBV prophylaxis; all other patients were treated with HBIG and at least one nucleos(t)ide analog.Results:One hundred and thirty-three patients underwent LT for HBV and were followed for a median of 82 mo (range: 1-274). The rates of post-LT survival and HBV recurrence during the follow-up period were 89% and 11%, respectively. The following factors were associated with disease recurrence: younger age (44.3 ± 16.2 years vs 51.4 ± 9.9 years, P = 0.02), positive pretransplant hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (60% vs 14%, P Conclusion:The use of potent anti-HBV agents has led to a changing trend in the indications for LT. HBV is currently the third leading indication for LT in this hyperendemic area.
