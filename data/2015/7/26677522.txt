Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer death worldwide accounting for over half a million deaths per year. Hepatocellular carcinoma can occur secondary to viral hepatitis, HBV or HCV. It can also occur secondary to other causes of Cirrhosis (alcoholism being the other most common cause).Objectives:To describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of Hepatocellular carcinoma in a tertiary care hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Methods:A retrospective study was conducted in patients admitted to Tikur Anbassa specialized Hospital with a diagnosis of Hepatocellular carcinoma during the period of January 1, 2013 to Dec. 31, 2015. Data were collected using structured questionnaire on basic demographic factors, behavioral risks, laboratory profiles and imaging reports. Descriptive analysis was performed on the data collected.Results:Fifty one patients fulfilled the criteria for Hepatocellular carcinoma in the study period. Thirty nine were males and 12 were females. Hepatitis B and C viruses were found to be the causes for HCC in 48% of the cases. History of alcohol abuse was documented in 45% % of the individuals. About 26% of the patients had Ascites, 35% were found to have portal vein thrombosis, The child-Pugh score for patients who had complete profile were Child A 46%, Child B an equal percentage of 46% andfor Child C 0.7%.Conclusion:The contribution of Hepatitis virus is high with equivalent proportion of HBV and HCV. Alcohol intake and unidentified risk factors have also played for another half of the causes. Almost a third of patients have Portal vein thrombosis and 96% were either Child Pugh A or B. Enhancing immunization coverage frequent use of infection prevention and availability of treatment for viral hepatitis will help to reduce Hepatocellular carcinoma.
