Background:The stromal compartment in several organs seems to play an important role in the initiation, growth, and progression of certain neoplasms. The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) has been found to be an independent factor for prognosis of several types of carcinomas, but the effect of the TSR on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been explored yet. The objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic importance of TSR in HCC patients after liver resection or transplantation.Methods:A total of 300 patients with HCC who underwent liver resection or transplantation were included in this study. TSR was assessed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections by 2 independent investigators. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a stroma-rich group (stroma â‰¥ 50%) and a stroma-poor group (stroma Results:Among the post liver resection patients, the TSR was associated with overall survival (OS) in univariate and multivariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR], 4.35 [95% CI, 2.54-7.47] and HR, 2.55 [95% CI, 1.44-4.52], respectively). Among the post liver transplant patients, the TSR was also associated with OS in univariate and multivariate analyses (HR, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.63-5.23] and HR, 2.76 [95% CI, 1.47-4.85], respectively), and TSR with recurrence-free survival (RFS) in univariate and multivariate analyses (HR, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.42-4.86] and HR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.03-3.62], respectively). Patients with stroma-poor tumor and who were within the Milan criteria or the UCSF criteria had a better in OS and RFS.Conclusion:We show for the first time that TSR is an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients after liver resection or transplantation. TSR may enable better identification of patients at risk for recurrence in HCC patients after curative treatment and may aid in patient management and development of individualized medicine for treatment of HCC.
