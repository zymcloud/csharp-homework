Treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) achieves good short-term but poor long-term survival. We retrospectively assessed whether outcomes differ between hypofractionated and conventional 3D-CRT regimens. Patients were treated in our institution between June 2005 and October 2009. All patients received two cycles of TACE followed by either hypofractionated 3D-CRT (6-8 Gy fractions for 3-4 weeks to 48-64 Gy) or conventional 3D-CRT (2 Gy fractions for 6-7 weeks to 60-70 Gy) 4 weeks later. We assessed data from 110 patients (55 in each 3D-CRT group). Overall response rates were similar in the two groups. Acute adverse event rates were not significantly higher in the hypofractionated 3D-CRT group than in the conventional 3D-CRT group; two patients and one patient, respectively, died of late radiation-induced liver failure. Overall survival at 1 year was 83.6 % in the hypofractionated 3D-CRT group versus 68.8 % in the conventional 3D-CRT group (P = 0.019), and at 3 years, it was 31.7 versus 13.9 % (P = 0.004). Median survival was 27.97 versus 16.13 months (P = 0.002). Hypofractionated 3D-CRT seemed to provide better overall survival than conventional 3D-CRT regimens combined with TACE as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC.
