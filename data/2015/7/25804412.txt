Local tumor recurrence remains a major clinical problem following surgical treatment for most cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An implantable local drug delivery system may be suitable for addressing this unmet clinical need. In this study, asymmetric multilayer polylactide nanofiber (AMPN) mats were prepared and a one-sided and prolonged release profile of hydrophilic dye or oxaliplatin was observed after they were sandwiched between two liver lobes in mice. Covering the surgery site by drug-loaded AMPN mat after tumor resection, in both subcutaneous and orthotopic HCC model in mice, the recurrence of HCC was significantly retarded and the survival time of mice was markedly prolonged. In conclusion, post-surgical therapy at tumor resection margins by drug-loaded AMPN mats may represent a suitable application of nanofiber-based local chemotherapy.From the clinical editor:After cancer surgery, local recurrence remains a significant problem. In this study, the authors designed asymmetric multilayer PLA nanofiber (AMPN) mats and loaded them with anti-tumor drugs. Both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments showed good efficacy in preventing tumor recurrence. This novel product may point a way to the future and improve survival of cancer patients.
