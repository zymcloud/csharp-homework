Aim:To investigate the association between thrombocytopenia and relapse after treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to obtain eligible studies. The hazard ratios (HRs) values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled by random effects model. Subsequently, we estimated the heterogeneity, performed a sensitivity analysis, determined the publication bias, and performed subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Study quality was assessed by using the Oxford Center for Evidence Based Medicine tool.Results:We identified 18 eligible studies by retrieval (published during 2000-2014). Out of the 4163 patients with HCC who were recruited, 2746 (66.0%) experienced recurrence. In general, our meta-analysis suggested that low platelet count (PLT) before therapy significantly increased the probability of postoperative recurrence (HR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.29-1.81). PLT was also valuable in the prediction of intrahepatic distant recurrence (HR = 1.49, 95%CI: 1.25-1.77). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses identified various therapeutic modalities as the source of a high degree of heterogeneity. The pooled HR values showed no obvious change when a single study was removed, but otherwise, an opposite-effects model was used. In addition, no significant publication bias was detected.Conclusion:Thrombocytopenia before treatment might be an inexpensive and useful predictor of postoperative recurrence in patients with HCC.
