Case 1: A6 4-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had received local therapy repeatedly for 20 years. In 2012, he underwent hepatic right lobectomy for recurrence of HCC. Multiple recurrences were found in the hepatic remnant, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed. Considering his condition, a small dose of sorafenib (200 mg per day) was administered. He complained of general fatigue, so we prolonged the administration interval (200 mg every other day). Thereafter, compliance improved and long-term stable disease (long SD), for more than 6 months, long SD was achieved. Case 2: A7 5-year-old man with HCC was treated by TACE repeatedly for multiple recurrences after liver resection (segment 6). In 2008, metastases to the thoracic vertebra and left rib were treated by radiation therapy and radiofrequency ablation, respectively. Subsequently, sorafenib (400 mg per day) was administered. We reduced the dose of sorafenib to less than 400 mg per day because of diarrhea, hypertension, and general fatigue. Thereafter, long SD was achieved despite the small dose of sorafenib. We report here 2 cases of HCC where we achieved long SD in spite of treating with a small dose of sorafenib.
