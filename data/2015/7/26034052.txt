Results from three studies, including KEYNOTE-012 and CheckMate 057, indicate that anti-PD-1 drugs look promising in cancers other than melanoma. Pembrolizumab was twice as effective as cetuximab for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; nivolumab induced durable antitumor activity in advanced liver cancer; and nivolumab extended the median overall survival of patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
