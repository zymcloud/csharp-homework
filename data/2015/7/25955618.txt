Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human malignancies and also the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. The mechanisms underlying the progression and metastasis of HCC remain unclear. The E3 ubiquitin ligase F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbxw7) is broadly considered as a tumor suppressor gene. However, the role of Fbxw7 in HCC is not clear. To investigate the expression and biological functions of Fbxw7 in HCC, we examined Fbxw7 expression level using HCC tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that Fbxw7 expression is significantly reduced in HCC compared with non-cancerous tissues (P
