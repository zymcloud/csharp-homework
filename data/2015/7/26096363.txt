MicroRNAs and Yes-associated protein (YAP) play an important role in the occurrence and development of hepatic carcinomas. However, the interaction between microRNAs and YAP was seldom elucidated. In this study, we showed that miR-132 could target YAP gene by using dual-luciferase reporter system. Further quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and western blotting showed that miR-132 could significantly reduce the expression of YAP at mRNA and protein levels. Results of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining and transwell assays showed that miR-132 significantly promoted the cell apoptosis and effectively inhibited the proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells. These results indicated that miR-132 could inhibit the growth of hepatoma cells by targeting YAP gene and reducing its expression level. Taken together, results from this study would help us to understand the mechanisms for occurrence and development of hepatic carcinoma and provide new targets for diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer.
