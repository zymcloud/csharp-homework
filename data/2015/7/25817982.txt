Objective:To identify risk factors for perioperative complications and morbidity in renal cell cancer (RCC) surgery with tumor thrombus invasion (TTI).Patients and methods:Retrospective single-center analysis of 128 patients who underwent open (n = 97) or laparoscopic (n = 31) radical nephrectomy (NT) for RCC between 1999 and 2010. TTI was at Mayo-Level 0, I, II, III, IV in 88, 7, 10, 4, and 19 cases, respectively. Cavotomy was performed in 27, liver mobilisation in 20, and cardiovascular bypass in 17 patients.Results:The rate of any early postoperative complication (PC) by Clavien-Dindo classification was 58.6%, while the severe early PC rate was 29.7%. There was a statistically significant difference in multivariate analysis in the incidence of any early PC and of severe early PC by Charlson score (OR:1.584 (95%CI:1.141-2.199), p = 0.006; OR:3.065 (95%CI:1.218-7.714), p = 0.017) and by tumor thrombus level TNM-UICC 2010 T3a/T3c (OR:10.668 (95%CI:1.266-89.871), p = 0.029; OR:10.502 (95%CI:2.981-36.992), p < 0.001). In pT3a cases open NT was associated with a higher early (57.9% vs. 25.8%) and severe (24.6% vs. 9.7%) PC rate compared to laparoscopic NT. The 30-day mortality rate was 0%. The 90-day mortality rate was 6.3% but 100% cancer-related. In Cox regression analysis tumor thrombus level was not predictive for overall survival.Conclusions:The strongest risk factor for early and severe PC in patients with TTI is a supradiaphragmatic tumor thrombus. In cases with severe PC, this fact persists when comparing Mayo-Levels II-III and Level IV. In pT3a cases open NT shows a 2-fold higher early PC rate compared to laparoscopic NT.
