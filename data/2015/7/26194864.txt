MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis. Recently, miR-203 was reported as a tumor suppressor microRNA silenced in different malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, oral cancer, breast cancer, and hematopoietic malignancy, whereas its role in the carcinogenesis of gastric carcinoma (GC) has not been evaluated. Here, we analyzed the levels of miR-203 and Slug in the GC specimen and studied their correlation. We analyzed the binding of miR-203 to the 3'-UTR of Slug messenger RNA (mRNA) and its effects on Slug translation by bioinformatics analysis and by luciferase-reporter assay, respectively. We modified miR-203 levels in GC cells and studied their effects on the cell invasiveness in transwell cell migration assay. We found that in GC, miR-203 levels were significantly decreased and Slug levels were significantly increased. miR-203 and Slug inversely correlated in patients' specimen. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that miR-203 may target the 3'-UTR of Slug mRNA to inhibit its translation, which was confirmed by luciferase-reporter assay. Overexpression of miR-203 inhibited Slug and cell invasiveness, while depletion of miR-203 increased Slug and cell invasiveness. These data suggest that miR-203 suppression in GC promotes Slug-mediated cancer metastasis.
