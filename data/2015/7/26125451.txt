Background:The inactivation of the Hippo pathway lead to TAZ (PDZ-binding motif)/YAP (yes-associated protein) overexpression, and is associated with worse prognostic outcomes in various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although there are several reports of microRNA (miR) targeting for YAP, miR targeting for TAZ remains unclear. The aim of this study is to identify the miR targeting TAZ expression in HCC.Methods:MicroRNA expression was analysed using the Human miFinder 384HC miScript miR PCR array, and was compared between low and high TAZ expression cell lines. Then, we extracted miR-9-3p as a tumour-suppressor miR targeting TAZ. We examined the functional role of miR-9-3p using miR-9-3p mimic and inhibitor in HCC cell lines).Results:In HCC cell lines and HCC clinical samples, there was the inverse correlation between miR-9-3p and TAZ expressions. TAZ expression was induced by treatment of miR-9-3p inhibitor and was downregulated by treatment of miR-9-3p mimic. Treatment of miR-9-3p mimic inhibited cell proliferative ability with downregulated phosphorylations of Erk1/2, AKT, and Î²-catenin in HLF. Inversely, treatment of miR-9-3p inhibitor accelerated cell growth compared with control in HuH1.Conclusions:MicroRNA-9-3p was identified as the tumour-suppressor miR targetting TAZ expression in HCC cells.
