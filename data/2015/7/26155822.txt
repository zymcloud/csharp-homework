Context:Patrinia villosa (Thunb.) Juss (Valerianaceae) is an important ancient herbal medicine widely used for inflammation, wound healing, and abdominal pain. But little is known of the phytochemical constituents of this herbal plant.Objective:The objective of this study is to isolate and identify the bioactive components from P. villosa.Materials and methods:A 70% EtOH extract of P. villosa was subjected to normal-phase silica, ODS silica gel column chromatography, and semi-preparative HPLC chromatography after partitioned successively with light petroleum, dichloromethane and n-BuOH. Chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including UV, 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and CD spectra. The cytotoxic activity of the new component was determined with the SMMC-7721 cell line using the MTT method after incubation for 48 h.Results:A new flavonoid named patriniaflavanone A (1) along with four known compounds was isolated from P. villosa. The four known compounds were identified as luteolin 7-O-glucuronide-6″-methyl ester (2), p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid methyl ester (3), trans-caffeic acid (4), and trans-caffeic acid methylate (5) by comparison of their spectral data with the reported data. The IC50 value of patriniaflavanone A (1) on SMMC-7721 was 61.27 μM.Discussion and conclusion:This is the first report on the isolation and identification of patriniaflavanone A (1), and compounds 2-5 were isolated for the first time from the title plant. Patriniaflavanone A (1) exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity.
