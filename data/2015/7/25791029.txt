Background:The boundary of the target hepatic segment within the liver parenchyma cannot be marked by the use of a conventional anatomic hepatectomy approach. This study describes a novel methylene blue staining technique for guiding the anatomic resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between February 2009 and February 2012, anatomic hepatectomy was performed in 106 patients with HCC via a novel, sustained methylene blue staining technique. Sustained staining was achieved by injecting methylene blue into the distal aspect of the portal vein after exposing Glisson's sheath. The hepatic pedicle was immediately ligated, and the hepatic parenchymal transection was performed along the interface between methylene blue stained tissue and unstained tissue.Results:Anatomic hepatectomies included subsegmentectomy (n = 16), monosegmentectomy (n = 57), multisegmentectomy (n = 27), and hemihepatectomy (n = 6). The portal vein was injected successfully with methylene blue in 100% of cases, and complete staining of the target hepatic segment was achieved in 98 of 106 (92.5%) cases. Mean intraoperative bleeding was 360 Â± 90 mL, and the postoperative complication rate was 24.5% (26/106). No perioperative mortality occurred. Operative margins were all negative on pathologic examination. Mean duration of postoperative follow-up was 40 months (range, 24-60). No local recurrence (around the operative margin) occurred.Conclusion:This novel technique of achieving sustained staining by injecting methylene blue then immediately ligating the hepatic pedicle is simple and feasible. It can guide the selection of the operative margin during hepatic parenchyma transection to improve the accuracy of anatomic hepatectomy for the treatment of HCC.
