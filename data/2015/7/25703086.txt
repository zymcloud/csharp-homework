Background & aims:Improved therapies for peginterferon/ribavirin null or partial responders are needed. This study evaluated daclatasvir (NS5A inhibitor) and asunaprevir (NS3 protease inhibitor) plus peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in this patient population.Methods:This open-label, phase 3 study (HALLMARK-QUAD; NCT01573351) treated patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 (n=354) or 4 (n=44) infection who had a prior null or partial response to peginterferon/ribavirin. Patients received daclatasvir 60 mg once-daily plus asunaprevir 100mg twice-daily, with weekly peginterferon alfa-2a and weight-based ribavirin for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) among genotype 1-infected patients.Results:Daclatasvir plus asunaprevir and peginterferon/ribavirin demonstrated SVR12 rates of 93% (95% CI 90-96) in prior non-responders infected with HCV genotype 1. SVR12 rates among genotype 4-infected patients were 98% (95% CI 93-100); one patient had a missing post-treatment week-12 HCV-RNA measurement, but achieved an SVR at post-treatment week 24, yielding a 100% SVR rate in genotype 4 patients. Prior peginterferon/ribavirin response, sex, age, IL28B genotype, or cirrhosis status did not influence SVR12 rates. Serious adverse events occurred in 6% of patients; 5% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities included neutropenia (22%), lymphopenia (16%), anemia (6%), thrombocytopenia (4%), and ALT/AST elevations (3% each).Conclusions:Daclatasvir plus asunaprevir and peginterferon/ribavirin demonstrated high rates of SVR12 in genotype 1- or 4-infected prior null or partial responders. The combination was well tolerated and no additional safety and tolerability concerns were observed compared with peginterferon/ribavirin regimens.
