Twelve consecutive patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) involving diaphragmatic or subdiaphragmatic regions were treated on an institutional review board-approved outcomes tracking protocol. All patients underwent treatment with proton therapy following chemotherapy and had comparative three-dimensional conformal photon radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans to evaluate differences in dose to organs at risk (OARs). Among the cohort, stomach doses with 3DCRT, IMRT and proton therapy were 21 Gy (median), 14 Gy and 6 Gy, respectively. Median dose reductions with proton therapy compared with 3DCRT and IMRT were 13 Gy (p = 0.0022) and 8 Gy (p = 0.0022) for the stomach. Additionally, there was significant dose reduction using proton therapy for the liver, pancreas, bowel, left kidney and right kidney. Proton therapy reduces the dose to the stomach, liver, pancreas, small bowel and kidneys compared with 3DCRT or IMRT in patients with HL requiring abdominal radiotherapy. These dose reductions are expected to translate into lower risks of secondary cancers and other late toxicities in survivors of HL.
