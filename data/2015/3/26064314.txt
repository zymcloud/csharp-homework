Background:MEK1 is overexpressed in various human carcinomas, but the role of MEK1 is not well unknown in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we aimed to explore MEK1 expression of in HCC tissues, and to evaluate its relationship with clinical pathological features.Methods:Expressions of MEK1 were detected by western blot assay, real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in 30 HCC tissues and their adjacent normal tissues. Pearson Chi-square test was used to analyze the relationship between MEK1 expression and clinical pathological features. The survival curve was drawn by Kaplan-Meier method, and survival was analyzed by Lon-rank test.Results:The expression of MEK1 mRNA in HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues and so was the expression of MEK1 protein. In the 30 specimens, 70% was with Tumor/Normal ratio > 2, 10% with Tumor/Normal ratio Conclusion:MEK1 expressions in HCC tissues were significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues, which indicated that MEK1 was involved in the genesis and development of HCC. Moreover, it was closely related to the postoperative survival time of patients with HCC.
