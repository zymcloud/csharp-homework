Objective:To investigate the survival and recurrence data after treatment in neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix (NECUC) with stage Ib-IIa, and to analyse its prognostic factors.Methods:Thirty-two cases of primary NECUC in early-stage disease treated from Jan. 2005 to Dec. 2013 at Cancer Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were reviewed, and their data of clinicopathologic characteristics were collected and analysed. The median age was 37 years (range, 23-57 years). The distribution by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical stage: 19 cases stage Ib1, 10 cases stage Ib2, 1 case stage IIa1, 2 cases stage IIa2. Pathologic types: 22 cases of small cell carcinoma, 1 case of atypical carcinoid, 9 cases of mixed carcinoma. The diameter of cervical tumor: 12 cases ≥4 cm, 20 cases <4 cm. All patients underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic ± para-aortic lymphadenectomy, and 15 cases of them were preserved unilateral or bilateral ovaries. Pathologic examination showed that 25 cases with cervical deep stromal invasion thickness ≥1/2, 21 cases with lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI), and 18 cases with pelvic and (or) para-aortic lymph nodes involvement. Ten cases were performed neoadjuvant chemotherapy (range,1-3 cycles), all patients received postoperative chemotherapy (range,3-6 cycles), and 15 patients were treated with radiotherapy after surgery. The follow-up data were updated on Jul. 2014. The median follow-up time was 18 months (range, 7-71 months). A retrospective analysis was conducted to analyse the survival and recurrence data,and to explore the prognostic factors of NECUC.Results:Thirteen patients died during the follow-up period. The cumulative progression-free survival (PFS) of 2 and 5 years were respectively 54.2% and 38.1%, and the estimated median PFS was 29 months. The cumulative overall survival (OS) of 2 and 5 years were respectively 56.1% and 44.9%, and the estimated median OS was 31 months. Fourteen cases had recurrence, and the median recurrence time was 9 months (range, 3-30 months). Recurrent or metastatic sites: 2 cases in pelvis, 4 cases in liver, 3 cases in lung, 3 cases in adrenal glands, 3 cases in bones, 2 cases in brain, 1 case in pancreas, 1 case in lymph nodes of para-aorta and neck, and 3 cases had metastasis in two or more organs. Thirteen cases with recurrence died of disease, and another one is alive with disease. The univariate analysis showed that lesion size of the cervix and FIGO stage were significant prognostic factors (P<0.01), while age, tumor components, deep invasion in cervical stromal, LVSI, pelvic and (or) para-aortic lymph nodes involvement, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy and preserving ovaries were not significantly associated with prognosis (all P>0.05).Conclusion:The prognosis of NECUC in early-stage is poor and the lesion size of the cervix and FIGO stage are prognostic factors.
