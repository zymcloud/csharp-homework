Objective:To detect the expression of RA SAL2 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to investigate the association of RASAL2 expression with pathological characteristics and prognosis.Methods:Immunohistochemical SP method was used to detect the expression of RA SAL2 in 164 samples of HCC tissue and the adjacent tissue. Th e association of RA SAL2 expression with clinical features and prognosis was analyzed.Results:The expression of RASAL2 in adjacent tissue was significantly increased compared to that in HCC tissue (P0.05). The 5 years recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with low expression of RASLA2 was significantly reduced compared with that in patients with high expression of RASLA2 (PConclusion:Low expression of RRASAL2 is significantly associated with the poor prognosis of HCC, which is an independent factor for HCC prognosis.
