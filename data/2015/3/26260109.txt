Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has limited treatment options when diagnosed at advanced stages; therefore, early detection is critical to reduce mortality. There is disagreement about the value of Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) in HCC surveillance. We aim to improve the sensitivity of AFP in HCC surveillance by using an algorithm that incorporates screening history to define patient-specific thresholds for positive a screen.Methods:De-identified data from the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) trial, which enrolled 1050 patients with hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who were prospectively followed every 3-6 months, were analyzed. AFP was assayed at each visit, and ultrasonography was performed every 6-12 months. A panel adjudicated the diagnosis of HCC. A parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) screening algorithm, which incorporates screening history, was compared with a single threshold approach for interpreting AFP results.Results:During a median follow-up of 80 months, 88 patients (48 of 427 with cirrhosis and 40 of 621 with advanced fibrosis) were diagnosed with HCC. PEB improved the sensitivity of AFP for detecting all HCC from 60.4% to 77.1% (P Conclusions:PEB increases the sensitivity of AFP testing and detects HCC earlier among hepatitis C patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. These data should prompt a reevaluation of how AFP is used in combination with ultrasound in HCC surveillance.
