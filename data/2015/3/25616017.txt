Background:Long-term outcome of chronic hepatitis C patients with successful viral eradication seems to be promising.Aim:To evaluate mortality, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver failure and liver transplantation in sustained virological responders (SVR) and non-SVR patients with different stages of fibrosis.Methods:Seven hundred and fourteen patients with a follow-up of 7.2 (1-21.1) years (age: 51.4 Â± 12.0 years, 276 female, IFN-monotherapy: n = 19, IFN/RBV: n = 122, peg-IFN/RBV: n = 573, SVR: 551, non-SVR: 163) were studied. Two hundred and ten of 540 patients with a liver biopsy prior to treatment had advanced stages of fibrosis (Metavir F3/F4).Results:Forty-eight patients died during follow-up, 15 with SVR and 33 without (P Conclusions:Successful anti-viral therapy decreases mortality, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure in patients with advanced fibrosis. However, hepatocellular carcinoma development or liver failure are not prevented completely, and further follow-up of patients is advisable.
