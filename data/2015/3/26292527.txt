Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a significant upper respiratory tract disease of chickens with a worldwide distribution. Differentiating between wild-type and vaccine strains of ILT virus (ILTV) would be useful for enhancing disease control, and in the early stages of a disease outbreak molecular diagnostic tools for the detection and differentiation of the circulating virus could be applied. This study developed TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) assays to detect and differentiate the glycoprotein G (gG)-deficient (ΔgG) ILTV candidate vaccine strain of ILTV from ILTV strains that contain the gG gene. The gG+ve and gG-ve ILTV TaqMan assays were used in individual and multiplex format to detect, differentiate, and quantitate ILTV DNA in laboratory and clinical samples. The assays were highly sensitive and highly specific, with a detection limit of 10 viral template copies for each assay. Low interassay coefficients of variation were recorded (0.021-0.042 and 0.013-0.039) for gG+ve and gG-ve TaqMan assays, respectively. The multiplex assay was successfully used to examine the replication kinetics of wild-type and ΔgG strains of ILTV in cultured leghorn male hepatoma cells and embryonated hen eggs under coinfection conditions. The results showed that the TaqMan qPCR assay, along with the ΔgG ILTV vaccine, has the potential to be used in a "Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals" strategy for the control and eradication of ILT.
