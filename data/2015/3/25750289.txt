Background/aim:A long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) activated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (lncRNA-ATB) was recently described to promote the invasion-metastasis cascade in hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to clarify the clinicopathological role and prognostic relevance of lncRNA-ATB in colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials and methods:lncRNA-ATB expression was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 124 patients with CRC. Patients were divided into two groups based on the median lncRNA-ATB expression.Results:High lncRNA-ATB expression was significantly associated with greater tumor size, depth of tumor invasion, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis. Patients of the high-lncRNA-ATB expression group had significantly poorer outcomes than those of the low-expression group. Additionally, levels of lncRNA-ATB expression were significantly higher in patients with hematogenous metastases.Conclusion:lncRNA-ATB may be involved in the progression of CRC and be a novel indicator of poor prognosis in patients with CRC.
