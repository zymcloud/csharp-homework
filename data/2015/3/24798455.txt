Purpose:To evaluate the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with liver cirrhosis.Methods:In total, 128 men with known liver cirrhosis were prospectively evaluated using the validated German version of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire. In parallel, all men underwent a detailed examination including medical history; physical examination; Child-Pugh liver function score (CPS) assessment; and measurement of blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), total and free testosterone, sexual hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), prolactin, luteotropic hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).Results:Mean patient age and mean IPSS was 56 ± 9 years and 8 ± 6, respectively. Mild (IPSS: 1-7), moderate (IPSS: 8-19), and severe (IPSS: 20-35) LUTS were present in 60.2 % (77/128), 31.3 % (40/128), and 7.0 % (9/128) of the patients, respectively. Storage symptoms increased with the CPS (p = 0.04). Voiding symptoms and overall IPSS did not differ between the CPS groups (p = 0.93 and p = 0.67). No correlation was found between ascites volume and IPSS, storage symptoms, voiding symptoms, or quality of life (QoL) (p = 0.46, p = 0.26, p = 0.81, p = 0.87). From CPS groups A to C, mean PSA levels (p = 0.04), total and free testosterone levels (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), and SHBG levels decreased (p = 0.03); however, prolactin levels increased (p = 0.03). LH and FSH levels did not differ between the CPS groups (p = 0.15 and p = 0.35).Conclusions:Men with liver cirrhosis commonly have LUTS, with a predominance of storage symptoms. Liver cirrhosis may also affect PSA-based prostate cancer risk assessment. Accurate diagnosis and therapy strategies are warranted to improve the QoL of these patients.
