Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human malignancies and the third most common cause of cancer mortality in the world. In this study, we report that miR-411 expression is markedly upregulated in HCC cells and HCC tissues compared with normal control tissues and cells. Previous studies have shown that miR-411 plays a crucial role in a variety of biological processes in various human cancer cells. However, the specific function of miR-411 in HCC remains unclear. Ectopic expression of miR-411 promoted the proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of HCC cells, whereas inhibition of miR-411 reduced this effect. Bioinformatics analysis further revealed ITCH, a putative tumor suppressor as a potential target of miR-411. Data from luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-411 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ITCH mRNA and repressed expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. In functional assays, miR-411 promoted HCC cell proliferation, which could be suppressed by miR-411-in. Taken together, our data provide convincing evidence that miR-411 functions as an onco-miRNA, which was associated with cell proliferation of HCC, and its oncogenic effect is mediated chiefly through direct suppression of ITCH expression.
