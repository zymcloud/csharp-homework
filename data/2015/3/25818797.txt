Objevtive:To explore the feasibility and reliability of ultrasonic monitoring of portal vein (PV) and hepatic vein (HV) blood flow volume changes in the process of induced carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma and the correlation of PV/HV blood flow volume ratio (Qpv/Qhv) with the severity of liver cirrhosis.Methods:SD rats with diethylnitrosamine-induced liver carcinogenesis underwent regular liver ultrasound examinations including color flow imaging and pulsed Doppler examination. The main PV and HV blood flow parameters were measured to calculate Qpv/Qhv until successful induction of liver cancer.Results:The PV diameter increased significantly with the severity of liver cirrhosis in the rats (PConclusion:Ultrasonography is reliable to monitor the change of liver hemodynamics in rats with induced liver carcinogenesis, in which the changes of Qpv/Qhv are correlated with the severity of liver cirrhosis.
