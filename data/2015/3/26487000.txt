Background:The clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving surgical resection (SR) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are diverse. This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict individualized survival risk in patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria undergoing aggressive treatments (SR and TACE).Methods:A total of 1009 patients were enrolled in the study and randomly grouped into derivation (n = 505) and validation sets (n = 504). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to select significant prognostic predictors from the derivation set to generate the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination (concordance index) and calibration tests.Results:Serum albumin Conclusions:This easy-to-use nomogram may accurately predict survival at 1 and 3 years for individual HCC patients beyond the Milan criteria, and provide quantitative survival advantage of SR over TACE.
