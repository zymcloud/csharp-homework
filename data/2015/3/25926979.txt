Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can lead to advanced fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. A myriad of pathways and genetic influence contribute to NASH pathogenesis and liver disease progression. Diagnosing patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis is critical prior to treatment and prognostication. There has been ongoing interest in developing non-invasive biomarkers and tools for identifying NASH and advanced fibrosis. To date, there has been no approved therapy for NASH. Recently, the FLINT (Farnesoid X Receptor [FXR] Ligand Obeticholic Acid in NASH Treatment) trial provided promising results of the efficacy of obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, in improving histological features of NASH and fibrosis. Long-term studies are needed to assess the safety of obeticholic acid and its effects on liver- and cardiovascular-related outcomes.
