Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) constitutes a major health concern. Hepatitis C virus eradication by antiviral treatment can markedly reduce the risk of developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. A plethora of new direct antiviral agents have been developed and are being explored in clinical trials. One of the newest members of this family is the NS3/4A protease inhibitor ABT-450. The multi-targeted approach combining ritonavir-enhanced ABT-450 with ombitasvir and dasabuvir has been evaluated for the treatment of CHC Gt1 in treatment-na√Øve and treatment-experienced adults. In this article, we sought to discuss the current knowledge on ABT-450-containing regimens, with special emphasis on treatment-experienced CHC Gt1 patients. This new combination was found to be potent, safe and well tolerated. Future Phase III trials with larger sample size in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, non-Gt1, end-stage renal disease and liver transplant recipients are eagerly awaited.
