Psoralea corylifolia (P. corylifolia) is a medicinal plant used primarily in herbal dietary supplements to treat skin diseases, such as vitiligo and psoriasis. Case reports of liver toxicity have recently emerged from its use, which often includes co-administration with other herbal products. In this study, CYP3A4 inhibition and hepatotoxicity of P. corylifolia and its major components were evaluated in human recombinant CYP3A4 enzyme, differentiated human hepatoma HuH-7 and HepaRG cells. LC/MS-TOF was used to identify the major components of P. corylifolia fruit methanol-water extract. P. corylifolia and its major bioactive components psoralen and isopsoralen were then incubated with human recombinant CYP3A4 (10 min) or differentiated HuH-7 and HepaRG cells (24 h) prior to CYP3A4 activity and cytotoxicity assays. P. corylifolia extract, psoralen, and isopsoralen concentration dependently inhibited CYP3A4 activity with different potency in the three in vitro systems. No cytotoxicity was observed at any concentration tested. In vitro CYP3A4 inhibition by P. corylifolia and its major components suggests potential drug-dietary supplement interactions that warrant further investigations in vivo.
