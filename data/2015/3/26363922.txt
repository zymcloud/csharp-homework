Chronic hepatitis B infection remains a major disease burden globally, and leads to high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development. Current therapies of nucleot(s)ide analogues and interferon alpha treatment remain limited in their efficacy. Several key findings in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) life cycle have led to the development of novel antiviral drugs to inhibit viral replication and persistence. In addition, recent studies on HBV-specific innate and adaptive immune responses have advanced development of immunotherapy to restore immune mediated virus control in chronic hepatitis B patients. In this review, we discuss potential new therapeutic strategies targeting HBV or the host immune system that might lead to a sustained cure for chronic hepatitis B.
