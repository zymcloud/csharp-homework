Background:With advances in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening and treatment, the incidence of diagnosing a case of extrahepatic primary malignancy (EHPM) in patients with HCC has increased. This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of EHPM in patients with HCC who underwent curative resection in Korea.Methods:The clinical data of 250 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection in our hospital from May 2003 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical features, overall survival, and causes of death were compared between patients with HCC with or without EHPM.Results:The prevalence of EHPM among the 250 patients was 13.2% (n = 33). The most common site of EHPM was the colorectal (n = 10), followed by the stomach (n = 9), breasts (n = 4), and kidneys (n = 3). Patients with EHPM were significantly older, and they presented with higher rates of comorbidities, a different etiology of HCC, and better liver function than patients without EHPM. Interestingly, overall survival was significantly lower in the EHPM group, which more frequently displayed extrahepatic causes of death. Moreover, the presence of EHPM was an independent factor for overall survival in the study population.Conclusions:The prevalence of EHPM in patients with HCC who underwent curative surgical resection was 13.2% in Korea, with colorectal and stomach cancers comprising most EHPMs (88%). The patients with EHPM displayed significantly worse survival because of extrahepatic causes of death, which should be considered in the management of HCC in the future.
