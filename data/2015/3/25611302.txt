Background:Treatment of advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer with irinotecan is hampered by severe toxicities. The active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, is a known substrate of drug-metabolising enzymes, including UGT1A1, as well as OATP and ABC drug transporters.Methods:Blood samples (n=127) and tumour tissue (n=30) were obtained from advanced cancer patients treated with irinotecan-based regimens for pharmacogenetic and drug level analysis and transporter expression. Clinical variables, toxicity, and outcomes data were collected.Results:SLCO1B1 521C was significantly associated with increased SN-38 exposure (P<0.001), which was additive with UGT1A1*28. ABCC5 (rs562) carriers had significantly reduced SN-38 glucuronide and APC metabolite levels. Reduced risk of neutropenia and diarrhoea was associated with ABCC2-24C/T (odds ratio (OR)=0.22, 0.06-0.85) and CES1 (rs2244613; OR=0.29, 0.09-0.89), respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer in SLCO1B1 388G/G patients and reduced in ABCC2-24T/T and UGT1A1*28 carriers. Notably, higher OATP1B3 tumour expression was associated with reduced PFS.Conclusions:Clarifying the association of host genetic variation in OATP and ABC transporters to SN-38 exposure, toxicity and PFS provides rationale for personalising irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that OATP polymorphisms and expression in tumour tissue may serve as important new biomarkers.
