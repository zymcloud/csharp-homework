Aims:Microwave ablation (MWA) is a technique which is used to destroy tumours and soft tissues by using microwave energy to create coagulation and localized tissue necrosis. It is used to treat the tumours which are considered to be inoperable and used to treat those patients who are ineligible for surgery due to some factors. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the use of MWA in the treatment of liver cancer.Methods:The data were collected from Department of Ultrasound, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital. From July 2010 to August 2011, a total of 123 patients with liver tumours was referred to Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital. One hundred patients were selected for this study and treated with MWA. The study group contained 64 (64%) males and 36 (36%) females with an average age (± SD) of 52 (± 5.1) years.Results:One month after therapy, complete ablation was obtained in nodules. The complete ablation rate in tumors ≤ 3 cm and those > 3 cm was 98% and 94%, respectively. Microwave ablation success was higher with nodules ≤ 3 cm (57/58; 98.3%) in comparison to nodules > 3 cm.Conclusion:Sonographically guided percutaneous microwave ablation proved to be safe, fast and effective for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
