Background:To realize the role of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3B (APOBEC3B) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence, mRNAs of APOBEC3B from tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with hepatectomy were isolated and in vitro studies were designed.Materials and methods:Seventy-two tumor and non-tumor tissue samples, as well as clinical data, were collected from HCC patients during hepatectomy. The mRNA of APOBEC3B was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The viability of pLV-APOBEC3B-transfected Hep 3B cells was then determined. Cell growth of pLV-APOBEC3B-transfected Hep 3B cells was evaluated by in vitro migration assay.Results:The real-time polymerase chain reaction results indicated a higher expression of APOBEC3B mRNA in tumor tissues than in non-tumor tissues of patients with HBsAg+ HCC. The expression of APOBEC3B in tumor or non-tumor tissue was not found to be a risk factor of recurrence in patients with HCC. The cell viability assay results indicated the growth-inhibitory effects of APOBEC3B on Hep 3B cells. The cell migration results indicated that APOBEC3B inhibits wound healing in Hep 3B cells.Conclusion:Based on these observations, we infer that APOBEC3B is a potential factor contributing to suppression of tumor growth in HCC.
