OBJECTIVE. This systematic review presents evidence-based consensus statements as reported by a multidisciplinary expert panel (six abdominal radiologists, four hepatobiliary surgeons, and two hepatologists) regarding the use of gadoxetic acid for liver MRI. CONCULSION. Although this review highlights the incremental diagnostic value of hepatobiliary phase imaging with gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI in multiple clinical scenarios, there remains a need for further impact studies for some clinical applications, such as hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis.
