Nontarget embolization is a relatively common cause of post-chemoembolization complications. Clinical presentation following nontarget embolization varies from minimal to fatal, and oftentimes relates to the vascular distribution embolized rather than the amount or type of embolic agent. Post-chemoembolization pancreatitis is an uncommon complication, but one that is known to occur. The following manuscript presents a case of post-chemoembolization pancreatitis, and suggests methods to decrease this complication as well as treatment once the complication occurs.
