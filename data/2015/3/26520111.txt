Background and aim:There is increasing evidence that histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) is a novel tumor suppressor. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which HINT1 promotes the stability of inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα) in the cytoplasm of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, which was observed in our previous study (Wang et al. in Int J Cancer 124:1526-1534, 2009).Methods:We examined HINT1 and IκBα expression in HCC cell lines and determined the effect of HINT1 overexpression and knockdown on IκBα protein and mRNA expression in these cell lines. Then, ubiquitination assays were performed to investigate the effects of HINT1 expression plasmid transfection on IκBα ubiquitination. Next, the interaction between HINT1 and β-TrCP was investigated in immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays.Results:Our data showed that increased HINT1 expression in HepG2 and SMMC7702 cells markedly increased IκBα protein levels, while decreased HINT1 expression markedly decreased them. Overexpression or knockdown of HINT1 did not alter the transcription of IκBα, but HINT1 inhibited proteasomal IκBα degradation and reduced its ubiquitination levels. This inhibition might occur because HINT1 is a component of the SCF(β-TrCP) E3 ligase, which is responsible for IκBα ubiquitination and degradation.Conclusion:This study provides new evidence that HINT1 is a regulator of IκBα through SCF(β-TrCP) E3 ligase. These findings help to clarify the mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of HINT1.
