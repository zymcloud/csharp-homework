Background/aim:Head and neck adenoid cystic carcinoma (HNACC) is a rare malignancy of the salivary glands with a tendency to metastasize in lung or liver without lymph node involvement, whereas squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) preferentially metastasizes to locoregional lymph nodes. The expression patterns of microRNA, a class of small non-coding RNA transcripts, involved in gene regulation and various developmental processes, could be of influence during the metastatic process. The aim of the present study was to compare mircoRNA expression patterns of HNACC and HNSCC.Materials and methods:In a total of 21 tissue samples, a genome-wide screening for microRNAs was performed. A microRNA array platform was used for the identification of target microRNA.Results:Five microRNAs, hsa-MiR-214, hsa-MiR-125a-5p, hsa-MiR-574-3p, hsa-MiR-199a-3p/199b-3p and hsa-miR-199a-5p were identified to be over-expressed in HNACC compared to HNSCC, whereas hsa-MiR-452 showed a lower expression level.Conclusion:Our data showed significantly different expression patterns of mircoRNA in HNACC and HNSCC supporting the theory of tumor-specific expression and giving hints for different clinical behavior.
