Background:Everolimus (RAD001) is an orally administered mTOR inhibitor that is well known for its antitumor efficacy and that has been approved for the treatment of several solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma. In gastric cancer (GC), despite previous preclinical and phase I/II studies suggesting the promising efficacy of everolimus in previously treated AGC, more recent trials revealed that only certain subsets of patients might benefit from treatment with everolimus.Case presentation:A 26-year-old man with metastatic gastric cancer with multiple liver lesions was treated with everolimus after failure of 1st-line and 2nd-line chemotherapy. A durable partial response was achieved for over 2 years. After progression from initial everolimus treatment, sequential cytotoxic chemotherapies were tried but failed rapidly. Everolimus was re-tried as salvage chemotherapy (re-treatment), and the patient achieved stable disease for 1 year until his death. Subsequent mutational analysis and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with the tumor tissues just before re-treatment with everolimus revealed a PIK3CA hotspot mutation and pS6 overexpression in the primary tumor. After two cycles of everolimus re-treatment, the overexpression of pS6 became nearly absent in follow-up IHC staining.Conclusions:Everolimus monotherapy was satisfactory in a patient with refractory metastatic GC harboring PIK3CA and pS6 aberrations. These molecular alterations might be potential biomarkers that can predict the treatment response of everolimus, particularly in the terms of durable disease control. This case suggests and emphasizes that close evaluation of biomarkers in tumor tissue may be essential for identifying highly favorable groups among various subpopulations with AGC.
