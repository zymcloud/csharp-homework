Aim:To clarify the surgical outcome of patients who underwent endoscopic hepatectomy (EH) compared to those of conventional open hepatectomy (OH) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Between 1999 and 2011, 269 HCC patients meeting the Milan criteria were divided into EH (n=89) and OH groups (n=180). To equalize the background covariates, a one-to-one propensity case-matched analysis was used.Results:With propensity matching, 52 EH and 52 OH patients showed comparable preoperative clinical characteristics. The operation time (320 min, p=0.049) and the median blood loss (180 g, pConclusion:EH for HCC patients meeting the Milan criteria is less invasive and might provide an equivalent disease-free and overall survival when compared to conventional OH.
