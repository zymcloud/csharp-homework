Cryoablation is a less prevalent percutaneous ablative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and current evidence about its usefulness is limited. We report our experience in treating 1595 HCC cases with percutaneous cryoablation to give a comprehensive profile about the effectiveness, safety and long-term outcome of this therapy. From January 2003 to December 2013, 1595 patients with 2313 HCC nodules were ablated with 2958 cryoablation sessions in our center. Complete ablation was achieved in 1294 patients for 1893 nodules with a mean diameter of 3.4 Â± 2.2 cm. The complete ablation rate was 81.2%, 99.4%, 94.4%, and 45.6% in all tumors, tumors 5 cm, respectively. Major complications were observed after 80 (3.4%) of the 2958 cryoablations and minor complications were observed after 330 cryoablations with no treatment-related deaths. After a median follow-up of 33.4 months, 937 patients developed different types of recurrence. The 5- and 10-year overall survival was 25.7% and 9.2%, respectively. Cryoablation showed reliable safety and efficacy and should be considered as a promising technique, particularly when a large zone of ablation is required.
