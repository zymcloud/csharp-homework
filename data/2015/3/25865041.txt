Background and study aim:Trans-arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) became the treatment of choice for multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma. The use of prophylactic antibiotics following intervention is controversial. This study aimed to assess the role of serum procalcitonin level in early diagnosis of bacterial infection following TACE to optimise antibiotic intake in those patients.Patients and methods:This study was carried on HCC patients diagnosed according to AASLD who underwent TACE and developed post interventional fever within 48 h. Laboratory investigations including CBC, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein and ESR (pre and after intervention) were done. Cultures were done according to the suspected site of infection. Serum procalcitonin was done for all the included patients before and after TACE.Results:Forty two TACE treated patients were included with post interventional fever within 48 h. Their ages ranged between 45 and 65 (mean 53.83 Â± 5.23). All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis started 24h pre intervention and for 5 days after according to the local protocol. Five patients (11.9%) had positive blood cultures post intervention. The analysis of laboratory results showed statistical significant correlation between procalcitonin levels and positive cultures, post interventional CRP and TLC and pre interventional INR and bilirubin, while there was statistical significant correlation between CRP and post interventional temperature, total leucocytic count and site of focal lesion.Conclusion:Procalcitonin seems to be a promising marker for diagnosis of sepsis in TACE treated HCC patients to optimise the unnecessary use of antibiotics.
