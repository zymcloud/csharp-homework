Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility of half-dose gadoxetic acid (0.0125mmol/kg) for liver MRI at 3-T compared to standard-dose (0.025mmol/kg) in patients at risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).Materials and methods:Forty patients who underwent both half-dose and standard-dose gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRIs were included. Contrast enhancement index (CEI) was calculated for liver, aorta, pancreas and kidney. Two observers independently rated and performed a one-to-one direct comparison of enhancement quality for both groups.Results:Liver CEIs were not significantly different on arterial phase between the two groups but CEIs of standard-dose MRIs were greater than half-dose MRIs on other phases (PConclusion:Liver MRI using half-dose gadoxetic acid at 3-T can be a feasible alternative for standard-dose MRI in patients at risk for NSF.
