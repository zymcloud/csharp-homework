Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (γ-GGT), an oxidative stress marker, is correlated with inflammation in the extracellular hepatic microenvironment. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of serum γ-GGT levels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy. Three hundred and eight patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC were included in the study. Preoperative serum γ-GGT levels, as well as demographic, clinical, and pathologic data, were analyzed. The optimal cutoff value of γ-GGT was 88 U/L. All patients were divided into γ-GGT ≤ 88 U/L group (n = 146) and γ-GGT > 88 U/L group (n = 162). The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of patients in the γ-GGT > 88 U/L group were poorer than those in γ-GGT ≤ 88 U/L group. Preoperative serum γ-GGT levels, associating with gender, HBsAg status, tumor size, capsulation, tumor number, and vascular invasion, was an independent prognostic predictor of disease-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.616; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.223-2.135; P = 0.001] and overall survival (HR = 2.043; 95 % CI, 1.509-2.766; P
