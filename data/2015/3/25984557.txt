Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health burden with an estimated 170-200 million peoples chronically infected worldwide. HCV infection remains as an independent risk factor for chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and a major reason for liver transplantation. Discovery of direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs have shown promising results with more than 90% success rate in clearing the HCV RNA in patients, although long-term consequences remain to be evaluated. microRNAs (miRNAs) are important players in establishment of HCV infection and target crucial host cellular factors needed for productive HCV replication and augmented cell growth. Altered expression of miRNAs is involved in the pathogenesis associated with HCV infection by controlling signaling pathways such as immune response, proliferation and apoptosis. miRNA is emerging as a means of communication between various cell types inside the liver. There is likely possibility of developing circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of disease progression and can also serve as diagnostic tool with potential of early therapeutic intervention in HCV associated end stage liver disease. This review focuses on recent studies highlighting the contribution of miRNAs in HCV life cycle and their coordinated regulation in HCV mediated liver disease progression.
