Our previous studies have shown that decreased expression of Annexin A7 elevates apoptosis in Hca-P cells, a hepatocarcinoma cell line with lymphatic metastatic potential. In this study, RNA interference technique was used to down-regulate the expression of Annexin A7, and unmanipulated Hca-P cells and transfected nonspecific-sequence Hca-P cells as control. The down-regulation of Annexin A7 declined the cell viability after cisplatin exposure. And the reduced expression of Annexin A7 decreased the expression of Bcl2, increased the expression of Cytochrome-C in the cytoplasme, and then improved the expression of Caspase-3. However there was no significant effect on the expression of Bax, Caspase-12, Fas, FasL and Caspase-8. The results indicate that the decreased expression of Annexin A7 could inhibit the proliferation, and increase the apoptosis of Hca-P cells by affecting the expression of the apoptosis associated proteins by the mitochondrial pathway.
