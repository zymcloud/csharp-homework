Aim:To determine the optimal type of surgery for late-stage gastric cancer with hepatic metastases.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 49 gastrectomies for late-stage gastric cancer conducted in the First Hospital Affiliated to Henan University of Science and Technology between September 2003 and September 2010. All gastrectomy operations were divided into two groups: radical resection (gastrectomy and simultaneous resection of hepatic metastases, n = 31), and palliative resection (gastrectomy without hepatic resection, n = 18). All 49 patients had chemotherapy catheter implantation in the hepatic artery via the gastroduodenal artery. Postoperative complications and cumulative survival rates of the two groups were compared and analyzed.Results:There was no significant difference in the number of perioperative complications between the radical and palliative resection groups (6 and 3 cases, respectively, P > 0.05). The incidence of long-term complications including ileus (3 in the radical resection and 2 in the palliative resection groups) and anastomosis (2 cases in each group) was not significantly different (P > 0.05). The cumulative survival rate was significantly lower in the palliative resection group (P < 0.05).Conclusion:Radical gastrectomy with resection of hepatic metastases and hepatoarterial catheter implantation is the recommended surgery for late-stage gastric cancer patients with hepatic metastases.
