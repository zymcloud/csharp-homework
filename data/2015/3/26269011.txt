Objective:To explore the diagnosis, treatment and long-term outcome of late acute rejection (LAR) following adult orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods:A total of 398 consecutive adult patients who underwent OLT in Organ Transplant Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University between January 2007 and December 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. There were 48 patients (12. 1%) developed to LAR, including 43 male patients and 5 female patients, with an average age of (52 ± 13) years(18 - 70 years). The mean body mass index was (22.1 ± 4. 5) kg/m2 (15. 4 - 30. 4 kg/m2). The indications of the liver transplantation recipients included 16 cases of end-staged liver cirrhosis after hepatitis B or C(33. 3%), 14 cases with severe hepatitis (29. 2%), 9 cases of primary liver cancer(18. 5%), 5 cases of alcoholic liver cirrhosis (10. 4%), 1 case with autoimmune liver disease (2. 1%) , the other 3 cases (6. 3%). They were followed up by outpatient service, telephone and other means. Survival curves were generated with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards modeling was used for predictors of mortality. Statistically significant variables found by single factor regression analysis were put into the Cox proportional hazards regression model of multivariate analysis.Results:The time-to-event was 23. 6 months after OLT which were more common in the first year to the third year post-transplant (26/48,52. 4%). Thirty-five cases were assessed as mild, 11 cases were assessed as moderate, and 2 cases were assessed as severe ,based on the Banff schema. After adjustment to the immunosuppressive regimen, the overall recovery rate reached to 81. 3%. The rate of steroid-resistant acute rejection was 11. 8% (4/34). Inadequate immunosuppression and steroid pulsation were two independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of LAR (P = 0. 008, P = 0. 003, respectively).Conclusions:LAR is an uncommon complication after OLT. Inadequate immunosuppression and steroid pulsation are the major risk factors for prognosis of LAR. Improving patient compliance and strengthening blood concentration surveillance can increase the patient survival.
