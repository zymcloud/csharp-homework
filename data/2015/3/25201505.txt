Background:The treatment of patients with metastatic rectal cancer remains controversial. We developed a reverse strategy, the liver-first approach, to optimize the chance of a curative resection. The aim of this study was to assess rectal outcomes after reverse treatment of patients with metastatic rectal cancer.Methods:From May 2000 to November 2013, a total of 34 consecutive selected patients with histology-proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum and liver metastases were prospectively entered into a dedicated computerized database. All patients were treated via our reverse strategy. Rectal and overall survival outcomes were analyzed.Results:Most patients presented with advanced disease (median Fong clinical risk score of 3; range 2-5). One patient failed to complete the whole treatment (3%). Rectal surgery was performed after a median of 3.9 months (range 0.4-17.8 months). A total of 73.3% patients received preoperative radiotherapy. Perioperative mortality and morbidity rates were 0 and 27.3% after rectal surgery. Severe complications were reported in two patients (6.1%): one anastomotic leak and one systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The median hospital stay was 11 days (range 5-23 days). Complete local pathological response was observed in three patients (9.1%). The median number of lymph nodes collected was 14. The R0 rate was 93.9%. There was no positive circumferential margin. After a mean follow-up of 36 months after rectal surgery, 5-year overall survival was 52.5%. Five patients experienced pelvic recurrence.Conclusions:In our cohort of selected patients with stage IV rectal cancer, the reverse strategy was not only safe and effective, but also oncologically promising, with a low morbidity rate and high long-term survival.
