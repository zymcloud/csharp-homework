Background:TSU-68 is a multikinase inhibitor that targets platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of TSU-68 on the tumor-microenvironment interaction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:HCC and fibroblast cell lines (HuH7, Hep3B, HuH1 and WI-38) were used to evaluate their interactions. Cancer characteristics were evaluated by spheroid formation and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. Time-lapse image analysis was performed to monitor cell motility.Results:Although PDGFA was abundantly expressed, PDGFR-α was predominantly located in the cytoplasm and was not functional in HuH7 cells. Co-culture experiments demonstrated that HCC cells induced phosphorylation of PDGFR-α in WI-38 fibroblasts and that stimulated fibroblasts, in turn, boosted the spheroid formation capacity of HCC cells. TSU-68 inhibited phosphorylation of PDGFR-α in WI-38 cells and suppressed the growth of subcutaneously co-injected HuH7/WI-38 tumor xenografts.Conclusion:TSU-68 inhibits stromal PDGF signaling activated by cancer cells and suppresses HCC growth.
