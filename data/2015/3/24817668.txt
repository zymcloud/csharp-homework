Background:Skeletal muscle depletion or sarcopenia has been identified as a poor prognostic factor for various diseases. The aim of this study is to determine whether muscle depletion is a prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We evaluated 217 consecutive patients with primary HCC. The skeletal muscle cross-sectional area was measured by computed tomography at the third lumbar vertebra (L3), from which the total body fat-free mass (FFM) and L3 skeletal muscle index (L3 SMI) were obtained. The factors contributing to overall survival (OS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.Results:In univariate analysis, FFM (P = 0.0422), Child-Pugh classification (P = 0.0058), serum albumin level (P 22) died earlier (P = 0.0129).Conclusions:Skeletal muscle depletion is an independent prognostic factor. Intervention to prevent muscle wasting might be an effective strategy for improving the outcome of HCC.
