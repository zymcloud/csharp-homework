Purpose:To compare efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization with and without radiation therapy (RT) versus sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Materials and methods:This single-center retrospective study involved 557 patients with HCC with PVTT who initially received chemoembolization (1997-2002; n = 295), chemoembolization and RT (2003-2008; n = 196), or sorafenib (2009-2012; n = 66) according to eligibility criteria among an initial population of 617. The three groups were divided into three pairs (chemoembolization vs chemoembolization/RT, chemoembolization vs sorafenib, and chemoembolization/RT vs sorafenib), and time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were compared by propensity-score analyses.Results:The chemoembolization/RT group had longer median TTP and OS than the chemoembolization-alone and sorafenib groups (P Conclusions:Within the limitation of a retrospective study, the present data indicate that transarterial chemoembolization combined with RT could be considered as an alternative to the standard sorafenib in the treatment of patients with advanced-stage HCC with PVTT.
