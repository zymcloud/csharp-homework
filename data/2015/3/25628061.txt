Aim:This prospective multicenter study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using percutaneous catheter placement techniques for liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).Methods:We administered 5-fluorouracil at 1000 mg/m2 over 5 h via hepatic arterial infusion on a weekly schedule. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (RR). The secondary endpoints were the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicities.Results:Between February 2000 and March 2002, seventy-seven eligible patients were enrolled in this study. After a median of 26 treatment cycles, 4 patients achieved a complete response, 29 achieved a partial response, 28 had stable disease, 15 had progressive disease and the status of one patient was unknown. The overall RR was 42.9% and the disease control rate (DCR) was 79.2%. The median PFS and OS times were 203 and 560 days, respectively. The most common grade 3 or 4 hematological and non-hematological toxicities were total bilirubin level elevation (10.4%) and gamma-glutamyl transferase level elevation (10.4%). With regard to the relationship between the background factors and treatment outcomes, the DCR, RR, PFS and OS were different between patients with and without extrahepatic lesions (DCR: 86.5% vs 64%, RR: 46.2% vs 36.0%, PFS: 233 days vs 99 days, OS: 587 days vs 558 days).Conclusion:The primary endpoint of this study was not met. HAIC using percutaneous catheter placement techniques did not improve the RR for liver metastasis from CRC.
