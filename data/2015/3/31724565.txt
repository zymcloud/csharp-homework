Chemotherapy has been anecdotally related to aneurysm growth, but no correlation has been noted to date for localized transarterial chemoembolization. We present the case of a 64-year-old man with clearly documented accelerated aortic and iliac artery aneurysm dilation after two rounds of transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma. Given the large size with rapid growth of his aneurysms and inability to be listed for transplant consideration before repair, he was offered endovascular repair and was successfully treated.
