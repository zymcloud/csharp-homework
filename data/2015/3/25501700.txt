Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of the treatment modes for liver cancer. The trauma caused by RFA is small, and its local curative effect is reliable. Computed tomography (CT) can only be used for axial scans, and parts of the lesion are unclear on plain scans. The aim of this study is to compare the local curative effect of RFA percutaneously guided by MRI and ultrasound for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study is a retrospective study. In this study, we examined 60 cases of 88 liver lesions and 50 cases of 52 lesions, in which RFA was guided by MRI and ultrasound, respectively. All cases were clinically diagnosed. The therapeutic effect of ablation lesions was examined by postoperative imaging follow-up. The results indicated that there were 5 (5/88) recurrences of liver lesions with MRI-guided RFA and 14 (14/52) recurrences of liver lesions with ultrasound-guided RFA. The median time to recurrence in the case of recurrent lesions was 7 months. Postoperative ablation lesions showed a low-intensity signal surrounded by a thin high-intensity signal ring on T2WI images. On T1WI images, the ablation lesion showed a concentric pattern and the central area of the original lesion continued to show a low-intensity signal with a clear ring of high-intensity signal that had a clear boundary. In conclusion, the local curative effect of MRI-guided RFA for small HCC is superior to that of ultrasound-guided RFA.
