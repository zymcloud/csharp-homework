Objective:To investigate the diagnostic value of serum Golgi protein-73 (GP73) combined with the AFP-L3% test for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Comprehensive electronic and manual searches were performed to retrieve relevant studies on GP73 combined with AFP-L3% for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. After screening of the studies according to inclusion criteria and extraction of the data,meta-analysis was performed in Meta-disc 1.4 and Stata 12.0.Results:Eleven studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected from the total 138 references with potential relevance.The threshold effect was not found in the GP73 combined with AFP-L3% for the diagnosis of liver cancer.However,heterogeneity was found in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of GP73 combined with AFP-L3% was 0.853 and 0.960 respectively. The area under summary receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.948, and the Q index was 0.888.Conclusion:GP73 combined with AFP-L3% can significantly improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to a high level, and can improve the diagnosis rate of hepatocellular carcinoma.
