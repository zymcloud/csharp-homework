Surgery involving elderly patients is becoming increasingly common due to the rapid aging of societies all over the world. The objective of this study was to elucidate the prognostic differences between elderly and young patients who undergo liver resection. A systematic review based on the PRISMA flow diagram was conducted. Ovid Medline and PubMed were used to search for relevant literature published between January 2000 and March 2013, and the modified MINORS score was used to assess the methodological quality. In cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and miscellaneous liver tumors, the morbidity and mortality rate did not differ significantly between the elderly and young patients. For patients with colorectal metastatic liver cancer, the mortality of the young patients was 2.7 times lower than that of elderly patients. Our review of high-quality retrospective studies was able to elucidate the clinical risks of age on the outcomes after liver surgery in specific patient populations.
