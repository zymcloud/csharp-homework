Aim:Liver volumetric analysis has not been used to detect hepatic remodelling during antiviral therapy before. We measured liver volume (LV) changes on volumetric magnetic resonance imaging during hepatitis C antiviral therapy.Methods:22 biopsy-staged patients (median [range] age 45(19-65) years; 9F, 13M) with chronic hepatitis C virus infection were studied. LV was measured at the beginning, end of treatment and 6 months post-treatment using 3D T1-weighted acquisition, normalised to patient weight. Liver outlines were drawn manually on 4 mm thick image slices and LV calculated. Inter-observer agreement was analysed. Patients were also assessed longitudinally using biochemical parameters and liver stiffness using Fibroscanâ„¢.Results:Sustained viral response (SVR) was achieved in 13 patients with a mean baseline LV/kg of 0.022 (SD 0.004) L/kg. At the end of treatment, the mean LV/kg was 0.025 (SD 0.004, P = 0.024 cf baseline LV/kg) and 0.026 (SD 0.004, P = 0.008 cf baseline LV/kg) 6 months post-treatment (P = 0.030 cf baseline, P = 0.004). Body weight-corrected end of treatment LV change was significantly higher in patients with SVR compared to patients not attaining SVR (P = 0.050). End of treatment LV change was correlated to initial ALT (R (2) = 0.479, P = 0.037), but not APRI, AST, viral load or liver stiffness measurements. There was a correlation of 0.89 between observers for measured slice thickness.Conclusions:LV increased during anti-viral treatment, while the body weight-corrected LV increase persisted post-antiviral therapy and was larger in patients with SVR.
