Background & aims:Whether perioperative blood transfusions (PBTs) negatively impact oncologic outcomes after curative resection for HCC remains controversial. We aimed to identify the independent predictive factors of PBT for curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to investigate the impact of PBT on long-term recurrence and survivals after resection.Methods:Of 1103 patients who underwent curative liver resection for HCC between 1999 and 2010, 285 (25.8%) patients received PBT. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were used to identify independent predictive factors of PBT. Propensity scores and Cox regression analyses were used to compare the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients who did and did not receive PBT.Results:Multivariable regression analysis revealed that performance status, preoperative hemoglobin, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, tumor rupture, tumor size, macroscopic vascular invasion, and intraoperative blood loss were independent predictive factors of PBT for HCC resection. Propensity score matching analysis created 234 pairs of patients. Before propensity matching, PBT was significantly associated with increased risks of OS (HR: 2.455, 95% CI: 2.077-2.901, pConclusions:The present study identified that PBT did not influence RFS and OS after curative resection of HCC.
