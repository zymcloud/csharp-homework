Background and objectives:Unroofing hepatectomy, an alternative approach to remove a deep-seated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) adjacent to major intrahepatic vessels by peel-off technique after sacrificing the overlying noncancerous liver, may result in tumor exposure without resection margin. The aim of the study was to examine the value of this approach in cirrhotic patients.Methods:Between 1998 and 2012, 51 cirrhotic patients underwent unroofing hepatectomy for deep-seated newly-diagnosed HCC adjacent to major intrahepatic vessels (group A). Another 274 cirrhotic patients with similar tumor size and without gross major vessel involvement in the same period were selected as the control cohort (group B). The patients' clinicopathological characteristics, the early and long-term outcomes of the two groups were compared.Results:The HCCs in group A had a significantly higher rate of tumor encapsulation, smaller number of associated satellite nodules, and smaller amount of resected liver weight. Postoperative complication and 90-day mortality rates were similar, but group A patients had a significant better 5-year disease-free (56% vs. 32%, P = 0.011) and overall survival rates (82% vs. 53%, P = 0.008).Conclusions:In selected cirrhotic patients, unroofing hepatectomy facilitates resection of deep-seated HCC adjacent to major intrahepatic vessels with acceptable early and long-term results.
