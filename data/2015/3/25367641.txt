In vitro bioassays are useful techniques for the determination of biological effects in sediment samples containing complex mixtures of contaminants. In this study, 28 surface sediment samples from Taihu Lake, East China, were collected for toxicity assessment using a battery of in vitro bioassays. The battery included a two-hybrid yeast bioassay for estrogenic and thyroidal effects, the H4IIE rat hepatoma cell bioassay for aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor (Ah-agonists)-mediated effects as measured by ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and the SOS/umu bioassay for genotoxic effects. Toxicities were expressed as 17β-estradiol equivalents (EEQs), T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) equivalents (T3-EQs), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalents (TEQs), and induction ratios (IRs) of β-galactosidase activity. The results showed that total estrogenic effects in sediment samples ranged from 0.0011 to 12.4 pg EEQ/g sediment [dry weight (d.w.)], the thyroidal effects ranged from 0.35 to 24.8 pg T3-EQ/g sediment (d.w.), the Ah-agonist effects varied from 2.70 to 37.8 pg TEQ/g sediment (d.w.), and the weight of soil required for the extracts to lead to a positive result (IR 2.0) in the SOS/umu bioassay was between 1.98 and 15.3 mg (d.w.) per well. Significantly positive correlations were only found between lgT3-EQs and lgEEQs, which indicated similar spatial distributions of estrogenic and thyroidal effects in Taihu Lake. These results suggested that the applied battery of in vitro bioassays represented an efficient (fast and cost-effective) screening system for the identification of emerging contaminants in Taihu Lake and provided meaningful information for further analysis and risk evaluation.
