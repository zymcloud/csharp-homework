Oxidative stress has been investigated in the context of alcoholic liver injury for many years and shown to be a causal factor of chronic hepatitis C (CHC), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), drug-induced liver injury, Wilson's disease, and hemochromatosis. In CHC, it has been demonstrated that oxidative stress plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. In cases with persistent hepatitis due to failure of hepatitis C virus eradication, or chronic liver disease, such as NASH, the treatment of which remains unestablished, it is important to reduce serum alanine aminotransferase levels and prevent liver fibrosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. This also suggests the importance of antioxidant therapy. Among treatment options where it would be expected that anti-inflammatory activity plays a role in their confirmed efficacy for chronic hepatitis, iron depletion therapy, glycyrrhizin, ursodeoxycholic acid, Sho-Saiko-To, and vitamin E can all be considered antioxidant therapies. To date, however, the ability of these treatments to prevent cancer has been confirmed only in CHC. Nevertheless, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects have been demonstrated in other liver diseases and these therapies may potentially be effective for cancer prevention.
