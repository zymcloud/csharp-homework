Purpose:This study was performed to evaluate the accumulation of lipiodol emulsion (LE) and adverse events during our initial experience of balloon-occluded trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (B-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with conventional TACE (C-TACE).Methods:B-TACE group (50 cases) was compared with C-TACE group (50 cases). The ratio of the LE concentration in the tumor to that in the surrounding embolized liver parenchyma (LE ratio) was calculated after each treatment. Adverse events were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0.Results:The LE ratio at the level of subsegmental showed a statistically significant difference between the groups (t test: P Conclusion:The LE ratio at the level of subsegmental showed a statistically significant difference between the groups (t test: P
Adverse events; Balloon-occluded trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (B-TACE); Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
