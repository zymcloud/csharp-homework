Objective:The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/computed tomography (CT) in bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Of 3912 consecutive HCC patients, 67 patients who had undergone both PET/CT and bone scintigraphy (BS) within a 3-month interval were evaluated.Results:Bone metastases were most frequently found in the pelvis (20%), followed by the lumbar spine (14%) and long bones (13%). PET/CT was significantly more sensitive than BS in region-based analyses, with 273 confirmed bone metastases (96.7 vs. 52.7%, respectively; P5.0). Large metabolic volume (≥200 cm3) of bone metastasis was another poor prognostic factor. On Cox regression analysis, high α-fetoprotein was the only poor prognostic factor with statistical significance.Conclusion:PET/CT was more sensitive than BS in bone metastasis from HCC by both patient-based and region-based analyses, and offered additional information on survival. PET/CT can be helpful in early diagnosis and opportune treatment of bone metastasis from HCC.
