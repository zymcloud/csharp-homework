The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti‑growth effect of the self‑designed multiple antigenic polypeptide (MAP) vaccine comprising B‑cell epitopes of heparanase (HPSE) on HCC97‑H hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mice. The polyclonal antibodies against the B‑cell epitopes of HPSE were prepared by immunizing rabbits with freshly synthesized MAP vaccine. HCC‑bearing models were constructed on BALB/c nude mice. Anti‑MAP antibodies were administrered to the models to assess the effects on HPSE activity, HCC growth, the expression of VEGF/bFGF and the value of micro‑vessel density (MVD). The anti‑MAP antibodies were harvested, purified and identified. These antibodies were able to specifically bind with the dominant epitopes of the precursor protein and large subunit monomer of HPSE, decrease HPSE activity, suppress the expressions of VEGF and bFGF, reduce the MVD, and markedly shrink the HCC volume. Based on these findings, MAP vaccine based on the B‑cell epitopes of HPSE seemed to provide theoretical evidence for further study of the synthesized HPSE MAP vaccine in the treatment of HCC.
