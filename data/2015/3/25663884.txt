The present study reports two cases of mandibular metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including the clinical presentation, and computed tomography (CT), histopathology and immunohistochemistry results. Space-occupying lesions occurred unilaterally as an initial mandibular manifestation. HCC metastasis was confirmed by post-surgical examination, and the primary tumor was found using CT scans. Hepatitis B virus infection history and positive results of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e-antibody, hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis B virus pre-S1 antigen further supported the pathogenesis of HCC. Based on the clinical findings, the characteristics of the CT scans and the histopathology and immunohistochemistry results, the mechanisms of HCC metastasis and its management are also discussed.
