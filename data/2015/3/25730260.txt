Background:A quantity of case-control studies have been performed to address the association between three cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) polymorphisms (-1195G/A, -765G/C and +8473T/C) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, previous research results are inconsistent. We conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the correlation between these COX-2 polymorphisms and HCC risk.Methods:The authors searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, CNKI and WanFang database for relevant articles up to April 28, 2014. The data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.Results:A total of 8 studies consisting of 2182 cases and 3324 controls were included in this meta-analysis. For COX-2 polymorphism -1195G/A, an association with increased risk was observed under the heterogeneous, homozygous, dominant model. However, COX-2 polymorphisms (-765G/C and +8473T/C) were not related to HCC risk in this study. We also found a similar result in the subgroup analysis of Chinese population that -1195G/A polymorphism, instead of -765G/C or +8473T/C polymorphism, was correlated with the risk of HCC.Conclusions:Polymorphism -1195G/A of COX-2 might be associated with susceptibility to HCC, but no similar correlations were observed between polymorphisms (-765G/C and +8473T/C) and HCC risk. Further large and well-designed studies are required to validate this association.
