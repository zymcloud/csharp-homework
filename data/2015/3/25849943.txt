Recent studies have shown that multiple phosphatases deactivate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Here we demonstrated that, by suppressing multiple phosphatases, miR-3127 promotes growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study also reveals clinical significance of miR-3127 expression in HCC patients. MiR-3127 expression was markedly upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Furthermore, high miR-3127 expression was associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. MiR-3127 overexpression promoted HCC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Also, miR-3127 accelerated G1-S transition by activating AKT/ FOXO1 signaling, by directly targeting the 3' untranslated regions (3`UTR) of pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1/2 (PHLPP1/2), inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 4A (INPP4A), and inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase J (INPP5J) mRNA, repressing their expression. In agreement, the miRNA antagonist antagomir-3127 suppressed HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth by inhibiting the AKT/FOXO1 signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest that silencing miR-3127 might be a potential therapeutic strategy.
