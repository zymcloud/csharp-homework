Lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma is rare, which has been recognized as a variant of hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we report a locally advanced case of lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma. A 50-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection presented with a single mass in the liver and two enlarged lymph nodes in retroperitoneum suspected to be hepatocellular carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. After discussion by multidisciplinary team, the patient underwent hepatectomy of VIII segment and dissection of two enlarged lymph nodes. One month after the operation, pre-chemotherapy abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed retroperitoneal enlarged lymph nodes, considered as local recurrence. Therefore, 3 cycles of oxaliplatin and tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsule and 3 cycles of paclitaxel and cisplatin were offered, and post-chemotherapy abdominal CT revealed disease remained stable. The patient has been alive for 6 months since performance of surgery. Our report suggests that even locally advanced lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma may have a good prognosis and operation and postoperative chemotherapy may benefit the patient.
