Background:Da Huang (Radix et Rhizoma Rhei) is the dried root or rhizome of Rheum palmatum L., Rheum tanguticum Maxim ex Balf. or Rheum officinale Braill of family Polygonaceae. It has heat clearing, damp drying, fire purging and toxin removing effects. Because of its definite curative efficacy, it has been widely applied in clinical settings.Objective:To study the inhibitory effect of emodin on human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 and its mechanism.Methods:MTT assay, flow cytometry and electron microscopy were used to investigate the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of emodin on human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721.Results:12 h, 24 h and 48 h after the action of 20, 40 and 80 umol/L emodin on SMMC-7721 cells, the proliferation of human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells was inhibited; the inhibitory effects showed time-and concentration-dependence. 48 h after the action of different concentrations of emodin on SMMC-7721 cells, cells in G2/M phase increased significantly, while the proportion of S phase cells gradually declined.Conclusion:Emodin can inhibit human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721.
