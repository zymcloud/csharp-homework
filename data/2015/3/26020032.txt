A key mission of the Asia-Pacific Primary Liver Cancer Expert (APPLE) Association is to ensure a coherent view for management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to advance new treatment for this difficult disease. At the 5th APPLE meeting, held in July 2014 in Taipei, Taiwan, an APPLE consensus development program was established to facilitate discussion among experts in the Asia-Pacific region on pertinent issues for HCC management, including (1) surgery for intermediate/advanced-stage disease, (2) prevention of HCC recurrence after curative treatment, (3) optimizing imaging diagnosis, (4) radiotherapy: current practice and future clinical trials, and (5) the role of cytotoxic chemotherapy. A pre-congress questionnaire was undertaken with the consensus development committee members to help understand the current practice patterns for HCC in the Asia-Pacific region and to identify issues relating to optimal patient care and further clinical trials for which consensus needs to be developed. In this report, the results of the questionnaire are presented, and the pertinent issues identified by each consensus group for further discussion and consensus development are summarized.
