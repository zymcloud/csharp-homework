Background:Nearly 20% of tuberculosis (TB) patients die within one year, and TB-related mortality rates remain high in Taiwan. The study aimed to identify factors correlated with TB-specific deaths versus non-TB-specific deaths in different age groups among TB-related mortalities.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2006-2008 with newly registered TB patients receiving follow-up for 1 year. The national TB database from the Taiwan-CDC was linked with the National Vital Registry System and the National Health Insurance database. A chi-squared test and logistic regression were used to analyse the correlated factors related to TB-specific and non-TB-specific deaths in different age groups.Results:Elderly age (odds ratio [OR] 2.68-8.09), Eastern residence (OR 2.01), positive sputum bacteriology (OR 2.54), abnormal chest X-ray (OR 2.28), and comorbidity with chronic kidney disease (OR 2.35), stroke (OR 1.74) or chronic liver disease (OR 1.29) were most likely to be the cause of TB-specific deaths, whereas cancer (OR 0.79) was less likely to be implicated. For non-TB-specific deaths in patients younger than 65 years of age, male sex (OR 2.04) and comorbidity with HIV (OR 5.92), chronic kidney disease (OR 8.02), stroke (OR 3.75), cancer (OR 9.79), chronic liver disease (OR 2.71) or diabetes mellitus (OR 1.38) were risk factors.Conclusions:Different factors correlated with TB-specific deaths compared with non-TB-specific deaths, and the impact of comorbidities gradually decreased as age increased. To reduce TB-specific mortality, special consideration for TB patients with old age, Eastern residence, positive sputum bacteriology and comorbidity with chronic kidney disease or stroke is crucial. In particular, Eastern residence increased the risk of TB-specific death in all age groups. In terms of TB deaths among patients younger than 65 years of age, patients with HIV, chronic kidney disease or cancer had a 6-10 times increased risk of non-TB-specific deaths.
