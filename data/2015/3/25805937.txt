Aim:To compare outcomes from radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and hepatectomy for treatment of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM).Methods:From January 2000 to December 2009, 408 patients underwent curative intent treatment for CRLM. We excluded patients using the criteria: size of CRLM > 3 cm, number of CRLM ≥ 5, percutaneous RFA, follow-up period < 12 mo, double primary cancer, or treatment with both RFA and hepatectomy. We matched 51 patients who underwent RFA with 102 patients who underwent hepatectomy by propensity scores.Results:The median follow-up period was 45 mo (range, 12 mo to 158 mo). Hepatic recurrence was more frequent in the RFA than the hepatectomy group (P = 0.021) although extrahepatic recurrence curves were similar (P = 0.716). Survival curves of hepatectomy group were better than that of RFA for multiple, large (> 2 cm) CRLM (P = 0.034). However, survival curves were similar for single or small (≤ 2 cm) CRLM (P = 0.714, P = 0.740).Conclusion:Hepatectomy is better than RFA for the treatment of CRLM. However, RFA might be suitable for selected patients with single, small (≤ 2 cm) CRLM.
