Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Herein, we first reported the codelivery of sorafenib and curcumin by directed self-assembled nanoparticles (SCN) to enhance the therapeutic effect on HCC. SCN was formed by employing the hydrophobic interactions among the lipophilic structure in sorafenib, curcumin, and similar hydrophobic segments of polyethylene glycol derivative of vitamin E succinate (PEG-VES), which comprised uniform spherical particles with particle size of 84.97 Â± 6.03 nm. SCN presented superior effects over sorafenib, curcumin, and their physical mixture (Sora + Cur) on enhancing in vitro cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis in BEL-7402 cells and Hep G2 cells, and antiangiogenesis activities in tube formation and microvessel formation from aortic rings. Moreover, the tissue concentration of sorafenib and curcumin in gastrointestinal tract and major organs were significantly improved after their coassembly into SCN. In particular, in BEL-7402 cells induced tumor xenograft, SCN treatment displayed the obviously enhanced inhibitory effect on tumor progression over free drug monotherapy or their physical mixture, with significantly increased antiproliferation and antiangiogenesis capability. Thereby, the codelivered nanoassemblies of sorafenib and curcumin provided a promising strategy to enhance the combinational therapy of HCC.
