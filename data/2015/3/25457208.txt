Background & aims:Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) plays a critical role in the detoxification of the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde. This study was designed to examine the impact of global ALDH2 overexpression on alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis.Methods:Wild type Friend virus B (FVB) and ALDH2 transgenic mice were placed on a 4% alcohol or control diet for 12 weeks. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin and cholesterol, hepatic triglyceride, steatosis, fat metabolism-related proteins, pro-inflammatory cytokines, glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), autophagy and autophagy signalling were examined. The role of autophagy was evaluated in alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1)-transfected human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (VA-13) treated with or without the autophagy inducer rapamycin and lysosomal inhibitors.Results:Chronic alcohol intake led to elevated AST-, ALT-levels, bilirubin, AST/ALT ratio, cholesterol, hepatic triglycerides and hepatic fat deposition as evidenced by H&E and Oil Red O staining. Hepatic fat deposition was associated with disturbed levels of fat metabolism-related proteins (fatty acid synthase, SCD1), upregulated interleukin-6, TNF-α, cyclooxygenase, oxidative stress, and loss of autophagy, effects which were attenuated or ablated by the ALDH2 transgene. Moreover, ethanol (100 mM) and acetaldehyde (100 and 500 μM) increased levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ, and suppressed autophagy in VA-13 cells, effects which were markedly alleviated by rapamycin. In addition, lysosomal inhibitors mimicked ethanol-induced p62 accumulation with little additive effect with ethanol. Ethanol significantly suppressed LC3 conversion in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors.Conclusions:In summary, our results revealed that ALDH2 plays a beneficial role in ameliorating chronic alcohol intake-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation through regulation of autophagy.
