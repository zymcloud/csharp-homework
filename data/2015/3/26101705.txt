The axon guidance cues netrin-1 has been reported to be associated with cancer progression in various types of human cancers. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of netrin-1-mediated metastasis remains obscure. In this study, we found that overexpression of netrin-1 promoted HCC cell migration and invasion as determined by transwell assay and 3D cell culture assay. However, netrin-1 knockdown inhibited these processes. Further investigation indicated that netrin-1 decreased the expression of Blood Vessel Epicardial Substance (BVES), which was down-regulated in HCC. Interestingly, LY294002, a special inhibitor to PI3K/AKT signaling which was determined as a downstream pathway of netrin-1, restored the reduction in BVES caused by netrin-1. In addition, BVES exhibited an opposite effect on HCC cell metastasis to that of netrin-1. Importantly, up-regulating BVES expression significantly attenuated netrin-1-enhanced migration and invasion, whereas silencing BVES expression rescued the metastatic phenotype in netrin-1 knockdown cells. Moreover, netrin-1 expression was negatively correlated with BVES in HCC tissues and cell lines with different metastatic potential. Taken together, these results reveal that netrin-1 promotes HCC cell metastasis by regulating BVES expression via AKT activation.
