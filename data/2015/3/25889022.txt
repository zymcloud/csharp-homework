Background:Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (GLPS) have been used as traditional Chinese medicine for their properties of cancer prevention and immunomodulation. However, it is unclear whether GLPS has therapeutic effect on anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vivo. In this study, the effect of GLPS and their impact on the balance of regulatory T cell (Treg) and effector T cell (Teff) was measured in a model of hepatoma-bearing mice.Methods:The effect of GLPS and their impact on the balance of regulatory T cell (Treg) and effector T cell (Teff) were measured in a model of hepatoma-bearing mice. Real-time PCR detected the levels of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNA. The effects of Tregs on Teff proliferation were determined via suppression assay. The mircroRNA-125b (miR-125b) inhibitor was used to down-regulate miR-125b expression.Results:GLPS significantly suppressed tumor growth in hepatoma-bearing mice associated with an increase of the ratio of Teffs to Tregs. Moreover, GLPS eliminate Treg suppression of Teff proliferation with an increase in IL-2 secretion. Addition of GLPS to treat T cells inhibited Notch1 and FoxP3 expression through increase of miR-125b expression. In hepatoma-bearing mice, miR-125b inhibitor obviously abolished the effect of GLPS on tumor growth.Conclusions:This finding provides the novel evidence for GLPS on inhibition of HCC through miR-125b inhibiting Tregs accumulation and function.
