The incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) has increased worldwide in line with an improved screening by high-resolution imaging of cirrhotic livers. Besides abdominal ultrasonography and computerised tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important tool to detect HCCs. With commercialisation of MR hepatobiliary contrast agents that cross membrane transporters in hepatocytes or tumour cells, MRI adds new information to detect and characterise HCCs. When tumour cells lose organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1/B3) in cell membranes facing sinusoidal blood, tumours appear hypointense (decreased contrast agent concentrations) in comparison to surrounding normal or cirrhotic liver that retains OATP1B1/B3 expression. However, expression, regulation, and prognostic significance of transporter evolution along carcinogenesis are not completely known. Moreover, understanding signal intensities in focal lesions also relies on transport functions of cellular efflux transporters. This manuscript reviews all the publications that associate liver imaging with hepatobiliary contrast agents and expression of transporters. The regulation of transporters along carcinogenesis to anticipate the prognosis of focal lesions is also included.
