Increasing evidence indicates that abnormal microRNA (miRNA) expression is related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Our study aimed to elucidate the essential role of miR-329 in HCC progression. Real-time PCR was used to analyze miR-329 and bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) expression in HCC samples (n = 135). Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometric analysis were used to investigate cell proliferation and apoptosis. The transwell assay was used to examine the cell invasive ability. The regulation mechanism was confirmed by luciferase reporter and western blot assays. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to detect the function of miR-329 on the prognosis of HCC patients. miR-329 was decreased in HCC samples and was related to tumor development. Furthermore, miR-329 significantly regulated cell invasion by targeting BRD4 but had no effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, downregulation of miR-329 predicted poor prognosis of HCC patients. miR-329 could control cell invasion via regulating BRD4 expression and may be a prognostic marker in HCC.
