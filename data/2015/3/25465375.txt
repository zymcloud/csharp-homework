Background:A phase II clinical trial was conducted on colorectal cancer patients with only liver metastases (focal diameter exceeds 5 cm or the number of liver metastases is ≥5; H2·H3) to evaluate the liver resection rate and safety after 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab (BV) therapy.Methods:mFOLFOX6+BV therapy was applied for 6 cycles to the patients with H2·H3 liver only metastasis. Hepatectomy was considered after the sixth cycle as a rule, and was performed if possible. The primary endpoint was the curative hepatectomy rate (R0 resection rate).Results:Forty-six patients were registered and 45 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. Of the 19 patients rated as unresectable before therapy, 18 completed 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6+BV therapy and subsequently underwent hepatectomy (16 were R0-resected). Of the 26 initially unresectable patients, 6 underwent hepatectomy (4 were RO-resected). The overall R0 resection rate was 44.4% (20/45). Chemotherapy-associated grade 3 or higher adverse events included neutrophil decreased (17.4%) and leukocyte decreased (8.7%), fatigue (6.5%) etc. Only hypertension (6.5%) and venous thromboembolism (2.2%) were BV-associated grade 3 or higher adverse events. Among the 25 patients who underwent hepatectomy, intraoperative/postoperative complications included grade 3 wound infections (2 cases), biloma, delayed wound healing and intraperitoneal abscess (each 1 case).Conclusions:In colorectal cancer patients with liver-only metastases, mFOLFOX6+ BV therapy yielded a high hepatectomy rate and a high percentage of initially unresectable and subsequently resectable cases. The chemotherapy associated adverse events and hepatectomy complications were both within acceptable ranges.
