Background and aims:The prognostic role of noninvasive assessments of liver fibrosis has been evolving. Our aim was to investigate the prognostic value of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with transient elastography and serum-based Hui index to predict hepatic events and deaths in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.Methods:The main prospective cohort included 1555 consecutive CHB patients referred for transient elastography examination; a subgroup of 980 patients underwent follow-up assessments at least 3 years later formed the serial cohort. Cox proportional hazard model was performed to determine the relationship of LSM, Hui index and other clinical variables with hepatic events and deaths.Results:During a mean follow-up of 69 Â± 9 months, 119 patients (7.6%) developed hepatic events or deaths. Hepatic event-free survival was significantly decreased with increasing stages of LSM and Hui index. The 5-year cumulative probability of hepatic event-free survival of patients of Stage 1-7 of LSM were 99.3%, 98.8%, 95.7%, 90.9%, 89.6%, 74.6%, and 50.0%, respectively; that of Stage 1 to 3 of Hui index were 98.2%, 93.1%, and 77.5%, respectively. Independent predictors of hepatic event-free survival were age, baseline LSM, and follow-up Hui index. Serum ALT and body mass index affected the accuracy of prediction by LSM. Patients remained early stages of LSM or Hui index at follow-up visit had better survival compared to those remained at late stages.Conclusion:Baseline and change in noninvasive parameters of liver fibrosis, LSM and Hui index, are accurate to predict hepatic event-free survival in CHB patients.
