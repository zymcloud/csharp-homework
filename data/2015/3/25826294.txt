Over-expression of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway genes is associated with the prognosis of various types of cancers. However, effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes on recurrence and death of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after surgery are still unknown. A total of 492 primary HCC patients treated with surgery were included in this study. Nine SNPs in 3 genes (ACACA, FASN and ACLY) of DNL pathway were genotyped. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used to analyze the association of SNPs with clinical outcomes. Two SNPs in ACACA gene were significantly associated with overall survival of HCC patients. Patients carrying homozygous variant genotype (VV) in rs7211875 had significantly increased risk of death, while patients carrying VV genotype in rs11871275 had significant decreased risk of death, when compared with those carrying homozygous wild-type or heterozygous genotypes. Moreover, patients carrying VV genotype in rs11871275 had decreased recurrence risk, while patients carrying variant genotype in rs4485435 of FASN gene had increased recurrence risk. Further cumulative effect analysis showed significant dose-dependent effects of unfavorable SNPs on both death and recurrence. SNPs in DNL genes may serve as independent prognostic markers for HCC patients after surgery.
