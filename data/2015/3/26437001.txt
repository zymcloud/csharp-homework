Recently, we identified a novel liver fibrosis glycobiomarker, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-reactive colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (WFA(+) -CSF1R), using a glycoproteomics-based strategy. The aim of this study was to assess the value of measuring WFA(+) -CSF1R levels for the prognosis of carcinogenesis and outcome in liver cirrhosis (LC) patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV). WFA(+) -CSF1R and Total-CSF1R levels were measured in serum samples from 214 consecutive HCV-infected patients to evaluate their impact on carcinogenesis and the survival of LC patients. Serum WFA(+) -CSF1R levels were significantly higher in LC patients than chronic hepatitis (CH) patients (p
