Background:Although radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective local ablative technique for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the optimal treatment for recurrence after RFA has not been established.Methods:Between September 2002 and December 2011, 46 hepatectomies (salvage group) were performed for intrahepatic (local or multifocal) recurrent HCC after RFA. The difference between the imaging findings before RFA and at the time of salvage resection, especially in the Local recurrent group, and the short-term and long-term outcomes after salvage surgery were analyzed retrospectively by comparing them with those for a matched control group (n = 46) and with those of patients who underwent a second hepatic resection for HCC recurrence after an initial hepatic resection during the same period (n = 155).Results:The tumor-occupying region was more distributed widely before the salvage resection compared with that before RFA, and a more extensive operation would have been required (rather than the RFA) in the local group. An evaluation of the short-term outcomes revealed that salvage resection required a longer operative time and was associated with a greater frequency of morbidity. The long-term outcomes of the salvage group were poorer than those of patients who underwent repeat hepatic resection for HCC recurrence after an initial hepatic resection.Conclusion:The indications for RFA should be determined carefully, because recurrence after RFA may be associated with a more aggressive pattern of recurrence, and the long-term results after salvage resection are unsatisfactory.
