Purpose:To investigate magnetic resonance (MR) findings of angiomyolipoma (AML) on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging, and to identify features that differentiate AML from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with a low risk of HCC development.Methods:This retrospective study was institutional review board approved, and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Twelve patients with hepatic AML who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI with no risk factors for HCC development were recruited. Twenty-seven patients with HCC under the same inclusion criteria were recruited as control. Two radiologists analyzed the images in consensus for morphologic features, enhancement patterns, and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) findings. All results were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, two-tailed Fisher exact test, and chi-square test.Results:Patients with AML were younger than those with HCC (48.8 ± 15 years for AML vs. 62.7 ± 14.2 years for HCC, p = 0.008) with female predominance, while most HCC patients were male (75% (9/12) vs. 15% (4/27), p Conclusions:Although AMLs showed similar enhancement patterns to HCCs during the dynamic phases of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, using characteristic MR features of AML during the HBP and demographic differences, one can better differentiate AML from HCC.
