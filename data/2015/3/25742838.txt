We report a very rare case of a 55-year-old man with chest wall metastatic tumor caused by seeding of hepatocellular carcinoma after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatic tumor 42 months after the initial operation. The patient was managed with aggressive full-thickness chest wall resection and reconstruction with a Prolene (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) and methyl methacrylate sandwich graft and subsequent musculocutaneous free-flap transposition.
