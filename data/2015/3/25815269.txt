Aim:To compare prevalence of chronic renal dysfunction (CRD) according to serum creatinine (sCr) vs estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among maintenance liver transplant patients.Methods:The ICEBERG study was an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional, and multicenter study. Consecutive adult patients (aged 18 years or older) with liver transplantation (LT) performed at least two years previously were recruited. Multi-organ transplant recipients were excluded. Chronic renal dysfunction was defined according to sCr based criteria in routine clinical practice (≥ 2 mg/dL) and eGFR using MDRD-4 equation (Results:A total of 402 patients were analyzed (71.6% males). Mean ± SD age at transplant was 52.4 ± 9.8 years. Alcoholic cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma was the most common reason for LT (32.8%). Mean time since LT was 6.9 ± 3.9 years. Based on sCr assessment, 35.3% of patients (95%CI: 30.6-40.0) had CRD; 50.2% (95%CI: 45.3-55.1) according to eGFR. In 32.2% of cases, sCr assessment had underestimated CRD. Multivariate analysis showed the following factors associated with developing CRD: eGFR Conclusion:Seven years after LT, CRD affected half our patients, which was underestimated by sCr. An eGFR
