This phase II, investigator-initiated, prospective single-arm multinational study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT00990860) evaluated sorafenib in combination with doxorubicin-based transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with intermediate-stage, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with histologically or clinically diagnosed HCC received TACE with interrupted dosing of sorafenib (sorafenib discontinued for 3 days before and 4-7 days after TACE). TACE/sorafenib cycles were repeated every 6-8 weeks. Primary and secondary objectives were, respectively: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TACE combined with sorafenib, and also their efficacy. The full analysis set comprised 192 patients (mean age 56.1 years). Most were male (87.0%), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0 (81.8%), Child-Pugh A (91.8%) and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B (81.5%); 81.2% had chronic hepatitis B. Combined TACE/sorafenib was well tolerated, with only 8.1% of patients discontinuing owing to adverse events (AEs). The most common grade â‰¥3 AEs were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (15.1%) and decreased platelet count (10.9%). Serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 52 patients during the study; however, only four were considered related to sorafenib. A mean of 2.7 TACE cycles were administered and 52.6% of patients achieved complete response in target lesions; 16.8% achieved partial response, and 5.8% had progression of disease as their best response, evaluated by modified RECIST. Median progression-free survival and time to progression were 384 and 415 days, respectively, and the estimated 3-year overall survival was 86.1%. This study suggests that the combination of TACE and sorafenib is well tolerated and efficacious; the interrupted sorafenib dosing schedule may have contributed to a considerably lower AE profile than observed in other combination trials.
