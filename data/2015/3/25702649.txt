Peritoneal carcinomatosis from hepatocellular carcinoma is well regarded as a poorly treatable malignant disease with rapid decline. Over the past decade, new modalities that combine cytoreductive surgery with perioperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy have been shown to be aggressive local-regional treatments with improved survival. We present a case of a 67-year-old non-cirrhotic woman with peritoneal metastases from hepatocellular caracinoma who was treated with cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Consideration remains individualized, but it can be considered in patients with adequate preservation of liver function, management of their primary hepatocellular caracinoma as well as the localized nature of their peritoneal metastases.
