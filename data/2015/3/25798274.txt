Isolated metastases in the left atrium that are discontinuous with an intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are extremely rare. This is the case report of a 46-year-old male patient with pulmonary metastases from HCC, who presented with a tumor in the left lung, extending to the left atrium through the left pulmonary vein. Two weeks after the initiation of treatment with sorafenib, the tumor metastasized to the left parietal cerebral lobe, with an intracranial hemorrhage. Although the patient underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for the metastatic brain tumor, his condition gradually deteriorated and he succumbed to multiple organ failure 4 months later. Given the severe complications that have been reported in patients with this type of metastasis, immediate multidisciplinary treatment, including surgical resection, should be considered.
