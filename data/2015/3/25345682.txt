Background:Splenectomy is a therapy for thrombocytopenia caused by hypersplenism with liver cirrhosis. However, the determinant of therapeutic outcomes for this complication has not yet been fully clarified.Methods:We studied the laboratory findings of 55 patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism with liver cirrhosis. In addition, we examined the histopathological findings of hepatosplenic tissues of nine patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma and splenectomy for hypersplenism with liver cirrhosis on one stage surgery. The locations of platelets in hepatosplenic tissues were identified by immunohistochemistry. We used monoclonal antibody against CD41.Results:Among 55 patients, 40 patients had high serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (â‰§38 IU/l). Blood platelet count after splenectomy of patients with high serum ALT level were significantly lower than those of patients with low serum ALT level (P = 0.02). Histopathologically, platelet area of the liver tissues was positively correlated with hepatic inflammation (P = 0.02). Platelet area of the liver tissues was negatively correlated with blood platelet count after splenectomy (P = 0.03).Conclusions:Hepatic inflammation contributes to the accumulation of platelets in liver; therefore, in patients with high serum ALT level, improvement of thrombocytopenia by the elimination of hypersplenism was limited.
