Aim:This study aimed at investigating the clinical characteristics of malignancies associated with pregnancy and to provide information for the development of suitable strategies of treating maternal malignancies.Methods:We conducted a retrospective analysis of 21 pregnant women with cancer who were admitted to our hospital between 2006 and 2012. The patients' clinical characteristics, treatment during pregnancy and postpartum, and pregnancy outcome were recorded.Results:There were 21 cases of malignancies associated with pregnancy, including 6 cases of cervical cancer, 6 cases of breast cancer, 3 cases of liver cancer, 2 cases of ovarian cancer, 2 cases of thyroid cancer, 1 case of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and 1 case of malignant brain tumor. Of the 21 patients, 15 patients continued their pregnancies (9 of these patients received cancer treatment), whereas the other 6 terminated pregnancy. The modes of delivery included cesarean section (12 cases) and vaginal delivery (3 cases), which resulted in 17 newborns, 12 of them with preterm birth (12/17, 70.6 %). The gestational age was from 30 weeks + 5 days to 39 weeks. No neonatal malformations were found.Conclusions:The management of malignancies associated with pregnancy is a challenge for doctors and patients. It should be based on histological subtype, disease stage, gestational age, obstetrics complications, and patient's preference regarding continuing the pregnancy.
