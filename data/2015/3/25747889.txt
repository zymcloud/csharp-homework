Aims:To investigate the cooperative effect of Bifidobacteria lipoteichoic acid (BLTA) combined with 5-fluorouracil on tumor cells growth and apoptosis in mice bearing H22.Methods:Hepatoma-22 (H22) cells were cultured in RPMI1640. Establish tumor-bearing mice model of liver cancer by injecting intraperitoneally 1Ã—10(6)/mL cells into the above-mentioned Balb/c mice. 5-FU alone, BLTA alone or BLTA in combination with 5-FU were used to treat tumor-bearing mice. The tumor size were observed and measured regularly. The growth-inhibiting rate (IR) of tumor was detected. Real-Time PCR and Western blot were used to detect Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3 expressions of mRNA and protein in tumor tissue of tumor-bearing mice. Detection of apoptotic cells in tumor tissue by HE staining analysis. Detection of the organ index was for evaluate the added-activity of immune organs in mouse. FCM was used to detect T subgroup ratio of spleen cells of tumor-bearing mice. Expression change of mRNA and proteins of Foxp3 and TIM-3 were detected by Real-Time PCR and Western blot in tumor-bearing mice tumor tissue.Results:BLTA and 5-FU significantly inhibited the proliferation of tumor and induced obvious apoptosis, the combined effects were greater than those of the individual agents (PConclusions:These results show that combined effects of Bifidobacteria lipoteichoic acid and 5-FU on H22 cells were superior to the individual. The combination did not only increase anti-tumor effect, but also could alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy, with inhibiting TIM-3/TIM-3L pathway, cutting down immunosuppressive activity of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg and enhancing cell-mediated immunity.
