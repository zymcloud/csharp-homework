This study was designed to investigate the apoptosis-inducing properties of Tegillarca granosa extract Haishengsu (HSS) in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402. Proliferation inhibition of the human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 cells was determined by the MTT assay, and the cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Apoptosis of BEL-7402 cells was demonstrated by fluorescence microscope with flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and Hoechst 33258 staining. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR were used to determine the expression levels of Fas. Expressions of caspase-8 and caspase-3 were examined by caspase activity assay and western blot analysis. HSS inhibited the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Our results showed HSS had positive effect on apoptosis through flow cytometry assay and fluorescence microscope. The expressions of Fas protein and mRNA were up-regulated following the treatment. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 were activated in the cells cultured with HSS. In conclusion, HSS induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma BEL-7402 cells. The apoptosis was associated with the up-regulation of Fas and the activations of caspase-8 and caspase-3.
