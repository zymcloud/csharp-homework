Background:Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare primary malignant liver tumor, significantly different from generic hepatocellular carcinoma with distinct demographics, risk factors, imaging features, histopathology and prognosis.Case report:Unlike conventional hepatocellular carcinoma, it presents in young individuals with no preexisting hepatitis or cirrhosis and does not cause elevation of serum alpha feto proteins in most cases. This paper presents a case report of this rare tumor in a young female with an unusual clinical manifestation of obstructive jaundice (which has not been reported so far) along with a review of its imaging and pathological features, with treatment options.Conclusions:Fibrolamellar HCC is a rare variant of classic HCC with different epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, radiological, pathological and prognostic features. Therefore, it is important to be familiar with the entity for its early diagnosis and management.
