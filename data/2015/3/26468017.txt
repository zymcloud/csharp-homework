It is known that chronic HBV infection (CHB) is the major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because CHB could not only cause liver tumorigenesis but also lead to change of local microenviroment and lower immune response to infected and cancerous cells (immune tolerance). Human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) belongs to a non-classic MHC-I family and was considered to be an immune tolerance molecule, which could bind to immunosuppressive receptors of natural killer cell (NK) and T cells and trigger immunosuppressive signaling. Recently, numerous studies highlighted that microRNAs (miRNAs) were significantly differentially expressed in HCC tumorigenesis, and the expression was tissue-specific, indicating that miRNAs may cause great epigenetic changes in HCC tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that the expression of HLA-G was upregulated by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and miR-152; a HLA-G-targeting miRNA was downregulated by HBV infection. And high expression of HLA-G further suppressed NK against cancer cells, providing a new concept that miR-152 was involved in HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.
