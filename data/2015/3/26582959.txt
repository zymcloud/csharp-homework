Background:Clinical factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been extensively studied in antiviral treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection but not in treatment-experienced patients. Owing to the wide availability of antiviral agents that effectively suppress HBV replication, we investigated HCC risk factors in treatment-experienced patients.Methods:In a cohort of 330 patients who underwent pretherapeutic liver biopsy, we analyzed the HCC incidence in relationship to clinical parameters. Ultra-deep sequencing of the viral genome was performed on 11 entecavir-treated and pegylated interferon (peginterferon)-treated patients.Results:Initial univariate/multivariate explorations indicated that cirrhosis and antiviral treatment were independently associated with HCC occurrence. The peginterferon-experienced patients had a lower HCC incidence than the nucleos(t)ide analogue-treated patients (P = .011). The peginterferon and entecavir monotherapy groups also differed in HCC incidence (P = .018). Results of analysis of baseline-matched subgroups concurred with cohort analysis (P = .009 for comparison of peginterferon-experienced vs nucleotide analogue-treated patients; P = .022 for comparison of peginterferon- vs entecavir-treated patients). Viral loads of entecavir-treated patients were constantly suppressed to levels lower than those of peginterferon-treated patients (P Conclusions:Treatment by peginterferon was associated with a lower HCC incidence than nucleos(t)ide-analogue treatment in chronic HBV infection.
