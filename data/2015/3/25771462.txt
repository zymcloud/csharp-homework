Introduction:The aims of this study were to detect the seroprevalence of hepatitis A, B, and C viruses in Turkish alcoholic cirrhotics, and to evaluate the impact of hepatitis B infection on clinical profile at first admittance.Methodology:Serological markers for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses in 300 alcoholic cirrhotics diagnosed between January 1994 and December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 148 eligible patients were divided into group 1 (HBsAg positive, n = 43) and group 2 (HBsAg and anti-HBc negative, n = 105). Clinical characteristics at first admittance of groups 1 and 2 were compared.Results:The seroprevalence of anti-HAV total, HBsAg, and anti-HCV was found to be 91.5%, 16.3%, and 8.2%, respectively. The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma was higher in the HbsAg-positive group compared to HbsAg- and anti-HBc-negative group (16.3% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.007). Other clinical features were similar in the two groups.Conclusions:Alcoholic cirrhotics have higher frequencies of HBsAg and anti-HCV than the general population. These patients should be investigated for coexistent HBV and HCV infections, and HBV vaccination should not be neglected. Alcoholic cirrhotic patients with concomitant HBV infection should be closely screened for hepatocellular carcinoma.
