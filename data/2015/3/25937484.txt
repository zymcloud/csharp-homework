Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver and third most common cause of cancer-related mortality. According to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered a recommended option for intermediate HCC.Objectives:The purposes of our study were to evaluate the various factors affecting the outcome of TACE, to study the efficacy of TACE by evaluating the imaging response by European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) necrosis criteria, and to study the survival of patients.Methods:Fifty-three patients (M = 48, F = 5) with unresectable HCC and treated with TACE were included in our study. Baseline laboratory and imaging characteristics were obtained. Clinical and laboratory toxicities were assessed. EASL necrosis response criteria were used to determine imaging response. Survival from the time of the first chemoembolization treatment was calculated. Univariate, multivariate, and survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier estimations.Results:A total of 53 patients underwent chemoembolization. Median age was 63 years (range 21-81 years). Thirty-one patients (58.4 %) belonged to Child-Pugh class A, while 22 patients belonged to Child-Pugh class B. Thirty-five patients died during the study period. Median study period was 13 months. Overall survival rate at 1 year was 62.26 %. Prognostic factors found to be significant on multivariate analysis were Child-Pugh class, presence of metastasis, and initial tumor size, while on univariate analysis, portal vein thrombosis, EASL response, and baseline AFP levels were also significant.Conclusion:Chemoembolization was an effective and safe treatment in Child A and early Child B patients. Factors that had adverse effect on survival were Child class B, larger tumor size, presence of portal vein thrombosis and metastasis, and high baseline alpha-fetoprotein levels.
