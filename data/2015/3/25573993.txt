Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare syndrome of uncontrolled immune activation that has gained increasing attention during the last decade. The diagnosis of HLH is based on a constellation of clinical and laboratory abnormalities, including elevated serum ferritin levels. In the pediatric population, marked hyperferritinemia is specific for HLH. To determine what conditions are associated with profoundly elevated ferritin in the adult population, we performed a retrospective analysis in a large academic health care system. We identified 113 patients with serum ferritin levels higher than 50,000 Âµg/L. The most frequently observed conditions included renal failure, hepatocellular injury, infections, and hematologic malignancies. Our results suggest that marked hyperferritinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions and is not specific for HLH in adults.
