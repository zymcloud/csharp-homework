Seven new δ-tocotrienols, designated litchtocotrienols A-G (1-7), together with one glorious macrocyclic analogue, macrolitchtocotrienol A (8), and one new meroditerpene chromane, cyclolitchtocotrienol A (9), were isolated from the leaves of Litchi chinensis. Their structures were mainly determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis, and their biological activities were evaluated by cytotoxicity against human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines (AGS, ATCC CRL-1739) and hepatoma carcinoma cell line (HepG2 2.2.1.5). The structure-activity relationship of the isolated compounds was also discussed.
Litchi chinensis; cyclolitchtocotrienol; hepatoma carcinoma cell line; human gastric adenocarcinoma cells; macrolitchtocotrienol; δ-tocotrienol.
