Spontaneous bilo-enteric fistula is a rare complication following surgery or some therapeutic interventions such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The present case was a young man, a known case of chronic hepatitis B with multiple recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma, who presented with clinical sepsis and jaundice. Computed tomography showed dilated proximal left intrahepatic ducts which suspected anastomotic stricture. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, but the endoscopic view showed a deep ulcer covered by yellowish debris tissue. After re-evaluation it was found to be hepaticoduodenostomy and choledochoduodenostomy tracts. In the present case the fistula was suspected to be related to a previous TACE procedure.
