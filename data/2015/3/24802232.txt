Aim:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who receive an initial full dose of sorafenib (800 mg/day) often require a decreased dose (400 mg/day) or discontinuation of therapy because of severe adverse events. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with HCC to compare the safety and efficacy of full- to half-dose sorafenib.Methods:We reviewed the medical records of 218 consecutive patients with intermediate or advanced stage HCC who received half (n = 73) or full-dose sorafenib (n = 145) between 2009 and 2012 at four institutions. A propensity score-matching analysis was used to adjust for potential bias.Results:Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that increased age was an independent factor for the selection of initial half-dose sorafenib (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.15; P Conclusion:Propensity score-matched analyses indicate that initial half-dose sorafenib treatment led to fewer severe adverse effects and a comparable survival benefit compared with a full dose in select patients with HCC, particularly for those of advanced age.
