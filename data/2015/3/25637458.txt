Gefitinib (Iressa®) is a selective small-molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations of EGFR tyrosine kinase. Large phase III or IV clinical trials in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed that gefitinib as first- or subsequent-line treatment significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and improved objective response rates and/or health-related quality of life parameters in patients with activating EGFR mutations and in clinically selected patients (e.g., Asian patients or never-smokers) who are more likely to harbour these mutations. Overall survival did not increase significantly with gefitinib, although post-study treatments may have had a confounding effect on this outcome. Gefitinib was generally well tolerated in these studies, with mild or moderate skin reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances and elevations in liver enzymes among the most common adverse reactions in gefitinib recipients; interstitial lung disease has also been reported in <6 % of gefitinib recipients. Compared with chemotherapy, gefitinib as first- or subsequent-line therapy provided similar or greater PFS benefit and was generally associated with fewer haematological adverse events, neurotoxicity, asthenic disorders, as well as grade ≥3 adverse events. Although the position of gefitinib with respect to other EGFR TKIs is not definitively established, current evidence indicates that gefitinib monotherapy is an effective and generally well-tolerated first- or subsequent-line treatment option for patients with NSCLC and activating EGFR mutations who have not received an EGFR TKI previously.
