Sedation using dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (DEX) was administered to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prior to local therapy. Case 1 was a 58-year-old man undergoing radiofrequency ablation in combination with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for HCC in S3. In accordance with the package insert, the initial loading dose was set at 6 μg/kg/hour. Although a favorable sedative effect was achieved, his blood pressure and pulse rate decreased. Case 2 was a 79-year-old woman undergoing percutaneous ethanol injection therapy for HCC in S6. Half the initial loading dose indicated in the package insert (3 μg/kg/hour) was administered, but the sedative effect was appreciable. No marked blood pressure or pulse rate decreases were observed. We believe that the use of DEX as a sedative agent in local therapy for HCC can be expected to increase. However, the optimal dose setting for DEX requires further examination.
