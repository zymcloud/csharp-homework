microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of their target genes in a sequence-specific manner. Emerging evidence demonstrates that miRNAs are critical regulators of lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein formation and secretion. Dysregulation of miRNAs disrupts gene regulatory network, leading to metabolic syndrome and its related diseases. In this review, we introduced epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of miRNAs expression. We emphasized on several representative miRNAs that are functionally involved into lipid metabolism, including miR-33/33(⁎), miR122, miR27a/b, miR378/378(⁎), miR-34a and miR-21. Understanding the function of miRNAs in lipid homeostasis may provide potential therapeutic strategies for fatty liver disease.
