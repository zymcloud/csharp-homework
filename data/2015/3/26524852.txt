Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are important human pathogens that cause chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Co-infection of HBV and HCV is not uncommon, particularly in countries where these two viruses are endemic. Therefore, the characteristics of HBV co-infection in HCV antibody (HCVAb) -positive Japanese patients found on the screening examination were analyzed.Patients and methods:Between January and December 2011, HCVAb status was evaluated as the screening examination in 12,582 patients in Gunma University Hospital, and it was positive in 402 patients (3.2%). In 331 HCVAb-positive/HBs antigen (HBsAg) -negative patients with available residual serum, HBs antibody (HBsAb) and HBc antibody (HBcAb) were examined. In addition, HCV-RNA was examined in 291 patients with available residual serum. HBV-DNA and HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg) were examined in 106 patients with available residual serum.Results:The HCVAb titer was distributed between 1 and 18 sample/cutoff index (S/CO). 275 patients (83.1%) had a high HCVAb titer (S/CO â‰¥10). HCV-RNA was positive in 230 (79.0%) patients, and it was more frequently detected in HCVAb high-titer patients (88%) than in low-titer patients (32%; p Conclusion:HBV reactivation should be noted in these HCVAb-positive/HBsAg-negative patients on the screening examination if these patients must receive chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, surveying of HBsAb in addition to HBcAb is also necessary.
