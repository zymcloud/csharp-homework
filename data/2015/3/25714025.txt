Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The inability of chemotherapeutic drugs to selectively target HCC tumor cells because of their predominant resistant phenotype to most conventional anticancer agents bestows a major obstacle for the clinical management of HCC. In this report, we have examined and demonstrated the remarkable heterogeneity of expression of survivin and its phosphorylated active form (p-survivin) in HCC patients' tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the expression of survivin and p-survivin in HCC cell lines was found to be associated with response to the small-molecule survivin suppressant YM155. Therefore, in the HCC cell lines that express elevated level of survivin and p-survivin, YM155 efficiently inhibited their proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis resulting in DNA damage through the dysregulation of cell-cycle checkpoint-related regulatory genes. Importantly, YM155 yielded significantly better therapeutic effect than sorafenib when tested in an orthotopic mouse model using patient-derived HCC xenografts with elevated survivin and p-survivin expression. Our results clearly demonstrated that the level of survivin and p-survivin expression could serve as molecular predictive biomarkers to select potential YM155-responsive patients, in a move towards delivering precision medicine for HCC patients.
