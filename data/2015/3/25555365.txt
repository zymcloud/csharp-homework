Accurate assessment of prognosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is key in optimizing management plans to fit individual patient needs. miRNAs are short noncoding single-stranded RNAs that control the expression of target genes and may act as cancer biomarkers. We analyzed the expression of miR-210 in 276 cases of primary ccRCC and compared its expression in 40 pairs of adjacent normal and cancerous tissues. We assessed its expression in primary and metastatic tumors, in the common RCC subtypes, and the benign oncocytoma. The results were validated with an independent data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas. miR-210 was significantly overexpressed in ccRCC compared with normal kidney. miR-210(+) patients had a statistically higher chance of disease recurrence [hazard ratio (HR), 1.82; P = 0.018] and shorter overall survival (HR, 2.46; P = 0.014). In multivariate analysis, miR-210 lost its statistically significant association with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival after adjusting for tumor size and tumor, node, metastasis stage. Papillary RCC showed comparable miR-210 overexpression, whereas decreased up-regulation was seen in chromophobe RCC and oncocytoma. A number of predicted targets that might be involved in carcinogenesis and aggressive tumor behavior were identified. miR-210 is a potential therapeutic target and independent marker of poor prognosis of ccRCC.
