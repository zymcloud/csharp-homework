Aim:To evaluate the characteristics of a 13762-MAT-B-III model in the rat liver and to assess the adequacy of the model for transarterial embolization (TAE) study.Materials and methods:One hundred thousand 13762-MAT-B-III rat breast cancer cells were inoculated into the livers of 11 Fisher 344 rats. Natural course via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up, histological characteristics and tumor response after TAE were evaluated.Results:The tumor induction rate of the 13762-MAT-B-III hepatoma model was 100%. Except for one tumor that started to regress after 14 days, the 13762-MAT-B-III hepatomas showed rapid growth, up to 13.1Â±1.4 mm, at 21 days. Peritoneal seeding was observed in all rats. TAE was conducted successfully in three rats on day 11. The TAE-treated hepatomas were significantly smaller on day 21 (p=0.040) and had a significantly greater apoptosis ratio (p=0.046).Conclusion:The 13762-MAT-B-III hepatoma model can be useful in many interventional oncology studies by providing consistent and rapidly growing tumors.
