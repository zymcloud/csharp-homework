Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), a hypoxia marker, correlates with tumor progression in a variety of human cancers. However, the role of CA-IX in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) remains largely unknown. We examined the expression of 277 unifocal, resectable, primary HCC tumors using immunohistochemistry. The CA-IX protein was expressed in 110 of the 227 (48.5%) HCC tumors. The expression of CA-IX correlated with younger age (P = 0.0446), female sex (P = 0.0049), high serum Î±-fetoprotein levels (P
