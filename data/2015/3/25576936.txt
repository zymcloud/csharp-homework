Metal complexes of the general formula [ML(H2O)Cl]nH2O; n=1 for M=Ni and Pt and n=2 for M=Pd, L=Schiff base (HL) derived from the condensation of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, were prepared. The synthesized ligand and its metal complexes were characterized on the basis of elemental analyses, spectral and magnetic studies as well as thermal analysis. The IR spectra revealed that the ligand is coordinated to the metal ions in bidentate manner via the N-atom of the azomethine group and the phenolic OH group. Square planar geometry was proposed for Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes and tetrahedral for Ni(II) complex. The ligand and its metal complexes were screened against the sensitive organisms Escherichia coli as Gram-negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus as Gram-positive bacteria, Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans as fungi. Moreover, the anticancer activity of the ligand and its metal complexes was evaluated in liver carcinoma (HEPG2) cell line. The results obtained indicated that the Schiff base ligand is more effective than its metal complexes towards the tested cell line. Ni(II), Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes as well as the free Schiff base ligand were tested for their antioxidant activities. The DNA-binding properties of the studied complexes have been investigated by electronic absorption and viscosity measurements.
