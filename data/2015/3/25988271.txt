Aim:To measure the diameter of the main tumor feeding artery (TFA) of a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodule at the entry site into the nodule.Methods:Fifty-seven HCC nodules in 43 patients were analyzed using a 3-D workstation and picture archiving system (PACS). TFA was defined as an artery connected to a HCC nodule on catheter-assisted multidetector computed tomography angiography (CAMDCTA). The entry site of the main TFA into the nodule was identified on CAMDCTA, and the corresponding portion was measured on digital angiography (DA) or digital subtracted angiography (DSA). The measuring scale of the PACS was calibrated using the platinum tip of microballoon catheters 0.68 mm in diameter. We investigated the relationship between diameters of the nodule and its main TFA.Results:The diameters of the nodule and its main TFA ranged 7-63 mm (20.3 ± 12.7) and 0.12-1.79 mm (0.41 ± 0.32), respectively. Simple regression analysis revealed a relationship between diameters of the nodule and its main TFA (P Conclusion:The diameter of main TFA was thicker in the larger nodule. The size of commercially available porous gelatin particles (1 or 2 mm in diameter) seems too large for embolization of most of HCC nodules.
