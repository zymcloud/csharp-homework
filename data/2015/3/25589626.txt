Purpose:This phase I study aimed to establish the biologic effects and MTD of the agonistic IgG1 chimeric anti-CD40 antibody ChiLob7/4 in patients (pts) with a range of CD40-expressing solid tumors and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, resistant to conventional therapy. Potential mechanisms of action for agonistic anti-CD40 include direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells and conditioning of antigen-presenting cells.Experimental design:ChiLob7/4 was given by IV infusion weekly for 4 doses at a range from 0.5 to 240 mg/dose. Validated ELISAs were used to quantify ChiLob7/4 in serum and test for anti-chimeric MAb (HACA) responses. Pharmacodynamic assessments included quantitation of T-cell, natural killer-cell, and B-cell numbers and activation in blood by flow cytometry and a panel of cytokines in plasma by Luminex technology. Planned dose escalation was in cohorts of 3 patients until MTD or biologic effect, defined as reduction of peripheral blood CD19(+) B cells to 10% or less of baseline.Results:Twenty-nine courses of treatment were given to 28 subjects. The MTD was 200 mg × 4, with dose-limiting toxicity of liver transaminase elevations at 240 mg. At 200 mg (range between 2.1 mg/kg and 3.3 mg/kg based on patient body weight), the trough level pretreatment was above 25 μg/mL. Grade 1-2 infusion reactions were seen above the dose of 16 mg, but could be prevented with single-dose corticosteroid premedication. HACA responses were seen after doses between 1.6 mg and 50 mg, but not above this. There were dose-dependent falls in blood B-cell numbers accompanied by reduced expression of CD21, and transient reductions in NK cell numbers with increased CD54 expression from 50 mg upward. MIP-1β and IL12 plasma concentrations rose after doses above 16 mg. Fifteen of 29 treatments were accompanied by disease stabilization for a median 6 months, the longest for 37 months.Conclusions:ChiLob7/4 can activate B and NK cells at doses that can be administered safely, and should be tested in combination with other antibodies and chemotherapy agents.
