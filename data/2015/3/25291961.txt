Background:Among various preoperative evaluations of liver function, accurate assessment of liver cirrhosis (LC) is especially important in patients undergoing surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:To explore the most significant laboratory parameter associated with LC in patients undergoing surgery for HCC.Methods:From among 588 HCC patients in our collected database who underwent liver surgery, 371 for whom sufficient laboratory data were evaluable, including direct serum fibrosis markers such as hyaluronic acid and type 3 procollagen peptide (P-3-P), were enrolled. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to define the ideal cutoff values of laboratory parameters, and the area under the ROC curve for LC was measured. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to clarify the laboratory parameter most significantly associated with LC.Results:Multivariate analysis of 13 laboratory parameters that had been selected by univariate analysis showed that the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (â‰¤ 0.8/>0.8) (odds ratio, 2.687; 95% confidence interval 1.215-5.940; P = 0.015) was associated with LC, along with the aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio, the indocyanine green retention ratio at 15 min (ICG R15), and the level of hyaluronic acid. Among these four parameters associated with LC, ROC curve analysis revealed that APRI (0.757) had the largest area under the ROC (aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase 0.505, ICG R15 0.714, and hyaluronic acid 0.743).Conclusions:APRI is closely associated with LC in patients undergoing surgery for HCC.
