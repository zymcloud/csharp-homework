Purpose:To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases.Methods:Forty-two patients with inoperable colorectal liver metastases not amenable to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were treated with SBRT for a total number of 52 lesions. All patients received a total dose of 75 Gy in 3 consecutive fractions. Mean size of the lesions was 3.5 cm (range 1.1-5.4). Toxicity was classified according to the Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0.Results:Median follow-up was 24 (range 4-47) months. The progression in field was observed in 5 lesions. Twenty-four months actuarial local control (LC) rate was 91 %. Median overall survival (OS) was 29.2 ± 3.7 months. Actuarial OS rate at 24 months was 65 %. Median progression-free survival was 12.0 ± 4.2 months; 24 months actuarial rate was 35 %. No patients experienced radiation-induced liver disease or grade ≥3 toxicity.Conclusions:SBRT represents a feasible alternative for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases not amenable to surgery or other ablative treatments in selected patients, showing optimal LC and promising survival rate.
