Background:There are no clear criteria established for treating a ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To elucidate the clinical features of affected patients, we examined prognosis and therapy choices.Materials/methods:We enrolled 67 patients treated for a ruptured HCC (HCV 44, HBV 5, HBV+HCV 1, alcohol 2, others 15; naïve HCC 34, recurrent 33) from 2000 to 2013, and investigated their clinical background and prognosis.Results:Median survival time (MST) for all cases was 4 months. For patients who survived for more than 1 year after rupture, the percentages of Child-Pugh C and positive for portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT)/extrahepatic metastasis were less than for those who died within 1 year. Child-Pugh classification (A:B:C=14:15:5 vs. 4:9:20, PConclusion:In patients with a ruptured HCC, especially those with a single tumor, and without decompensated liver cirrhosis and PVTT/extrahepatic metastasis, better prognosis can be expected with curative treatment. The present naïve group included more of such cases than the recurrent group, indicating the effectiveness of curative therapy.
