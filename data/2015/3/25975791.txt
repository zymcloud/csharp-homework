Objective:To investigate the value of quantitative iodine-based material decomposition images with gemstone spectral CT imaging in the follow-up of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoebolization (TACE).Methods:Consecutive 32 HCC patients with previous TACE treatment were included in this study. For the follow-up, arterial phase (AP) and venous phase (VP) dual-phase CT scans were performed with a single-source dual-energy CT scanner (Discovery CT 750HD, GE Healthcare). Iodine concentrations were derived from iodine-based material-decomposition images in the liver parenchyma, tumors and coagulation necrosis (CN) areas. The iodine concentration difference (ICD) between the arterial-phase (AP) and venal-phase (VP) were quantitatively evaluated in different tissues.The lesion-to-normal parenchyma iodine concentration ratio (LNR) was calculated. ROC analysis was performed for the qualitative evaluation, and the area under ROC (Az) was calculated to represent the diagnostic ability of ICD and LNR.Results:In all the 32 HCC patients, the region of interesting (ROI) for iodine concentrations included liver parenchyma (n=42), tumors (n=28) and coagulation necrosis (n=24). During the AP the iodine concentration of CNs (median value 0.088 µg/mm(3)) appeared significantly higher than that of the tumors (0.064 µg/mm(3), P=0.022) and liver parenchyma (0.048 µg/mm(3), P=0.005). But it showed no significant difference between liver parenchyma and tumors (P=0.454). During the VP the iodine concentration in hepatic parenchyma (median value 0.181 µg/mm(3)) was significantly higher than that in CNs (0.140 µg/mm(3), P=0.042). There was no significant difference between liver parenchyma and tumors, CNs and tumors (both P>0.05). The median value of ICD in CNs was 0.006 µg/mm(3), significantly lower than that of the HCC (0.201 µg/mm(3), PConclusion:Quantitative iodine-based material decomposition images with gemstone spectral CT imaging can improve the diagnostic efficacy of CT imaging for HCC patients after TACE treatment.
