Background/aim:Extracellular matrix (ECM) is of great significance for homeostasis in the liver. In fact, one of the stages leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes accumulation of excess ECM. Ras Suppressor-1 (RSU-1) is localized in the cell-ECM adhesions but its role in HCC is unexplored.Materials and methods:We investigated the expression and role of RSU-1 in two HCC cell lines that differ in aggressiveness; non-invasive Alexander cells and highly invasive HepG2 cells.Results:Our results showed that RSU-1 expression is elevated in HepG2 cells both at the mRNA and protein level, while its silencing leads to increased cell proliferation in both cell lines. Interestingly, RSU-1 depletion from highly invasive HepG2 cells reduces cell adhesion and invasion.Conclusion:This is the first study to provide in vitro evidence for the involvement of RSU-1 in HCC cell invasive behavior.
