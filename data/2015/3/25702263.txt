The resection of liver metastases from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has been discouraged because it is commonly thought that it does not improve survival. However, the role of potential prognostic factors is unclear, and universally accepted strategies have not been proposed. Between 2003 and 2014, 15 patients with isolated synchronous or metachronous metastases from pancreatic cancer underwent liver resection in our department. The role of potential prognostic factors was analyzed to predict survival. One right hepatectomy, 1 bisegmentectomy and 13 wedge resections were performed. Eleven patients underwent simultaneous pancreatic and liver resection for synchronous disease. The median overall survival (OS) was 9.1 months (95% CI 8.6-9.7). The only potential prognostic factor that significatively affected survival was the timing of metastases (metachronous vs. synchronous). Median OS in patients with metachronous disease was 11.4 months (95% CI 0-25.1) vs. 8.3 months (95% CI 6.9-9.7), p = 0.038. Surgery for liver metastases from pancreatic cancer is not suggested for most patients. If resection is considered, timing of metastatic disease could be a prognostic factor for survival after surgery.
