Polymeric micelles functionalized with folate conjugated bovine serum albumin (FA-BSA) and loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are investigated as a specific contrast agent for tumor targeting and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vitro and in vivo. The SPIONs-loaded polymeric micelles are produced by self-assembly of amphiphilic poly(HFMA-co-MOTAC)-g-PEGMA copolymers and oleic acid modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles and functionalized with FA-BSA by electrostatic interaction. The FA-BSA modified magnetic micelles have a hydrodynamic diameter of 196.1 nm, saturation magnetization of 5.5 emu/g, and transverse relaxivity of 167.0 mM(-1) S(-1). In vitro MR imaging, Prussian blue staining, and intracellular iron determination studies demonstrate that the folate-functionalized magnetic micelles have larger cellular uptake against the folate-receptor positive hepatoma cells Bel-7402 than the unmodified magnetic micelles. In vivo MR imaging conducted on nude mice bearing the Bel-7402 xenografts after bolus intravenous administration reveals excellent tumor targeting and MR imaging capabilities, especially at 24h post-injection. These findings suggest the potential of FA-BSA modified magnetic micelles as targeting MRI probe in tumor detection.
