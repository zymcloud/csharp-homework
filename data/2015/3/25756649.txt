Sauromatum giganteum (Engl.) Cusimano &amp; Hett Tuber are used in Chinese folklore medicine for treatment of neoplasms. However, the claim has not been scientifically validated. The aim of the study is to screen the antitumor bioactive fraction of Sauromatum giganteum (Engl.) Cusimano &amp; Hett Tuber and sensitive tumor cell lines using a cytotoxicity assay in vitro and tumor transplantation method in vivo, to support its use in folk medicine. The petroleum ether fraction, chloroform fraction, ethyl acetate fraction, n-butanol fraction and water fraction were successively extracted by turn by the maceration under reflux assay. Screening of antitumor bioactive fraction and sensitive cell lines were measured by MTT assay and the serum pharmacology method, and in vivo the antitumor activities of the active fraction was evaluated by using S180 or H22 tumor-bearing mice model and Kunming mice. The active constituents of ethyl acetate fraction of Sauromatum giganteum (Engl.) Cusimano &amp; Hett were characterized by UPLC-TOF-MS. Compared with control groups, mice serum containing ethyl acetate fraction had a inhibition effect on SMMC-7721 cell, SGC-7901 cell, MCF-7 cell, HeLa cell, A549 cell, HT-29, and MDA-MB-231, respectively, but mice serum containing other four fractions had no different with that of control group. The inhibition capabilities of mice serum containing ethyl acetate fraction on the seven cell lines in descending order is SGC-7901 > SMMC-7721 > MCF-7 > HT-29 > A549 > HeLa > MDA-MB-231. In vivo the inhibition rate of 106, 318, 954 mg/kgÂ·d ethyl acetate fraction dry extract to sarcoma S180 is 15.22%, 26.15% and 40.24%, respectively, and life prolonging rate to hepatoma H22 is 33.61%, 40.16% and 55.74%. A total of 14 compounds were identified in the ethyl acetate fraction of Sauromatum giganteum (Engl.) Cusimano &amp; Hett. The results of the experimental studies proved the antitumor activity of Sauromatum giganteum (Engl.) Cusimano &amp; Hett and supported the traditional use of this plant. These data indicate the potential for the use of ethyl acetate fraction of Sauromatum giganteum (Engl.) Cusimano &amp; Hett Tuber in tumor therapy, anti-tumor activity on cancer cell line in descending order is SGC-7901 > SMMC-7721 > MCF-7 > HT-29 > A549 > HeLa > MDA-MB-231.
