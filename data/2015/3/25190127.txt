Background:The C-reactive protein/albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio is associated with outcomes in septic patients. We investigated the prognostic value of the CRP/Alb ratio in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We retrospectively evaluated 186 newly diagnosed HCC patients and investigated the correlations among the pretreatment CRP/Alb ratio, clinicopathological parameters, and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the clinicopathological parameters associated with OS. Subsequently, we evaluated the prognostic value of the CRP/Alb ratio compared with other inflammation-based prognostic scores [Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), modified GPS (mGPS), and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR)] using the area under the curve (AUC).Results:The optimal cutoff level for the CRP/Alb ratio was 0.037. An elevated CRP/Alb ratio (â‰¥0.037) was associated with tumor progression and reduced liver functional reserve. In the multivariate analysis, the CRP/Alb ratio [hazard ratio (HR) 3.394; p Conclusion:The CRP/Alb ratio might be an independent prognostic marker in patients with HCC, and may have comparable prognostic ability to other established inflammation-based prognostic scores. The prognostic value of this novel inflammation-based prognostic score needs to be verified in patients with other types of cancer.
