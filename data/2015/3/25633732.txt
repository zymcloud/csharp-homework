Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often recurs after curative resection, and thus the optimal treatment strategy to treat recurrences remains uncertain. We analyzed the results of different options to treat recurrent HCC and emphasized the impact of pathologic patterns of the tumor at initial resection.Methods:Between 2000 and 2014, 293 patients underwent potentially curative hepatic resection for HCC. Among them, 150 experienced a recurrence and have been treated by repeat resection (RR), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), salvage liver transplantation (SLT), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), or conservative treatment, including systemic or targeted chemotherapy. Clinical outcomes were analyzed and compared between the treatment groups, focusing on clinical and pathologic characteristics of the tumor at initial resection.Results:After a median follow-up of 26 months, the overall survival (OS) at 1, 3, and 5 years after recurrence was 62%, 48%, and 40%, respectively. Survival rates were greater in patients treated by a curative approach (RR, RFA, SLT) than those treated by TACE, with 5-year OS of >70% and 37%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed satellitosis and microvascular invasion (MVI) at initial resection as negative prognostic factors of survival after recurrence (P Conclusion:Curative treatments of recurrent HCC improve patient survival. Satellitosis and MVI on the primary resected specimen may be used as selection criteria for the best treatment strategy for intrahepatic recurrences.
