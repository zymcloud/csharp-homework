Aim:The plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) are increased in cirrhotic patients. We aimed to investigate whether these cytokines correlate with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), the severity of liver cirrhosis and complications of cirrhosis.Methods:Sixty-three cirrhotic patients that underwent hemodynamic studies in Taipei Veterans General hospital were enrolled retrospectively. Plasma levels of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1Ra and endotoxin were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma obtained from 11 healthy subjects served as normal controls.Results:Plasma levels of IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1Ra were increased in cirrhotic patients compared with controls. IL-1Ra levels significantly correlated with plasma endotoxin levels, Child-Pugh scores, Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores and HVPG. On multivariate analysis, higher IL-1Ra levels (≥760 pg/mL) predicted the occurrence of portal hypertension-related complications and the development of bacterial infections independently of the MELD scores and portal pressure. Furthermore, higher IL-1Ra levels also predicted the survival in patients without hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:The plasma IL-1Ra level correlates with HVPG. Additionally, it may predict the occurrence of portal hypertension-related complications and bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients and the survival in patients without hepatocellular carcinoma.
