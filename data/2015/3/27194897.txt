Most patients with testicular seminoma have been treated with a curative intent for decades. Second cancers after radiotherapy for testicular seminoma before 1990 are a growing issue, and are related to previous generation of dose planning and delineating strategies. Among those cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma is an extremely rare occurrence, especially when affecting patients with healthy, noncirrhotic liver. Here, we describe such a case in a patient of our institution, and subsequently review the relevant literature and large epidemiologic studies. Understanding those late and serious toxicity features may help cancer care teams to screen and treat those patients appropriately.
