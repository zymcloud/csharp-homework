Background:Genomic instability is a common feature in hepatocellular carcinoma. Deregulation of replication licensing factors has been shown to trigger DNA damage response contributing to genomic instability. Overexpression of DNA replication licensing factors chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (CDT1) and minichromosome maintenance complex component 7 (MCM7) has been previously reported in several human cancers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression and prognostic significance of CDT1 and MCM7 in association with DNA damage response markers and p53 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Expression of CDT1, MCM7, p-H2A histone family member X (H2AX), phospho-ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/ataxia telangiectasia rad3-related (ATR) substrate, and p53 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from 111 patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate associations between the studied proteins, clinicopathological parameters, and patient survival.Results:CDT1 expression correlated with p-H2AX (p = 0.038), while MCM7 correlated with p-H2AX and phospho-ATM/ATR substrate (p Conclusions:Overexpression of CDT1 and MCM7 in hepatocellular carcinoma correlates with DNA damage response, and CDT1 overexpression is a significant prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.
