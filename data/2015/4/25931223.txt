As a functionally unique subset of T cells, regulatory T cells (Treg) suppress tumor immune responses effectively through a variety of mechanisms and play an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. There is growing evidence to suggest that Treg participates in the formation and development of hepatic tumor, especially the HCC. Elucidation of the mechanisms for involvement of Treg in HCC progression may provide new ideas for liver cancer therapy through a point of view regarding immunology.
