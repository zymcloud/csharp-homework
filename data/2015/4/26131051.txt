Objective:Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1) has been reported to be overexpressed in diverse human malignancies. However, the prognostic and clinicopathological value of MACC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the association between MACC1 expression and the outcomes of HCC.Methods:Relevant articles were searched in PubMed, Embase, Sciencedirect, CNKI, and Wanfang databases updated to October 2014. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed using STATA 10.0, and then the correlations of MACC1 expression with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and clinicopathological features were analyzed.Results:9 studies with a total of 1293 HCC patients were included in this meta-analysis. Our results showed that MACC1 over-expression was significantly associated with poor OS (HR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.47-3.59, univariate analysis; HR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.49-3.82, multivariate analysis), poor DFS (HR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.40-2.13, univariate analysis). Moreover, MACC1 over-expression was significantly associated with AFP level (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.68), tumor number (OR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.07-1.75), differentiation (OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.46-3.83), TNM stage (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 2.18-3.82), vascular invasion (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.43-2.50), capsule invasion (OR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.40-5.94), and metastasis (OR = 2.66, 95% CI 1.16-6.10).Conclusion:MACC1 over-expression indicated poor survival rate, high recurrence rate, and aggressive biological behaviors. MACC1 can serve as an indicator of prognosis and a potential novel target for treatment in HCC patients.
