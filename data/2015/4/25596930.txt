Background:There are very few studies on the incidence and risk factors of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the absence of advanced fibrosis. Our objective was to identify the clinical-pathological features of these patients.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 162 patients admitted to our hospital for HCV-related HCC between 2000 and 2010. Patients with hepatitis of other aetiologies, human immunodeficiency virus co-infection, or treated with interferon were excluded. We compared demographic, laboratory, clinical and outcome parameters of patients with and without advanced fibrosis.Results:137 patients had advanced fibrosis (85%). Median age was higher in the advanced fibrosis vs. the non-advanced fibrosis group (62 vs. 65 years, respectively; p = 0.025). Steatosis was significantly more frequent in patients with advanced fibrosis compared to those without advanced fibrosis (43% vs. 20%, respectively; p = 0.032). Independent predictors associated to the occurrence of HCC in patients without advanced fibrosis were hepatitis B core antigen (odds ratio: 3.86; p = 0.044) and duration of hepatitis C infection (odds ratio: 1.21; p = 0.003).Conclusions:Risk factors such as steatosis or diabetes were not frequent in patients without advanced fibrosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of occult hepatitis B and the duration of hepatitis infection in patients with HCC and chronic hepatitis C without advanced fibrosis.
