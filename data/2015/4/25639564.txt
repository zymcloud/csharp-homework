As life expectancy increases in persons with hemophilia (PWH), more age-related diseases such as cancer emerge among this patient group. The aim of this study was to investigate incidence and survival of cancers among PWH in Taiwan. We analyzed data of 1,054 PWH retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 1997 and 2010, by comparing variables to 10540 age- and gender-matched healthy individuals from the general population. There were 43 PWH and 178 individuals of general population with newly diagnosed cancer (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.74-3.35). The cumulative incidences of cancer in PWH and the general population were 4.7 and 1.9%, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the major type of cancer (17 cases) in PWH; cancer rate was still increased when HCC and HIV-related cancers were excluded (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.06-2.59). There was no significant difference observed in lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer occurrence. Compared to the general population, PWH were younger at the time of cancer diagnosis (45.1 vs. 57.2 years old, P value
