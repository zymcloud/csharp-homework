Background:Only limited data exist on the treatment and outcome of adrenal metastases that derive from different primary tumor entities. Due to the lack of evidence, it is difficult to determine the indication for surgical resection.Methods:We assessed the outcome of 45 patients (28 men, 17 women) with adrenal metastases who underwent surgery (1990-2014). The median age at the time of adrenal surgery was 62 years (range 44-77 years). We were able to evaluate follow-up data of 41 patients.Results:Primary tumor types were liver n = 12 (hepatocellular carcinoma n = 9, cholangiocellular carcinoma n = 2, sarcoma n = 1), upper GI tract n = 5 (esophagus n = 2, stomach n = 3), lung n = 9, kidney n = 6, neuroendocrine tumors n = 3, colon n = 2, ovarial n = 2, melanoma n = 2, others n = 4. The overall median survival time was 14 months (95 % CI 8.375-19.625). The survival rates at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years were 60, 31, 21, and 11 %, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in the survival time according to the resection status (R0 vs. R1/R2) (p Conclusions:Resection of adrenal metastases can improve the survival if patients are carefully selected, the tumor is completely resected, and the intervention is integrated into a multidisciplinary oncologic treatment strategy.
