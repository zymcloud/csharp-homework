Transitional liver cell tumor is an extremely rare entity and has a poor prognosis. It has similar histopathologic findings with hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Up to now, only 10 cases have been reported in the literature. We report on an 8-year-old boy with histologically proven transitional liver cell tumor and describe the pertinent radiological findings.
