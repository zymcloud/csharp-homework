Issues related to small-for-size grafts in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) are highly important. The neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been reported to be an inexpensive index of systemic inflammation for various diseases. We retrospectively evaluated the relationship between NLR and clinical course of 61 adult LDLT recipients in our institute until post-operative day 14. Patients were classified into two groups based on the graft volume divided by standard liver volume, as over 35% of graft volume divided by standard liver volume (GV/SLV) (Group L; n = 55) and under 35% of GV/SLV (Group S; n = 6). No differences were seen in background of the patients between the two groups. Also, absolute neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts in both the groups showed no significant differences. In contrast, the NLR between the groups differed significantly from post-operative day 3 to 10, being higher in the Group S. In addition, the incidence of prolonged hyperbilirubinemia and small for size graft syndrome differed significantly between the two groups. Therefore, the elevation of post-operative NLR in the smaller graft group reflect suggestive pathophysiology of endothelial injuries that related to small for size graft syndrome in LDLT.
