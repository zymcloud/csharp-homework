The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression levels and telomerase activity that mainly depends on telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and paracancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to detect the expression of PTEN and hTERT in 58 cases with HCC and the corresponding paracancerous tissues. The correlation between PTEN and hTERT was analyzed. The PTEN mRNA and protein expression was significantly lower in HCC, as compared with the paracancerous tissues (P
