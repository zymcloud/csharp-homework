Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a critical risk factor for the carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It promotes HCC development by inducing liver fibrogenesis, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and the expression of active viral-coded proteins. Effective antiviral treatments inhibit the replication of HBV, reduce serum viral load and accelerate hepatitis B e antigen serum conversion. Timely initiation of antiviral treatment is not only essential for preventing the incidence of HCC in chronic hepatitis B patients, but also important for reducing HBV reactivation, improving liver function, reducing or delaying HCC recurrence, and prolonging overall survival of HBV-related HCC patients after curative and palliative therapies. The selection of antiviral drugs, monitoring of indicators such as HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen, and timely rescue treatment when necessary, are essential in antiviral therapies for HBV-related HCC.
