Aim:The objectives of this study was to evaluate the utility of tumor markers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance based on the reliability of ultrasonography.Methods:We analyzed 313 patients with HCC detected through a surveillance program using ultrasonography combined with three tumor markers from February 2000 to December 2010. The patients were categorized into two groups based on the triggering event: the US group (n = 281) in which a tumor was first detected using ultrasonography and the TM group (n = 32) in which elevated tumor markers led to the diagnosis of a tumor that was undetected using ultrasonography. The reliability of ultrasonography was scored on a 4-point scale based on three items (coarseness of liver parenchyma, patient obesity and liver atrophy). Additionally, patient survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.Results:The median tumor size was 20 mm (interquartile range, 15-24). The reliability of ultrasonography was evaluated as good in 208 (66.5%), satisfactory in 80 (8.0%), poor in 21 (6.7%) and unsatisfactory in four (1.2%) patients. The proportion of patients in the TM group increased significantly according to the score, from 7.2% to 25.0% (P = 0.01). The survival rates of patients at 3 and 5 years were 83.7% and 57.2% in the US group, and 79.3% and 59.4% in the TM group, respectively (P = 0.98).Conclusion:Tumor markers may play a diagnostic role in patients with unreliable ultrasonography results. The survival of patients diagnosed by elevated tumor markers was not significantly different from those diagnosed by ultrasonography.
