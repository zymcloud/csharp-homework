Hemorrhagic metastatic brain tumors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rare and have been mostly presented as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). A 51-year-old male patient presented with sudden altered level of consciousness. He suffered from HCC since 2010 and transarterial chemoembolization was performed three times for HCC. The brain computed tomography (CT) scans revealed subdural hematoma (SDH) in the right fronto-temporal area and 6.0Ã—3.5 cm sized ICH in the right parieto-occipital lobe. Brain angiographic CT scans demonstrated that the hemorrhagic lesions did not include any enhancing lesions and vascular abnormalities. We undertook a decompressive craniectomy and evacuation of the acute SDH and ICH. During evacuation of ICH, the yellowish mass was observed in the cortical surface of the right occipital lobe. Pathological examination displayed the findings of metastatic brain tumor from HCC. Metastatic brain tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis as a cause of spontaneous SDH with ICH.
