The member 3a of Wingless-type MMTV integration site family (Wnt3a) as an oncogene is overexpressed in many kinds of tumors with a worse outcome. However, the mechanism and alteration of Wnt3a expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been clarified. In this study, the levels of Wnt3a expression were investigated in 80 HCC tissues or sera of 186 patients with chronic liver diseases. The incidence of hepatic Wnt3a expression in HCC tissues was 96.25 % and significantly higher (Ï‡ (2) = 48.818, P 800 ng/L) of circulating Wnt3a expression was found in 92.5 % HCC patients and significantly related (P
