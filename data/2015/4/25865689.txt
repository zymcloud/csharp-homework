Background:The current methods used for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unsatisfactory. Here, we assessed the serum levels of secreted frizzled related protein 4 (sFRP-4) for diagnosing HCC in patients infected with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:In 272 patients with CHB enrolled, 142 were patients with HCC. Thirty-three healthy subjects were recruited as healthy controls. The CHB patients were assigned to a test group or a validation group based on the time of enrollment. Human antibody arrays were used to screen 15 patients (8 CHB-related HCC patients, 7 CHB patients) for serum markers. Four markers and one candidate marker were assessed in the test group and validation group, respectively.Results:Human antibody assays indicated that the serum levels of sFRP-4 in HCC patients were significantly higher than those in CHB patients (PConclusion:sFRP-4 is a candidate serum marker for diagnosing HCC in CHB patients, and the combination of sFRP-4 with AFP may improve the diagnostic accuracy of HCC.
