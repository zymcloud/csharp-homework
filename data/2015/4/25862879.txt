Aim:Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a primary driving force for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis and over-expression of VEGF has been detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to clarify the usefulness of VEGF for monitoring the response to intra-arterial chemotherapy in patients with HCC.Patients and methods:Seventy-three patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and advanced HCC (aHCC) received hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC: leucovorin (LV) at 12 mg/h, cisplatin (CDDP) at 10 mg/h and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 250 mg/22 h) via the proper hepatic artery every 5 days for 4 weeks using a catheter connected to a subcutaneous drug delivery system.Results:i) Serum VEGF levels were higher in patients with progressive disease than those in patients with a partial response or stable disease. ii) VEGF levels were higher in patients with alcoholic LC than those in patients with hepatitis C-related or hepatitis B-related LC. iii) VEGF levels were higher in stage IVB patients than those in patients with stage III or IVA disease. iv) VEGF levels were significantly higher in patients with giant or confluent multinodular tumors than those in patients with multiple discrete nodules. v) Serum VEGF levels were higher in patients with vascular invasion than in patients without vascular invasion.Conclusion:Monitoring the serum VEGF level is useful for predicting the response of aHCC to HAIC, as well as for predicting metastasis, tumor type and vascular invasion.
