Introduction:Previous reports have indicated an association between blood transfusion and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy. However, clinicopathological biases were not adjusted in these studies. We aimed to clarify the effect of blood transfusions in patients with HCC and Child-Pugh class A after hepatectomy by using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis for selection bias control.Materials and methods:We enrolled 479 patients with primary HCC and Child-Pugh class A retrospectively (91 transfused and 388 nontransfused patients) who underwent curative hepatectomy. After adjusting for different covariate distributions for both groups by IPTW, we analyzed the prognostic outcomes.Results:In the unweighted analyses, overall survival (OS) rate of transfused patients was significantly lower than in nontransfused patients (P Conclusions:These results suggest that blood transfusion was associated with recurrence of HCC after hepatectomy in patients with HCC and Child-Pugh class A.
