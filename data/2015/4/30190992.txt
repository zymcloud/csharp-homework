The incidence and impact of hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) continues to increase worldwide. While radical therapies such as resection, radiofrequency ablation or transplantation are potentially curative for patients with early-stage HCC, the majority of patients in routine practice present with more advanced tumors, where treatment goals are palliation and extending survival. With multiple new and promising treatment options emerging for these patients, the challenge for the medical oncologist is how best to integrate these therapies into routine clinical practice. Here we review the most recent data on the efficacy and safety of yttrium-90 radioembolization in HCC, the considerations involved in patient selection, and the optimal assessment and management of patients receiving treatment. We also examine the potential impact of several ongoing clinical trials.
