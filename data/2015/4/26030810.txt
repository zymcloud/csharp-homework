Objectives:We present here the outcomes of our first 500 liver transplants and discuss the lessons learned during this time.Materials and methods:We retrospectively analyzed the first 500 consecutive transplants within the listing criteria of the United Network for Organ Sharing, with recipients and donors with minimum 1-year follow-up. Patient survival and donor complications were analyzed for 31 liver transplant recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma beyond the Milan criteria who had transplant performed during the same time.Results:Between August 2006 and March 2013, there were 519 liver transplants performed in 500 patients (365 adult, 135 pediatric). There were 394 living-donor and 125 deceased-donor liver transplants. In addition, 31 adult liver transplants were performed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan criteria (22 living-donor and 9 deceased-donor transplants). The main cause of chronic liver failure was biliary atresia in pediatric patients (30.4%) and chronic hepatitis B infection in adults (35.6%). The complication rate for primary nonfunction was 3.8%, overall biliary complications 24.0% (significantly higher after adult living-donor liver transplant, 30.3%), hepatic artery thrombosis 1.6%, portal vein thrombosis 3.0%, retransplant 3.8%, acute cellular rejection 29.6%, and bacterial infection 39.4%. Overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year patient survival rates in the first 500 consecutive transplants performed on recipients within United Network for Organ Sharing listing criteria were 87.8%, 85.0%, and 78.6%; for hepatocellular carcinoma patients beyond the Milan criteria, survival rates were 71.9%, 52.5%, and 38.2%.Conclusions:In regions without a sufficient number of deceased donors, living-donor liver transplant, with its associated problems, is the only alternative to deceased-donor liver transplant. Liver transplant requires teamwork, with all players working well together for a successful outcome. The important keys to success in liver transplant include decision-making, timing, surgical skills, experience, and close follow-up.
