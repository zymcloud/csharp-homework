Objective:To vexplore expression of HSP90, SIRT3 in liver cancer tissue and its effect on liver cancer cell invasion ability.Methods:Moderate expression of HSP90 in SMMC-7721, HepG2, LO2 and Hep-3B cell lines were screened, which was validated by RT-PCR. Over-expression of HSP90 cell line and lentivirus packaging HSP90-RNAi were established, which was validated by RT-PCR and western blot. The level of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related gene was detected by western blot. The percentage of cancer stem cells was assayed by flow cytometry.Results:RT-PCR demonstrated the highest expression of HSP90 mRNA in SMMC-7721 cells, the lowest expression of HSP90 mRNA in Hep3B and LO2 and the moderate expression of HSP90 mRNA in Hep-G2. Therefore, HepG2 was selected as a follow-up experiment cell lines. Compared with the blank control group, expression of HSP90 in HSP overexpression group was increased obviously, and expression of HSP90 in HSP90 shRNA group was significantly decreased, which indicated successful establishment of HSP overexpression and shRNA group. The apoptotic cell in hsp-siRNA group was higher than the blank control group, while the HSP overexpression group showed opposite results. Western blot results showed transfection HSP promoted cells EMT transformation, up-regulated the level of E-cadherin, and down-regulated the level of Vimentin; meanwhile, shRNA group showed opposite results.Conclusions:Carcinoma HepG2 cell transfected high expression of HSP can promote the transformation of EMT, improve the expression of Vimentin, reduce the expression of E-cadherin, and inhibit apoptosis of cancer stem cells, which improve the invasive ability of cancer of the liver cells. While hsp-siRNA group presents opposite results. In summary, the expression of HSP is closely related to the occurrence, development and invasion of cancer of the liver tissue.
