Objective:To investigate the correlation between polymorphisms in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB 1 and primary liver cancer (PLC) with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and to search for susceptibility and resistance genes related to PLC with HBV.Methods:One hundred and eighteen patients with HBV-related liver cancer were enrolled from the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University. Patients were stratified by family history of hepatitis B (39 with; 79 without) and HBV DNA positivity (60 positive, â‰¥1*10(3) IU/mL; 58 negative, Results:The allele frequencies of HLA-DQBl*0202 and HLA-DQBl*0301 were significantly higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than the control group (1 1.8% and 29.3% vs. 7.6% and 21.1%; U=2.43 and 3.09, PConclusions:The HLA-DQB 1 *0202 and HLA-DQB 1*0301 alleles may represent susceptibility for PLC with hepatitis B as well as for familial hepatitis B liver cancer. The HLA-DQB 1*0301 allele may support replication of HBV DNA, facilitating progression to liver cancer. The HLA-DQB1*0302 allele may inhibit replication of HBV DNA and reduce the incidence of liver cancer.
