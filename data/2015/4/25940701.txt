The cell fate determination factor Dachshund (DACH1) functions as a novel suppressor in the progression of various neoplasms. Previous study has suggested that hypermethylation of promoter region was responsible for the reduction of DACH1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and associated with the progression of HCC, but the clinical significance and the exact molecular mechanisms of DACH1 in the progression of HCC remain unclear. In this study, we employed public microarray data analysis and tissue microarrays (TMAs) technologies and showed that DACH1 expression was reduced in HCC even at early stage and associated with the tumor progression. Notably, Kaplan-Meier analysis further indicated DACH1 could be an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of HCC. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that overexpression of DACH1 inhibited the growth and migration of HCC cell line, which were dependent in part on the inactivation of Wnt pathway via phosphorylation of GSK3β to suppress β-catenin. In agreement, the abundance of DACH1 was inversely correlated with several Wnt target genes. Collectively, our study indicated β-catenin is a novel target of DACH1 in HCC.
