Background:Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is generally based on genetic testing performed in primary tumor biopsies, but whether the genomic status of primary tumors is identical to that of metastases is not well known. We compared the gene expression profiles of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies of colorectal primary tumors and matched liver metastases.Patients and methods:We compared the expression of 18 genes in FFPE CRC tumors and their matched liver metastases from 32 patients. The expression of each gene in CRC primary tumors and their matched liver metastases was tested using Student's t test for paired samples. Pairwise correlations of each gene in the primary tumors and matched liver metastases were evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient.Results:The expression of six genes was significantly different in primary tumors compared with their matched liver metastases [CXCR4 (p < 0.001), THBS1 (p = 0.007), MMP 9 (p = 0.048), GST Pi (p = 0.050), TYMP (p = 0.042) and DPYD (p < 0.001)]. For the remaining genes, where no significant differences were observed, only SMAD4 (r s = 0.447, p = 0.010), ERCC1 (r s = 0.423, p = 0.016) and VEGF A (r s = 0.453, p = 0.009) showed significant correlation in expression between the two tissues. Therefore, we only detected similar gene expression levels between the tumor and the metastases in these three markers.Conclusions:We only found similar gene expression levels between the tumor and the metastases in three genes (SMAD4, ERCC1, and VEGF A). However, our study could not assess whether the differences in gene expression were secondary to tumoral heterogeneity or to molecular changes induced by previous chemotherapy.
