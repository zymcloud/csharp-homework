This study aims to investigate the safety of inferior right hepatic vein (IRHV)-conserving surgery by comparing the surgical data and postoperative complications between IRHV-conserving segments 7 to 8 (S7 to S8) resection and conventional right hemihepatectomy (RH). Five patients who underwent IRHV-conserving S7 to S8 segmentectomy between 2007 and 2011 (IRHV group) and 25 liver cancer patients who underwent RH without biliary tract reconstruction during the same period (RH group) were investigated. The surgical data, postoperative complications, and duration of hospital stay were compared. The IRHV and RH groups included 2 (40%) and 13 (52%) hepatocellular carcinoma patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in liver function before surgery between the groups. The presence of the IRHV did not adversely affect the processing of the short hepatic vein or frontal dissection of the inferior vena cava. The operative time was shorter (median, 366 minutes versus 501 minutes; P = 0.0001), the postoperative bilirubin level was lower (12 mg/dL versus 1.8 mg/dL; P = 0.037), and the duration of hospital stay was shorter (10 days versus 14 days; P = 0.002) in the IRHV group. No significant differences were noted in the intraoperative blood loss, postoperative transaminase levels, or the incidence of severe complications (Clavien grade IIIb or higher) between the groups. IRHV-conserving resection of the liver is a safe surgical procedure that is useful in preventing postoperative elevation of bilirubin level and in shortening the duration of hospital stay.
