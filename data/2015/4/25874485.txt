Charged multivesicular body protein 4B (CHMP4B), a subunit of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III complex, plays an important part in cytokinetic membrane abscission and the late stage of mitotic cell division. In this study, we explored the prognostic significance of CHMP4B in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its impact on the physiology of HCC cells. Western blot and immunohistochemistrical analyses showed that CHMP4B was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Meanwhile, clinicopathological analysis revealed that high CHMP4B expression was correlated with multiple clinicopathological variables, including AFP, cirrhosis, AJCC stage, Ki-67 expression, and poor prognosis. More importantly, univariate and multivariate survival analyses demonstrated that CHMP4B served as an independent prognostic factor for survival of HCC patients. Using HCC cell cultures, we found that the expression of CHMP4B was progressively upregulated after the release from serum starvation. To verify whether CHMP4B could regulate the proliferation of HCC cells, CHMP4B was knocked down through the transfection of CHMP4B-siRNA oligos. Flow cytometry and CCK-8 assays indicated that interference of CHMP4B led to cell cycle arrest and proliferative impairment of HCC cells. Additionally, depletion of CHMP4B expression could increase the sensitivity to doxorubicin in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Taken together, our results implied that CHMP4B could be a promising prognostic biomarker as well as a potential therapeutic target of HCC.
