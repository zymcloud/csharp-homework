Objective:To determine the prognostic impact of tumor location in gallbladder cancer.Background:Depth of tumor is a strong predictor of survival after curative resection of gallbladder cancer. However, the gallbladder has a unique anatomical relationship with the liver, and the clinical significance of tumor location remains unclear.Methods:For 437 patients with gallbladder cancer who underwent resection at 4 international institutions, clinicopathologic characteristics and their association with survival were analyzed. Tumor location was defined as "hepatic side" or "peritoneal side," and the prognostic significance of tumor location was evaluated.Results:Among the 252 patients with T2 disease, patients with tumors on the hepatic side (T2h, n = 99) had higher rates of vascular invasion, neural invasion, and nodal metastasis than patients with tumors on the peritoneal side (T2p, n = 153) (51% vs 19%, 33% vs 8%, and 40% vs 17%, respectively; P < 0.01 for all). After a median follow-up of 58.9 months, 3-year and 5-year survival rates were 52.1% and 42.6%, respectively, for T2h tumors and 73.7% and 64.7%, respectively, for T2p tumors (P = 0.0006). No such differences were observed in T1 or T3 tumors. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent association of hepatic-side location with survival in T2 tumors (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-4.2; P < 0.001). This subclassification of T2 tumors predicted recurrence in the liver (23% vs 3%; P = 0.003) and distant lymph nodes (16% vs 3%; P = 0.019) even after radical resection.Conclusions:After curative resection of T2 gallbladder cancer, tumor location predicts the pattern of recurrence and survival.
