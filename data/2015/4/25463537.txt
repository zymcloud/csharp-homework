Background & aims:gp96, or grp94, is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized heat shock protein 90 paralog that acts as a protein chaperone and plays an important role for example in ER homeostasis, ER stress, Wnt and integrin signaling, and calcium homeostasis, which are vital processes in oncogenesis. However, the cancer-intrinsic function of gp96 remains controversial.Methods:We studied the roles of gp96 in liver biology in mice via an Albumin promoter-driven Cre recombinase-mediated disruption of gp96 gene, hsp90b1. The impact of gp96 status on hepatic carcinogenesis in response to diethyl-nitrosoamine (DENA) was probed. The roles of gp96 on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) were also examined pharmacologically with a targeted gp96 inhibitor.Results:We demonstrated that gp96 maintains liver development and hepatocyte function in vivo, and its loss genetically promotes adaptive accumulation of long chain ceramides, accompanied by steatotic regeneration of residual gp96+ hepatocytes. The need for compensatory expansion of gp96+ cells in the gp96- background predisposes mice to develop carcinogen-induced hepatic hyperplasia and cancer from gp96+ but not gp96- hepatocytes. We also found that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of gp96 in human HCCs perturbed multiple growth signals, and attenuated proliferation and expansion.Conclusions:gp96 is a pro-oncogenic chaperone and an attractive therapeutic target for HCC.
