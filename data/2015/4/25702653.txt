Amphicrine carcinoma is a peculiar tumor in which the cells have both exocrine and neuroendocrine differentiation, with mucus and neuroendocrine granules within the cytoplasm. In the 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive tract, they have been included in the intermediate-grade malignant category of mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANECs). These tumors are extremely rare in the gastrointestinal tract. Four cases have been reported in the stomach, three in the pancreas, and one in the liver. To the best of our knowledge, this report describes the first case of amphicrine carcinoma in the ampullary region.
