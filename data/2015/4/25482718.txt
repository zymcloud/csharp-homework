Liver fibrosis may lead to portal hypertension, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma, and predominantly results from the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells. OSU‑03012, a non‑cyclooxygenase‑inhibiting celecoxib derivative, has been previously demonstrated to promote apoptosis in certain cell types, however, its function in hepatic fibrosis remains unclear. In the current study, the inhibitory effect of OSU‑03012 on the proliferation of the LX2 human hepatic stellate cell line was evaluated by cell counting kit‑8 assay. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed in order to examine the expression of α‑smooth muscle actin and type I collagen, which are representative of LX2 cell activation. The senescence of LX2 cells was measured by senescence‑associated β‑galactosidase staining, and the cell cycle and apoptosis levels were assessed by flow cytometry. The impact of senescence‑associated signaling on protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis. OSU‑03012 was observed to inhibit cell proliferation and prevent the secretion of profibrotic factors in LX2 cells in a dose‑dependent manner. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that OSU‑03012 inhibited the proliferation and activation of LX2 via the induction of cell senescence at the G1 phase, rather than via cell apoptosis. The induction of senescence may be via the upregulation of p16, p21 and p27. In conclusion, the current study provided insight into the pharmacological mechanisms of OSU‑03012 in preventing the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells through cell senescence. The current study supports the theory that OSU‑03012 is a novel agent for potential use against liver fibrosis.
