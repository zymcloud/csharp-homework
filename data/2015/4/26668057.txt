Background:For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) improved the diagnosis, migrated Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, and changed therapeutic decision in retrospective analysis.Aim:This prospective study was to evaluate the clinical impact of EOB-MRI on HCC management.Methods:From September 2012 to February 2014, consecutive patients with suspicion of HCC in BCLC early stage by multidetector computed tomography or dynamic MRI with non-specific gadolinium, well liver function reserve, and admitted for resection evaluation were enrolled prospectively. Additional EOB-MRI was performed. The HCC diagnosis, BCLC staging, and treatment decision were obtained in a liver cancer conference. EOB-MRI impact on HCC management was analyzed.Results:One hundred and three patients including 68 with typical and 35 with atypical HCC nodules in dynamic imaging studies were enrolled. EOB-MRI characterized 3 (4.4 %) benign and 33 (94.3 %) HCC for patients with typical and atypical HCC nodules, respectively. For 90 HCC patients, additional EOB-MRI changed BCLC stage in 25 (27.8 %) and treatment decision in 17 (18.9 %) patients. There were 66 patients with 78 resected nodules including 65 HCCs, 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 9 benign nodules. Dynamic study and EOB-MRI detected and characterized 69 and 77 nodules, respectively. The sensitivity and accuracy in HCC diagnosis were 98.5 and 85.7 % for EOB-MRI, which were better than those of dynamic study (p Conclusions:Additional EOB-MRI improved HCC diagnosis in sensitivity, accuracy but not specificity. It changed BCLC staging and treatment decision in 27.8 and 18.9 % of early-stage HCC patients.
