A 73-year-old woman (height : 155 cm, weight : 55 kg) was scheduled to undergo a laparotomic hepatectomy and radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma. Her medical history did not include any relevant conditions such as cardiovascular or neurological disorders. A thoracic epidural catheter was introduced at T8-9 before the induction of anesthesia with intravenous propofol. General anesthesia was maintained with the inhalation of oxygen, air, and desflurane, and the continuous infusion of remifentanil. Several intraoperative episodes of mild hypotension occurred, each of which was successfully treated with intravenous ephedrine, but otherwise her anesthetic course was uneventful, and she recovered from the anesthesia smoothly. Her postoperative pain was well controlled with continuous epidural infusion of levobupivacaine and fentanyl, and she could walk by herself on postoperative day (POD) 1. However, she suffered weakness in her lower extremities on POD2 and subsequently fell into complete paraplegia with sensory loss below the T4 level on POD3. A magnetic resonance imaging scan taken on POD4 showed an idiopathic spinal cord infarction (SCI) involving levels T1 through T4, although no epidural abnormalities, e.g., hematomas, were detected. Immediate treatment with methylprednisolone, ozagrel, and edaravone failed to resolve her symptoms. We suggest that it is of great importance to consider SCI as a differential diagnosis as soon as possible in cases of unanticipated postoperative paraplegia.
