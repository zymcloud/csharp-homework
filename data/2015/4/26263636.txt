Factors of the inborn immunity in patients, suffering hepatocellular carcinoma of large size, were studied. Preoperatively the raising of metabolic activity of neutrophils in spontaneous NST-test, the neutrophils reserve reduction in NST-test, weak activation of the neutrophils absorption function in a phagocytosis reaction were noted. On the 7-8th postoperative day a reduction of quantity of formazan--positive neutrophils in spontaneous NST--test, raising of reserve of the neutrophils metabolic activity, comparing with initial values, were observed.
