Since its introduction as an alternative intestinal lengthening technique, serial transverse enteroplasty has been increasingly used as the surgical treatment of choice for children with refractory short bowel syndrome, but there have been few reports about the adult patients. This report describes the case of a 71-year-old man with a short bowel after distal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction for gastric cancer, followed by extensive intestinal resection. The serial transverse enteroplasty operation was performed and lengthened the small intestine from 49 to 67 cm. The patient tolerated the procedure well and weaned off total parenteral nutrition. Liver function also improved. This case shows that the serial transverse enteroplasty procedure increases intestinal length. This procedure should be considered a surgical option for adult patients with extreme short bowel syndrome.
