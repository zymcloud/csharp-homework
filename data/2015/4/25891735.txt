A 57-year-old man with a history of hepatitis B virus infection was referred to our hospital for living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Five years earlier, right lobectomy had been performed for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumor thrombus in segments 5 and 6 in the liver. Two years later, transarterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation were performed for recurrent HCC. Two years after those local therapies, another recurrent HCC was treated with transhepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin and conventional radiation therapy (RT) with 60 Gy in 20 fractions, because the tumor was contiguous to the trunk of the portal vein. After the completion of RT, symptoms due to liver failure and severe infection caused by multiple liver abscesses developed despite the administration of antibiotics and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage. Therefore, LDLT was performed with the use of a right lobe graft donated by his wife. Vascular anastomosis was successfully performed with the use of normal procedures. The patient recovered uneventfully, and has since been doing well for 34 months, with no evidence of vascular complications. However, the degree of injury to the anastomotic vessels caused by definitive RT before LDLT remains unclear, whereas the safety and efficacy of some forms of RT as a bridge to deceased-donor LT have been reported. Salvage LDLT is effective for patients with liver failure after multidisciplinary treatment including radiation, while carefully taking radiation-induced vessel injury as a potential late complication into consideration, especially in LDLT cases.
