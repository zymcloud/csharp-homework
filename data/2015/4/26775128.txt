Backgrounds:The effect of metformin on survival in patients with pancreatic cancer is controversial.Aims:To investigate the beneficial effect of metformin in pancreatic cancer patients.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed patients with pancreatic cancer and pre-existing diabetes mellitus type 2 who were treated at Severance Hospital (Seoul, South Korea) between May 2005 and December 2013.Results:Among 237 enrolled patients, 117 patients (49.4%) were exposed to metformin. The median overall survival was 13.7 months for the metformin group versus 8.9 months for the non-metformin group (P=0.001) In univariate analysis, metformin exposure, low serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels (<1000 U/mL), small tumor size (â‰¤20 mm), no tail involvement, good performance status (ECOG 0 vs. 1 or 2), and resectable cancer stage were associated with favorable survival outcomes (all P<0.05). In multivariate analysis, in addition to low serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels (<1000 U/mL) and resectable cancer stage, metformin exposure was significantly associated with longer survival with a hazard ratio of 0.61 (P=0.001). Additionally, the cumulative duration of metformin use was significantly correlated with a favorable survival outcome.Conclusion:Our findings supported that metformin exposure was associated with survival benefits in patients with pancreatic cancer and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially among those with an advanced cancer stage.
