Background:Platelet count is known to be an indirect indicator of portal hypertension but is not a part of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score or the Child-Pugh score for risk stratification in hepatobiliary surgery.Methods:Data from 2097 hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were evaluated from 2005-2012 using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Patient demographics, morbidity, and mortality were evaluated.Results:Median age and body mass index were 64 y and 26.5 kg/m(2), respectively. Majority of the patients had American Society of Anesthesiologists â‰¥3 (78.1%) and median MELD score was 7. On multivariate analysis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count Conclusions:Thrombocytopenia, which is an indirect indicator for portal hypertension, is significantly associated with adverse outcomes after hepatectomy, independent of the MELD score. Platelet count should be integrated into the selection criteria for hepatic resections for HCC.
