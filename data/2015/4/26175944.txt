Diabetes associated metabolic syndrome has been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cirrhosis, in fact, was not always a prerequisite of HCC development and this might particularly apply to the metabolic abnormality associated HCC. This study was to investigate diabetes associated HCC and the potential role of FGF21 during carcinogenetic transformation of HCC. Dimethylnitrosamine (DEN) was used to induce HCC in the diabetic OVE26 mice. Pronounced damage characterized by steatohepatitis was found in the liver of diabetic mice. Steatohepatitis accompanied by constant cell proliferation and tumor cell growth were also found in the hepatic tissues of diabetic OVE26 mice when DEN being administrated. FGF21 protein level increased in liver tissues at an early stage along with steatohepatitis in diabetic OVE26 mice, but decreased in liver tissues later when HCC was developed. In addition, decreased FGF21 protein level was associated with cancerous hyper-proliferation and aberrant p53 and TGF-Î²/Smad signaling during HCC development. Loss of FGF21 may play an important role in HCC carcinogenetic transformation during metabolic liver injury in diabetic animals. The present finding calls attention to the need to control metabolic disorders associated with diabetes and may further develop a protective strategy against HCC.
