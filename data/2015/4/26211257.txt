Due to the good tumor-targeting and excellent biocompatibility, the drug-loading nanoparticles (NPs) has been widely applied in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, after the NPs are recognized and internalized by cancer cells, the effects of NPs on cell migration behavior were unclear. In the present study, the self-assembly techniques (SAMs) was used to modify gold (Au) nanoparticles (Au NPs) with different chemical functional groups (CH3, OH, COOH and NH2) as model NPs. The dispersion of these groups in solution and the distribution in cells were studied by transmission electron microscope (TEM), respectively, and the proliferation was examined by MTT assay in vitro. The wound-healing and the Transwell assay were used to examine the effect of internalized Au-NPs on HepG2 cells migration. The results showed that different Au-NPs mainly distributed at the edge of the vesicle membrane and the gap between cells. The Au-NPs resulted in decreased cell viability in a concentration-depended manner. In addition, the results of wound-healing and Transwells assay indicated that the internalization of the NH2-NPs and OH-NPs would inhibit cell migration compared with those in the control group.
