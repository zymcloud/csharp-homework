Background:Phase 3 clinical studies have shown that long-term treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) can suppress hepatitis B viral load and promote significant fibrosis regression and cirrhosis reversal in a majority of treated chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. This retrospective analysis investigated the impact of baseline cirrhosis status on virologic, serologic, and histologic outcomes in patients treated with TDF.Methods:Patients enrolled in studies GS-US-174-0102 and GS-US-174-0103 who had baseline liver biopsy-diagnosed cirrhosis and entered the open-label phase of the studies were included in the virologic and serologic analyses. Patients (both HBeAg positive and negative) with paired liver biopsies at baseline and 5 years (N = 348) were included in a histologic analysis.Results:After 5 years on study, comparing patients with and without baseline cirrhosis, respectively: 99.2 and 98.0% achieved virologic response (hepatitis B viral load Conclusions:This represents the largest analyses to date of CHB patients with sequential liver biopsies demonstrating that treatment with TDF for up to 5 years is associated with favorable virologic, serologic, and histologic outcomes, regardless of baseline cirrhosis status. Notably, histologic improvement was observed in the majority of cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients.
