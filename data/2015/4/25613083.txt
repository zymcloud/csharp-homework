Purpose:Few treatment options are available for patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on preclinical and early clinical efficacy signals and lack of overlapping toxicity, we undertook this multicenter phase II trial to estimate efficacy and safety of everolimus and pasireotide in advanced HCC.Methods:Patients with advanced HCC not amenable to locoregional therapy and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis received everolimus 7.5 mg PO daily and pasireotide LAR 60 mg IM every 28 days. The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP), with 26 events needed to evaluate if everolimus + pasireotide improved TTP from 2.8 to 4.4 months, with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05. Secondary endpoints included response as measured by RECIST modified for HCC, treatment-emergent adverse events, and overall survival.Results:After 24 patients were enrolled, results of a randomized trial showing no benefit of everolimus in HCC were released prompting an unplanned interim analysis that found the conditional probability of rejecting the null hypothesis based on events in those patients was 0.08. Therefore accrual was halted. Patients had a median age of 59 years, 21 (88%) had BCLC stage C cancer, and 11 (46%) metastatic disease. Median TTP was 3.5 months (95% CI 2-5.8) and median survival 6.7 months (95% CI 6-infinity). Best response was stable disease in ten patients. Grade 3 hyperglycemia occurred in 6 (25%). There were no grade 4 treatment-emergent events.Conclusion:Despite promising early efficacy signals, we found no benefit for the combination of everolimus and pasireotide in HCC.
