Objectives:To examine the feasibility of three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) image fusion in facilitating assessment of the ablative margin (AM) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This study involved 75 patients with solitary HCC who underwent RFA. The AM was evaluated using 3D-CT image fusion. All cases were categorized into two groups based on the extent of the AM: in Group A, sufficient AM was obtained, which was greater than or equal to 5 mm; in Group B, the lesion was also ablated successfully, but a 5 mm AM was not obtained.Results:3D-CT Image Fusion was performed on 36 and 39 patients in Group A and Group B, respectively. The 1, 3, 5 year RFS was 87.6%, 63.2%, 50.6% for Group A, and 77.2%, 51.5%, 35.6% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.042); the corresponding OS was 94.3%, 73.8%, 64.6%, and 86.2%, 60.5%, 47.6%, respectively (P = 0.046). Multivariate analysis showed that the AM (P = 0.048, HR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.01-4.60) and Pre-NLR were independent prognostic factors for PFS.Conclusions:3D-CT image fusion is a feasible and useful method to evaluate the AM after RFA of HCC.
