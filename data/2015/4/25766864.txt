Objective:Comparing prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in community-practice metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients receiving second-line everolimus with those previously reported in clinical trials.Research design and methods:Two separate chart sets (2009 - 2012) were used to develop and validate a prognostic model for patients initiating second-line everolimus after first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).Main outcome measures:Prognostic factors for OS have been identified and validated in separate samples.Results:One-year OS probabilities in the study (n = 220) and validation (n = 97) samples were 68 and 67%; median OS was 19 and 23 months - higher than the 1-year OS of 60% and median OS of 14.8 months of RECORD-1. Karnofsky performance score < 80%, duration of mRCC < 1 year, progression on first-line TKI, liver metastasis and clear cell histology were significant prognostic factors for shorter survival. One-year OS estimates were 84% for validation sample patients with 0 - 2 risk factors, 63% for 3 risk factors and 22% for 4 - 5 risk factors (log-rank p < 0.001).Conclusion:Real-world prognostic factors for OS following second-line everolimus for mRCC were largely consistent with those previously identified in trial data; however, OS was longer in the practice setting than in clinical trials and was not associated with type of first-line TKI.
