Aim:To synthesize 24-h soluble gelatin sponge particles (SGSP) of 200-500 and 500-1000 µm, and to investigate their ischemic potency following hepatic artery embolization (HAE).Methods:Low-endotoxin gelatin was freeze-dried and heated at 110, 115, 118, 120, 122 and 125°C to form cross-linked gelatin sponge. We prepared 200-500- and 500-1000-µm SGSP by pulverizing and sieving the gelatin sponge. The dissolution times in saline were measured. Eight healthy pigs underwent HAE of the right and left hepatic arteries with either 200-500- or 500-1000-µm SGSP (n = 4/group).Results:The particles prepared at 110-122°C were soluble whereas particles prepared at 125°C or more were insoluble. The mean dissolution time of the particles increased with increasing temperature. In each pig, sequential arteriography confirmed that recanalization was complete 24 h after embolization. Pathological tests 48 h after HAE revealed coagulation necrosis but least damage to the biliary tract. The liver necrosis rate (mean ± standard deviation) was significantly greater in the 200-500-µm group than in the 500-1000-µm group (9.89 ± 4.04% vs 4.44 ± 0.67%, respectively; P = 0.0027). A significantly greater proportion of arteries with a diameter of 100-200 µm had residual SGSP in the 200-500-µm group than in the 500-1000-µm group (P Conclusion:HAE with 200-500-µm SGSP had greater effects on promoting liver necrosis without biliary damage than did HAE with 500-1000-µm SGSP.
