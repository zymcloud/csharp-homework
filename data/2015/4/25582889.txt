Aim:To evaluate the usefulness of fusion imaging with real-time ultrasonography (US) and three-dimensional (3D) US for the guidance of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) 2-5 cm in diameter.Materials and methods:This study was conducted as a retrospective cohort study. It was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was waived. During percutaneous RFA of HCCs, targeting was performed under conventional fusion imaging guidance, whereas monitoring and controlling were conducted under fusion with 3D US guidance. Technical success, technique effectiveness, incidence of major complications, and local tumour progression rate were evaluated. According to tumour size (small: Results:There were 29 small-sized HCCs (2.5 ± 0.3 cm) and 17 medium-sized HCCs (3.4 ± 0.5 cm). All RFA procedures were performed in a single RFA session. Both the technical success and technique effectiveness rates were 100%. One patient with medium-sized HCC developed a hepatic abscess (n = 1) as a major complication. The local tumour progression rate was 8.7% (4/46) with a mean follow-up period of 18.2 months. The roundness indexes of the ablation zone were not significantly different between small- and medium-sized HCCs, and the local tumour progression rates were also not significantly different between the two groups [3.4% (1/29) versus 17.6% (3/17); p = 0.135].Conclusion:Image fusion with real-time US and 3D US is useful for the guidance of percutaneous RFA for HCCs 2-5 cm in diameter.
