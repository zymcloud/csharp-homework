For two decades, hepatitis B vaccine has been integrated into national routine childhood vaccination programs in almost all countries. The prevalence of HBsAg has decreased in children worldwide. However, there are children who miss the benefit of hepatitis B vaccine in some regions and countries. Long-term follow-up studies have revealed the clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in children. A small percentage of chronically infected children develop liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, it is controversial who should be treated and when antiviral treatment should be initiated in children. Compared with adult studies, the data are insufficient to evaluate the pathogenesis of hepatitis B infection and the efficacy of antiviral treatment in childhood. New antiviral drugs have been approved for children and adults. Also, oral antiviral drugs are administered to pregnant women to reduce the hepatitis B virus mother-to-child transmission rate.
