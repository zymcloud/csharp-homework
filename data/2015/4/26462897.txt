Objective:To compare the effectiveness of percutaneous microwave ablation ( MWA) versus hepatectomy for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:From August 2002 to March 2012, one hundred and twenty-two patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (diameters 1 to 7 cm, 2 to 4 lesions) were treated by either complete MWA or radical hepatectomy, and their clinical data were collected and analyzed.The patients were divided into MWA group (n = 50) and resection group (n = 72), and the resection group was matched by MWA group based on clinical parameters. The survival and complications in the two groups were compared.Results:The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 100.0%, 73.0% and 62.0%, respectively, in the MWA group, and 80.0%, 56.0%, and 41.0%, respectively, in the resection group (P Conclusion:Compared with hepatectomy, percutaneous microwave ablation is a minimally invasive and reproducible procedure, and can improve the survival in patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma.
