Background:In patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), extended liver resections (ELRs) increase the rate of resectability. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the morbidity and oncologic outcomes of ELR compared with other liver resections (LR) for ICC.Methods:All LR for ICC that were performed in our center between January 1997 and September 2013 and conducted with curative intent were included in this retrospective analysis. ELRs were defined by resections of ≥5 liver segments. The factors that influenced the occurrence of major complications (Clavien ≥ 3) and overall survival (OS) were tested with univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:One hundred seven patients (82 men and 25 women) were resected, and 27 (25.3%) underwent ELRs. Compared with the LRs, the ELRs were performed in larger tumors (P = .003) and were significantly associated with more complex surgeries such as vascular (P < .001) or biliary reconstructions (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that ELR was an independent risk factor for major complications (odds ratio [OR], 6.2; 95% CI, 2.11-19.62; P < .001). Compared with the other LRs, ELRs had no effects on OS or disease-free survival (P = .881 and P = .228, respectively). Perioperative blood transfusion (Hazard ratio (HR), 2.51; 95% CI, 1.49-4.23; P < .001), the presence of >1 nodule (HR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.67-5.97; P < .001), and age ≥65 years (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.03-2.86; P = .036) were independent prognostic factors for OS.Conclusion:This study suggests that ELRs performed for large ICCs do not affect negatively oncologic outcomes, despite the increased risk of major complications.
