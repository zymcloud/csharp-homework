Background:Based on pre-clinical and clinical activity in adult refractory tumors, and absence of significant neuro-, nephro-, or oto-toxicity, we conducted a pediatric phase 1 trial to determine the toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacokinetics of satraplatin, an oral platinum analogue, in children and young adults with refractory solid tumors.Procedure:Satraplatin was administered orally once daily on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle at dose level (DL) 1 (60 mg/m(2) /dose), and DL2 (80 mg/m(2) /dose). Toxicities, responses, satraplatin pharmacokinetics, and pharmacogenomic expression of specific DNA repair genes were evaluated.Results:Nine patients received 1-15 cycles (median = 2). The MTD was exceeded at DL2 with delayed prolonged myelosuppression as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in 2/4 patients. At DL1, 0/5 patients had DLTs. Common non-DLTs included myelosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicities, fatigue, headache, liver enzyme elevation, and electrolyte abnormalities. No significant neuro-, nephro-, or oto-toxicity was observed. No objective responses were observed but 2 patients experienced prolonged disease stabilization (---6-15 cycles). Satraplatin exposure (day 1 plasma ultrafiltrate area under the curve) was similar at DL1 and DL2. A strong correlation between estimated creatinine clearance and satraplatin pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, area under the curve, and peak concentration) was observed.Conclusions:The MTD of oral satraplatin in children with solid tumors was 60 mg/m(2) /dose daily Ã—5 days every 28 days, which is lower than the adult recommended dose of 80-120 mg/m(2) /dose. The toxicity profile was similar to adults and delayed myelosuppression was the DLT. No significant neuro-, nephro- or oto-toxicities were observed.
