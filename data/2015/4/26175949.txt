FBXO31 is a member of F-box family which is involved in diverse biological functions and development of disease. Recent reports in breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer demonstrated inhibitory effect of FBXO31 on proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the function of FBXO31 is not analyzed in lung cancer so far. In this study, we reported that expression of FBXO31 was higher in lung cancer tissues compared with non-cancerous lung tissues, and that higher expression of FBXO31 was significantly associated with tumor size, tumor infiltration, clinical stages and lymph node metastasis. In addition, exogenous expression of FBXO31 promoted cell growth, metastasis and invasion in A549 cells. Conversely, silencing FBXO31 by specific siRNA caused inhibitory effect on cell growth, metastasis and invasion. Moreover, tumorigenicity assays in nude mice showed FBXO31 promoted tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest FBXO31 promotes cell proliferation, metastasis and invasion in lung cancer.
