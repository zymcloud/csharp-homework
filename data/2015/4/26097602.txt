Background:Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play widespread roles in gene regulation and cellular processes. However, the functional roles of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not yet well elucidated. The aim of the present study was to measure the levels of lncRNA PCAT-1 expression in HCC and evaluate its clinical significance in the development and progression of HCC.Methods:We examined the expression of PCAT-1 in 117 HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues using quantitative real-time-PCR and analyzed its correlation with the clinical parameters.Results:Our data showed that PCAT-1 expression in HCC tissues was significantly increased compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (PConclusions:Our data suggested that the increased expression of PCAT-1 was associated with advanced clinical parameters and poor overall survival of HCC patients, indicating that PCAT-1 up-regulation may serve as a novel biomarker of poor prognosis in HCC patients.
