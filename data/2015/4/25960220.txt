Our previous study (Biomed Pharmacother 2015;69:11) demonstrated that the over-expression of CRKL, a chicken tumor virus number 10 regulator of kinase-like protein, suppresses in vitro proliferation, invasion and migration of murine hepatocarcinoma Hca-P cell, a murine HCC cell with lymph node metastatic (LNM) rate of ∼25%. In current work, we investigated the effects of CRKL knockdown on the in vitro cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and on the in vivo tumor malignancy and LNM rate and level for Hca-P cells. Western blotting assay indicated that CRKL was down-regulated by ∼90% in a monoclonal CrkL-shRNA-transfected Hca-P cells. Compared with Hca-P and unrelated-shRNA-transfected Hca-P cell, the in vitro proliferation, migration and invasion potentials were significantly enhanced following CRKL stable deregulation. CRKL knock-down significantly promoted the tumorigenicity malignancy, LNM rates and level of Hca-P-transplanted mice. Consistent with our previous work, it can be concluded CRKL plays an important role in hepatocarcinoma cell proliferation, invasion and migration as well hepatocarcinoma malignancy and metastasis. It functions as a potential tumor suppressor in hepatocarcinoma.
