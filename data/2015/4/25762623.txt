PGC-1α, a major metabolic regulator of gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, is strongly induced to coactivate Hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression in the liver of fasting mice. We found that 8-Br-cAMP and glucocorticoids synergistically induce PGC-1α and its downstream targets, including PEPCK and G6Pase. Also, HBV core promoter activity was synergistically enhanced by 8-Br-cAMP and glucocorticoids. Graptopetalum paraguayense (GP), a herbal medicine, is commonly used in Taiwan to treat liver disorders. Partially purified fraction of GP (named HH-F3) suppressed 8-Br-cAMP/glucocorticoid-induced G6Pase, PEPCK and PGC-1α expression and suppressed HBV core promoter activity. HH-F3 blocked HBV core promoter activity via inhibition of PGC-1α expression. Ectopically expressed PGC-1α rescued HH-F3-inhibited HBV surface antigen expression, HBV mRNA production, core protein levels, and HBV replication. HH-F3 also inhibited fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression and decreased lipid accumulation by down-regulating PGC-1α. Thus, HH-F3 can inhibit HBV replication, gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis by down-regulating PGC-1α. Our study indicates that targeting PGC-1α may be a therapeutic strategy for treatment of HBV infections. HH-F3 may have potential use for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients with associated metabolic syndrome.
