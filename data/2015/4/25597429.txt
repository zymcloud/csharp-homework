Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly metastatic cancer. Huaier polysaccharide (TP-1) is a naturally occurring bioactive macromolecule, found in Huaier fungus and has been shown to exert in vitro antitumor and antimetastasis for HCC, but no study has addressed in vivo efficacy and mechanisms of action. Presently, we found that TP-1 at doses of 0.5, 1 and 2mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis to the lung in mice bearing HCC SMMC-7721 tumors without toxicity. The analysis of tumors by immunohistochemistry demonstrated that TP-1 inhibited PCNA expression, increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells and reduced microvessel density (MVD) to achieve this effect. Furthermore, TP-1 administration reduced the protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), AUF-1 and AEG-1, in tumor tissues. Taken together, our data suggested that the antitumor and anti-metastatic activities of TP-1 might be at least partially through down-regulation of HIF-1alpha/VEGF and AUF-1/AEG-1 signaling pathways.
