We investigated the effects of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene silencing on Survivin expression in HepG2 cells. Small interfering RNA technology was used to downregulate AFP expression in HepG2 cells. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure AFP concentration in the supernatant before and after transfection. An MTT assay was used to detect cell proliferation activity before and after transfection. We performed flow cytometric analysis to detect the cell apoptosis rate, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect Survivin mRNA levels before and after transfection. Forty-eight hours after transfection, AFP concentration in the supernatant of the experimental group significantly decreased, hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth was inhibited by 43.1%, and the apoptosis rate increased by 24.3%. Survivin mRNA expression was reduced by 78.0% in HepG2 cells. These indicators in the control group and in the blank group did not change significantly. Silencing of AFP expression in HepG2 cells can effectively inhibit the growth of hepatoma cells and promote apoptosis, which may be useful for reducing intracellular Survivin mRNA levels.
