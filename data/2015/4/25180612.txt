Objectives:To analyze the role of smoking, drinking, and their synergistic effect in the occurrence of potentially malignant oral disorders (PMOD).Subjects and methods:We examined three groups: 50 patients with lung cancer, 50 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 50 patients with clear medical history. Scores were developed for drinking, smoking, drinking & smoking, and PMOD.Results:All four scores were the lowest in the control group. The lung cancer group showed the highest Smoking, Alcohol & Smoking and Lesions score, while the liver cirrhosis group had the Alcohol score the highest. Compared with the control group, lung cancer group is more likely to develop a PMOD than the liver cirrhosis group (OR = 12.31/OR = 6.71). Statistical significance between the groups was found in the Lesions score (Ï‡(2) = 15.34; P = 0.001).Conclusions:The patients with lung cancer and liver cirrhosis represent a high-risk group for PMOD. Patients with lung cancer and liver cirrhosis have never, to our knowledge, been categorized as high-risk patients for PMOD. After diagnosed, patients with lung cancer and liver cirrhosis should have a routine oral cavity examination, as they present a high-risk group for PMOD and oral cancer.
