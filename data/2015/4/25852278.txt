Aim:To determine the cutoff values and to compare the diagnostic role of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:A total of 1255 patients with CHB, including 157 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 879 with non-cirrhotic CHB and 219 with cirrhosis without HCC, were retrospectively enrolled. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of PIVKA-II, AFP and their combination were calculated and compared.Results:The optimal cutoff values for PIVKA-II and AFP were 40 mAU/mL and 10 ng/mL, respectively, for the differentiation of HCC from nonmalignant CHB. The sensitivity and specificity were 73.9% and 89.7%, respectively, for PIVKA-II and 67.5% and 90.3% for AFP, respectively. The AUROC curves of both PIVKA-II and AFP were not significantly different (0.854 vs 0.853, P = 0.965) for the differentiation of HCC from nonmalignant CHB, whereas the AUROC of PIVKA-II was significantly better than that of AFP in patients with cirrhosis (0.870 vs 0.812, P = 0.042). When PIVKA-II and AFP were combined, the diagnostic power improved significantly compared to either AFP or PIVKA-II alone for the differentiation of HCC from nonmalignant CHB (P Conclusion:Serum PIVKA-II might be a better tumor marker than AFP, and its combination with AFP may enhance the early detection of HCC in patients with CHB.
