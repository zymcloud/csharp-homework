As a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) plays an important role in angiogenesis and malignant progression of many human cancers. However, the role of NRP-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. The study aimed to detected the expression of Neuropilin-1 in HCC and investigate the association between its expression and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of HCC. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot, Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses were performed to characterize the expression of NRP-1 in HCC cell lines and tissues. The association of NRP-1 expression with the clinicopathological characteristics and the prognosis was subsequently assessed. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays revealed that the expression of NRP-1 in HCC was significantly increased relative to that of normal live cells and tissues (P
