Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as essential posttranscriptional modulators of gene expression, and are involved in a wide range of physiologic and pathologic states, including cancer. Numerous miRNAs are deregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-27a in the development of HCC.Methods:The expression of MiR-27a was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was used to examine changes in the viability of HepG2, Bel-7402, Bel-7404 hepatoma cell lines associated with up-regulation or down-regulation of miR-27a. A dual-luciferase activity assay was used to verify a target gene of miR-27a. Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, Western blotting analysis, and cell cycle and apoptosis flow cytometric assays were used to elucidate the mechanism by which miR-27a modulates liver cancer cell proliferation.Results:The expression of miR-27a was signiﬁcantly increased in HCC tissues and HepG2, Bel-7402, Bel-7404 hepatoma cell lines (P Conclusions:Our findings suggested that miRNA-27a promoted HCC cell proliferation by regulating PPAR-γ expression. MiR-27a may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.
