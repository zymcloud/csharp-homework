In the present study, we isolated a novel hemagglutinin from an edible legume and explored its growth-inhibitory effect on osteocarcinoma and liver cancer cells. The protein was purified by liquid chromatography techniques which entailed affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q, and gel filtration on Superdex 75 with an FPLC system. The hemagglutinating activity of this hemagglutinin was demonstrated to be ion dependent and stable over a wide range of temperature and pH values. Antiproliferative activity was observed in the tumor cell lines MG-63 and HepG2 but not in the normal cell line WRL 68. Osteocarcinoma cells treated with the hemagglutinin underwent obvious cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and apoptosis. The mRNA expression level of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were found to be up-regulated to different extents after treatment of this hemagglutinin.
