In this study, we detected the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) packaged within microvesicles (MVs) from blood samples of HCC patients and healthy donors. Using microarray analysis, there were 83 down-regulated and 92 over-expressed miRNAs in HCC circulation-derived MVs relative to control group. Then potential functions of the dysregulated MVs miRNAs were investigated with bioinformatic tools. We found that 664 Corf genes were targeted by 72 altered MVs miRNAs and some of these target genes were reported to be associated with tumorous activities. Gene Ontology annotation demonstrated that biological roles of the target Corf genes mainly contained the regulation of growth, cell death, macromolecule metabolism, etc. As regulated by abnormal MVs miRNAs, functions of target Corf genes might be interrupted, which were much likely to contribute to HCC occurrence and progression.
