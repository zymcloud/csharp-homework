Purpose of review:The scarcity of liver grafts requires to optimize the results of transplantation. Extensions and alternatives of liver transplantation have to be regularly evaluated.Recent findings:Acute-on-chronic liver failure and severe alcoholic hepatitis may represent potential extensions of transplant indications. In these diseases, selected patients could obtain a significant benefit from liver transplantation, whereas long-term outcomes and global impact on waiting lists remain to be evaluated prospectively. Alternatives to transplantation may be represented by recent progress in the management of hepatitis C and the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. In hepatitis C, new drug combinations may improve the disease control, reducing the progression to cirrhosis and also the risk of post-transplant reinfection allowing to anticipate a future decrease in the indications for transplantation and retransplantation in these patients. In hepatocellular carcinoma, thanks to improvements in operative techniques and better identification of prognostic factors of cancer recurrency, surgical resection or radiofrequency destruction could appear now as true alternatives to transplant in highly selected patients.Summary:Before implementation of these potential changes into decisional algorithms for listing and organ allocation, their consequences, either for patient's individual benefit or for global transplant outcomes, should be closely evaluated using objective long-term end points and taking into account the ethical recommendations for organ transplantation.
