Objectives:With the increased life span, the need for liver transplant for elderly patients also increased in the world. In this study, we reviewed our experience to determine the outcomes and problems of patients aged > 60 years who had liver transplants.Materials and methods:Data of recipients aged > 60 years were reviewed retrospectively. We analyzed 16 elderly patients who had liver transplant for chronic liver disease between 2001 and 2014 in our center.Results:In our series, there were 5 women and 11 men between age 60 and 65 years. The mean Child-Pugh score was 7.9 ± 1.7 and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 14.1 ± 5.1. Primary liver disease was hepatitis B in 9 patients (34.5%), most of them with hepatocellular carcinoma. The other causes of liver failure were hepatitis C (n = 4), alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 2), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 2); 1 patient had both hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, and 1 patient had both hepatitis B virus and alcoholic cirrhosis. There were 9 patients who had hepatocellular carcinoma. Mortality was observed in 4 patients. The reasons for mortality were sepsis (n=3) and hepatocellular carcinoma (n=1).Conclusions:Liver transplant can be safely performed and has acceptable long-term outcomes in low-risk elderly recipients. Age alone should not be a contraindication for liver transplant in elderly patients.
