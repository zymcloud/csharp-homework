Introduction:GIDEON is a non-interventional, prospective, international study that evaluated the safety of sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in daily clinical practice, including Child-Pugh B patients.Objectives:To analyze data collected in Spain on the safety and efficacy of sorafenib and treatment patterns.Methods:Data were collected during follow-up on demographic and disease characteristics, the initial dose used, treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and dose modifications. Overall survival was evaluated, as well as time to disease progression. Efficacy and safety were analyzed according to the Child-Pugh classification and the initial dose.Results:We included 143 patients from 19 Spanish hospitals. A total of 24.5% of the patients were Child-Pugh B. An initial dose of 400 mg/12 h was used in 90.9% of patients. In Child-Pugh A patients, dose modifications occurred more frequently and the treatment duration was longer. The incidence of AEs and drug-related AEs were similar in Child-Pugh A and B patients, although serious AEs were more frequent in Child-Pugh B patients. The most common AEs were diarrhea, fatigue and hand-foot skin reactions. The median overall survival was 384 days and was higher in Child-Pugh A patients (593 vs. 211 days in Child-Pugh B). The median time to disease progression was 177 days, similar in both subgroups.Conclusion:The safety profile of sorafenib in Spanish patients with unresectable HCC is independent of liver function. Child-Pugh status does not seem to influence the approach to sorafenib dosage or time to progression but does seem to be a strong prognostic factor for survival.
