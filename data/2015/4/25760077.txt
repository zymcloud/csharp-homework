The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) has been recently shown to be dysregulated, which plays an important role in the progression of several cancers. However, the biological role and clinical significance of UCA1 in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Herein, we found that UCA1 was aberrantly upregulated in HCC tissues and associated with TNM stage, metastasis and postoperative survival. UCA1 depletion inhibited the growth and metastasis of HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, UCA1 could act as an endogenous sponge by directly binding to miR-216b and downregulation miR-216b expression. In addition, UCA1 could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-216b on the growth and metastasis of HCC cells, which might be involved in the derepression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) expression, a target gene of miR-216b, and the activation of ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, our data highlights the pivotal role of UCA1 in the tumorigenesis of HCC. Moreover, the present study elucidates a novel lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network that is UCA1-miR-216b-FGFR1-ERK signaling pathway in HCC, which may help to lead a better understanding the pathogenesis of HCC and probe the feasibility of lncRNA-directed diagnosis and therapy for this deadly disease.
