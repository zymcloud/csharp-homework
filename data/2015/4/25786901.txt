Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a frequently progressive and fatal disease. Death from cancer occurs in a significant subset of patients with PSC. Patients with PSC have a 10 to 15 % lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). About one third of CCAs are present in the first year after a diagnosis of PSC; the remainder are present with a frequency of about 1.5 % each year. Patients with concomitant PSC and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a 4-fold higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) than patients with IBD alone and a 10-fold higher risk of CRC than the general population. The risk does not diminish with liver transplantation. This patient population also has a high frequency of carcinoma in gallbladder mass lesions. The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the presence of cirrhosis is uncertain-two large cohort studies suggest that HCC is not as common as in other causes of cirrhosis. Although AASLD guidelines do not recommend routine screening for liver tumors in patients with PSC, we recommend MRI/MRCP and serum CA 19-9 levels in patients with PSC every 6 months to screen for CCA, HCC, pancreatic cancer, and gallbladder cancer. Screening colonoscopy at the diagnosis of PSC and surveillance colonoscopies every 1-2 years should be performed in those with PSC and IBD.
