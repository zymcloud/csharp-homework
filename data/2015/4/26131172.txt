Previous reports have indicated that MDM2 T309G polymorphism might be a risk factor for various cancers. Increasing studies have been conducted on the association of MDM2 T309G polymorphism with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. However, the results remain inconclusive. Thus, the present study aimed to address this controversy by meta-analysis. Relevant literature up to Oct 2014 was searched and screened. Necessary information was rigorously extracted for data pooling and analyzing. Separate analyses on ethnicity, source of controls, sample size and P53 polymorphism status were also performed. As a result, eleven case-control studies were selected and the overall data indicated a significant association of MDM2 T309G polymorphism with HCC risk (GG vs. TT: OR=2.31; 95% CI=1.66-3.20; dominant model: OR=1.83; 95% CI=1.36-2.47; recessive model: OR=1.73; 95% CI=1.49-2.00). Similar results could be shown in the subgroups regarding ethnicity, source of controls and sample size. Interestingly, in the subgroup analysis regarding P53 codon 72 polymorphism, increased HCC risk could be observed in the Pro/Pro+Pro/Arg subgroup under a recessive model (OR=1.78; 95% CI=1.29-2.44). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that MDM2 T309G polymorphism might be a low-penetrant risk factor for HCC. Homozygous GG alleles might interact with Pro of P53 and thus confer the susceptibility to HCC.
