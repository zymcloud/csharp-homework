Background:Interleukin (IL)-32 is a described intracellular pluripotent pro-inflammatory mediator, characterized by the signaling of NF-ÎºB and STAT3.Methods:Our study investigated whether IL-32 expression has clinical significance in the metastases of colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 70 CRC patients were enrolled, 47 cases of which were single CRC organic metastasis lesions while the rest of which were primary CRC lesions (T4NxM0). IL-32 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the correlation between IL-32 expression and CRC metastases was analyzed.Results:The positive rates of IL-32 in the CRC organic metastasis group were more severe than those in the primary CRC group (P < 0.05). The positive rate of IL-32 in primary CRC with lymph node metastasis was more severe than that of IL-32 in primary CRC without lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05).Conclusions:The level of IL-32 expression could influence the N grade of CRC. Thus, IL-32 expression may stimulate the organic metastasis and the lymph node metastasis of CRC.
