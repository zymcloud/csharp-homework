Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection could cause severe liver disease including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver failure in HIV-positive individuals. The available data from clinical studies suggest that HIV infection modulates the HBV-specific T cell response. However, the virological and molecular aspects of HIV-HBV coinfection are currently poorly understood due to the lack of appropriate model systems. In this study, the effect of HIV infection on the life cycle of HBV was explored using an in vitro model system. The present data show that the extracellular and intracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and e antigen (HBeAg) decrease significantly in HepG2 cells cotransfected with HIV NL4-3 and pHBV1.3 as compared to those cells transfected only with pHBV1.3. Moreover, a significant decrease in HBV DNA and mRNA expression was also observed in the cotransfected cells. HIV Rev protein, an RNA-bound regulatory protein, could significantly decrease the expression levels of extracellular and intracellular HBsAg and HBeAg by mediating the expression of HBV mRNA in cells cotransfected with plasmids containing HIV-1 Rev and pHBV1.3. Further experiments demonstrate that HIV Rev manipulated neither the promoters of HBV nor the nuclear export of HBV mRNA. These results from the in vitro model system might provide clues to further understand the rapid progression of liver disease in HIV-HBV-coinfected patients.
