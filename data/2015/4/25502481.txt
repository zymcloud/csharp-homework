Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is clinically important given that its early detection has remarkable survival benefits. We investigated the possible role of FIB-4, a recently developed noninvasive marker for liver fibrosis based on routine laboratory tests, as a clinical indicator for predicting future HCC among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Our retrospective cohort study involved 986 Korean HBsAg carriers 40 years of age or older who visited Seoul National University Hospital for a health checkup. National medical service claims data were used to determine HCC incidence. Median follow-up time was 5.4 years (interquartile range: 4.4 years). Adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, and antiviral medication for hepatitis B, compared to subjects with FIB-4 Conclusion:High FIB-4 is a highly predictive risk factor for HCC incidence among Korean HBsAg carriers. FIB-4 is a promising, easily applicable, and cost-effective clinical tool in identifying a subpopulation of HBsAg carriers who are at heightened risk. Our study needs to be replicated in larger future studies on various ethnic groups; nonetheless, our study suggests that FIB-4 may play a valuable role in HCC screening among HBsAg carriers.
