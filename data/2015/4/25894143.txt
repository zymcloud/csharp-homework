Objectives:To identify the predictors of overall survival and tumor-free survival of 88 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who were treated with orthotopic liver transplant at Shiraz Organ Transplant Center.Materials and methods:We performed this retrospective study after reviewing the transplant database of all patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplant secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed in 70 patients before liver transplant and 18 patients on histologic examination of the explanted livers. Cox regression identified independent factors that affected posttransplant survival.Results:The overall survival rate was 83% and the tumor-free survival rate was 79.5%. Independent factors for tumor recurrence were Milan criteria, alpha-fetoprotein level before operation â‰¥ 400 ng/mL, tumor grade, vascular invasion, and age. Vascular invasion (odds ratio, 5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 25.496; P = .049) and tumor grade (odds ratio, 14.42; 95% confidence interval, 3.652 to 56.95; P Conclusions:Vascular invasion and tumor grade were predictive factors for tumor-free survival.
