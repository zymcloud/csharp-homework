A carcinoma displaying undifferentiated features with dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration is defined as lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC). Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) with LELC components is rare, and most LELCs are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We report here on a case of ICC with LELC components not associated with EBV. A 65-year-old woman was incidentally found to have a hepatic tumor in the caudate lobe. An extended right hepatectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. Histologically, the tumor was mainly composed of large undifferentiated epithelial cells with vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, indistinct cell borders, and heavy small lymphocytic infiltration, which are the characteristic features of LELC. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 19 but were negative for glypican 3. In situ hybridization using EBV-encoded RNA was negative. Therefore, a diagnosis of ICC with LELC components not associated with EBV was made. Because there is limited information available regarding the prognosis and treatment of ICC with LELC components because of the limited number of reported cases, additional studies will be needed to clarify the clinicopathologic features of this disease.
