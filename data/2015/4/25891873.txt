Conventional surgical therapy for advanced renal venous tumor thrombi results in high morbidity, so there is a need for less invasive techniques. This report presents the first case of a successful inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus removal without complications with balloon catheter (BC) via internal jugular vein (IJV), called the venous tumor thrombus pushing with balloon catheter (VTTP BC). Under the control of transesophageal echocardiogram and fluoroscope, a balloon catheter was sleeved on the guide wire, which was already inserted into the right internal jugular vein (IJV) and was driven distally above the IVC tumor thrombus. The balloon was inflated to occlude the IVC for prevention of pulmonary embolization. After the occlusion, the guide wire was driven to the cavotomy and was opened at the ostium of the right renal vein. It was pulled at both ends and stretched to serve as a rail. The balloon was gently pushed toward the cavotomy and the thrombectomy was completed. This is a less invasive method for treatment of venous tumor thrombus level 3 that can reduce surgical time, blood loss, and complication rates compared to the existing surgical methods. Also, it can be performed without thoracotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, hypothermic circulatory arrest, and liver mobilization.
