Aim:The present study investigated whether bevacizumab (BV) is associated with postoperative wound complications (PWCs).Patients and methods:We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing surgery for liver metastases of colorectal cancer at our Institution. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the preoperative treatment: che mo therapy with BV (group A), chemotherapy without BV (group B) and no chemotherapy (group C).Results:Between February 2003 and September 2012, 297 patients underwent 373 surgeries. Groups A, B and C consisted of 23, 62 and 288 patients, respectively. PWCs occurred in 29 patients (7.8%). In multivariate analysis, there were no differences in PWCs among the groups (C vs. B:P=0.739; C vs. A: P=0.110). Conversely, lower serum albumin levels (<3.5 g/dl vs. â‰¥ 3.5 g/dl: p=0.030) and synchronous colorectal resection (no vs. yes; p<0.001) remained significant risk factors of developing PWCs.Conclusion:Chemotherapy with or without BV did not influence the risk of PWCs.
