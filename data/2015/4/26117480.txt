Background:Leptin takes part in regulation of energy balance, neuronal functions, pain and mood. It may act as intermediary marker for various components of HRQOL in patients of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.Aims:To document the correlation among leptin levels, obesity and HRQoL in OSAS patients.Methods:A tertiary care hospital based cross-sectional study was done in 224 subjects aged 18-65 years, after taking informed consent. Subjects with previous history of smoking, Liver disease, COPD, CHD, T2 DM, asthma, cancer, end stage renal disease, heart failure, any endocrine disorder including Cushing syndrome, thyroid, on systemic steroid or any continuous medication for last 6 months, on dieting or suffering from any disability condition (other than obesity and OSAS) affecting their HRQoL were excluded from the study. All subjects underwent Polysomnography. Leptin assay was done by ELISA method. Hindi version of HRQoL tool SF-36 was used to evaluate HRQoL.Results:SPSS 20 was used to analyse data. Three groups (AHI <5, 5 to 15 and >15) were compared. Significant differences were observed in BMI, NC, WC, WHR and ESS. Differences were not significant in sleep architecture and Leptin level. SF-36 HRQoL, scores were observed decreased with increase in severity of disease. Leptin level was found significantly correlated with "Role limitations due to physical health problems", "Social functioning", Hypopnea and obesity indices.Conclusions:In these subjects Obesity indices are the most important correlates of Leptin level. Oxygen desaturation indices with exception of Hypopnea and HRQoL may not be exclusively correlated to leptin levels.
