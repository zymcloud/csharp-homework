Glabridin (GA) has gained wide application in the cosmetics and food industry. This study was performed to investigate its metabolic inactivation and elimination by glucuronidation by use of liver and intestine microsomes from humans (HLM and HIM) and rats (RLM and RIM), and liver microsomes from cynomolgus monkeys and beagle dogs (CyLM and DLM). Both hydroxyl groups at the C2 and C4 positions of the B ring are conjugated to generate two mono-glucuronides (M1 and M2). HIM, RIM and RLM showed the most robust activity in catalyzing M2 formation with intrinsic clearance values (Clint) above 2000 μL/min/mg, with little measurable M1 formation activity. DLM displayed considerable activity both in M1 and M2 formation, with Clint values of 71 and 214 μL/min/mg, respectively, while HLM and CyLM exhibited low activities in catalyzing M1 and M2 formation, with Clint values all below 20 μL/min/mg. It is revealed that UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A9, 2B7, 2B15 and extrahepatic UGT1A8 and 1A10 are involved in GA glucuronidation. Nearly all UGTs preferred M2 formation except for UGT1A1. Notably, UGT1A8 displayed the highest activity with a Clint value more than 5-fold higher than the other isoforms. Chemical inhibition studies, using selective inhibitors of UGT1A1, 1A9, 2B7 and 1A8, further revealed that UGT1A8 contributed significantly to intestinal GA glucuronidation in humans. In summary, this in vitro study demonstrated large species differences in GA glucuronidation by liver and intestinal microsomes, and that intestinal UGTs are important for the pathway in humans.
