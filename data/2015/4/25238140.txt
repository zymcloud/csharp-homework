Background and aims:Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and the recovery of ALC after treatment have been identified as a prognostic biomarker for several malignancies. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic role of peritransplant ALC and ALC recovery after liver transplantation (LT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:A total of 269 HCC patients undergoing LT were enrolled in our study. Clinicopathological data were retrospectively collected and reviewed. Peritransplant ALC and the change of ALC (2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months post-LT) were carefully monitored. All potential risk factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis.Results:Over a mean follow-up of 35.9 months, 120 recurrences and 89 deaths were recorded. In the multivariate analysis, HCC with ALC no recovery at 1 month after LT (P 8 cm (P = 0.003), and beyond Milan criteria (P 8 cm (P = 0.011), pretransplant albumin 15 (P = 0.017), and beyond Milan criteria (P = 0.001) were significantly related to poor OS. When subgroup analyses were performed according to the Milan criteria, the results showed that the recovery of ALC at 1 month after LT still indicated longer recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P Conclusions:ALC recovery at 1 month after LT indicated favorable outcomes of HCC patients.
