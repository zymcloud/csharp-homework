Aim:To describe a three-dimensional model (3DM) to accurately reconstruct anatomic relationships of centrally located hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Methods:From March 2013 to July 2014, reconstructions and visual simulations of centrally located HCCs were performed in 39 patients using a 3D subject-based computed tomography (CT) model with custom-developed software. CT images were used for the 3D reconstruction of Couinaud's pedicles and hepatic veins, and the calculation of corresponding tumor territories and hepatic segments was performed using Yorktal DMIT software. The respective volume, surgical margin, and simulated virtual resection of tumors were also estimated by this model preoperatively. All patients were treated surgically and the results were retrospectively assessed. Clinical characteristics, imaging data, procedure variables, pathologic features, and postoperative data were recorded and compared to determine the reliability of the model.Results:3D reconstruction allowed stereoscopic identification of the spatial relationships between physiologic and pathologic structures, and offered quantifiable liver resection proposals based on individualized liver anatomy. The predicted values were consistent with the actual values for tumor mass volume (82.4 ± 109.1 mL vs 84.1 ± 108.9 mL, P = 0.910), surgical margin (10.1 ± 6.2 mm vs 9.1 ± 5.9 mm, P = 0.488), and maximum tumor diameter (4.61 ± 2.16 cm vs 4.53 ± 2.14 cm, P = 0.871). In addition, the number and extent of portal venous ramifications, as well as their relation to hepatic veins, were visualized. Preoperative planning based on simulated resection facilitated complete resection of large tumors located in the confluence of major vessels. And most of the predicted data were correlated with intraoperative findings.Conclusion:This 3DM provides quantitative morphometry of tumor masses and a stereo-relationship with adjacent structures, thus providing a promising technique for the management of centrally located HCCs.
