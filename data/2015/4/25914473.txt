Aim:To compare the outcomes of hepatic resection and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system.Methods:A consecutive sample of 540 patients with solitary HCC who underwent liver resection (n = 312) or TACE (n = 128) were included in the present study. Baseline characteristics, tumor characteristics, and post-operative complications were compared between the two groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for long-term survival analysis. Independent prognostic predictors were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model (univariate and multivariate analyses).Results:The TACE and liver resection groups had similar baseline demographic and clinicopathological characteristics. The TACE group showed a significantly lower rate of major complications than the liver resection group (3.9% vs 17.4%, P Conclusion:A tumor diameter of 6 cm should be the cutoff for deciding between liver resection and TACE.
