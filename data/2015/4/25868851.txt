Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer, leading to many cancer-related deaths worldwide. Several studies have shown an association between pre-S deletion mutation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCC risk, but the results remain conflicting. We aimed to verify HBV pre-S deletion mutations in relation to the risk of HCC.Material and methods:We searched the commonly used electronic databases for relevant studies of this association among the Asian population until September 30th, 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed to calculate the association.Results:A total of 17 case-control studies were screened out, including 2837 HBV-infected patients, of whom 1246 had HCC. The results showed that the frequency of pre-S deletion of HBV in patients with HCC was higher than that in patients without HCC (35.7% vs. 11.5%), indicating the prevalence of this mutation in patients with HCC. Statistically significant correlations were observed for pre-S deletion mutation and risk of HCC in a random-effects model (OR=3.90, 95% CI=2.80-5.44, PConclusions:Our data indicate that HBV pre-S deletion mutations might be associated with HCC risk. Their oncogenic role may be important in studying the potential mechanism of HBV hepatocarcinogenesis.
