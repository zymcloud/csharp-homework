This study aimed to compare the changes and determine the clinical significance of carbohydrate antigens CA242, CA199, CA125, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and tumor-specific growth factor (TSGF) before and after cryoablation by Cryocare system. Thirty-one pancreatic cancer patients were selected to receive cryoablation by Cryocare system. The serum expression levels of CA242, CA199, CA125, CEA, and TSGF before and 1 month after treatment were determined. Meanwhile, the serum level of these factors was also determined in 31 healthy volunteers. The parameter changes were analyzed with the clinical pathological data. The serum levels of CA242, CA199, CA125, CEA, and TSGF in the pancreatic cancer group were significantly higher than those of the control group both before and after the cryoablation treatment (P < 0.05). The serum CA199, CEA, and TSGF dramatically decreased 1 month after the treatment, which were statistically different (P < 0.05). The positive rates of serum CA242, CA199, CA125, and CEA in the pancreatic cancer group were much higher than those in the control group both before and after treatment (P < 0.05), and the positive rate of TSGF was significantly higher than that of the control group before the treatment (P < 0.05). The positive rate of CA199, CEA, and TSGF after the treatment was significantly lower than that before the treatment (P < 0.05). Serum level of CA242 was correlated with the tumor diameter, clinical staging, tumor differentiation, lymph node, and liver metastasis (P < 0.05). Except gender, CA199 was correlated with all the other clinical pathological parameters (P < 0.05). The serum levels of CA125 and CEA were correlated with all the other clinical pathological parameters (P < 0.05). The serum level of TSGF was only correlated with tumor differentiation (P < 0.05). Cryoablation treatment by Cryocare system can decrease the serum levels of CA199, CEA, TSGF, and the positive rate. Serum CA199, CEA, and TSGF can be important index for pancreatic cancer treatment assessment. Serum levels of CA242, CA199, CA125, and CEA are of great clinical value for metastasis assessment and prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients.
