Objective:Limited therapies are offered for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It carries dismal prognosis and efforts tried changing its management from a palliative to a curative mode. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a palliative procedure that may have survival benefit if compared to non-management of large lesions. Microwave ablation (MWA) has emerged as a relatively new technique with promise of larger and faster ablation. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous MWA versus TACE for large tumors (5-7 cm) and to assess their effects on local tumor progression and survival.Patients and methods:Sixty-four patients with large lesions are managed in our multidisciplinary HCC clinic and were divided into two groups treated either by MWA or TACE. Complete response rate, local recurrence, de novo lesions, and overall survival analysis are compared between both procedures.Results:Both groups were comparable as regards the demographic and ultrasonographic features. MWA showed higher rates of complete ablation (75%) with fewer sessions, lower incidence of tumor recurrence (p = 0.02), development of de novo lesions (p = 0.03), occurrence of post-treatment ascites (p = 0.003), and higher survival rates (p = 0.04). The mean survival of the microwave group was 21.7 months with actuarial probability of survival at 12 and 18 months 78.2% and 68.4%, respectively. The mean survival of the TACE group was 13.7 months with actuarial probability of survival at 12 and 18 months being 52.4% and 28.6%, respectively.Conclusion:MWA showed better results than TACE in the management of large HCC lesions.
