Lysyl oxidase like 4 (LOXL4), a member of the secreted copper-dependent amine oxidases that contribute to the assemble and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM), was found to be up-regulated or down-regulated in different cancer types, suggesting its paradoxical roles in cancer. The specific role of LOXL4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, is still yet to be defined. Twenty-eight pairs of HCC specimens were used for LOXL4 mRNA expression analysis. The mRNA expression in HCC cell lines was examined, and HepG2 was selected for LOXL4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) interference to investigate the biological function of LOXL4, LOXL4 immunohistochemical staining was performed using a tissue microarray containing 298 HCC patients. The prognostic and diagnostic value of LOXL4 was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. LOXL4 mRNA or protein expression was significantly lower in HCC tissues than peritumoral tissues (LOXL4 mRNA expression, P = 0.018; LOXL4 protein expression, P
