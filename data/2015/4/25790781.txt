Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays important roles in cancer development. However, the significance of FAK expression in colorectal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma has not been clarified. This study aims to explore the roles FAK played in the progression of colorectal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. RNAi method was used to inhibit the expression of FAK in Caco2 and SMMC-7721 cells. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis and Western blot analysis were used to examine mRNA and protein expression of FAK. Then, the proliferation, motility and apoptosis of both types of cells were detected using MTT assay, wound healing/transwell assay and nuclear staining assay. The microstructure changes (F-actin, β-tubulin and lamin B1) of SMMC-7721 cells were visualized by immunofluorescence. FAK was overexpressed in both cell lines and down-regulation of FAK resulted in suppression of cell proliferation, inhibition of cell migration and invasion. The apoptosis of cells was increased significantly following the FAK expression inhibition. Moreover, actin polymerization, β-tubulin and lamin B1 expression of cells were significantly decreased. The results highlight the role of FAK in the progression of cancers. These findings suggest FAK serve as a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy.
