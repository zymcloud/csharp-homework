Aim:The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of detection, staging and differentiation assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a combination of dual-phase computed tomography (CT)-angiography in the arterial and portal phase with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)FDG).Patients and methods:From a set of 10,000 patients who underwent (18)FDG-PET/CT, we examined a total of 65 patients (52 males, 13 females; mean age=61.7 years, ranging from 35-82 years) with HCC. The imaging included CT data acquisition after intravenous application of iodinated contrast material in arterial and portal phases, allowed to obtain data in CT angiography quality. Histological diagnosis of the resection sample (21), biopsy (37) or necropsy (7), including the evaluation of the hepatocytary origin of the tumor and the grade of its differentiation, was determined in all patients.Results:The most sensitive sign in the detection of HCC was the alternative presence of hypervascularity or hyperaccumulation of (18)F FDG that reached 93.8%. The high level of (18)F-FDG accumulation showed sensitivity of 84.1% and specificity of 75.0% for distinguishing between well- and poorly differentiated HCC.Conclusion:The combination of the dual-phase CT angiography with (18)FDG PET helps in the assessment of staging and differentiation of HCC and has an important role in treatment decision-making.
