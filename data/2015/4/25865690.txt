Background:Prothymosin alpha (PTMA) is a nuclear oncoprotein-transcription factor essential for cell cycle progression and proliferation. PTMA was overexpressed in several human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the prognostic significance of PTMA protein expression in HCC remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated PTMA protein expression by immunohistochemistry in order to elucidate the prognostic roles of PTMA in HCC patients.Methods:By immunohistochemistry, we investigated the expression of PTMA protein in tumor tissue from 226 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate its predictive value for tumor recurrence and survival of patients. The median follow-up period was 120 months.Results:PTMA expression was observed in 162 (71.7%) of the 226 HCC patients and was significantly associated with higher Edmondson grade, microvascular invasion, intrahepatic metastasis, higher American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T-stage, and lower albumin level. PTMA expression was an independent predictor of early recurrence (P=0.001). PTMA expression showed an unfavorable influence on recurrence-free survival (RFS) (PConclusions:PTMA protein expression might be a novel predictor of early recurrence and RFS in HCC patients, even those at early stage or with alpha-fetoprotein-negative after curative hepatectomy. PTMA could be used as an immunohistochemical biomarker to detect patients with a high risk of recurrence.
