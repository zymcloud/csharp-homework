Patients presenting with abdominal lump is a common clinical finding in our medical practice. Most of the cases can be diagnosed without much difficulty. But sometimes it can be difficult to diagnose the cause of the lump. Here we are presenting a 42-year-old man who visited his physician in Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University with huge abdominal lump. Initially it was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Later it turned out to be case of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Problems related to diagnosis and management is also discussed.
