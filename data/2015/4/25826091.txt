Activation of the PI3K and Yes-associated protein (Yap) signaling pathways has been independently reported in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the oncogenic interactions between these two cascades in hepatocarcinogenesis remain undetermined. To assess the consequences of the crosstalk between the PI3K and Yap pathways along liver carcinogenesis, we generated a mouse model characterized by combined overexpression of activated mutant forms of PIK3CA (PIK3CAH1047R) and Yap (YapS127A) in the mouse liver using hydrodynamic transfection (PIK3CA/Yap). In addition, suppression of PI3K and Yap pathways was conducted in human HCC and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell lines. We found that concomitant activation of PI3K and Yap pathways triggered rapid liver tumor development in mice. Histologically, tumors were pure HCC, CCA, or mixed HCC/CCA. At the molecular level, PIK3CA/Yap tumors were characterized by activation of the mTORC1/2, ERK/MAPK, and Notch pathways. Simultaneous activation of PI3K and Yap pathways frequently occurred in human liver tumor specimens and their combined suppression was highly detrimental for the growth of HCC and CCA cell lines. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the oncogenic cooperation between PI3K and Yap pathways along liver carcinogenesis. The PIK3CA/Yap mouse represents an important preclinical liver tumor model for the development of novel therapeutics against this malignancy.
