Background:The impact of KRAS signaling on cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) expression has not yet been explored. We investigated the impact of KRAS on CIP2A expression in colorectal cancer patients after colorectal liver metastasectomy.Methods:We examined CIP2A expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and used direct sequencing to identify the mutational status of KRAS exon 2 (codon 12 and 13). The association between CIP2A expression, KRAS genotype, clinicopathological parameters and survival were examined by the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model. A combination of immunoblotting and proliferation assays were employed to elucidate the role of CIP2A in signal transduction pathways in wild-type KRAS Caco-2 cells.Results:A total of 220 colorectal cancer patients who had undergone colorectal liver metastasectomy were included in the study. The mutant KRAS genotype was associated with CIP2A overexpression. CIP2A expression was an independent prognostic marker in patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer after colorectal liver metastasectomy (relative risk = 1.873, P = 0.019). Targeted silencing of CIP2A in Caco-2 cells (wild-type KRAS) led to decreased expression of pERK/ERK and decreased cell proliferation. Overexpression of mutant KRAS G12D in Caco-2 cells led to an increase in CIP2A expression and cell proliferation. In Caco-2 cells with the KRAS G12D, KRAS overexpression preserved the regulation effect of CIP2A in KRAS and abrogated the impact of CIP2A regulation on pERK/ERK and cell proliferation. CIP2A inhibition also increased the efficacy of cetuximab in Caco-2 cells.Conclusions:CIP2A is an independent prognostic marker in patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer after colorectal liver metastasectomy.
