Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate response of the targeted tumor burden by functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including volumetric diffusion-weighted imaging and volumetric contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and its impact on survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with intra-arterial therapy (IAT).Materials and methods:This institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective study included 157 hepatocellular carcinoma lesions in 97 patients (78 men and 19 women; mean age, 64 years) treated with IAT. All patients had pretreatment and 3- to 4-week follow-up MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging and CE-MRI. All lesions 2 cm or larger that were targeted during the first session of IAT were segmented using research software (MR-Oncotreat) to determine targeted tumor burden relative to liver volume (%). Targeted tumor burden was stratified into low (≤10%) or high (>10%). Response using volumetric functional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; increase by ≥25%) and CE-MRI (decrease by ≥50% and ≥65% in arterial and venous enhancement [VE], respectively) was assessed in all targeted tumors (range, 1-11) using paired t tests. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed and log-rank test was used to compare pairs of survival curves. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the simultaneous effect of treatment response and tumor burden on survival after adjusting for age, sex, and Child Pugh status.Results:There was a significant increase in volumetric ADC (median, 15%; P Conclusion:Quantifying targeted tumor burden is important in predicting patient survival when using functional MRI metrics in assessing treatment response.
