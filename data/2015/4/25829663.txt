Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Most cases of HCC are associated with cirrhosis from various causes such as alcohol or viral hepatitis. Most patients are symptomatic as a result of cirrhosis itself or secondary to tumor extension. These tumors have an affinity for the vasculature and often invade the portal system. HCC rarely causes invasion of the inferior vena cava or the heart. We, however, present a case of HCC in a patient without cirrhosis who remained asymptomatic despite having tumor extension to the heart by way of the inferior vena cava. The mean survival in patients with intracardiac extension with or without aggressive treatment or intervention is approximately 4 months, but our patient greatly exceeded survival expectations after treatment with sorafenib.
