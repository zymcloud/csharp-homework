Cervical cancer in virgin women is extremely rare. We present the case of a 36-year-old patient without any type of sexual contact with sensa- tion of lump in external genitalia referring only irregular bleeding in the previous two months, finding in vaginal examination an indurated mass in vaginal introitus with result in the biopsy of adenosquamous adenocarcinoma. The evolution of the tumor was very aggressive in spite of trying palliative chemotherapy, and patient died two months after of diagnosis with lung, liver and brain metastases. Cervical human papil- lomavirus testing was negative. What unusual of these cases does not justify the cytology as the only method of screening for cervical cancer.
