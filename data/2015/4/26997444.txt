Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare T-cell lymphoma commonly associated with cytopenias. The pathogenesis of cytopenias in patients with HSTCL is not well defined, although the presence of dyspoietic hematopoietic cells and the common association with trisomy 8 raise the possibility of an associated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In 25 bone marrow specimens involved by HSTCL, we systematically assessed for morphologic features of dyspoiesis and correlated the findings with peripheral cytopenia(s), cytogenetic findings, and detection of chromosome 8 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The median patient age was 33 years. One patient had a history of MDS diagnosed 1 year prior to the diagnosis of HSTCL. Thirteen (54%) patients had anemia less than 100 g/L, 10 (53%) of 19 had neutropenia less than 1.8 × 10(9)/L, and 15 (60%) had thrombocytopenia less than 100 × 10(9)/L. Dyspoietic features were identified in 1 to 3 hematopoietic cell lineages in 20 (80%) of 25 patients. Cytogenetic analysis identified trisomy 8 in 7 cases. Patients with trisomy 8 had a lower platelet count, but trisomy 8 was not associated with cytopenias, dyspoietic features, or cytogenetic abnormalities. Combined morphologic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that trisomy 8 was restricted to the lymphoma cells, except in the 1 patient with a history of MDS. In conclusion, dyspoietic changes are common in the bone marrow of patients with HSTCL. These changes are not associated with cytopenias or chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting that dyspoiesis in patients with HSTCL is not a manifestation of a MDS.
