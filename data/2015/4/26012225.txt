Chronic HCV infection causes hepatic cirrhosis and approximately 10%-20% of cirrhotic patients may develop hepatocellular carcinoma within 5 years. Diabetes mellitus is associated with a 2-4-fold increase in the risk of HCC. Insulin resistance (IR) emerged as a risk factor for a variety of cancers, including endometrial and breast and various gastrointestinal cancers The role of IR in the development of HCC associated with chronic HCV infection has not, been established. This study elucidated the role of insulin resistance assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR) in development of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with chronic hepatitis C infection. The study included 3 groups: GI: 100 newly diagnosed cases of HCV related hepatocellular carcinoma GII: 60 patients with HCV related chronic liver disease. Forty healthy persons as a control group (GIII). All groups were subjected to full history taking, physical examination, laboratory investigations abdominal ultrasonography and Triphasic C.T examination. In addition to Calculation of Body mass Index, Measurement of fasting blood insulin and glucose, Calculation of insulin resistance using HOMA-IR. The results showed that fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly higher among HCC group than HCV group & control group. Also, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in HCV group than control group. HOMA-IR above 3.7, insulin above 9Î¼U/L & DM were considered independent predictors of HCC.
