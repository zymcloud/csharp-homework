Background:Although hepatocellular carcinoma cells can sometimes undergo differentiation in an embryonic microenvironment, the mechanism is poorly understood.Aim:The developmental stage-specific embryonic induction of tumor cell differentiation was investigated.Methods:Both chick and mouse liver extracts and hepatoblast-enriched cells at different developmental stages were used to treat human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and the effects on the induction of differentiation were evaluated. The nuclear factors controlling differentiation, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4α, HNF-1α, HNF-6 and upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1), and the oncogene Myc and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were measured. HNF-4α RNA interference was used to verify the role of HNF-4α. Embryonic induction effects were further tested in vivo by injecting HepG2 tumor cells into immunodeficient nude mice.Results:The 9-11-days chick liver extracts and 13.5-14.5-days mouse hepatoblast-enriched cells could inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of HepG2 cells, leading to either death or maturation to hepatocytes. The maturation of surviving HepG2 cells was confirmed by increases in the expressions of HNF-4α, HNF-1α, HNF-6, and USF-1, and decreases in Myc and AFP. The embryonic induction of HepG2 cell maturation could be attenuated by HNF-4α RNA interference. Furthermore, the 13.5-days mouse hepatoblast culture completely eliminated HepG2 tumors with inhibited Myc and induced HNF-4α, confirming this embryonic induction effect in vivo.Conclusions:This study demonstrated that developmental stage-specific embryonic induction of HepG2 cell differentiation might help in understanding embryonic differentiation and oncogenesis.
