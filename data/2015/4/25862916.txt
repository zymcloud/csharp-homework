Background/aim:Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHC-CC) is found unexpectedly in explanted or resected liver specimens. The current study evaluated the longterm outcomes of living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) between patients with cHC-CC and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:We performed 178 LDLT including 8 patients of pathologically and immunohistochemically diagnosed cHC-CC who all underwent LDLT with a preoperative diagnosis of HCC by imaging study.Results:Out of the 8 patients, 6 were within the Milan criteria and all were within the Kyushu University criteria. The 1-, 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates after LDLT for patients with cHC-CC were 87.5, 72.9 and 48.6% and 85.7, 85.7 and 85.7%, respectively. The OS and DFS between patients with cHC-CC and HCC were not statistically different.Conclusion:LDLT for patients with cHC-CC using the Milan criteria or the Kyushu University criteria, as well as HCC, could have an acceptable long-term outcome.
