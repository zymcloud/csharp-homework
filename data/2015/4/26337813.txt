Background:Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an established independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). T2DM is associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a major cause of non-HBV and non-HCV-related HCC; nevertheless, it has been difficult to identify those patients with T2DM who have a high risk of developing HCC. The aim of this study was to identify genetic determinants that predispose T2DM patients to HCC by genotyping T2DM susceptibility loci and PNPLA3.Methods:We recruited 389 patients with T2DM who satisfied the following three criteria: negative for HBs-Ag and anti-HCV Ab, alcohol intake 10 years. These patients were divided into two groups: T2DM patients with HCC (DM-HCC, n = 59) or those without HCC (DM-non-HCC, n = 330). We genotyped 51 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported as T2DM or NASH susceptibility loci (PNPLA3) compared between the DM-HCC and DM-non-HCC groups with regard to allele frequencies at each SNP.Results:The SNP rs738409 located in PNPLA3 was the greatest risk factor associated with HCC. The frequency of the PNPLA3 G allele was significantly higher among DM-HCC individuals than DM-non-HCC individuals (OR 2.53, p = 1.05 Ã— 10(-5)). Among individuals homozygous for the PNPLA3 G allele (n = 115), the frequency of the JAZF1 rs864745 G allele was significantly higher among DM-HCC individuals than DM-non-HCC individuals (OR 3.44, p = 0.0002).Conclusions:PNPLA3 and JAZF1 were associated with non-HBV and non-HCV-related HCC development among Japanese patients with T2DM.
