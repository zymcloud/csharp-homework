Aim:To compare survival and recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who did or did not receive adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A consecutive sample of 229 patients who underwent curative resection between March 2007 and March 2010 in our hospital was included. Of these 229 patients, 91 (39.7%) underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant TACE and 138 (60.3%) underwent curative resection alone. In order to minimize confounds due to baseline differences between the two patient groups, comparisons were conducted between propensity score-matched patients. Survival data and recurrence rates were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Independent predictors of overall survival and recurrence were identified using Cox proportional hazard regression.Results:Among 61 pairs of propensity score-matched patients, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 95.1%, 86.7%, and 76.4% in the TACE group and 86.9%, 78.5%, and 73.2% in the control group, respectively. At the same time, the TACE and control groups also showed similar recurrence rates at 1 year (13.4% vs 24.8%), 2 years (30.6% vs 32.1%), and 3 years (40.1% vs 34.0%). Multivariate Cox regression identified serum alpha-fetoprotein level â‰¥ 400 ng/mL and tumor size > 5 cm as independent risk factors of mortality (P Conclusion:As postoperative adjuvant TACE does not improve overall survival or reduce recurrence in HCC patients, further study is needed to clarify its clinical benefit.
