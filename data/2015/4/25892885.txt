Aim:To evaluate the performance of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the detection and characterization of focal hepatic lesions (FHLs).Methods:This meta-analysis compared relevant studies that were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases for articles published between January 1988 and September 2014 and that met the following criteria: (1) SPIO-enhanced MRI was conducted to identify FHLs and data were sufficient for pooled analysis using Meta-DiSc 1.4; (2) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were differentiated from other FHLs; (3) well-differentiated HCCs (WD-HCCs) were contradistinguished from dysplastic nodules; and (4) WD-HCCs were compared with moderately and poorly differentiated HCCs (MD- and PD-HCCs, respectively).Results:The data obtained from 15 eligible studies yielded a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 78% for differentiating between HCCs and other FHLs. The sensitivity was unchanged and the specificity was increased to 87% when non-HCC malignancies were excluded. Comparative analyses between WD-HCCs and MD- and PD-HCCs from seven studies showed a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 50% for the diagnosis of MD- and PD-HCCs, and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristics (sROC) curve was 0.97. A comparison between WD-HCCs and dysplastic nodules revealed a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 92% for the diagnosis of WD-HCCs and the area under the sROC curve was 0.80.Conclusion:SPIO-enhanced MRI is useful in differentiating between HCCs and other FHLs.
