A number of genetic studies have attempted to link interleukin-27 (IL-27) polymorphisms (rs153109, rs17855750 and rs181206) to the risk of cancer in Chinese population, including glioma, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, etc. However, the results were inconclusive. The aim of this study is to derive a more precise estimation of any association in a meta-analysis. We searched the PubMed database (up to 6 June 2014) for studies regarding the association of IL-27 polymorphisms (rs153109, rs17855750 and rs181206) and the risk of cancer in Chinese population. Odds ratios (ORs) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using random/fixed effect model to assess the association. Sensitivity analyses were used to assess the stability of the results. Begg's test was performed to measure publication bias. A total of six eligible studies with 1684 patients and 1837 controls were included in this meta-analysis. IL-27 rs153109 polymorphism was significantly associated with cancer risk in Chinese population (GG versus AA: OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.00-1.54, p = 0.05). However, there were no associations between IL-27 rs17855750 and rs181206 polymorphisms and cancer risk in Chinese population. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that IL-27 rs153109 polymorphism was associated with cancer risk in Chinese population.
