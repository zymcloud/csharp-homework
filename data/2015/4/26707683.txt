Background & aims:The effect of ethanol consumption on hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with fatty liver disease (FLD) is not clear. We aimed to investigate the influence of alcohol consumption on hepatocarcinogenesis and determine the risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a large number of Japanese patients with FLD without viral hepatitis.Methods:This multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted at a specialized center for hepatology in Japan and included 9959 patients with FLD without viral hepatitis, diagnosed by ultrasonography from January 1997 through December 2011. The patients' level of ethanol consumption was divided into 4 categories: Results:Of the study cohort, 49 cases (0.49%) developed HCC during the follow-up period. The annual incidence rate of HCC was 0.05% in patients with FLD and a daily ethanol consumption Conclusions:Based on a multicenter, retrospective analysis of almost 10,000 patients with FLD, ethanol consumption â‰¥40 g/day is an independent risk factor for HCC.
