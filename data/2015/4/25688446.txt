Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an important therapeutic option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We discuss five patients with HCC and tuberculosis (TB) reactivation following TACE. Screening patients for latent TB infection at diagnosis of cirrhosis or HCC should be considered because of the immunosuppression inherent in both the diseases and their treatments.
Cirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma; transarterial chemoembolization; tuberculosis reactivation.
