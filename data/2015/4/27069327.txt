Hepato cellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of malignant tumor. To investigate the proteins in cancer molecular mechanism and its role in HCC, we have used proteomic tools such as 2DE and MALDI-TOF-MS. Our investigation ravels that, plasma α-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were elevated in DEN induced rats and gradually decreased after the treatment with 1,3BPMU. 2DE and MALDI-TOF-MS tool offers to identify the up and down regulation of proteins in HCC. Proteomic study reveals that, five differentially expressed proteins were identified in DEN induced rats and 1,3BPMU treated rats i.e. three up regulated protein such as T kininogen, NDPKB, PRMT1 (DEN induced rats), RGS19 and PAF (1,3BPMU treated rats) in 3BPMU treated rats, activation of transcription of a single gene from multiple promoters provides flexibility in the controlled gene expression. The regulations of hepatocyte stimulating factor were slow down the proliferation of hepatic cell and uncontrolled hepatic cell growth and also molecular signals strongly argue for a patho-physiological role in liver metastasis to control the cell aggression. This indicates that, anti cancer property of 1,3BPMU can be used as potent anti cancer agent. The present study also shows the proteomic approach helps to elucidate the tumor maker as well as regulatory marker proteins in HCC.
