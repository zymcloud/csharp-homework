Objectives:Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into collagen producing myofibroblasts is critical for pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is one of the main profibrogenic mediators for HSC transdifferentiation. Recent studies have shown effect of microRNAs (miRNAs) on regulating TGF-β1-induced HSC activation during liver fibrosis. Here, we aimed to explore the roles of miR-144 and miR-200c in human liver fibrosis.Methods:Expression of TGF-β1 was detected in 42 fibrotic and 18 normal human liver tissues by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, and its correlation with α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was calculated. miR-144 and miR-200c expression level in fibrotic liver tissues were also detected by qRT-PCR. The correlation of TGF-β1 expression with miR-200c and miR-144 in the fibrotic liver was analyzed.Results:The results showed that TGF-β1 expression was much higher in fibrotic liver than that in normal liver tissues (PConclusion:All the results indicate that miR-144 can be a novel regulator of TGF-β1-induced HSC activation during liver fibrosis.
