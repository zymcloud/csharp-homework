Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world, and the prognosis for the HCC remains very poor. Although dys-regulation of CIZ1 (Cip1 interacting zinc finger protein 1) has been observed in various cancer types, its expression and functions in HCC remain unknown. In this study, the mRNA level of CIZ1 in the HCC tissues were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the effects of CIZ1 on the growth, migration, and metastasis of HCC cells were examined by crystal violet assay, Boyden chamber assay, and in vivo image system, respectively. In addition, the molecular mechanisms were investigated by luciferase assay. Upregulation of CIZ1 in the clinical HCC samples was observed. Forced expression of CIZ1 promoted the growth and migration of HCC cells, while knocking down the expression of CIZ1 inhibited the growth, migration, and metastasis of HCC cells. Molecular mechanism studies revealed that CIZ1 activated YAP/TAZ signaling in HCC cells. Taken together, our study demonstrated the oncogenic roles of CIZ1 in HCC cells and CIZ1 might be a promising therapeutic target for HCC.
