Aim:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were ineligible for resection or ablation therapies.Methods:Overall, 65 patients with 74 HCC (median tumor size, 16 mm) were enrolled. They were treated at the prescribed dose of 48 Gy in four fractions at the isocenter. Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scoring was used to classify 56 and nine patients into classes A and B, respectively. Local progression was defined as irradiated tumor growth on a dynamic computed tomography follow up. The median follow-up period was 26 months. Tumor responses were assessed according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Treatment-related toxicities were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.Results:The 2-year overall survival, progression-free survival and local control rates were 76.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.4-86.7%), 40.0% (95% CI, 27.6-52.3%) and 100% (95% CI, 100%), respectively. At 6-12 months after SBRT, grade 3 or higher toxicities was observed in 15 (23.1%) patients. The incidence of grade 3 or higher toxicities was higher in CTP class B than in class A (P = 0.0127).Conclusion:SBRT was effective and relatively safe for patients with small HCC who were ineligible for resection or ablation therapies.
