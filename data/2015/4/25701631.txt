Anti-angiogenic (AA) drugs are proposed as novel agents for targeted therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Loading of AA drugs into drug delivery systems for local delivery would reduce their side effects. The present study investigated the loading and the delivery of two AA drugs, sunitinib and bevacizumab, from one day-resorbable embolization microspheres (REM). REM were prepared with 10 or 20% of methacrylic acid (MA) as active drug binding monomer. Sterilized beads (100-300 Î¼m) were analyzed for cytotoxicity, AA loading and in vitro release. REM modified with MA were not cytotoxic and extemporaneous drug loading was significantly higher on REM containing 20% of MA. The drug release in saline buffer was sustained for several hours before complete REM degradation. MA content had low effect on drug release profile. When eluted from REM, sunitinib and bevacizumab reduced viability of tumoral VX2 cells, and proliferation of human endothelial cells, respectively. Deliverability of REM via microcatheter was not impaired by the loaded drugs. As conclusion, the loading values of sunitinib and bevacizumab on REM were close to those achieved for cytotoxic drugs onto non-degradable MS used in chemoembolization of HCC. Transcatheter delivery to liver tumors of anti-angiogenics could be achieved with REM.
