Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Surgery, percutaneous ablation and liver transplantation are the only curative treatment modalities for HCC. However, the majority of patients have unresectable disease at diagnosis. Therefore, effective treatment options for patients with advanced HCC are required. In advanced HCC, according to current international guidelines, sorafenib, a molecular targeted agent, is the standard treatment. However, alternative treatment modalities are required because of the low response rates and unsuitability of molecular agents in real practice. In various treatment modalities, mostly in Asia, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has been applied to advanced HCC with a view to increasing the therapeutic efficacy. HAIC provides direct drug delivery into the tumor feeding vessels and also minimizes systemic toxicities through a greater first-pass effect in the liver. However, the sample sizes of studies on HAIC have been small and large randomized trials are still lacking. In this article, we describe the treatment efficacy of HAIC for advanced stage HCC and discuss future therapeutic possibilities.
