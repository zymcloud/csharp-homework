Despite numerous investigations on metastasis, the determinants of metastatic processes remain unclear. We aimed to identify the metastasis-associated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Potent metastatic SK-hep-1 (SK) cells, designated 'SKM', were generated using Transwell assay followed by selection in a mouse model. Genes expressed differentially in SKM and SK cells were identified via microarray analyses. A small form of Neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (sNEDD4) was identified to be overexpressed in SKM cells, which was confirmed as a novel transcript using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In clinical specimens, sNEDD4 was significantly overexpressed in tumors and serves as a poor prognostic factor for male patients with HCC (P = 0.035). Upon subcutaneous introduction of sNEDD4-overexpressing SK cells into flanks of nude mice, tumors grew faster than those of the control group. Furthermore, sNEDD4-mediated promotion of tumor metastasis was demonstrated in the orthotopic mouse model. Overexpression of sNEDD4 increased the invasive ability of SK cells through upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and inhibited serum deprivation-induced apoptosis via upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1. In conclusion, sNEDD4 is a novel metastasis-associated gene, which prevents apoptosis under nutrient restriction conditions. The present findings clearly support the prognostic potential of sNEDD4 for HCC.
