Background:Liver transplantation is the optimal treatment for a selected group of patients with moderate to severe cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite the strict selection of candidates, post-transplant recurrence often occurs and markedly reduces the long-term survival of patients with HCC. The present review focuses on the current strategies on preventing the recurrence of HCC after liver transplantation.Data sources:Relevant articles were identified by extensive searching of PubMed using the keywords "hepatocellular carcinoma", "recurrence" and "liver transplantation" between January 1996 and January 2014. Additional papers were searched manually from the references in key articles.Results:The current theories of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation are: (i) the growth of pre-transplant occult metastases; (ii) the engraftment of circulating tumor cells released at the time of transplantation. Pre-transplant treatment aims to control local tumor by radiofrequency ablation, transarterial embolization and transarterial chemoembolization. The main objective during the operation is to prevent tumor cell dissemination. Post-transplant treatment includes systemic anticancer therapy, antiviral therapy, and most recently, immunotherapy. These strategies concentrate on the control of the tumor when the patients are waiting for transplant, to reduce the release of HCC cells during surgical procedures and to clear the occult HCC cells after transplantation.Conclusions:Much can be done to prevent HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. In future, effort is likely to be directed towards combining multidisciplinary approaches and various treatment modalities.
