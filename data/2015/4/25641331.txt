Background:Data on survival and safety of sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplant are still equivocal.Aim:We performed a meta-analysis of published studies, with the aim of estimating the 1-year rates of survival, analysing the variability in survival rates and, finally, identifying the factors associated with a longer survival.Methods:Data from 8 of the 17 selected studies were pooled, while the other 9 were excluded because survival rates were missing. All included studies were retrospective.Results:Overall, the 1-year survival ranged from 18% to 90%. Tumour progression was the main cause of death. The second cause was bleeding, reported only in patients undergoing m-Tor inhibitor therapy. The pooled estimate of 1-year survival was 63%. There was a significant heterogeneity among studies (P Conclusions:Additional data from multicentre prospective studies are required to clearly determine if sorafenib is a safe and acceptable treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplant. Nevertheless, its association with m-Tor inhibitors should be discouraged.
