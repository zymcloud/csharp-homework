With an increasing number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing liver transplantation (LT), tumor recurrence remains the main limiting factor for long-term survival. Although sorafenib is available for advanced HCC, there is still a lack of data on the use of sorafenib for treatment of recurrent HCC after LT. Here, we report on four cases of the use of sorafenib for treatment of recurrent HCC after LT. The median time of recurrence from LT was 4 months (range, 1-16 months). Two of the four evaluated patients showed stable disease, which was the best response and the duration of stabilization was 11 months and 5 months, respectively. One patient also experienced stable disease and remained in stable disease without sorafenib therapy for 29 months and the total duration of stabilization was 38 months. The remaining patient showed partial response but stopped treatment due to radiological tumor progression during treatment. Although all cases were high risk group for recurrence such as above Milan criteria, vascular invasion and tumor biology, clinical outcomes showed some good results. Therefore, sorafenib may be an acceptable treatment option for recurrent HCC after LT.
