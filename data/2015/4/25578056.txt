Purpose:In this study, we retrospectively investigated the prevalence of arterioportal (AP) shunts in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) and evaluated the changes in AP shunts after chemoembolization followed by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).Materials and methods:We analyzed 54 HCC patients with PVTT who were treated with chemoembolization followed by EBRT. EBRT was uniformly delivered at a total dose of 30 to 45 Gy (median, 35 Gy), with a daily dose of 2 to 4.5 Gy. Angiographic images of chemoembolization before and after radiation therapy (RT) were reviewed to investigate the AP shunt.Results:During the initial session of chemoembolization, 33 of 54 patients (61%) had an AP shunt. After EBRT, 32 out of 33 patients had an additional session of chemoembolization and were evaluated for a change in the AP shunt. The AP shunt decreased in 20 of 32 patients (63%) after chemoembolization followed by EBRT. The 1-year calculated overall survival (OS) rate for all patients was 52.6% and the 2-year OS was 36.4%. The median OS in all patients was 13 months. Patients with AP shunt showed poorer median OS than those without AP shunt, but there was no statistically significant difference (median, 12 months vs. 17 months).Conclusion:The AP shunt frequently occurs in HCC patients with PVTT. This study suggests that a poor prognosis is associated with an AP shunt. Chemoembolization followed by RT may produce a decrease in AP shunts.
