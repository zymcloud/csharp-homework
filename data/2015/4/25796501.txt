Angiogenic factor with G-patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) is a factor implicating in vascular differentiation and angiogenesis. Several lines of evidence indicate that aberrant expression of AGGF1 is associated with tumor initiation and progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and prognostic value of AGGF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as its relationship with clinicopathological factors and tumor angiogenesis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of AGGF1 in HCC and paracarcinomatous tissues collected from 70 patients. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CD34 expression levels were examined in the 70 HCC tissues. Prognostic significance of tumoral AGGF1 expression was determined. Notably, AGGF1 expression was significantly higher in HCC than in surrounding non-tumor tissues (65.7 vs. 25.7 %; P
