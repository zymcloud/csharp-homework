Background:Preoperative absolute C-reactive protein (CRP) has been shown to correlate with prognoses in various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The aim of this study was to investigate whether pretransplant CRP levels predict prognoses in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) for HCC. We retrospectively analyzed clinicopathological factors in 211 patients with available pretransplant serum CRP levels who underwent LT for HCC between January 2005 and April 2012.Results:By means of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a CRP level of >0.3 mg/dL was considered to be elevated. By multivariate analysis, the high CRP level, the maximal tumor size >5 cm, the presence of intrahepatic metastasis, and positive findings in pretransplant (18)fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) were related to tumor recurrence, whereas the high CRP level, the presence of intrahepatic metastasis, and positive findings in pretransplant (18)F-FDG PET/CT were related to poor overall survival. When subgroup analysis was conducted according to the Milan criteria, the high CRP level was an independent factor for predicting poor outcomes in patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria (P = .001 for recurrence-free survival and P = .010 for overall survival), and not for patients within the criteria.Conclusions:Pretransplant serum CRP levels can predict prognoses in patients undergoing LT for HCC, especially in patients with HCC exceeding the Milan criteria.
