Currently there is no predictor for survival after adjuvant sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have undergone curative resection. Thirty-eight patients who underwent curative resection of HCC received adjuvant sorafenib therapy between August 2009 and March 2012. Clinicopathological parameters including patient factors, tumor factors, liver background, and inflammatory factors (before surgery and dynamic changes after sorafenib therapy) were evaluated to identify predictors for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). The recurrence rate, mortality rate, and clinicopathological data were also compared. Increased NLR after sorafenib (HR = 3.199, 95 % CI 1.365-7.545, P = 0.008), increased GGT after sorafenib (HR = 3.204, 95 % CI 1.333-7.700, P = 0.009), and the presence of portal vein thrombosis (HR = 2.381, 95 % CI 1.064-5.328, P = 0.035) were risk factors related to RFS. By contrast, increased NLR after sorafenib was the only independent risk factor related to OS (HR = 4.647, 95 % CI 1.266-17.053, P = 0.021). Patients with increased NLR or increased GGT after sorafenib had a higher incidence of recurrence and death. Patients who had increased NLR tended to have higher preoperative levels of NLR and GGT. There were no differences in clinicopathological factors in patients with increased GGT and decreased GGT. In conclusion, increased NLR predicted a worse OS and RFS in patients with HCC who underwent curative resection with adjuvant sorafenib therapy. Increased GGT predicted a worse OS. NLR and GGT can be monitored dynamically before and after sorafenib therapy.
