Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) has been reported to be a tumor-suppressing gene in hepatocellular carcinoma. Association between hepatocellular carcinoma and RUNX3 promoter methylation has been investigated in studies with specific ethnic backgrounds and small sample sizes. In this study, a meta-analysis was adopted to combine the data from 11 studies of association between RUNX3 promoter methylation and hepatocellular carcinoma. Pooled odds ratio for RUNX3 promoter methylation status in hepatocellular carcinoma versus control liver tissue was 24.37 (95%CI: 12.14, 48.92), p
