Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is controlled by liver-enriched transcriptional factors, including forkhead box protein A (FOXA) members. Here, we found that FOXA members are directly and indirectly involved in HBV replication in human hepatic cells. HBV replication was elevated in HuH-7 treated with individual FOXA members-specific siRNA. Reciprocally, the downregulation of HBV replication was observed in FOXA-induced HuH-7. However, the mechanism of downregulation is different among FOXA members at the level of HBV RNA transcription, such as precore/pg RNA and 2.1 kb RNA. In addition, FOXA1 and FOXA2 suppressed nuclear hormone receptors, such as HNF4Î±, that are related to HBV replication.
