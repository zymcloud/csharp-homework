The aim of the meta-analysis described below was to investigate the correlation between serum levels of adiponectin (ADPN) and the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Relevant studies about serum ADPN levels and the pathogenesis of HCC were identified by searching electric databases and by manual search. The included studies were selected in strict accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Detailed criteria were described in "Materials and methods" section. Statistical analyses were conducted with the STATA 12.0 statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). A total of nine studies were incorporated into this meta-analysis after careful consideration, including 705 HCC patients and 1390 healthy controls. This meta-analysis demonstrated that the serum ADPN levels in HCC patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.97, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.02âˆ¼1.93, P
