Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor currently approved in Japan for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Interstitial pneumonia induced by sorafenib may have a fatal outcome, and therefore, has recently been the focus of many studies. The current report presents an autopsy case of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) that occurred in a 59-year-old male, who had been treated with sorafenib. The patient had been given sorafenib for six months and had exhibited no respiratory symptoms during this time. However, 19 days after sorafenib treatment was resumed, acute interstitial pneumonia developed. In previously reported cases, the first symptoms of pulmonary toxicity appeared following a limited treatment duration with sorafenib; this was in contrast to the patient in the current study, who developed the first symptoms after eight months. We therefore conclude that physicians must be aware of interstitial pneumonia as a potential pulmonary toxicity associated with sorafenib treatment when treatment with sorafenib is resumed, even after prolonged use. In addition, to best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a postmortem examination reported in patient with interstitial pneumonia induced by sorafenib treatment.
