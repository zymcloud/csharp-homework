Although tumor is one of the most frequently occurring diseases and a leading cause of death, nanotechnology, one of the frontier sciences, is exhibiting its great potential to tumor treatments. The aim of this study was to design a facile and environmentally-friendly method to prepare bovine serum albumin-conjugated heavy metal sulfides nano-materials, including Ag2S, PbS and CdS. Here, bovine serum albumin was introduced in order to direct the synthesis of nano-materials by using its template effect and supply more sites for further modification in future. The crystal structure and morphology were analyzed by XRD and TEM, respectively. Additionally, the antineoplastic activity of nano-materials was compared by cell viability analysis, optical and electron microscopy observation after exposure of the human hepatoma cell line. The results showed that the inhibition effect of heavy metal sulfides on tumor cells was in the order of nano-PbS > bulk CdS > nano-Ag2S > nano-CdS > bulk PbS > bulk Ag2S. It could be concluded that heavy metal sulfides had significantly negative impact on human hepatoma cells growth but it could not be obviously generalized that nano-particles were always more effective to kill tumor cells than bulk materials. The size and surface reactivity might be the important factors causing the difference.
