Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a poor prognosis because of a lack of effective treatment options. The objective of this study was to examine a new strategy for HCC treatment, namely the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitor (ABT-888) together with Temozolomide (TMZ) incorporated onto magnetic nanoparticles.Methods:Magnetic Fe3 O4 /Fe cores were encapsulated within a silica shell to facilitate the simultaneous incorporation of ABT-888 and TMZ. In vitro tests were performed with HepG2, Hep3B and PLC-PRF-5 liver tumoural cell lines and with WRL-68 liver non-tumoural cells.Results:The magnetic nanocarriers were loaded simultaneously with ABT-888 and TMZ. High stability and extended release were achieved in culture medium. Confocal microscopy images showed that drug-loaded particles were uptaken and accumulated into the cytoplasm of liver tumoural cells, inducing the following effects: G2/M cell cycle arrest (P Conclusions:These magnetic nanocompounds are able to incorporate both drugs simultaneously, enter the tumour cells and release them. ABT-888/TMZ/NPs decrease the transcription of key genes involved in tumour survival and induce apoptotic cell death in a more effective manner than is achieved by free drugs.
