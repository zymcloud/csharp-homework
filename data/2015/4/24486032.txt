Background:Resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is often hindered by their location close to the major hepatic vessels. So far, radiofrequency ablation for perivascular tumours was thought to be ineffective and unsafe due to either the heat sink effect or vascular thrombosis. The aim of this study was to examine whether RFA using multipolar probes could be a safe and effective option for CRLM adjacent to major hepatic vessels.Methods:Patients were treated with multipolar RFA during an open procedure using 3 simultaneously placed electrodes. In 52 consecutive patients with CRLM, 144 tumours were ablated with RFA. In 16 out of 52 (31%) patients, metastases were abutting major hepatic vessels. We examined whether perivascular location was a risk factor for local tumour progression. The relation between perivascular location and time to local tumour progression and recurrence free survival was assessed using cox-regression analysis.Results:All patients were followed for at least 3 years after RFA unless they deceased before this time. Local tumour progression following RFA occurred in 17 out of 144 tumours (12%), of which 4 out of 21 were perivascular tumours. Tumour size was the only risk factor for local tumour progression in this study. Proximity to large vessels was neither a risk factor for local local tumour progression, nor for time to local tumour progression or recurrence free survival.Discussion:This study indicates that patients with CRLM abutting any of the large hepatic vessels can be safe and effectively treated with RFA when using a multipolar system.
