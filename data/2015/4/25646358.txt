Objective:Sorafenib is a recommended treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The study is to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib plus cyproheptadine compared with sorafenib alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A retrospective cohort study reviewed all consecutive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma cases with Child-Pugh Class A disease starting sorafenib treatment at our hospital from August 2012 to March 2013. They were followed up until 31 December 2013. A total of 52 patients were enrolled: 32 patients in the combination (sorafenib-cyproheptadine) group and 20 patients in the control (sorafenib alone) group. The response to treatment, overall survival and progression-free survival were compared.Results:The median overall survival was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval: 6.8-15.1 months) in the combination group compared with 4.8 months (95% confidence interval: 3.1-6.6 months) in the control group (crude hazard ratio = 0.45, 95% confidence interval: 0.22-0.82). The median progression-free survival time was 7.5 months (95% confidence interval: 5.1-10.0 months) in the combination group compared with 1.7 months (95% confidence interval: 1.4-2.1 months) in the control group (crude hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.22-0.86). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that both overall survival and progression-free survival in the combination group were significantly longer than that in the control group. The multivariate model found patients in the combination group were 76% less likely to die (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.24, 95% confidence interval: 0.10-0.58) and 82% less likely to have progression (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.18, 95% confidence interval: 0.08-0.44) during the 17 months of follow-up.Conclusion:Cyproheptadine may significantly improve survival outcomes of sorafenib-treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
