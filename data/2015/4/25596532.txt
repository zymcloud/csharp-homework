Human hepatoma (HCC) has been reported to be strongly resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study the function of oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 8 (ORP8) in human hepatoma cells apoptosis was assessed. We found that ORP8 is down-regulated, whereas miR-143, which controls ORP8 expression, is up-regulated in clinical HCC tissues as compared with liver tissue from healthy subjects. ORP8 overexpression triggered apoptosis in primary HCC cells and cell lines, which coincided with a relocation of cytoplasmic Fas to the cell plasma membrane and FasL up-regulation. Co-culture of HepG2 cells or primary HCC cells with Jurkat T-cells or T-cells, respectively, provided further evidence that ORP8 increases HCC cell sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. ORP8-induced Fas translocation is p53-dependent, and FasL was induced upon ORP8 overexpression via the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Moreover, ORP8 overexpression and miR-143 inhibition markedly inhibited tumor growth in a HepG2 cell xenograft model. These results indicate that ORP8 induces HCC cell apoptosis through the Fas/FasL pathway. The role of ORP8 in Fas translocation to the plasma membrane and its down-regulation by miR-143 offer a putative mechanistic explanation for HCC resistance to apoptosis. ORP8 may be a potential target for HCC therapy.
