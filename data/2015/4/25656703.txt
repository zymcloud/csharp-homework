Aims:Cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for the development of postoperative pulmonary complications after major surgical procedures. The objective of this study was to investigate whether preoperative smoking has any impact on early morbidity after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Data of 425 consecutive patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for HCC was retrospectively reviewed. Smoking and drinking habits, biochemical tests, tumor status, operation data, and any postoperative complications occurring before discharge from the hospital were documented. The risk factors promoting postoperative complications were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods.Results:The overall morbidity rate was 40% (170 of 425). 166 patients were current smokers (39%). By multivariate analysis, liver cirrhosis (Risk Ratio (RR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-8.0), smoking status (RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.1), PY of smoking (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), preoperative platelet count (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-2.0) and major hepatectomy (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8) were independent risk factors of postoperative morbidity (all p Conclusions:Cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for the development of liver-related and infectious complications in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for HCC, especially in those with liver cirrhosis.
