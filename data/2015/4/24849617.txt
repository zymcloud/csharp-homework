Aim:Although perihepatic lymph node enlargement (PLNE) is frequently observed in chronic liver disease, little is known about PLNE in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We aimed to evaluate this issue.Methods:We originally enrolled a consecutive 502 patients with chronic HBV infection. Among them, 288 patients without history of interferon-based or nucleoside analog treatment and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were primarily analyzed.Results:PLNE was detected in 27 of 288 (9.4%) patients, which was fewer than that in chronic hepatitis C patients but more than that in subjects undertaking a general health examination as previously reported. The presence of PLNE was significantly associated with a higher probability of having an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) platelet ratio index of more than 1.5 (11.1% vs 1.5%, P = 0.01), a higher AST level (38.0 vs 26.8 U/L, P = 0.001), a higher alanine aminotransferase level (50.1 vs 28.0 U/L, P Conclusion:PLNE was associated with liver fibrosis and hepatocellular injury, but was negatively associated with HCC in chronic HBV infection.
