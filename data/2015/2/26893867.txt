Pretreatment anemia has been reported to be associated with survival in several solid tumor types. In terms of survival, only limited data on the hemoglobin (HGB) level in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been published and no data on mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) level in HCC is available. The present study sought to examine the role of HGB and MCH levels in predicting long-term survival of patients with HCC who undergo resection. A retrospective study of 399 consecutive patients (1987-1994) who underwent hepatic resection for HCC in Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Centre was performed. Serum HGB and MCH levels were examined preoperatively, and their prognostic capabilities were evaluated by Cox's proportional hazard model. Among the whole cohort, the HGB level appeared to be positively correlated with the MCH level (P
