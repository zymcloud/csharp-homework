Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide and the leading indication for liver transplantation in the adult United States population. Although the incidence of chronic HCV infection is declining, the number of deaths is projected to rise over the next decade. Hence, the major reason for treating chronic HCV infection is to mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection but also to alleviate patient symptoms and to prevent person-to-person transmission. Successful eradication or virological cure is possible and a reduction in liver-related outcomes has been demonstrated in patients with advanced liver disease who achieve this desirable endpoint.â€“
