Clear cell hepatocellular carcinoma (CCHCC) is an uncommon morphologic variant of HCC and rarely invades into the main bile ducts. Here we describe a case of CCHCC that was diagnosed by bile duct brushing cytology. Liquid-based preparation of brushing specimen showed clusters of atypical epithelial cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, round nuclei, and occasional intranuclear inclusions. The tumor cells were positive for HepPar-1 and arginase 1, suggestive of their hepatic origin. The overall morphologic and immunophenotypic features were consistent with CCHCC. The cytological diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic examination of the resected tumor.
