A 54-year-old woman with a known history of multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma was treated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using yttrium-90 ((90)Y) microspheres, despite disease relapses after surgical resection and transarterial chemoembolization. She developed a dramatic clinical, radiological and metabolic response after 9 weeks. This case provides visual illustration of the potential roles of SIRT in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
