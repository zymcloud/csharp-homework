A case of rib and pulmonary metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) successfully treated with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) followed by surgery is reported. A 66-year-old male with a history of HCC treated previously with hepatectomy was admitted to our hospital for examination of a chest wall tumor. Before the admission, TAE targeting the chest wall tumor was performed. TAE followed by surgery for postresection metastases of HCC was performed and provided an excellent result with long-term survival. The combination of TAE plus salvage surgery could be an option in select patients with limited disease.
