We present a case of adrenal rest tumor of the liver in which differential diagnosis from lipid rich-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was challenging. The patient was a 50-year-old woman in whom a 3-cm tumorous mass was discovered in segment 7 of the liver during computed tomography evaluation of a uterine leiomyoma. The preoperative diagnosis was HCC, and subsegmental liver resection was performed. The tumor appeared as a well-demarcated golden yellow nodule consisting of clear or partially eosinophilic cells arranged in a trabecular pattern. The initial impression of this lesion was that of clear cell type or lipid-rich type HCC because it stained positive for Hep Par1, but negative for arginase-1 and positive for CD56 which is one of the neuroendocrine markers. The lesion also stained positive for SF-1 and 3Î²-HSD, both of which are markers of adrenocortical tissue. The final diagnosis was hepatic adrenal rest tumor. Hepatic adrenal rest tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of segment 7 tumor. A diagnostic algorithm that includes immunohistochemical staining for CD56 and arginase-1 is to rule out the possibility of lipid-rich HCC.
