The antiviral therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus(HCV) infection has changed from interferon(IFN) monotherapy to dual therapy with IFN plus ribavirin(RBV), moreover pegylated IFN(Peg-IFN) plus RBV. The sustained virologic response(SVR), defined as HCV RNA negativiation at 24 weeks after the treatment, were obtained 50% among the patients with genotype 1 (48 weeks treatment) and 80% among those with genotype 2 (24 weeks treatment) in Peg-IFN plus RBV combination therapy. The baseline host factors such as age, the degree of liver fibrosis progression and a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene, the viral factors such as HCV genotype, mutant virus at HCV core region and interferon sensitivity determining region, the treatment factors such as drug adherence and treatment duration have been reported to be associated with SVR. The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence was significantly lower in SVR patients than non-SVR patients. Especially, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels decreased through therapy, and the patients with
