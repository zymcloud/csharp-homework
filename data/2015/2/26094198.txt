Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing adenocarcinoma, histologically mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a distinct entity known as hepatoid adenocarcinoma (HAC). Reported cases of HAC arising from the esophagus are extremely rare. Due to common liver metastasis and elevated AFP levels in patients with esophageal HAC, differentiation of HAC with liver metastasis from HCC could be challenging. We describe a case of esophageal HAC that presented with a liver mass showing hepatoid features and elevated serum AFP levels. Initial presentation was suspicious for HCC. Upon further diagnostic work-up, the patient was diagnosed with esophageal HAC with liver metastasis. The distinction between these two entities is particularly important because HAC is more aggressive, and its therapeutic options are very limited.
