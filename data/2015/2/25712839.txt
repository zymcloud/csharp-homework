Background:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective first-line therapy for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Acute renal injury may be induced after transarterial chemoembolization because of iodinated radiocontrast medium, but its incidence, risk factors, and prognosis remain unclear.Patients and methods:This prospective study enrolled 166 HCC patients with a total of 316 TACE treatments. The incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) were examined.Results:The incidence of post-TACE AKI was 21.84% (69/316) according to Barrett and Parfrey criteria, whereas 7.59% (24/316) according to acute kidney injury network (AKIN) criteria. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that serum total bilirubin (TB) (>13.5 Î¼mol/L; odds ratio [OR]: 1.871 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.044-3.352; P = 0.035) and hemoglobin (HGB) level (55 years; OR: 3.456, 95% CI: 1.107-10.790; P = 0.033), post-TACE AKI history (OR: 7.108, 95% CI: 1.387-36.434, P = 0.019), and serum aminotransferase level (>55 U/L; OR: 4.420, 95% CI: 1.792-10.906; P = 0.001) were associated with the development of AKI after TACE procedure in accordance to AKIN criteria. Total hospitalization cost was significantly higher (P = 0.034) in the patients with AKI after TACE procedure according to Barrett and Parfrey criteria. A post-TACE AKI diagnosis was associated with mortality in any definition used (P = 0.034 and P = 0.001 for Barrett and Parfrey and AKIN criteria, respectively).Conclusion:The present study showed that the incidence of post-TACE AKI was high in HCC patients (i.e., 7.59-21.84%) depending on criteria used. HGB (13.5), and aminotransferase level (>55 U/L), age (>55 years) and post-TACE AKI history may be predictors of post-TACE AKI in HCC patients. The development of post-TACE AKI was associated with the risk of renal replacement treatment, prolonged renal insufficiency, or mortality according to AKIN criteria.
