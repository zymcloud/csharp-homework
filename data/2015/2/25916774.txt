Objective:To explore the expression of TPX2 and its significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and examine the relationship between TPX2 and clinicopathological characteristics of HCC.Methods:Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining were used to compare the expression of TPX2 in tumor and adjacent non-tumoral tissues.Results:The TPX2 mRNA expression was higher in tumor tissues than that in non-tumoral counterparts (30/50) (P Conclusion:An over-expression of TPX2 may be risk factor of metastasis and recurrence after curative resection so that it is a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.
