Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, leading to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related deaths. Universal hepatitis B vaccination is the most cost-effective way to eradicate HBV infection with the remarkable reduction of chronic carriage, neonatal fulminant hepatitis and childhood HCC. The introduction of highly effective antiviral agents, including lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and pegylated interferons further improve short-, medium- and long-term outcomes of chronic HBV infection, such as ALT normalization, HBV DNA suppression, HBeAg seroconversion, HBsAg seroclearance, fibrosis regression, reduction of cirrhosis, HCC, liver-related deaths and the need for liver transplantation. Above all, sustained and profound viral suppression is the key to improve the clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis B.
