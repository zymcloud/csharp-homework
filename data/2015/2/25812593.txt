We conducted a retrospective study to clarify the clinical significance of metastasectomy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Of 83 mRCC patients who were treated at our hospital between 2005 and 2010, 19 patients who underwent metastasectomy during the treatment course were the subjects of the present study. By the purpose and timing of metastasectomy, we classified the 19 patients into three groups : (1) patients who immediately underwent metastasectomy at diagnosis of metastasis (primary group), (2) patients who underwent resection of clinically problematic metastatic lesions for the relief of their symptoms (palliative group), and (3) patients who underwent complete resection of all metastatic lesions after sufficient systemic therapies (consolidation group). In the primary group (n=5), four patients had lung metastasis and one had metastases to limbs and the adrenal gland. Overall survival at 3 years was 100%. In the palliative group (n=4), 3 patients underwent resection of brain metastasis and one underwent resection of skin metastasis. The symptoms associated with metastasis clearly improved. In the consolidation group (n=10), the metastasized organ was the lung in 5 patients, pancreas in 4, and liver in one. Preoperative systemic therapy included sunitinib or sorafenib in 5 patients, interferon-Î± in 4, and S-1 in one. After metastasectomy, systemic therapies were discontinued in 9 patients, 4 of whom did not experience RCC recurrence, with a median follow-up of 35 months. Overall survival at 3 years was 60%. Metastasectomy would be a good treatment option in patients with mRCC.
