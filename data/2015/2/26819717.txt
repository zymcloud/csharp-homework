Background:It is well known that molecular-targeted drugs, of which sorafenib (NexavarÂ®) is one, differ from previous anticancer drugs and cause various unusual adverse drug reactions. Treatment with sorafenib causes adverse drug reactions such as hand-foot skin reactions, hypertension, and diarrhea. Physicians spend a lot of time monitoring adverse drug reactions to sorafenib in outpatients. As such, at Okayama University Hospital, pharmacists and nurses have organized a medical supportive team to help physicians in this regard. However, the effectiveness of interventions for sorafenib-treated outpatients by this medical supportive team remains unclear. The purpose of this study was thus to clarify the effectiveness of interventions for sorafenib-treated outpatients by this medical supportive team.Methods:We retrospectively studied 70 outpatients treated with sorafenib between May 2009 and December 2012 at Okayama University Hospital. These outpatients were classified into two groups, an intervention group (31 outpatients) and a non-intervention group (39 outpatients). We compared the duration of sorafenib treatment between these groups.Results:The duration of treatment with sorafenib was significantly longer in the intervention group than in the non-intervention group. No outpatients in the intervention group discontinued sorafenib due to adverse drug reactions such as hand-foot skin reactions or diarrhea.Conclusion:The duration of sorafenib treatment was significantly longer in the intervention group than in the non-intervention group. Our findings suggest that interventions by the medical supportive team consisting of health care professionals were effective in preventing the discontinuation of sorafenib.
