Nanoparticle (NP)-based contrast agents that enable high resolution anatomic T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer the prospect of improving differential diagnosis of liver tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we investigated the possibility of employing novel non-toxic human serum albumin nanoparticles conjugated with Gd-DTPA and rhodamine 123 (Gd-Rho-HSA-NPs) for the detection of HCC by T1-weighted MRI. In addition, the influence of surface coating of the NPs with poloxamine 908, which alters the absorptive behavior of NPs and changes their distribution between the liver and tumor was examined. MRI of transgenic mice with endogenously formed HCCs following intravenous injection of Gd-Rho-HSA-NPs revealed a strong negative contrast of the tumors. Contrasting of the HCCs by NP-enhanced MRI required less Gd as compared to gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced MRI, which currently provides the most sensitive detection of HCC in patients. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the Gd-Rho-HSA-NPs were localized to macrophages, which were - similar to HCC in patients - fewer in number in HCC as compared to the liver tissue, which is in agreement with the negative contrasting of HCC in Gd-Rho-HSA-NP-enhanced MRI. Poloxamine-coated NPs showed lower accumulation in the tumor macrophages and caused a longer lasting enhancement of the MRI signal. These data indicate that Gd-Rho-HSA-NPs enable sensitive detection of HCC by T1-weighted MRI in mice with endogenous HCC through their uptake by macrophages. Poloxamine coating of the NPs delayed the tumor localization of the NPs.
