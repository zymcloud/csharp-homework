Human cystic echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by the larval cestode Echinococcus granulosus. Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common types of cancer in the whole world including China. A few reports about cystic echinococcosis concurrent with hepatocellular carcinoma were noted until now. In addition, the association between these two diseases is still not well defined as the case with cystic echinococcosis with hepatocellular carcinoma is rare. In this case report, we presented a female herdsman living in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region, China, which may raise the possibility that echinococcosis may play a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
