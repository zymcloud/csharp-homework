Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key in carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of lncRNA GAS5 in HCC tissues and to define the role of growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) in the regulation of hepatoma cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization were performed to investigate the expression of GAS5 in tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues from 50 patients with HCC. Low expression of GAS5 was significantly correlated with differentiation (P
