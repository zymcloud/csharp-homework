Oysters are widely consumed seafood, but their shells impose a serious environmental problem. To extend the utilization of oyster shell waste, we investigated the biological role of oyster shell extract. In this study, we verified that the ethanol extract of oyster shell (EOS) contains taurine and betaine, the major components of oyster body. EOS downregulated transcription of Sptlc1 and Sptlc2 mRNA, the subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). Suppression of SPT subunits reduced sphinganine and sphingomyelin by inhibiting de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. Inhibition of sphingomyelin biosynthesis resulted in downregulation of lipogenic gene expression such as ACC, FAS, SCD1, and DGAT2. Consistent with inhibition of lipogenesis, cellular triglyceride levels were diminished by EOS, but cholesterol levels were not altered. Taken together, these results suggest that EOS has a lipid-lowering effect and could be applied as either a therapeutic or preventive measure for metabolic dysfunction.
