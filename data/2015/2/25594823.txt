Here we demonstrate a novel and facile strategy of highly luminescent water-soluble Zn-doped AgIn5S8 (ZAIS) nanocrystals and ZAIS/ZnS core/shell structures, which were based on hydrothermal reaction between the acetate salts of the corresponding metals and sulfide precursor in the presence of l-cysteine at 110 Â°C in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The photoluminescent (PL) emission wavelength can be conveniently tuned from 560 to 650 nm by tailoring the stoichiometric ratio of [Ag]/[Zn]. The as prepared nanocrystals were characterized systematically and exhibit long PL lifetimes more than 100 ns. The influence of experimental conditions, including concentration of l-cysteine and reaction temperature, was investigated. In addition, we performed a coating procedure with the ZnS shell outside the ZAIS core and showed excellent PL quantum yields up to 35%. The in vitro experiment exhibited quite low cytotoxicity and marvelous biocompatibility, revealing their promising prospect in bioscience. Furthermore, the obtained ZAIS/ZnS nanocompounds (NCs) were covalently conjugated to alpha-fetoprotein antibodies and targeted fluorescent imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma cells was realized.
