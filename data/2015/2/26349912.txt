MicroRNAs are predicted to play fundamental roles in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MiR-375 is frequently downregulated in HCC and acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting multiple oncogenes. The objective of this study was to evaluate miR-375 expression and its relevance to the prognosis of HCC. MiR-375 expression was measured in cancerous tissues using qRT-PCR and dichotomized based on a median cutoff. The association between miR-375 expression and clinicopathological parameters and prognosis was subsequently determined. Expression levels of miR-375 were detected in a cohort of 38 HCC patients who underwent curative surgery. No significant correlations were observed between miR-375 expression and clinicopathological parameters, such as gender, age, performance status, preoperative serum AFP level, histological grade, HBV-DNA copy number, ascites, cirrhosis, tumor size, number of tumor nodules, and macrovascular invasion. However, miR-375 expression differs across CLIP scores significantly (p
