Sorafenib, a potent multikinase inhibitor, lead to a significant improvement in progression free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Though sorafenib has proven its efficacy in advanced stage HCC, there are limited reports on the role of sorafenib allowing for curative treatment by down-staging. We herein report a case of advanced HCC with vascular invasion, which showed treatment response by sorafenib therapy as to allow for radiofrequency ablation as curative treatment. The patient was followed-up for 6 mo without recurrence with continued sorafenib therapy.
Complete remission; Down-staging; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Radiofrequency ablation; Sorafenib.
