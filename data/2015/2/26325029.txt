De novo hepatitis B infection in patients receiving liver transplants from hepatitis B core antibody-positive donors is well known, but the effective prevention strategy has not been well established. In our hospital, recipients receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin monotherapy if they are hepatitis B surface antigen negative at the time of transplant and are receiving a liver from a hepatitis B core antibody-positive donor. Since August 2006, we have had 4 patients who were na√Øve to hepatitis B virus and received a hepatitis B core antibody-positive graft. Two patients died of other causes, and 2 patients, who had liver transplant in October 2006 and October 2009, developed de novo hepatitis B. Both patients were tested annually for serum hepatitis B surface antigen as part of routine visit. Tests were negative; however, both patients recently became hepatitis B surface antigen positive. Other laboratory results, including liver function test, were unremarkable, except HBsAb titer was undetectable even though hepatitis B immunoglobulin monotherapy had been administrated 2 months previously in both patients. The patients had hepatitis B virus DNA levels of 3.07E+08 copies/mL and 1.51E+08 copies/mL. We suggest that additional prophylactic therapies above hepatitis B immunoglobulin monotherapy are needed for these recipients.
