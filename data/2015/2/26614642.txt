Background:Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA)-IgM complex has been described as a promising tool to identify patients with progressive liver disease at higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in retrospective studies.Aim:To assess the clinical value of this biomarker in patients with cirrhosis in a prospective study.Methods:Patients with overt cirrhosis were prospectively evaluated at 6-month intervals for HCC development and decompensation with clinical examination, liver ultrasound, α-fetoprotein measurement. SCCA-IgM was measured in serum by immunoenzymatic assay. Median follow-up duration was 52 months (range 12-68 months).Results:70 patients (26% male; mean age 56±10 years) were enrolled. The main aetiological factors were alcohol (44%) and hepatitis C (34%). Baseline values of SCCA-IgM were significantly higher in patients who developed HCC. Positivity of the biomarker at baseline was associated with a significantly shorter HCC-free survival, while α-fetoprotein (cut off >20 ng/ml) was not significant. SCCA-IgM positivity and hepatitis C were significant prognostic factors for HCC development. The biomarker was not associated with the development of clinical complications of cirrhosis.Conclusion:This prospective study demonstrates that in patients with cirrhosis SCCA-IgM is associated with HCC development and may be useful for clinical management of cirrhotic patients at higher risk of HCC development.
