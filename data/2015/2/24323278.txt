In some tumors, psychosocial interventions may enhance health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients. The effects of psychological variables on HRQOL in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients have been rarely assessed. The aim of this work is to evaluate the psychopathological profile of HCC and cirrhotic patients and its effect on HRQOL. Twenty-four HCC patients (median age 71, Child A 21, Child B 3), 22 cirrhotic patients (median age 68, Child A 20, Child B 2) and 20 control subjects were included in this study. Each subject completes four questionnaires: medical outcomes study short form-36 (SF-36, HRQOL evaluation); Hamilton-D (quantitative evaluation of depression; positive ≥8); symptom check list 90-revised (SCL 90-R, general psychopathological profile; nine domains, each positive >1); Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS 20) (positive ≥60). SCL 90-R: cirrhotic patients differ from HCC subjects for somatization (SOM) (M ± SD 1.09 ± 0.6 vs 0.65 ± 0.6; p = 0.01) and anxiety (M ± SD 0.85 ± 0.46 vs 0.58 ± 0.38; p = 0.01) items. TAS 20: positive in 50% of HCC patients, in 54% of cirrhotic patients (p = n.s.) and in none of controls. Hamilton-D: higher scores in cirrhotic patients than in the HCC group (86 vs 46%; p = 0.005). SF-36: each item, except bodily pain, is lower in both group of patients in comparison with controls. Pearson correlation analysis shows negative correlations on HRQOL of depression, SOM and anxiety both in cirrhotic and HCC subjects, also of obsessive-compulsive and hostility items in HCC. This is the first report on the psychopathological profile of HCC patients: the results open questions on the role of psychological interventions that may improve HRQOL of patients before treatment and in the follow-up.
