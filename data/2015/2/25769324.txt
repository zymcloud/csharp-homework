Objective:To exlpore the eff ect of depsides salts from Salvia miltiorrhiza on human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 xenograft tumors and the possible mechanisms.Methods:A total of 36 nude mice were divided into 6 groups: A model group, a negative control group, a positive control group, and 3 treatment groups at low, middle or high dose (n=6). The tumor model of nude mice was given depsides salts at a dose of 10, 20 or 50 mg/kg every 3 day for 16 days. Then samples of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice were collected. The morphological changes of tumor samples were observed by HE staining and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the tumor antigen Ki67 was detected by immunohistochemical method.Results:The tumor growth was inhibited by all doses of depsides salts. The morphology of tumors was shrinkage, broken and irregularly arranged compared with the tumors in the model group and the negative control group. Morphological changes were more obvious in tumors with treatment at high dose. Expression of VEGF and Ki67 in treatment groups and the positive control group were lower than that in the model group and the negative control group, with a significant difference (PConclusion:Depsides salts from Salvia miltiorrhiza can inhibit the growth of human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 tumor in nude mice, which is related to the inhibition of Ki67 and VEGF.
