Objectives:To investigate the relationship between the improved stability of an anticancer drug-lipiodol emulsion and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile for transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The stability of four doxorubicin- or idarubicin-lipiodol emulsions was evaluated over 7 days. PK and clinical data were recorded after TACE with the most stable emulsion in eight unresectable HCC patients, after institutional review board approval.Results:The most stable emulsion was the one that combined idarubicin and lipiodol (1:2 v:v). At 7 days, the percentages of aqueous, persisting emulsion and oily phases were 50-0-50, 33-0-67, 31-39-30, and 10-90-0 for the doxorubicin-lipiodol (1:1 v:v), doxorubicin-lipiodol (1:2 v:v), idarubicin-lipiodol (1:1 v:v), and the idarubicin-lipiodol (1:2 v:v) emulsion, respectively. After TACE, mean idarubicin Cmax and AUC0-24h were 12.5 ± 9.4 ng/mL and 52 ± 16 ng/mL*h. Within 24 h after injection, 40% of the idarubicin was in the liver, either in vessels, tumours, or hepatocytes. During the 2 months after TACE, no clinical grade >3 adverse events occurred. One complete response, five partial responses, one stabilisation, and one progression were observed at 2 months.Conclusion:This study showed a promising and favourable PK and safety profile for the idarubicin-lipiodol (1:2 v:v) emulsion for TACE.Key points:• Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) regimens that improve survival in hepatocellular carcinoma are needed. • Improved emulsion stability for TACE resulted in a favourable pharmacokinetic profile. • Preliminary safety and efficacy data for the idarubicin-lipiodol emulsion for TACE were encouraging.
