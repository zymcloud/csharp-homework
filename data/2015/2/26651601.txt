A novel lipid micro-bubble (MB) loaded with docetaxel (DOC-MB) was investigated in a previous study. However, its anti-tumor effects and mechanism of action in combination with low-frequency ultrasound (LFUS) in vivo are still unclear. DOC-MBs containing 5.0 mg of DOC were prepared by lyophilization with modification via ultrasonic emulsification. Then, the effects of DOC-MBs combined with LFUS on tumor growth, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression and cell apoptosis, as well as local DOC delivery, were investigated in H22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-bearing mice. Compared with the previously prepared DOC-MBs (1.6 mg of DOC loaded), the encapsulation efficiency (81.2% ± 3.89%) and concentration ([7.94 ± 0.04] × 10(9) bubbles/mL) of the DOC-MBs containing 5.0 mg of DOC were higher, but the bubble size (1.368 ± 0.004 μm) was smaller. After treatment with the DOC-MBs and LFUS, the H22 HCC growth inhibition rate was significantly increased, PCNA expression in tumor tissue was significantly inhibited and local release of DOC was induced. In conclusion, new DOC-MBs containing 5.0 mg of DOC were successfully prepared with a high encapsulation efficiency and superior bubble size and concentration, and their combination with LFUS significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of DOC in H22 HCC-bearing mice by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and increasing local drug delivery.
