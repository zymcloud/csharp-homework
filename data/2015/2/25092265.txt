Background and aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis could be made with one typical imaging study in a cirrhotic liver by the guideline of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in 2010. Patients with hepatitis B who may not have fully developed cirrhosis could be applied. We aim to retrospectively analyze and validate the diagnostic power of the 2010 guideline in an HCC endemic area (Taiwan).Methods:From January 2006 to December 2010, a total of 648 patients with liver tumor post-surgical resection were reviewed. The fibrotic scores were verified by METAVIR score 4. Among the 648 patients, 569 (87.8%) were HCC patients. Hepatitis B accounts for 54.5%, hepatitis C 21.9%, hepatitis B + C 2.8%, and non-hepatitis B or C 20.7% of patients. Two hundred eighty-eight of 648 (44%) patients were with cirrhotic liver.Results:The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy of the 2010 AASLD guideline f are 99.1%, 36.7%, 91.9%, 85.3%, and 91.5%, respectively. Cirrhotic liver exhibited a higher PPV (P 0.05).Conclusions:Similar sensitivity of HCC diagnosis existed between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic liver, and across different fibrotic stages. But cirrhotic liver exhibited a higher PPV. Hepatitis B or C has no decisive effect in HCC diagnosis.
