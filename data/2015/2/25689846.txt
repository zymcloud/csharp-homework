Aims:This retrospective study was carried out to compare the outcomes between elderly (â‰¥70 years of age) and nonelderly patients (Methods:88 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of advanced HCC were enrolled in this study. Of these, 24 elderly patients were matched with 48 nonelderly patients at a 1:2 ratio using propensity score matching to minimize selection bias. The related adverse events and survival benefits were compared between the two groups.Results:Sorafenib combined with TACE was equally well tolerated in both age groups, and grade 3 or 4 adverse events were similarly observed in 54.2% of elderly and 50.0% of nonelderly patients (P = 0.739). There were no significant differences in survival time between the elderly and nonelderly patients (P = 0.876). Significant prognostic factors for overall survival as identified by multivariate analysis were the Child-Pugh score and portal vein invasion.Conclusions:Sorafenib combined with TACE may be well tolerated and effective in elderly patients with advanced HCC. Age alone is not a parameter for the treatment of advanced HCC patients.
