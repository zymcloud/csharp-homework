Background:In order to preserve functional liver parenchyma, extended central hepatectomy (segments 4, 5, 7 and 8 resection) was proposed for the management of centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma invading the right and middle hepatic veins, reconstructing segment 6 outflow in the absence of the thick inferior right hepatic vein. The present study was to describe our surgical techniques of extended central hepatectomy.Methods:Between 2008 and 2012, 5 patients with centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma invading or in the vicinity of the right and middle hepatic veins underwent extended central hepatectomy. The thick inferior right hepatic vein was preserved during dissection. Gore-Tex graft was used for segment 6 outflow reconstruction in the absence of the thick inferior right hepatic vein.Results:The mean future remnant liver volume for segments 2 and 3 was 28% versus 45% on segment 6 preservation. The mean tumor diameter was 7.4 cm. The thick inferior right hepatic vein was found in 1 patient. Outflow reconstruction from segment 6 was performed in 4 patients. Postoperative complications included bile leakage (1 patient), pleural effusion (2) and liver failure (1). The rate of graft patency was 75%. There was no perioperative mortality.Conclusion:Extended central hepatectomy is a safe alternative for extended hepatic resection in selected patients attempting to preserve the functional liver parenchyma.
