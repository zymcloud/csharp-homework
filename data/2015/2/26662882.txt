Background:Localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with adequate liver function is typically treated with resection. Non-surgical modalities including trans-arterial embolization have emerged as options for intermediate/advanced HCC. Hypothesizing that non-surgical techniques have expanded to localized disease, we examined treatment patterns, factors associated with surgical therapy, and the impact of modality on survival.Methods:Non-cirrhotic, localized HCC patients were identified from the National Cancer Data Base (2003-2011). Trends were examined using average annual percent change (AAPC). Regression models were developed to determine factors associated with treatment and assess the association of modality with survival.Results:Of 10,187 patients (median tumor size: 3.7 cm), 6,387 (62.7%) underwent surgery and 3,800 (37.3%) non-surgical therapy. Surgery declined from 61.6% to 44.5% (AAPC, -3.7%; 95%CI, -4.9% to -2.6%, P Conclusions:Non-surgical therapy has become as common as surgery in the treatment of non-cirrhotic, localized HCC. Randomized studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of treatments for this disease.
