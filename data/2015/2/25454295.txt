The burden of hepatocellular carcinoma is rising and anticipated to escalate and while the best chance for long term cure remains transplantation, however the shortage of available organs remains a limitation. Liver directed therapy can serve the role of bridge/downstaging to transplant or as palliative care. Despite an improved overall survival among patients with HCC, due to advancements in surgical techniques, liver directed and systemic therapy, the 5 year overall survival remains low at 18% high-lightening the need for novel therapies. Surveillance for HCC is key to detect disease at an early stage to increase the chances for a potentially curative option.
