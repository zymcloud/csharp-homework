Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been used to treat unresectable massive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lots of embolic agents have been applied in embolization because of it can decrease patient discomfort and side-effects.Aim:The aim was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of TACE with lipiodol and gelatin sponge.Materials and methods:A total of 109 patients with massive HCC (the size of tumor >10 cm and unresectable) from January 2011 to August 2014 in our institution was divided into group A and group B based on the different embolitic agents. Before and about 1-month after each case of TACE, clinical and biological data such as tumor size, Child-Pugh stage, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), complications, were recorded at the same time.Results:In group A, the diameter of the tumor reduced from 12.57 ± 1.26 cm to 9.04 ± 0.89 cm. No patient was complete response (CR), partial response (PR) 36, stable disease (SD) 7 and PD 6; in group B, the diameter of tumor decreased from 12.08 ± 1.42 cm to 8.43 ± 1.05 cm, CR 0, but PR 27, SD 18 and PD 15. RR in group A was significantly higher than in group B (P Conclusions:TACE with lipiodol and gelatin sponge is a highly effective for massive HCC.
