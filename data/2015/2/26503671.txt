Introduction:The present study evaluated the threshold dose for hepatic parenchymal changes on gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) images after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Twenty patients with available data of follow-up MR images acquired 2-4 months after completion of SBRT were selected among the registered patients. SBRT was performed using multiple coplanar and non-coplanar beams with energies of 6 or 15 MV. All patients were treated with doses of 45 Gy administered in three fractions over 3 consecutive days. For image registration between planning computed tomography (CT) and MR images, landmark-based rigid body registration was performed using MIM software.Results:Seventeen patients were included in the analysis. The median discrepancies between planning CT and MR images in the left-right, anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions were 1.38 mm, 1.24 mm and 1.72 mm, respectively. The median D50 value for the defect in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR images after SBRT was 19.8 Gy (range, 14.2-28.7 Gy), with R(2) values ranging from 0.76 to 0.99.Conclusions:The threshold dose for parenchymal changes in the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR images performed 2-4 months after 45 Gy of SBRT in three fractions was approximately 20 Gy. Our results provide the basis for further research on the functional loss of liver parenchyma after SBRT.
