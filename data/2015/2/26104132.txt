Background & aims:Previous studies predicted the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mainly based on tumour-related factors, whereas the impacts of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related factors are usually ignored. The objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the prognostic role of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) on post-operative survival and recurrence of HCC.Methods:A retrospective analysis of 3388 HBsAg positive (HBV-related) HCC patients treated by curative resection was performed. Multivariate analysis of independent prognostic factors was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression model.Results:HBcAb positivity was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) of HBV-related patients (P Conclusion:Positive HBcAb may represent a more invasive phenotype of HBV-related HCC, and is associated with a higher risk of early intrahepatic recurrence and poorer RFS of HBV-related patients after curative resection.
