Obatoclax is an indole-pyrrole compound that induces cancer cell apoptosis through targeting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family. Previously, we developed a series of obatoclax derivatives and studied their STAT3 inhibition-dependent activity against cancer cell lines. The obatoclax analog, prodigiosin, has been reported to mediate DNA cleavage in cancer cells by coordinating with copper complexes. To gain an understanding of copper-obatoclax complex activity, we applied obatoclax derivatives to examine their copper-mediated nuclease activity as a means to establish a basis for structure activity relationship. Replacement of the indole ring of obatoclax with furanyl, thiophenyl or Boc-indolyl rings reduced the DNA cleavage ability. The same effect was achieved through the replacement of the obatoclax pyrrolyl ring with thiazolidinedione and thioacetal. Among the compounds tested, we demonstrated that the complex of obatoclax or compound 7 with copper exhibited potent DNA strand scission which correlated with HCC cell growth inhibition.
