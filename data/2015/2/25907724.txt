Objective:To understand the incidence and death patterns of viral hepatitis in China and provide evidence for the prevention and control of viral hepatitis.Methods:The analysis was conducted on the incidence and death data of viral hepatitis published by National Health and Family Planning Commission during 2004-2013.Results:The incidences of viral hepatitis in Guizhou,Yunnan, Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai,Ningxia and Xinjiang provinces (autonomous region) were high. The major forms were hepatitis B (80.63/100 000) and hepatitis C (9.68/100 000), accounting for 80.90% and 9.25% of the total reported viral hepatitis cases respectively. The incidences of hepatitis A and unidentified hepatitis decreased and the incidence of hepatitis B, C and E increased during this period. During the 10 years, 10 008 deaths caused by viral hepatitis were reported (1 001 deaths per year). The reported deaths caused by hepatitis A, hepatitis E and unidentified hepatitis decreased during this period. The reported deaths caused by hepatitis B were in a downward trend, but the constituent in total cases remained high. The reported deaths caused by hepatitis C were in an upward trend.Conclusion:During 2004-2013, the overall incidence of viral hepatitis showed no downward trend in China. The incidence of hepatitis B remained high, and the incidence of hepatitis C showed an obvious upward trend. The overall death rate and case fatality rate of viral hepatitis showed a downward trend, but hepatitis B remained the main cause of viral hepatitis related death, and the death caused by hepatitis C was in increase. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are the major targets in the prevention and treatment of viral hepatitis in China, and the 7 western provinces (autonomous region) with high incidences are the key regions of the prevention and control.
