Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell cancer (RCC) are malignancies, which are chemotherapy resistant and fatal at the advanced stages. Previously developed tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used in the treatment of advanced stage disease. In the present case study, a patient using sunitinib for stage IV RCC presented with HCC following 2 years of treatment. A patient who exhibited Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis initially, exhibited a marked improvement of hepatocellular parenchyma findings following treatment with sunitinib. Sunitinib is suggested to have preventive effects on the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in vitro, via an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor and anti-platelet-derived growth factor mechanism. However, no clinical supportive study has been performed until now. Improvement of liver functions may be explained in this manner. Therefore, investigations are required with different doses of sunitinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors in order to evaluate the efficacy on treatment of cirrhosis progression.
