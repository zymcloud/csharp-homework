Chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection can cause persistent hepatic inflammation and cirrhosis, which may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CHB is considered the dominant cause of HCC in Asia because of the endemic status of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. A persistently high viral load, long duration of infection, and cirrhosis are the major risk factors for developing HCC in CHB patients. Antiviral therapies using interferon (IFN) and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) could suppress viral replication, reduce liver injury, and preserve liver function, thereby lowering the risk of developing HCC. Recurrence of HCC after therapy is closely related to high levels of HBV DNA at the initial stage. Western studies have found that persistent antiviral treatments on CHB patients could not only reduce their risk of developing HCC, but also prevent or delay HCC recurrence after liver transplantation, hepatic resection, or radiation therapies. This review will focus on Asian clinical studies, where there is a higher prevalence of CHB and HCC. The outcomes of antiviral therapies on HCC in these Asian studies were compared to those in the Western studies.
