Cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), play an important role in the liver. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between common polymorphisms in potential functional promoters of cytokine genes and liver damage markers among enrollees of a large Japanese cohort study. Subjects included 3257 Japanese individuals (1608 men and 1649 women, aged 35-69 years). Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of five cytokine genes, IL1B (T-31C), IL6 (C-634G), IL8 (T-251A), IL10 (T-819C), tumor necrosis factor-A (TNFA) (T-1031C), and TNFA (C-857T), were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. Information regarding alcohol intake, smoking habits, height, and weight was collected by a self-administered questionnaire. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured during a routine health check-up. Of the six SNPs genotyped, an IL6 polymorphism (rs1800796, C-634G) was most strongly associated with a liver damage marker, AST. Mean serum AST was significantly different among the three genotypes (mean ± SD, 22.7 ± 7.3 IU/L for CC, 22.8 ± 7.7 IU/L for CG, and 24.3 ± 8.6 IU/L for GG, p=0.011 by analysis of variance). The differences remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders by general linear models. The variations in mean serum AST and ALT levels were marked especially among men. Thus, the functional polymorphism IL6 C-634G may affect serum AST and ALT levels, possibly through different IL-6 production.
