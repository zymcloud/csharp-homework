Background & aims:Prevention of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) following liver transplant (LT) with pre-LT antiviral therapy is limited by poor tolerability and efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NS3/4A protease inhibitor (PI)-based triple therapy in patients awaiting LT.Methods:Consecutive patients treated with triple therapy pre-LT from two centers were prospectively enrolled in an observational cohort. Overall 12 week sustained virological response (SVR12) was the primary outcome. Pre- and post-LT (pTVR) virological response rates and safety were secondary outcomes.Results:Twenty-nine patients (mean age 57.9, 79% male, 66% prior non-responders) were treated with telaprevir (93%) or boceprevir-based (7%) triple therapy for a median (range) of 27 (3-50) weeks, including a pegylated-interferon and ribavirin lead-in in 18%. Median (range) MELD at treatment was 8 (6-16), 39% had hepatocellular carcinoma and all patients were Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A (62%) or B (38%). Twelve patients underwent LT, 75% with undetectable viral load. The overall SVR12 rate was 52%, including pre-LT SVR12 of 41% in patients who completed treatment and follow-up on the wait list and pTVR12 of 67% among transplanted patients. The pTVR12 rate was 89% among those patients with undetectable viral load at LT. Serious adverse events occurred in nine (31%) patients including one (3%) on-treatment death and eight (28%) hospitalizations.Conclusions:Overall SVR12 and pTVR12 rates are high among patients treated with PI-based triple therapy while awaiting LT, even in this difficult to treat population. However, caution is needed as early discontinuation and serious adverse events are common.
