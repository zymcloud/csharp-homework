Cancer cell growth is complicated progression which is regulated and controlled by multiple factors including cell cycle, migration and apoptosis. In present study, we report that TADs, a novel derivative of taspine, has an essential role in resisting hepatocellular carcinoma growth (including arrest cell cycle) and migration, and inducing cell apoptosis. Our findings demonstrated that the TADs showed good inhibition on the hepatoma cell growth and migration, and good action on apoptosis induction. Using genome-wide microarray analysis, we found the down-regulated growth and apoptosis factors, and selected down-regulated genes were confirmed by Western blot. Knockdown of a checkpoint c-Myc by siRNA significantly attenuated tumor inhibition and apoptosis effects of TADs. Moreover, our results indicated TADs could simultaneously increase cyclin D1 protein levels and decrease amount of cyclin E, cyclin B1 and cdc2 of the cycle proteins, and also TADs reduced Bcl-2 expression, and upregulated Bad, Bak and Bax activities. In conclusion, these results illustrated that TADs is a key factor in growth and apoptosis signaling inhibitor, has potential in cancer therapy.
