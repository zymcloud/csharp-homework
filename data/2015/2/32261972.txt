Liver diseases, particularly viral hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, are common in clinical practice with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Many substances for diagnostic imaging and therapy of liver diseases may have either severe adverse effects or insufficient effectiveness in vivo because of their nonspecific uptake. Therefore, by targeting the delivery of drugs into the liver or specific liver cells, drug efficiency may be largely improved. This review summarizes the up-to-date research progress focusing on nanoparticles targeting the liver for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Targeting strategies, mechanisms of enhanced effects, and clinical applications of nanoparticles are discussed specifically. We believe that new targeting nanotechnology such as nanoprobes for multi-modality imaging and multifunctional nanoparticles would facilitate significant advancements in this active research area in the near future.
