Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been shown to induce apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. However, the molecular mechanism of As2O3-induced apoptosis in the hepatocellular carcinoma cells remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of As2O3 exposure on the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and examined the underlying mechanism of cell death. As2O3 induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and caused a massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was able to prevent As2O3-induced cell death, implying an involvement of ROS in the induction of As2O3-triggered apoptosis. Furthermore, As2O3 initiated apoptosis by triggering of the mitochondria apoptotic pathway as indicated by inhibited Bcl-2 expression, a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), release of cytochrome c and activation of the caspase cascade. However, these As2O3-induced events can be prevented by NAC. Taken together, these findings suggest that the As2O3 induced apoptosis through a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway and activation of caspases.
