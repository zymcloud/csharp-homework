Objectives:Li Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome due to a germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. It results in multiple primary neoplasms in children and adults. A common question when faced with a Li Fraumeni patient who develops multiple primary cancers and/or recurrences is what is the proper treatment? Data suggests that ionizing radiation exposure increases the incidence of second malignancies in the Li Fraumeni population. Therefore, how much surgery can a cancer patient tolerate and still derive benefit from it?Methods:We describe a representative case of a 54-year-old female with Li Fraumeni syndrome with an enlarging adrenocortical hepatic metastasis, a new primary ampullary cancer, and an extensive surgical history.Results:We performed a simultaneous pancreaticoduodenectomy and repeat partial hepatectomy.Conclusions:We propose that surgery is underutilized in metastatic solid organ familial cancers in general, and argue that an aggressive surgical approach should be considered in a multidisciplinary manner for patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome and recurrent tumors. However, because of the rarity of this familial cancer there is a paucity of evidence to support this approach, therefore a review of the literature is presented.
