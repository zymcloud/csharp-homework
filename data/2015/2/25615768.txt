OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to determine the overall survival rates in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who undergo treatment with drug-eluting bead (DEB) therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review of the clinical HCC database of a single institution was undertaken for patients treated between September 2008 and December 2011. Demographic information, laboratory and imaging findings, procedural details, and outcomes after treatment were obtained. The primary outcome was overall survival, which was stratified by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, Child-Pugh class, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, serum bilirubin level, and ethnicity. Multiple secondary independent variables were also measured. RESULTS. Of 239 consecutive patients treated during the prescribed time frame, 43 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thirty patients met the criteria for BCLC stage C, and 13 met the criteria for BCLC stage D based largely on ECOG score. Eight patients had venous invasion or portal venous thrombosis, and four had limited extrahepatic metastases. Eight patients had Child-Pugh class C liver disease but remained candidates for liver transplant based on the Milan criteria. The median overall survival was 596 days; 23 patients are still alive, 12 of whom underwent liver transplant. The only independent variables affecting survival were serum bilirubin value of 2.0 mg/dL or greater (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.96; 95% CI, 1.46-10.7; p = 0.007) and Child-Pugh class B or C disease (HR = 3.33; 95% CI, 1.07-10.34; p = 0.037). CONCLUSION. The use of DEBs for TACE therapy is safe and effective in carefully selected patients with advanced HCC.
