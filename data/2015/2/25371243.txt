A subset of liver transplantation (LT) recipients who undergo transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will develop postoperative recurrence. There has yet to be a thorough investigation of donor factors influencing recurrence. Data regarding adult, primary LT recipients with HCC (n = 5002) who underwent transplantation between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2010 were extracted from the United Network for Organ Sharing database, and the cumulative incidence of post-LT recurrence by donor factors was subsequently estimated. Among the HCC LT recipients, 324 (6.5%) developed recurrence. An analysis of donor characteristics demonstrated a higher cumulative incidence of recurrence within 4 years of transplantation among recipients with donors â‰¥ 60 years old (11.8% versus 7.3% with donors
