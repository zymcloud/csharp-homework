The adaptive immune system, including type1 helper T cells (Th1 cells), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and dendritic cells (DCs), plays an important role in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV). On the other hand, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) suppress the immune reaction in HBV and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Excessive activation of immune suppressive cells could contribute to the persistent infection of HBV and the progression of HCC. The frequency and/or function of Tregs could affect the natural course in chronic hepatitis B patients and the treatment response. In addition to the suppressive function of MDSCs, MDSCs could affect the induction and function of Tregs. Therefore, we should understand in detail the mechanism by which Tregs and MDSCs are induced to control HBV persistent infection and HBV-related HCC. Immune suppressive cells, including Tregs and MDSCs, contribute to the difficulty in inducing an effective immune response for HBV persistent infection and HBV-related HCC. In this review, we focus on the Tregs and MDSCs that could be potential targets for immune therapy of chronic hepatitis B and HBV-related HCC.
