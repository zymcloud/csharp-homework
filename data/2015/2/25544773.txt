MicroRNAs function as oncomiRs and tumor suppressors in diverse cancers. However, the utility of specific microRNAs in predicting the clinical benefit of chemotherapy has not been well-established. Here, we investigated the correlation between microRNA-21 expression and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin (HAIC) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that HCC patients with low microRNA-21 levels in tumors tended to have a longer time to recurrence and disease-free survival. We demonstrated that microRNA-21 suppression in combination with 5-fluorouracil and pirarubicin treatment inhibited tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft mice models. Mechanistically, the AP-1 and microRNA-21-mediated axis was verified to be a therapeutic target of cytotoxic drugs and deregulation of this axis led to an enhanced cell growth in HCC. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that microRNA-21 is a chemotherapy responsive microRNA and can serve as a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients undergoing HAIC. Targeting microRNA-21 enhances the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, thereby suggesting that microRNA-21 suppression in combination with HAIC may be a novel approach for HCC treatment.
