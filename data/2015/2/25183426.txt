Background & aims:Liver stiffness (LS) measurement using transient elastography and the FibroTest (FT) are alternatives to liver biopsy (LB) in assessing liver fibrosis. We investigated the prognostic role of the combined use of LS and FT in predicting liver-related events (LREs) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:Consecutive patients with CHB who underwent LB, along with LS and FT on the same day were recruited. LRE was defined as hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver-related death.Results:A total of 151 patients (86 male) were analyzed. During follow-up (median 59.9 months), overall 18 (11.9%) patients experienced LREs. The areas under receiver-operating characteristic curves of LS, FT, LS + FT and LS Ã— FT in predicting LRE were 0.701, 0.668, 0.702 and 0.741 respectively. After adjusting for age and histological fibrosis staging, significant variables in univariate analysis (both P Conclusion:The combined use of LS and FT significantly predicted forthcoming LRE development, but with only a slight additional benefit compared to LS or FT alone.
