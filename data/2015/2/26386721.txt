Metastasis has been one of the major reasons for cancer-related mortality, with multiple genes and pathways being involved in this complex process. Given the molecular variations underlying metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown; in our previous work, we found copying number of protocadherin-17 (PCDH-17) was significantly deleted in HCC tissues that occurred to metastasize compared with that in the primary HCC without metastasis. Therefore, we hypothesized that PCDH-17 may suppress the metastasis of HCC. There has been, however, no relevant literature available regarding PCDH-17 in HCC. In the present study, we have immunohistochemically detected and clinicopathologically analyzed the expression of PCDH-17 in vivo in clinical tissues; besides, we have explored the role of PCDH-17 ex vivo using a panel of HCC cell lines. It was discovered that PCDH-17 expression was clinically correlated with overall prognosis as well as metastasis in vivo and that PCDH-17 inhibited metastasis via EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling pathway ex vivo. Together, our results obtained both in vivo and ex vivo suggested that activation of EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling pathway through PCDH-17 promotes metastasis in HCC.
