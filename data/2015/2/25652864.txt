Objective:To investigate the relationship between the level of Bcl-2 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients, and to detect the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells after Bcl-2 is down-regulated with siRNA.Methods:The level of Bcl-2 in 68 HCC tissues was detected by reverse transcription PCR, SP immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The 68 HCC tissues were divided into two groups based on the level of Bcl-2. The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of the patients were compared between groups. The proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells was evaluated by MTT assay after Bcl-2 was inhibited with siRNA.Results:Compared with corresponding noncancerous liver tissues, the level of Bcl-2 was significantly elevated in HCC tissues. The level of Bcl-2 was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics, and the patient with higher expression level of Bcl-2 had relatively poorer prognosis. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression by siRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells.Conclusion:The level of Bcl-2 is abnormally elevated in HCC tissues and can serve as a predictor of the prognosis of patients with HCC. The down-regulated of Bcl-2 in SMMC-7721 cells can inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.
