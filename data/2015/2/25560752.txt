Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) such as hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver, and their downstream effect cancer affect more than a billion of people around the world both symptomatically and asymptomatically. The major limitation for early detection and suitable medical management of CLDs and liver cancer is either the absent of symptoms or their similar manifestations as other diseases. This detection impediment has led to a steady increase in the number of people suffering from CLDs with an ultimate outcome of liver failure and undergoing transplantation. A better understanding of CLD pathogenesis has helped us to develop novel therapies for patients who are at greatest risk for CLD progression to the most serious disease cancer. With the discovery of aberrant molecular pathways in CLDs, it is now possible to delineate a road map for selecting targeted therapies for CLDs. Technological advances in imaging as well as the availability of several stable, sensitive, early, noninvasive biomarkers for distinguishing different stages of CLDs and cancer have greatly facilitated both drug target identification and real-time monitoring of response to therapy. Biomarkers are the most useful in clinical practice for liver diseases like hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is associated with secretion of various tumor-related proteins or nucleotides in peripheral circulation. The need for the identification of CLD biomarkers remains high. This article reviews the etiologies of CLDs, the results of recent clinical trials of treatments for CLDs, and development of noninvasive methodologies for detecting CLDs and monitoring their progression toward HCC.
