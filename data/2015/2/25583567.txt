Background and purpose:To establish a model to predict survival after SBRT for oligo-metastases in patients considered ineligible for surgical resection (SR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Material and methods:Overall survival (OS) rates were estimated in 321 patients treated for 587 metastases with SBRT over 13years. Patients were treated for a variety of metastasis types with colorectal cancer (CRC) being the most frequent (n=201).Results:With a median follow-up time of 5.0years, the median OS was 2.4years (95% CI 2.3-2.7) and the survival rates were 80%, 39%, 23% and 12% at 1, 3, 5 and 7.5years after SBRT, respectively. WHO performance status (PS) (0-1) (HR 0.49; p<0.001), solitary metastasis (HR 0.75; p=0.049), metastasis ⩽30mm (HR 0.53; p<0.001), metachronous metastases (HR 0.71; p=0.02) and pre-SBRT chemotherapy (HR 0.59; p<0.001) were independently related to favorable OS. Median OS rates were 7.5, 2.8, 2.5, 1.7 and 0.8years with 0, 1, 2, 3, ⩾4 unfavorable prognostic factors, respectively. The treatment-related morbidity was moderate. However, three deaths were possibly treatment-related.Conclusion:Prognostic factors may predict long-term survival in patients with oligo-metastases treated with SBRT.
