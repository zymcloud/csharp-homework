A high glucose (Glu) milieu promotes generation of reactive oxygen species, which may not only cause cellular damage, but also modulate phase II enzymes that are responsible for the metabolism of flavonoids. Thus, we examined the effect of a high Glu milieu on quercetin (Q) metabolism in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were grown for 3 days in Glu ranging from 5.5 to 50 mmol/L and/or cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) ranging from 0 to 25 Î¼mol/L. Subsequently, the capacity of HepG2 cells to metabolize Q was assessed for up to 16 h. Q metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Four major Q metabolites were observed in the culture medium and inside the HepG2 cells. Three of these metabolites appear to be sulfated forms of Q or methylated Q, and one was a methylated Q. These metabolites and Q itself were reduced or tended to be reduced in cells grown in a high Glu compared to a normal Glu medium. Addition of C3G or superoxide dismutase plus catalase did not prevent or enhance reduction of Q metabolites. In vitro, a hyperglycemic milieu decreases the production of the principal Q metabolites in HepG2 cells, mediated through mechanisms independent of oxidative stress.
