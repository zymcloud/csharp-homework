The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Apelin-13 on autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and the underlying mechanism of the effect. The HepG2 cells were treated with Apelin-13 at a final concentration of 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 µmol/l for 24 h. Cells were also treated with 10 µmol/l PD98059 for 24 h. The expression of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and Beclin1 proteins were detected by western blot analysis. Beclin1 mRNA expression was also detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Autophagy was observed using fluorescence microscopy subsequent to monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. Following treatment with the various concentrations of Apelin-13, the expression of the ERK1/2 protein remained at a similar level, whereas the expression of pERK1/2 increased in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the control group, the increase was significant (P
