Aim:To evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:From March 2009 to April 2015, we treated 132 small HCC patients with SBRT. Eligibility criteria included longest tumor diameter ≤5.0 cm; Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Class A or B; unfeasible, difficult or refusal to undergo other surgery or percutaneous ablative therapies; and tumor recurrence after other local treatment. The dose of 42-46 Gy in 3-5 fractions and 28-30 Gy in 1 fraction was prescribed.Results:Of the treated patients, 114 were classified as CTP A and 18 as CTP B. Median tumor size was range 1.1-5.0 cm. The local control rate at 1 years was 90.9%. OS at 1, 3, and 5 years was 94.1%, 73.5%, and 64.3%, respectively. PFS at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82.7%, 58.3%, and 36.4%, respectively. Hepatic toxicity grade ≥3 was observed in 11 patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that CTP B was associated with worse OS (P Conclusions:SBRT is a promising alternative treatment for patients with primary or recurrent small HCC who are unsuitable for surgical resection or local ablative therapy.
