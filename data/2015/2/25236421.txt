Background:To elucidate the benefits of successful antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patientsMethods:A total of 463 CHC patients who underwent pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin therapy were classified as sustained virological response (SVR) or non-SVR based on response to antiviral therapy. We investigated disease progression to cirrhosis in non-cirrhotic patients, development of cirrhosis-related complications such as ascites, variceal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:Three hundred patients achieved SVR, and 163 were classified into the non-SVR group. The overall SVR rates were 64.8 %, and multivariate analysis showed that younger age, non-cirrhosis, HCV genotype 2 or 3, lower HCV RNA level (Conclusions:SVR resulted in significantly more favorable long-term outcomes, such as lower risk of progression to cirrhosis and HCC occurrence compared with non-SVR.
