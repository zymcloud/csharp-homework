Background:Chronic hepatitis is a major public health problem. Hepatitis B virus is the primary cause, and Hepatitis B and C together are responsible for 60% of cirrhosis and 80% of hepatocellular carcinomas. This study measured the prevalence of HBsAg among Senegalese military to develop an appropriate strategy to prevent cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among Senegalese military aged 25 to 60 years. A sample of 1224 participants was selected following a two-level-stratification. The mark of surface HBs antigen using chemiluminescence concerned 1195 participants. The presence of HBsAg was analyzed according to age, marital status, alcohol consumption and glomerular filtration rate. Epi-info6fr and R software were used, respectively, for data capture and analyses. A Chi-square test was performed to compare proportions considering a significance level of 5% and a confidence interval of 95%.Results:The average age was 39.8 Â± 9.2 years. Participants in the age groups of 25-34 years, 45-60 years and 35-44 years were respectively 30.7%, 34.4% and 34.9% of the sample. Married persons represented 82.6% of participants and 17.08% were single. Most participants were educated (99%), and 56% had reached at least secondary school level. Alcohol consumption was at 11.5%. The HBsAg prevalence rate was 10.8% [9.1% to 12.7%] with a significant difference between age groups (P Conclusions:The high prevalence of HBsAg in the military requires the implementation of an effective prevention and care program to reduce the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and contribute to reducing the burden of communicable diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV/AIDS, and non-communicable diseases.
