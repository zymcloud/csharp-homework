Several members of protocadherins have been found involved in human carcinogenesis, but little is known about PCDH20 in HCC. Here in this study, using quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay, we demonstrated the downregulation of PCDH20 expression in 6 of 7 HCC cell lines tested. Similarly, PCDH20 expression in primary HCC tissues was also significantly downregulated in comparison with that in either disease-free normal liver tissues or the adjacent nontumour liver tissues (P
