Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of the sulfated form of 6-gingerol, a major pharmacologically active component of ginger, in plasma samples of normal human subjects who were administered 6-gingerol. The current study was designed to systematically identify the major human cytosolic sulfotransferase enzyme(s) capable of mediating the sulfation of 6-gingerol. Of the 13 known human cytosolic sulfotransferases examined, six (SULT1A1, SULT1A2, SULT1A3, SULT1B1, SULT1C4, SULT1E1) displayed significant sulfating activity toward 6-gingerol. Kinetic parameters of SULT1A1, SULT1A3, SULT1C4, and SULT1E1 that showed stronger 6-gingerol-sulfating activity were determined. Of the four human organ samples tested, small intestine and liver cytosols displayed considerably higher 6-gingerol-sulfating activity than those of the lung and kidney. Moreover, sulfation of 6-gingerol was shown to occur in HepG2 human hepatoma cells and Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells under the metabolic setting. Collectively, these results provided useful information relevant to the metabolism of 6-gingerol through sulfation both in vitro and in vivo.
