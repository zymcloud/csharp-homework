The objective of this study was to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of radiofrequency-assisted liver resection (RFLR) and conventional clamp-crushing liver resection (CCLR) and to evaluate the safety and efficiency of RFLR. Between January 2008 and December 2012, a total of 597 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent curative hepatectomy were identified. A total of 272 patients underwent RFLR, and 325 patients received CCLR. The short- and long-term outcomes were compared. The patients in the RFLR and CCLR groups showed similar baseline characteristics. The RFLR group showed less intraoperative blood loss (485.5 vs. 763.2 mL, p = 0.003), a lower transfusion requirement rate (19.1 vs. 31.7%, p ≤ 0.01), shorter surgery duration (211 vs. 296 min, p ≤ 0.01) and a lower vascular inflow occlusion rate (25.7 vs. 33.8%, p = 0.032). No significant postoperative changes in bilirubin or liver enzymes were observed in the two groups. The degree of postoperative complications and morbidity did not significantly differ between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates (73.8%, 58.5%, and 55.7% vs. 80.8%, 65.8%, and 56.2%, respectively) or disease-free rates (51.9%, 47.2%, and 46.0% vs. 54.5%, 44.9%, and 38.5%, respectively) between the RFLR and CCLR groups. These results suggested RFLR was a safe and efficient method for patients with HCC. RFLR was associated with decreased blood loss, fewer blood transfusions, shorter surgery times and less vascular inflow occlusion application. The RFLR group did not show increased liver injury or postoperative morbidity or mortality.
