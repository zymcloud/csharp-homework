Background & aims:Cytokines are key molecules implicated in the defense against virus infection. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is well known to block the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, the molecular mechanism and the downstream effector molecules remain largely unknown.Methods:In this study, we investigated the antiviral effect and mechanism of p22-FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory protein) by ectopic expression in vitro and in vivo. In addition, to provide the biological relevance of our study, we examined that the p22-FLIP is involved in TNF-α-mediated suppression of HBV in primary human hepatocytes.Results:We found that p22-FLIP, a newly discovered c-FLIP cleavage product, inhibited HBV replication at the transcriptional level in both hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes, and that c-FLIP conversion to p22-FLIP was stimulated by the TNF-α/NF-κB pathway. p22-FLIP inhibited HBV replication through the upregulation of HNF3β but downregulation of HNF4α, thus inhibiting both HBV enhancer elements. Finally, p22-FLIP potently inhibited HBV DNA replication in a mouse model of HBV replication.Conclusions:Taken together, these findings suggest that the anti-apoptotic p22-FLIP serves a novel function of inhibiting HBV transcription, and mediates the antiviral effect of TNF-α against HBV replication.
