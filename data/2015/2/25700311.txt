The optimal treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension (PHT) is still controversial. The objective of this study is to compare HCC patients with PHT treated with hepatic resection to those treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or thermal ablation. A series of 167 cirrhotic patients with HCC undergoing hepatic resection or TACE/ablation from 2001 to 2008 were retrospectively analyzed. Cirrhotic patients with HCC were divided into 3 groups: hepatic resection in HCC patients with PHT (PHT-R group, n = 58), without PHT (NPHT-R group, n = 67), and TACE or thermal ablation in HCC patients with PHT (PHT-O group, n = 42). The short-term and long-term outcomes of liver function, operative mortality and morbidity, and survival rate were compared.Baseline characteristics were similar among the 3 groups, except for patients in the PHT-R group had larger spleen (16.0 vs 11.4 cm, P = 0.001) and smaller tumor size (4.8 vs 7.1 cm, P = 0.001) in comparison with those in the NPHT-R group. The PHT-R group had better liver function compared with those in the PHT-O group (patients had Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B liver function: 5.2% vs 31%, P = 0.001). There was no significant difference of operative mortality and morbidity in all groups. The 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates were 80.4%, 55.6%, and 28.1% in the PHT-R group; 79.1%, 64.2%, and 39.8% in the NPHT-R group (vs PHT-R, P = 0.313); and 60.7%, 24.4%, and 7.3% in the PHT-O group (vs PHT-R, P
