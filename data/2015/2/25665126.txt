Preoperative transcatheter arterial embolization for hypervascular bone tumors is now widely accepted as a safe and effective procedure for reducing intraoperative blood loss and surgical morbidity. However, few studies have reported the use of preoperative transcatheter arterial embolization for nonspine bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of preoperative embolization on blood loss and clinical outcomes in surgery for nonspine bone metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma. Seventy-five patients with metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma to the pelvis and extremities were reviewed retrospectively. The study population consisted of 62 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 64.6 years (range, 40.0-80.1). The average follow-up period was 8.2 months (range, 0.3-66.1). Twenty-two patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization for preoperative devascularization (group A), and 53 patients underwent operative treatment only (group B). The proportion of pelvis metastases was significantly higher (P
