Aims/hypothesis:Type 2 diabetes is closely associated with pathological lipid accumulation in the liver, which is suggested to actively contribute to the development of insulin resistance. We recently identified serine/threonine protein kinase 25 (STK25) as a regulator of liver steatosis, whole-body glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in a mouse model system. The aim of this study was to assess the role of STK25 in the control of lipid metabolism in human liver.Methods:Intracellular fat deposition, lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity were studied in immortalised human hepatocytes (IHHs) and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells in which STK25 was overexpressed or knocked down by small interfering RNA. The association between STK25 mRNA expression in human liver biopsies and hepatic fat content was analysed.Results:Overexpression of STK25 in IHH and HepG2 cells enhanced lipid deposition by suppressing β-oxidation and triacylglycerol (TAG) secretion, while increasing lipid synthesis. Conversely, knockdown of STK25 attenuated lipid accumulation by stimulating β-oxidation and TAG secretion, while inhibiting lipid synthesis. Furthermore, TAG hydrolase activity was repressed in hepatocytes overexpressing STK25 and reciprocally increased in cells with STK25 knockdown. Insulin sensitivity was reduced in STK25-overexpressing cells and enhanced in STK25-deficient hepatocytes. We also found a statistically significant positive correlation between STK25 mRNA expression in human liver biopsies and hepatic fat content.Conclusions/interpretation:Our data suggest that STK25 regulates lipid partitioning in human liver cells by controlling TAG synthesis as well as lipolytic activity and thereby NEFA release from lipid droplets for β-oxidation and TAG secretion. Our findings highlight STK25 as a potential drug target for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.
