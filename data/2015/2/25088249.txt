Introduction:We investigated the therapeutic effects of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumour thrombosis (PVTT).Methods:Sixty-three HCC patients with PVTT were divided into two groups. Group A (30 patients) was treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy followed by 2-3 series of TACE, while group B (33 patients) was only treated with TACE.Results:The 1- and 2-year survival rates of group A were 62.40% and 20.81%, respectively, with a mean survival time of 13.0 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates of group B were 56.49% and 18.83%, respectively, with a mean survival time of 9.0 months. There were significant differences between the two groups (log-rank chi-square value = 3.950, P = 0.047).Conclusion:Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy combined with TACE can significantly improve clinical outcomes in patients with HCC and PVTT compared with TACE alone.
