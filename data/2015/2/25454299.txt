Different imaging modalities including ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging may be used in the liver depending on the clinical situation. The ability of dedicated contrast-enhanced liver MR imaging or CT to definitively characterize lesions as benign is crucial in avoiding unnecessary biopsy. Liver imaging surveillance in patients with cirrhosis may allow for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma at an earlier stage, and therefore may improve outcome. This article reviews the different imaging modalities used to evaluate the liver and focal benign and malignant hepatic lesions, and the basic surveillance strategy for patients at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma.
