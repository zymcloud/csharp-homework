Background:Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infection are the 2 most important risk factors for the development of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to assess the importance of the type of viral infection in evaluation of HCC recurrence risk after liver transplantation (LT).Material and methods:This retrospective study was based on 130 HCC patients undergoing LT. Patients were subdivided by HBV or HCV infection only or HBV and HCV co-infection (HBV-HCV). The primary outcome measure was recurrence-free survival (RFS) 5 years after transplantation.Results:The 5-year RFS did not differ significantly according to HBV infection, HCV infection, or HBV-HCV co-infection in the entire study cohort (p=0.902) or among patients who fulfilled (p=0.454) or did not fulfill (p=0.999) the Milan criteria. Neither HCV (p=0.869) nor HBV (p=0.968) infection significantly affected 5-year RFS following adjustment for covariates. Higher lesion number (p=0.004), increased alpha-fetoprotein (p=0.017), microvascular invasion (p=0.004), and female donor sex (p=0.025) were significant risk factors for poor RFS in HBV patients; older recipient age (p=0.010) and increased total tumor volume (p=0.028) were significant risk factors in HCV patients.Conclusions:Although the viral infection type does not affect post-LT outcomes in HCC patients, the influence of other risk factors is markedly different in HBV- and HCV-related HCC.
