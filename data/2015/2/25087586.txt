Background and aim:The clinical utility of our designed primary culture method in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was investigated.Methods:Specimens obtained from ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of 108 hepatocellular carcinoma patients were cultured. The associations of the cellular proliferative speeds with cancer invasiveness and 1-year survivals were analyzed.Results:Successful cultures were achieved in 105 patients (97.2%). Ten hepatocellular carcinoma and nine cancer-associated fibroblast cell lines were established. The cells obtained from patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging ≥ IIIB upon entering the study had higher proportion of rapidly proliferative cancer cells than those from patients with staging ≤ IIIA (P Conclusion:Our method can provide cells from individual patient for researches and predict outcomes in patients receiving non-curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
