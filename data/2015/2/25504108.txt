Metastasis is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. The master genes that govern organ-selective metastasis remain elusive. We compared the expression levels of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in the human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, SBC-5 and SBC-3, by flow cytometric analysis and found that CXCR4 was expressed at markedly higher levels in the SBC-5 cells which can produce multiple organ metastasis, particularly bone metastasis compared to the SBC-3 cells. Stromal-derived-factor-1 (SDF-1)-CXCR4 has been shown to regulate cell migration and metastasis in a various types of cancer; however, the roles of SDF-1-CXCR4 in the organ-selective metastasis of SCLC in vivo remain to be elucidated. Thus, in this study, we constructed a phenotype of SBC-5 cells in which CXCR4 was knocked out using the intrakine strategy and found that the downregulation of CXCR4 inhibited cell migration and invasion, but did not affect cell proliferation or apoptosis in vitro. In in vivo experiments, the knockout of CXCR4 suppressed the development of metastastic lesions in the lungs, liver and bone, but did not decrease metastasis to the kidneys. Our data demonstrate that CXCR4 is a candidate gene involved in the development of metastastic lesions in specific organs, such as the lungs, bone and liver, which can secrete high concentrations of SDF-1, the sole ligand of CXCR4. Thus, CXCR4 may prove to be a promising target for the prevention and effective treatment of metastastic lesions due to SCLC.
