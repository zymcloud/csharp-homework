Background:KRAS mutations have been associated with lung metastases at diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but the impact of this mutation on subsequent development of lung metastasis is unknown. We investigated KRAS mutation as a predictor of lung metastasis development.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated data from patients with mCRC whose tumour was tested for KRAS mutation from 2008 to 2010. The relationships of KRAS mutational status with time-to-lung metastasis (TTLM) and overall survival (OS) were analysed.Results:Of the 494 patients identified, 202 (41%) had tumours with KRAS mutation. KRAS mutations were associated with a shorter TTLM (median 15.2 vs 22.4 months; hazard ratio=1.40; P=0.002) and a two-fold greater odds of developing lung metastases during the disease course in patients with liver-limited mCRC at diagnosis (72 vs 56%, P=0.007). Overall survival did not differ by KRAS status.Conclusions:Lung metastasis was more likely to develop during the disease course in patients whose tumour had a KRAS mutation than in those whose tumour did not have a KRAS mutation. This finding may have an impact on decision making for surgical resection of metastatic disease.
