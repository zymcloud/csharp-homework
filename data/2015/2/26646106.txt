AKAP12/Gravin (A kinase anchor protein 12) belongs to the group of A-kinase scaffold proteins and functions as a tumor suppressor in some human primary cancers. While AKAP12 is found consistently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its involvement in hepatocarcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. We identified targeting sites for miR-103 in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of AKAP12 by bioinformatic analysis and confirm their function by a luciferase reporter gene assay. We reveal miR-103 expression to be inversely correlated with AKAP12 in HCC tissue samples and show that overexpressed miR-103 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by downregulating AKAP12 expression in HCC cell lines. On the other hand, repression of miR-103 suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis in HCC cells by increasing AKAP12. In xenografted HCC tumors, overexpression of AKAP12 suppresses tumor growth whereas overexpression of miR-103 enhances tumor growth while repressing AKAP12. Since the activation of telomerase is crucial for cells to gain immortality and proliferation ability, we investigated whether AKAP12 expression affected telomerase activity in HCC cells. Both AKAP12 overexpression and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) inhibition prevent nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of TERT and reduce telomerase activity in HCC cells. These findings indicate that miR-103 potentially acts as an oncogene in HCC by inhibiting AKAP12 expression and raise the possibility that miR-103 increases telomerase activity by increasing PKCα activity. Thus, miR-103 may represent a new potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
