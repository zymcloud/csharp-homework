Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common risk factor for HCC. The HBV proteins can induce oncogenic or synergy effects with a hyperproliferative response on transformation into HCC. CREBH (cAMP-responsive, element-binding protein H), activated by stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is an ER-resident transmembrane bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factor that is specifically expressed in the liver. In the present study, we address the role played by CREBH activated by ER stress in HBV-induced hepatic cell proliferation. We confirmed CREBH activation by ER stress and showed that it occurred as a result of/via hepatitis B virus X (HBx)-induced ER stress. CREBH activated by HBx increased the expression of AP-1 target genes through c-Jun induction. Under pathological conditions such as liver damage or liver regeneration, activated CREBH may have an important role to play in hepatic inflammation and cell proliferation, as an insulin receptor with dual functions under these conditions. We showed that CREBH activated by HBx interacted with HBx protein, leading to a synergistic effect on the expression of AP-1 target genes and the proliferation of HCC cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. In conclusion, in HBV-infected hepatic cells or patients with chronic HBV, CREBH may induce proliferation of hepatic cells in co-operation with HBx, resulting in HCC.
