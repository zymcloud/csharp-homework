Background:Liver resection is the mainstay of treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and compensated cirrhosis. We investigated the relationship between the morphologic severity of cirrhosis and post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and evaluated the role of cirrhosis staging in determination of the extent limit for liver resection.Methods:The clinicopathologic data of 672 consecutive patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function who underwent curative liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in Tongji Hospital from 2009 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Severity of cirrhosis was staged morphologically and histologically. Risk factors for histologic cirrhosis and PHLF were analyzed. The extent limit of liver resection with reference to morphologic staging was studied.Results:Morphologic and histologic stages were significantly correlated (Ï„ = 0.809, P Conclusions:Morphologic severity of cirrhosis is an independent predictor of PHLF. Resection of fewer than four liver segments is justified in patients with mild cirrhosis. Major resection is not recommended in patients with moderate cirrhosis. In patients with severe cirrhosis or severe portal hypertension, only resection of fewer than two liver segments can be safely performed.
