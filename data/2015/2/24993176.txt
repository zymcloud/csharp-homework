Background:Laparoscopic hepatectomy (Lap-Hx) has been increasingly performed for patients with liver tumors as surgical techniques and devices have progressed. However, the long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx for malignant liver tumors are not oncologically guaranteed. This study compared the short- and long-term outcomes between Lap-Hx and open hepatectomy (Open-Hx) for malignant liver tumors by matched-pair analysis.Methods:The indications for Lap-Hx at our department are a tumor size of Results:With respect to short-term outcomes, the operation time, blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level after Lap-Hx were significantly better than those after Open-Hx in both the patients who underwent partial resection and those who underwent lateral sectionectomy. In patients who underwent partial resection, the incidence of postoperative complications after Lap-Hx was significantly lower than that after Open-Hx; in particular, wound infection and respiratory complications were significantly lower. Furthermore, when the tumor was located in the posterosuperior segments, the operation time for Lap-Hx was not shorter than that for Open-Hx. With respect to long-term outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma, neither overall nor disease-free survival differed between the two groups. With respect to long-term outcomes of colorectal liver metastases, the disease-free survival rate was similar between Lap-Hx and Open-Hx; however, the overall survival rate was significantly better for Lap-Hx than for Open-Hx.Conclusions:Lap-Hx is a good option for selected patients with malignant liver tumors. The short- and long-term outcomes of Lap-Hx also are considered to be acceptable.
