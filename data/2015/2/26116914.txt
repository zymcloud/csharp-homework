Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer with high mortality and poor prognosis. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways have been implicated in promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion of HCC cells.Methods:As a potential inhibitor of tumor metastasis, the role of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) in HCC development and the functional relevance with MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways were investigated. The levels of RKIP expression were examined in human HCC tissues and correlated with tumor stages and metastatic status. Function of RKIP in cellular proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis was investigated in HCC cell lines by either overexpressing or knocking down RKIP expression. Mouse xenograft model was established to assess the effect of RKIP expression on tumor growth.Results:Our results demonstrated decreased RKIP expression in HCC tissues and a strong correlation with tumor grade and distant metastasis. Manipulation of RKIP expression in HCCLM3 and HepG2 cells indicated that RKIP functioned to inhibit HCC cell motility and invasiveness, and contributed to tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that the function of RKIP was mediated through MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. However, cell type-dependent RKIP regulation on these two pathways was also suggested, indicating the complex nature of signaling network.Conclusion:Our study provides a better understanding on the molecular mechanisms of HCC metastasis and sets the foundation for the development of targeted therapeutics for HCC.
