Background and aim:Various inflammatory cytokines and adipokines have been implicated in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-mediated liver disease, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and adiponectin may play key roles. In addition, these factors may be associated with chronic hepatitis C (CHC)-induced extrahepatic manifestations. However, little data are available on the role of these factors on future outcomes of CHC patients. This study aims to evaluate the impact of serum levels of IL-6 and adiponectin on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and liver-unrelated mortality.Methods:A long-term follow-up study was conducted, consisting of 325 CHC patients, for which we previously reported positive associations between these factors (Serum levels of IL-6 and adiponectin) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development.Results:During the follow-up period (mean, 13.0 year), there were 92 events consisting of 91 deaths (liver related, 72; liver unrelated, 19) and 1 liver transplantation due to liver failure. High IL-6 and adiponectin levels, defined as being higher than each median value at baseline, were associated with significantly higher incidences of not only HCC development but also all-cause mortality. Interestingly, high IL-6 was strongly associated with only liver-related mortality, whereas high-serum adiponectin was associated with not only liver-related, but also liver-unrelated mortality. Multivariate analysis identified high IL-6 as an independent risk factor for liver-related mortality and high adiponectin as an independent risk factor for liver-unrelated mortality.Conclusion:High serum levels of IL-6 and adiponectin were associated with higher all-cause and liver-related mortality in CHC patients. In addition, high adiponectin was associated with liver-unrelated mortality. The measurement of these factors may provide information useful for predicting future outcomes in CHC patients.
