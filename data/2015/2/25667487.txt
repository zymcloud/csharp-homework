Aim:This study aimed to investigate the relationship between prognosis after curative hepatectomy and serum methylation signature (SMS), defined by methylation levels of six specific genes (cyclin D2, Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) domain family member 1, serine peptidase inhibitor Kunitz type 2, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, brain abundant membrane attached signal protein 1, and steroid-5-alpha-reductase alpha polypeptide 2).Patients and methods:Serum samples were collected preoperatively from 125 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis C virus infection who underwent curative hepatectomy. We measured the methylation levels of the preceding six genes. We defined the methylation of three genes or more in the serum as SMS-positive in this study. We investigated the prognosis of SMS-positive patients.Results:SMS-positive patients exhibited significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than SMS-negative patients (p=0.0002 and pConclusion:SMS is useful as a prognostic predictor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy.
