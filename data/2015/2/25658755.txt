Objective:Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine that is produced by activated CD4 T cells. This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between two IL-13 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP rs1800925 and SNP rs20541) and the incidence of hepatitis B virus-related (HBV) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Method:Three hundred and ninety-eight HBV-positive individuals (192 HCC and 206 patients with chronic hepatitis) and one hundred and ninety-two healthy participants from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University were enrolled in this study.Results:The results showed no significant differences between the genotype and allele frequencies of the IL-13 gene rs1800925 and rs20541 polymorphisms and chronic hepatitis B risk after adjusting for age, sex, tobacco use, and alcohol intake using binary logistic regression analyses. Regarding the rs20541 SNP, the GA genotype was significantly related to a decreased risk of HCC after adjusting for age, sex, tobacco use, and alcohol intake using binary logistic regression analyses (The odds ratio (OR) = 0.54, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.34-0.87). The adjusted OR for the GA and AA genotypes combined was 0.68 (95% CI 0.39-0.90).Conclusion:This study indicates that the functional IL-13 rs20541 polymorphism may contribute to the risk of HCC and that the rs20541 polymorphism is a protective factor for HCC.
