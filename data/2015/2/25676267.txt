Objective:To observe the biological role and underlying mechanism of microRNA-132 (miR-132) in liver cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.Methods:The expressions of miR-132 in the cancer tissue and their adjacent tissues from 45 liver cancer patients were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The biological effects of miR-132 transfection on human liver cancer MHCC97H cells were assessed by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry,in vivo experiment in nude mice, and TUNEL test. Western blotting was used to detect the expressions of p-AKT, Survivin, and Caspase 3 in liver cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the positive expressions of Ki-67,Survivin,and Caspase 3 in the xenograft tumors.Results:The expression level of miR-132 was found to be down-regulated in liver cancer tissues compared with the matched adjacent tissues (PConclusions:miR-132 is down-regulated in human liver cancer tissues miR-132 transfection can effectively inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of MHCC97H cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, miR-132 may become a new target in liver cancer treatment.
