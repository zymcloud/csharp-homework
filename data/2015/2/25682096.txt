Background:Hepatic resection is the main treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. However, surgery is generally stressful for older patients.Methods:Clinicopathologic data and outcomes after hepatic resection were retrospectively investigated for older patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The younger group (n = 219) included patients aged 60 to 69 years, and the older group (n = 60) included patients >70 years of age.Results:Hepatitis B virus was more common in the younger group than in the older group (64.5% vs 28.8%, P Conclusions:Although the incidence of postoperative pneumonia was higher in the older group than in the younger group, hepatic resection was justified for hepatocellular carcinoma in selected patients >70 years of age.
