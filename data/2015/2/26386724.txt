To investigate the immunogenicity of Homo sapiens putative translation initiation factor (Sui1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot were utilized to assess autoantibody responses to Sui1 in sera from HCC patients and healthy individuals. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay with cancer cells and immunohistochemistry (IHC) study with tissue array slides were performed to examine Sui1 expression profile in cancer cells and tissues. The data confirmed that the frequency of autoantibody to Sui1 in sera of HCC patients was 15.5 % (16/103), which was remarkably higher than that in sera of liver cirrhosis (LC) patients (3.3 %, 1/30), chronic hepatitis (CH) patients (0 %, 0/29), and normal human serum (NHS) (0 %, 0/82) (p 0.05). In immunodiagnosis of HCC, the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-Sui1 antibody were 15.5 and 99.3 %, respectively. If both anti-Sui1 and alpha fetal protein (AFP) were simultaneously utilized as detective markers, 66.7 % (30/45) of HCC patients could be correctly distinguished. The results suggested that anti-Sui1 could be utilized as a supplementary serological marker for the detection of HCC and Sui1 might be associated to HCC carcinogenesis.
