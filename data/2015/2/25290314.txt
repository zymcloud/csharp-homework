Background & aims:The BCLC-staging system is used to facilitate treatment decisions in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Owing to the observed clinical heterogeneity of the intermediate stage BCLC-B, a subclassification was proposed taking Child-Pugh score and extended criteria for transplantation into account. Analysis of the prognostic significance of a proposed subclassification of the BCLC-B score in a European cohort of HCC patients.Methods:Eight hundred and eighty four consecutive HCC patients were retrospectively analysed. Patients with stage BCLC-B were grouped according to the proposed subclassification. Baseline patient and tumour characteristics, therapy and overall survival were analysed.Results:Two hundred and fifty four patients with stage BCLC-B were classified as B1/B2/B3 and B4 in 16.1/56.7/7.9 and 19.3%. OS compared between adjacent subgroups (B1 vs. B2, B2 vs. B3, B3 vs. B4) did not reach statistical significance. Groupwise comparison showed significant differences between B1 vs. B3 (P = 0.035), B1 vs. B4 (P = 0.006) and B2 vs. B4 (P Conclusions:No significant survival differences between subgroups were found in the retrospective analysis. We could not confirm the BCLC-B subclassification to be prognostically meaningful in our cohort. As liver function and therapy influenced survival in this study, a more refined BCLC-B subclassification has the potential to be a useful tool to better stratify treatment decisions. Further studies in larger collectives with homogenous staging and treatment strategies are warranted to confirm the prognostic significance of the proposed subclassifications.
