Background:The implication of extremely high preoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) values for the long-term outcomes of hepatectomy for resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncertain.Methods:A total of 762 hepatectomized HCC patients were divided into 3 groups according to preoperative AFP serum concentrations: 578 patients with AFP Results:The EAP group had a greater proportion of younger patients and those with hepatitis B compared with the other 2 groups. Large tumor size, poor histologic differentiation, and microscopic vascular invasion were also more common in the EAP group. The recurrence-free and overall survival rates of the EAP group were worse than those of the LAP group (both P Conclusion:An extremely high AFP level does not provide additional postoperative prognostic implications beyond those provided by a high AFP level. Hepatectomy should be performed without reservation for cases of HCC associated with an extremely high AFP value.
