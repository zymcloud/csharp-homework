Background:Rising rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among chronic hepatitis C (HCV) patients may contribute to higher hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk.Aim:To perform a systematic review evaluating the impact of DM, body mass index (BMI), or steatosis on HCC risk among chronic HCV patients.Methods:A structured keyword search of PubMed from January 1, 2001, to July 1, 2014, was performed to identify original articles evaluating the association of DM, BMI, or steatosis with HCC among adults with chronic HCV. Studies involving HCV patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, or other chronic liver diseases with the exception of NAFLD were excluded. Quality assessment utilized the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.Results:Nine studies (seven cohorts, two case-controls) met inclusion criteria for the final analysis. Five of seven studies analyzing DM demonstrated significantly increased HCC risk associated with concurrent DM with effect sizes ranging from HR 1.73 (95 % CI 1.30-2.30) to RR 3.52 (95 % CI 1.29-9.24). One of three studies analyzing BMI demonstrated a significant association with HCC risk (BMI â‰¥ 30.0 vs. BMI Conclusions:Concurrent DM is associated with increased HCC risk among chronic HCV patients. BMI and steatosis may also increase HCC risk, but the limitations of the current studies do not allow us to draw strong conclusions.
