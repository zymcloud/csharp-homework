Background & aims:Polymorphisms in interferon (IFN)L3 (encodes IFNλ3 or interleukin 28B) are associated with outcomes of treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, there is controversy regarding how polymorphisms in IFNL3 affect the risk for development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.Methods:In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from 1118 patients with HCV infection (589 men; median age, 60 y; 49.9% infected with genotype 1; 51.3% with advanced fibrosis) treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin from March 2000 through October 2009 at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan (71.64% achieved sustained virologic response [SVR]). Baseline samples were collected before therapy. Starting 24 weeks after treatment, clinical and biochemical features were assessed every 3 to 6 months and patients underwent ultrasound examinations. Lesions detected were examined by computed tomography, angiography, or fine-needle aspiration biopsy analyses. Patients were followed up from the initiation of HCV therapy until a diagnosis of HCC (based on published guidelines), death, or March 31, 2013 (median, 60 mo). DNA samples from each patient were analyzed for rs12979860 in IFNL3. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine the risk for development of HCC.Results:The percentages of patients with the IFNL3 rs12979860 CC, CT, and TT genotypes were 86.4%, 13.2%, and 0.3%, respectively. A total of 108 patients (9.66%) developed HCC. The IFNL3 rs12979860 CT and TT genotypes correlated with high baseline levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP; ≥20 ng/mL), advanced stage of fibrosis, diabetes, or lack of an SVR (all P Conclusions:Based on a retrospective study of patients treated for HCV infection, the IFNL3 rs12979860 CT and TT polymorphisms are associated with a risk for HCC, especially in patients without a SVR.
