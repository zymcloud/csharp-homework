Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) often metastasizes to the lungs, liver, brain, and bones. Eyelid metastasis of a distant RCC is an infrequent condition. Breast carcinoma and lung malignancies are responsible of most eyelid metastases, although other malignancies may also metastasize to the eyelid. We report a case with eyelid metastasis as a first presentation of a distant RCC.
