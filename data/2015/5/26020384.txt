This study investigated the preoperative independent risk factors associated with survival and recurrence for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent hepatic resection. In total, 384 consecutive patients who underwent curative hepatic resection for single primary HCC were studied. Predictive factors associated with 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were assessed using a univariate log-rank test and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) > 100 U/L was identified as a preoperative independent risk factor affecting 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival whereas GGT > 50 U/L and indocyanine green retention 15 min (ICG-R15) > 10% were identified as preoperative independent risk factors affecting 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS. The 384 patients studied had a 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rate of 72.8%, 43.3%, and 27%, respectively. Patients with GGT > 50 U/L had a 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rate of 64.5%, 36.0%, and 21.7%. These patients had lower survival rates than did patients with GGT â‰¤ 50 U/L (P 50 U/L and ICG-R15 > 10% had a 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rate of 62.4%, 29.5%, and 14.1%, respectively. These patients had lower survival rates than did patients in the other 2 groups with different levels of GGT and ICG (P
