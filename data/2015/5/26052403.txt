Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of deaths in patients with hepatitis B or C, and its incidence has increased considerably over the past decade and is still on the rise. Liver transplantation (LT) provides the best chance of cure for patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. With the implementation of the MELD exception system for patients with HCC waitlisted for LT, the number of recipients of LT is increasing, so is the number of patients who have recurrence of HCC after LT. Treatments for intrahepatic recurrence after transplantation and after other kinds of surgery are more or less the same, but long-term cure of posttransplant recurrence is rarely seen as it is a "systemic" disease. Nonetheless, surgical resection has been shown to be effective in prolonging patient survival despite the technical difficulty in resecting graft livers. Besides surgical resection, different kinds of treatment are also in use, including transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, and stereotactic body radiation therapy. Targeted therapy and modulation of immunosuppressants are also adopted to treat the deadly disease.
