Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the proteome of the pancreatic juice after pancreatectomy.Methods:Pancreatic juice samples were obtained during surgery and the postoperative period. Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry-based protein quantification technology and compared with published data of the nonoperated pancreas. Subgroup analyses were done in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in smokers.Results:Five hundred eighteen proteins were identified in the postoperative pancreatic juice, encompassing all of the main organ functions. Sixty-seven of these were also present in the published data of the nonoperated pancreas and 7 of these had significant variation of concentration after surgery. Growth factors that have been described in postsurgical regeneration of the liver were not found to be overexpressed, whereas clusterin did, confirming the finding of previous experimental studies on pancreatic regeneration. Several proteins involved in immunomodulation and organ functions were differently expressed, depending on PDAC, neoadjuvant therapy, and smoking.Conclusions:The proteome of the pancreas after surgical resection contains factors related to all main organ functions, changes over time, and is different in patients with PDAC receiving neoadjuvant therapy and in smokers. The pancreas reacts to the surgical trauma by producing proteins that protect the organ and stimulate the restoration of its function.
