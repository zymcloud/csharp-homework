Objective:To develop an anti-hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) IgG chemiluminescence assay kit and assess its clinical application.Methods:The HEV recombinant antigen was used as coating antigen, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated monoclonal anti-human IgG as the secondary antibody, and the luminol chemiluminescent reaction system as a substrate. The sensitivity, specificity, precision and other technical indicators of the kit were evaluated using the HEV national reference product, and a contrast experiment was conducted on 1012 serum samples by the kit developed in this research and a commercialized anti-HEV IgG chemiluminescence assay kit.Results:The sensitivity, specificity, precision and stability of all the three batches of kit reached national standard. In the detection of 1012 clinical serum samples, the positive coincidence rate of both kits was 97.4%, the negative coincidence rate was 99.4%, and the total coincidence rate reached 98.4%.Conclusion:An anti-HEV IgG chemiluminescence assay kit has been successfully developed. The kit is of high sensitivity and specificity, easy to operate. It is applicable to the clinical diagnosis and epidemiological survey of HEV infection.
