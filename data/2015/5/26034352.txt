Aim:To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative changes in N-linked glycosylation, which occurred in association with diethyl nitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rodents.Methods:Liver tissues of (1) normal (non-tumor-bearing) rats; and (2) tumor-bearing rats; were collected and were used for histological and GlycanMap analyses. Briefly, GlycanMap analysis is a high-throughput assay that provides a structural and quantitative readout of protein-associated glycans using a unique, automated 96-well assay technology coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and custom bioinformatics. Histopathological studies were carried out to ensure the development of HCC in the tested animals.Results:The N-glycomic analysis revealed 5 glycans; Glc₁Man₉GlcNAc₂, Gal₂Man₃GlcNac₄Fuc₁Neu₁, Man₄GlcNac₂, Gal₂Man₃GlcNac₄Neu₃OAc₃, and Man₃GlcNac₅ Fuc₁, which showed significant changes in rat HCC tissues when compared with normal liver tissues. Four glycans were increased (P Conclusion:The reported HCC-associated changes in glycan flow and subcellular localization explain the increase in high mannose glycans and siayl Lewis glycans common in HCC liver tissues.
