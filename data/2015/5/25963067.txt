Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and several antiviral agents are available for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. However, the impact of antiviral therapy on the long-term outcomes of HCV-related HCC patients remains inconclusive. We aimed to examine the impact of antiviral therapy on the long-term outcomes of HCV-related HCC patients. We conducted a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines to identify trials and English-language literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library database till August 2014. Randomized trials of antiviral treatments examining the effects of antiviral therapy on CHC patients and HCV-related HCC patients were screened and selected. We identified 6 trials evaluated the effectiveness of interferon (IFN)-alfa treatment, 3 studies examined pegylated interferon-alfa treatment, and 2 studies examined IFN-beta treatment. IFN-based therapy may decrease HCC incidence in HCV cirrhotic patients after a >5-year follow-up, improve liver reserve, decrease HCC recurrence rate, and increase survival rate in HCV-related HCC patients after curative HCC therapy. In conclusion, IFN-based therapy is beneficial and may be recommended in the management of HCV-related HCC patients who are IFN eligible.
