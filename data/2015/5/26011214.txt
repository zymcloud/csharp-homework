Sorafenib (Nexabar, Bayer, Berlin, Germany), one of multikinase inhibitors, can infrequently downstage advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are some reports that sorafenib in combination with other modalities, such as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radiation therapy, could represent a bridge to surgery. We have observed a progressive HCC case with hepatic vein tumor thrombosis proceeding to the inferior vena cava (IVC-HVTT) convert to a state of feasible curative resection after a multidisciplinary treatment which included sorafenib. The patient underwent a successful resection in consequence of this therapy. A 45-year-old male with Hepatitis B Virus-associated chronic hepatitis was diagnosed as HCC with IVC-HVTT. To obtain oncological curative resection, we performed TACE, radiation therapy followed by administration of sorafenib (800 mg per day, total 72 g). The tumor including IVC-HVTT remarkably shrank, therefore, an extended posterior sectionectomy and total removal of the IVC-HVTT was successfully performed. The operation time was 736 minutes and the amount of intraoperative hemorrhage was 805 mL. No postoperative complication occurred. Adjuvant therapy with sorafenib was started four weeks after the operation and continued for 6 months (800 mg per day, total 144 g). The patient is alive without recurrence for about 4 years from the initial therapy. Multidisciplinary therapy including sorafenib, TACE, radiation, and hepatic resection may be an effective strategy to treat HCC patients with IVC-HVTT.
