Platelets play a known role in the maintenance of vascular homeostasis, but these cells are emerging as important cellular mediators of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Platelets are key elements in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic liver disease associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection by promoting the accumulation of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells and nonspecific inflammatory cells into the liver parenchyma. This review discusses major platelet functions in immune and inflammatory responses, with an emphasis on recent pre-clinical studies that suggest that the inhibition of platelet activation pathways represent an alternative therapeutic strategy with potential use in the reduction of virus-specific T cell-mediated chronic inflammation, liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients who are chronically infected with HBV.
