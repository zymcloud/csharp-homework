In hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib is the only active medical treatment validated to date. Sorafenib is a targeted therapy mainly blocking tumor vascularisation. Sorafenib is currently used for inoperable or advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence when the disease is diffuse or multifocal. Current clinical trials are designed to identify new antitumor molecules active in hepatocellular carcinoma that could enrich the therapeutic armamentarium in addition to sorafenib.
