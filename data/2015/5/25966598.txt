Hepatitis C infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States with an estimated 2.7 million individuals suffering from chronic infection. Of those who are infected with Hepatitis C virus, 75-85% develop chronic infection. Without treatment for chronic infection, individuals can develop liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, during many years of asymptomatic infection. To examine the burden of Hepatitis C virus infection in the state, the Arkansas Department of Health created an epidemiologic profile based on data collected in 2013 from several data sources, including the department's Hepatitis C surveillance program. In order to make more Arkansans aware of their infection, the local health units in all 75 counties of the state recently began screening individuals at risk for the disease, including persons born during the years 1945-1965. Despite recent advances in treatment efficacy, identifying infected individuals and connecting patients to affordable HCV treatment and care remain priorities.
