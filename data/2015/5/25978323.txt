Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its recurrence are major problems in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Several biomarkers have been used to investigate this event. We conducted a prospective controlled study to determine the activities of the basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), survivin, Ki67, endostatin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in different conditions before, early after, and late after LDLT with and without HCC recurrence.Methods:Fifty patients with virus-related HCC who underwent LDLT were enrolled in this 2-year cross-sectional study. During the study period, recurrent HCC was identified in 9 patients (study group, n = 9) and 41 patients (control group, n = 41) had no recurrence after LDLT. The mean time to HCC recurrence was 587.11 Â± 398.64 days (range, 90-1352 days). Microvascular invasion (MVI) was found in 66.7% (6/9) of the recipients, as determined on pathological examination. The serum biomarkers were investigated by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at the different LDLT stages.Results:The serum levels of the biomarkers significantly correlated with LDLT and HCC recurrence in the repeated-measures analysis (F = 31.676, P = 0.000). Significant differences were observed in the effects of all biomarkers (F = 85.313, P = 0.000) and the time to HCC recurrence after LDLT (F = 3.178, P = 0.046). The biomarkers, ordered by the observed power of the test for HCC recurrence after LDLT, were FGF-2 (1.000) > survivin (0.999) > Ki67 (0.949) > endostatin (0.411) > VEGF (0.305).Conclusions:Different biomarker activities may be implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC recurrence after LDLT. Oncogenes may not exist in the new graft but may still be present in the peripheral blood. The timing of HCC recurrence and impact of MVI in the explanted liver requires confirmation in larger studies with a longer follow-up.
