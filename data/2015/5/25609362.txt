Objective:In order to increase local drug concentration and reduce systemic side effects of liver cancer chemotherapy, it is desirable to develop novel non-invasive technologies for drug targeting, such as ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD).Methods:H22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) xenograft transplantation model was generated in UTMD study. BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups: doxorubicin HCl liposomal injection (DOX), DOX + US, UTMD, DOX + UTMD, H22 liver tumor control (CH control) and blank control group. The therapeutic schedule started on day 4 after tumor inoculation.Results:Average survival time of the animal model was approximately 18 d. The UTMD therapy parameters were optimized in the H22 mouse model to be: microbubble (MB) diameter, 2.30 ± 0.25 μm; MB density, 4.0 × 10(9) bubbles/ml; treatment dose, 0.2 ml per 20 g mouse body weight; sonication frequency, 1.3 MHz; and sonication power, 2.06 W/cm(2). Mice treated with DOX + UTMD had the smallest tumor volume and weight (p Conclusion:An improved antitumor effect was observed with the combination therapy of DOX and UTMD, as compared with treatment with DOX, DOX + US or UTMD, which implicates a novel approach for HCC treatment.
