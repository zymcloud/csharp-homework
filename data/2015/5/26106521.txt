Current standard practices for treatment of cancers are less than satisfactory because of recurrence mediated by cancer stem cells (CSCs). Caffeic acid (CaA) is a novel anti-tumor agent that inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion in human cancer cells. However, little is known about the functions of CaA in regulating CSCs-like properties and the potential molecular mechanisms. Here, we found that CaA attenuated the CSCs-like properties by the microRNA-148a (miR-148a)-mediated inhibition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-SMAD2 signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo. CaA enhanced the expression of miR-148a by inducing DNA methylation. MiR-148a, which targeted the SMAD2-3'UTR, decreased the expression of SMAD2. Knockdown of miR-148a abolished the CaA-induced inhibition of TGFβ-SMAD2 signal pathway and the CSCs-like properties. Our study found a novel mechanism that CaA inhibits the CSCs-like properties via miR-148a-mediated inhibition of TGFβ-SMAD2 signaling pathway, which may help to identify a new approach for the treatment of human cancers.
