Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a common cause of chronic liver disease and has been an increasingly studied topic of research as the obesity epidemic has been growing. There is a significant morbidity and mortality with uncontrolled steatohepatitis, which can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of this disease has been estimated to be roughly one-third of the western population, thought to be largely due to diet and sedentary lifestyle. Several treatments have been studied including vitamin E, insulin-sensitizing agents and ursodeoxycholic acid; however, the only treatment shown to improve the histologic changes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is weight loss. Given the proven benefit of weight loss, there may be reason to screen at-risk populations; however, limited availability of other disease-modifying treatments may limit the cost-benefit ratios. A better understanding of the diagnosis and management of this condition is required to alter the course of this modifiable disease.
