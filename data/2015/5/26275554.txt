Background:Preliminary series have shown the feasibility of combined laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCRLM). The aim of this study was to compare the short- and long-term outcomes for matched patients undergoing combined resections.Methods:An international multicenter database of 142 patients that underwent combined laparoscopic resection of CRC and SCRLM between 1997 and 2013 was compared to a database of 241 patients treated by open during the same period. Comparison of short- and long-term outcomes was performed after propensity score adjustment.Results:After matching, 89 patients were compared in each group including mostly ASA I-II patients, presenting with mean number of 1.5 CRLM, with a mean diameter of 30 mm, and resectable by a wedge resection or a left lateral sectionectomy. A rectal resection was required in 46 and 43 % of laparoscopic and open procedures, respectively (p = 0.65). There was no difference in global operative time, blood loss and transfusion rates between the two groups. A conversion was required in 7 % of the laparoscopic procedures. Morbidity rates were similar in the two groups (p = 1.0). The 3-year overall survival in the laparoscopy and open groups were 78 and 65 %, respectively (p = 0.17).Conclusions:In patients without severe comorbidities presenting with one, small (â‰¤3 cm), CRLM resectable by a wedge resection or a left lateral sectionectomy, combined laparoscopic resection of CRC and SCRLM allowed similar short- and long-term outcomes compared with the open approach.
