Aim:To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of a novel microwave generator, designed to deliver automatically adjusted energy by tissue permittivity feedback control into the tumour via an uncooled antenna, in patients with larger hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Fourteen patients with HCC >5 cm in diameter received surgical or percutaneous microwave ablation with more than 12 months of follow-up. Microwave ablation was performed using a 902-928 MHz generator at 28 W; a single 14 G antenna without water-cooled system was used. The patients were followed up with contrast-enhanced CT and serum alpha-foetoprotein to monitor for tumour recurrence at 1 month and then every 3 months after tumour ablation.Results:The follow-up duration for the 11 male and three female patients (mean tumour size 5.77 cm, range 5-7 cm; mean age 63.8 years) was 15.8 months. The mean ablation time was 2025 s (range 900-3600 s), and the mean ablation session was 2.5 (range 1-4). The complete ablation rate was 85% (17 of 20). Local recurrence rate was 5.8% (1 of 17). All patients survived and the morbidity and mortality rate was 21.4% and 0%, respectively.Conclusions:Microwave tissue ablation using this novel system with tissue permittivity feedback control and a single uncooled antenna has a high complete ablation rate and lower morbidity. It proved to be a fast, easy, and effective option for ablation of large (>5 cm) tumours.
