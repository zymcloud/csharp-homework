Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+) )-dependent protein deacetylase. In mice, mSirt1 deficiency causes the onset of fatty liver via regulation of the hepatic nutrient metabolism pathway. In this study, we demonstrate SIRT1 expression, activity and NAD(+) regulation using noncancerous liver tissue specimens from hepatocellular carcinoma patients with non-B non-C (NBNC) hepatitis. SIRT1 expression levels were higher in NBNC patients than in healthy donors, while SIRT1 histone H3K9 deacetylation activity was suppressed in NBNC patients. In the liver of hepatitis patients, decreased NAD(+) amounts and its regulatory enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase expression levels were observed, and this led to inhibition of SIRT1 activity. SIRT1 expression was associated with HIF1 protein accumulation in both the NBNC liver and liver cancer cell lines. These results may indicate that the NBNC hepatitis liver is exposed to hypoxic conditions. In HepG2 cells, hypoxia induced inflammatory chemokines, such as CXCL10 and MCP-1. These inductions were suppressed in rich NAD(+) condition, and by SIRT1 activator treatment. In conclusion, hepatic SIRT1 activity was repressed in NBNC patients, and normalization of NAD(+) amounts and activation of SIRT1 could improve the inflammatory condition in the liver of NBNC hepatitis patients.
