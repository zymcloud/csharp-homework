Purpose:To evaluate the risk factors associated with short-term local recurrence of malignant liver lesions after irreversible electroporation (IRE).Materials and methods:Thirty-nine consecutive patients (79 malignant liver lesions) were treated with IRE, of whom 14 were excluded from the analysis (including 12 without 6 mo of follow-up and two with incomplete ablation). The remaining 25 patients (aged 59.4 y Â± 11.2) had 48 malignant liver lesions, including 22 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), six cholangiocellular carcinomas, and 20 metastatic liver cancers. Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the associations of risk factors with early recurrence. The characteristics of patients, lesions, and IRE procedures were assessed by logistic regression.Results:Fourteen of the 48 treated lesions (29.2%) showed early local recurrence after 6 months. Tumor volume (Conclusions:Because short distances to the surrounding vessels were not associated with early local recurrence, percutaneous IRE might provide an alternative treatment option for perivascular tumors. However, patients with larger tumor volumes appeared to be poor candidates for percutaneous IRE. Regarding the different types of treated lesions, patients with HCC had significantly better outcomes.
