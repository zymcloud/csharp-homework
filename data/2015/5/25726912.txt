Apolipoprotein F (ApoF) inhibits cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity and plays an important role in lipid metabolism. In the present study, the full-length human ApoF promoter was cloned, and the molecular mechanism of the regulation of ApoF was investigated. The ApoF promoter displayed higher activities in hepatoma cell lines, and the -198 nt to +79 nt promoter region contained the maximum promoter activity. In the promoter region of -198 nt to -2 nt there were four putative binding sites for transcription factors ETS-1/ETS-2 (named EBS-1 to EBS-4) and one for C/EBP. Mutation of EBS-2, EBS4 and the C/EBP binding site abolished the promoter activity, and ETS-1/ETS-2 and C/EBPα could interact with corresponding binding sites. In addition, overexpression of ETS-1/2 or C/EBPα enhanced, while dominant-negative mutants of ETS-1/2 and knockdown of C/EBPα decreased, ApoF promoter activities. ETS-1 and C/EBPα associated physically, and acted synergistically to activate ApoF transcription. These results demonstrated combined activation of the ApoF promoter by liver-enriched and ubiquitous transcription factors. Direct interactions between C/EBPα and ETS-1 were important for high liver-specific expression of ApoF.
