p21-Activated kinase 5 (PAK5) is the last identified member of the PAK family. The PAKs are highly conserved serine/threonine and effector proteins for Cdc42 and Rac and are essential in regulating cell motility and survival. Previous studies have demonstrated that PAK5 played a pivotal role in apoptosis, proliferation, cancer migration, and invasion. However, the biological function of PAK5 in hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as its underlying mechanism, still remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that PAK5 markedly inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Moreover, our results showed that overexpression of PAK5 contributed to cell cycle regulation. In order to elucidate the underlying mechanism of PAK5 on cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, we also examined the protein expressions of chk2 and p-chk2. In summary, our study investigated the role of PAK5 in cisplatin-induced cellular processes and provided evidence of its underlying mechanism.
