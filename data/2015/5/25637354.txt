Purpose:The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using ultrasound (US)-specific microbubbles in guiding radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A retrospective analysis of 50 patients with HCC treated with CEUS guided RFA using perflutren at our institution was performed. CEUS images were first compared to B-mode US images performed at the same RFA session to determine the ability of CEUS to increase the conspicuity of lesions. A qualitative score (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = excellent) was used to grade the ability to visualize the lesions. The preprocedure CEUS images were then evaluated using the most recent prior contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated with short-term follow-up imaging (median 1 month) for presence of residual or recurrent disease.Results:CEUS allows at least fair visualization (score â‰¥2) in 78% (reader 1) and 80% (reader 2) of the lesions not visualized by B-mode US, and 50% (reader 1) and 42% (reader 2) of the lesions poorly visualized by B-mode US. Lesion appearances on CEUS are largely concordant with those on CT or MRI: 88% for reader 1, 96% for reader 2. With CEUS-guided RFA, complete response was achieved in the vast majority of the lesions at short-term follow-up: 82% for reader 1, 94% for reader 2.Conclusions:CEUS increases the conspicuity and provides better characterization of hypervascular HCC that are either not seen or poorly seen on B-mode US, and CEUS provides real-time guidance of RFA with good short-term treatment responses.
