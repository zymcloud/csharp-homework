Purpose:The simultaneous management of primary colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases has been reported extensively in open surgery. Data regarding feasibility, safety, and outcomes of the laparoscopic procedure is emerging from the experience of a few surgical centers. This paper aims at discussing the technique and results of a one-step laparoscopic approach for colorectal cancer and liver metastases resection on a series of 35 patients.Methods:Between January 2008 and December 2013, 18 males and 17 females (median age 71 years) underwent colorectal and hepatic laparoscopic resection for colorectal metastatic cancer.Results:Thirty-five colorectal resections and 66 liver resections were performed; no conversion to open surgery has been indicated. Median blood loss was 200 ml, median operative time 240 min, and median hospital stay was 8 days (range 4-30). According to Clavien-Dindo classification, two class II complications, two class IIIb complications, and one class IV complication were recorded. Two high-risk patients died within 30 days from surgery.Conclusions:This series confirms the feasibility of synchronous laparoscopic colorectal and hepatic resections. To ensure the best outcomes, a careful selection of patients is needed. However, most patients can benefit from this surgical approach.
