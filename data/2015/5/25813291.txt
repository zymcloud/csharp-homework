Aging is associated with reduced tissue regenerative capacity. In recent years, studies in mice have shown that transfusion of blood from young animals to old ones can reverse some aging effects and increase regenerative potential similar to that seen in young animals. Because pregnancy is a unique biological model of a partially shared blood system, we have speculated that pregnancy would have a rejuvenating effect on the mother. Recent studies support this idea. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the rejuvenating effect of pregnancy on the mother.
