Classification and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma in a way that allows optimal treatment selection is challenging. This article summarizes some of the classification and staging schemes and discusses the conceptual framework that guides optimal treatment selection for each patient. The article does not exhaustively discuss each staging system proposed in the last three decades, but rather reviews the most commonly used staging systems, evaluates the rationale behind some of the newer staging systems, and compares them focusing on their use in clinical decision-making, notably choice of therapy.
