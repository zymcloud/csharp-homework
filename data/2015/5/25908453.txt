To find an efficient transfection method for metastatic cancer cells, we established a three-dimensional (3D) growth model for solid tumor cells to mimic the metastatic cancer cells in the vascular system and compared the efficiency of several transfection methods in vitro. We found that it was optimal to transfect two-dimensional cells in vitro and detach them for 3D growth 6 h later. The transfection efficiency of this method was high, and the results were reliable. This method can be used to deliver several types of small molecules into the 3D metastatic cell model. Using this method, we increased our understanding of why drugs that are effective in vitro cannot treat the disease in vivo. If this phenomenon occurs due to the resistance of the cells to the drug, other treatment agents for the disease must be identified. However, if this occurs because the agent cannot reach the cells inside the 3D aggregate, we can improve the delivery efficiency by using methods that target the agent to all cells. Briefly, the method introduced in this study will contribute to future research focusing on the 3D metastatic cell model as well as on drug development for various solid tumors.
