There have been few reports of acute liver failure (ALF), with encephalopathy and coagulopathy, caused by infiltration of the liver by malignant cells. We describe a case series of 27 patients with ALF caused by malignancy. We examined a large, multicenter ALF registry (1910 patients; mean age, 47.1 Â± 13.9 y) and found only 27 cases (1.4%) of ALF attributed to malignancy. Twenty cases (74%) presented with abdominal pain and 11 presented with ascites. The most common malignancies included lymphoma or leukemia (33%), breast cancer, (30%), and colon cancer (7%); 90% of the patients with lymphoma or leukemia had no history of cancer, compared with 25% of patients with breast cancer. Overall, 44% of the patients had evidence of liver masses on imaging. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy in 15 cases (55%) and by autopsy for 6 cases. Twenty-four patients (89%) died within 3 weeks of ALF.
