Introduction:We evaluated the long-term outcomes of 157 patients receiving radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to colorectal cancer (CRC) lung metastases.Methods:A total of 434 lesions were ablated in 199 procedures over 14 years. Thirty-two out of the 157 patients underwent multiple procedures. Our primary end-points were overall survival, disease free survival, procedure-related mortality and morbidity and various prognostic entities for survival. The survival in three subgroups were analysed: those that had undergone CRC resection and peritonectomy, CRC resection and liver resection and resection of their primary CRC alone.Results:105 patients (67%) underwent pre-RFA liver resections, 14 patients (9%) underwent pre-RFA peritonectomies and 58 patients underwent only resection of their primary tumour. There were no procedurally related deaths. The mean duration of follow up was 28 months. A chest drain was required in 18.6% of all procedures. The overall median survival was 33.3 months. Survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 89, 44 and 19.9% respectively. RFA post liver resection, post peritonectomy and post primary CRC resection alone saw median survivals of 38 months, 26 months and 27 months respectively. Tumour free survival at 12 months, 3 years and 5 years was 60.5%, 14.4% and 7% respectively. Lesion size, lesion number and pre-RFA CEA levels were not prognostic factors for overall survival or disease free survival.Conclusion:RFA is now an accepted alternative treatment modality for CRC lung metastases in selected groups of patients. RFA has a reasonable morbidity profile and a demonstrated benefit for survival in these patients.
