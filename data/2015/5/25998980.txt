Up-to-date imaging modalities such as three-dimensional dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (3D CT) and MRI may contribute to detection of hypervascular nodules in the liver. Nevertheless, distinguishing a malignancy such as hepatocellular carcinoma from benign hypervascular hyperplastic nodules (HHN) based on the radiological findings is sometimes difficult. Multiple incidental liver masses were detected via abdominal ultrasonography (US) in a 65-year-old male patient. He had no history of alcohol intake and no remarkable past medical history or relevant family history, and his physical examination results and laboratory findings were normal. 3D CT and MRI showed numerous enhanced nodules with hypervascularity during the arterial phase. After US guided liver biopsy, the pathological diagnosis was HHN. To date, several cases of HHN have been reported in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease or cirrhosis. Herein, we report on a case of HHN in a patient with no history of alcoholic liver disease or cirrhosis.
