Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor driven by complex pathological mechanisms and is characterized by fast progression and poor prognosis. The main cause of death in HCC patients is tumor metastasis. However, underlying molecular mechanisms of metastasis are largely unknown in HCC. In the present study, a novel metastasis-related gene, leucine-rich-alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1), was identified in HCC. We revealed that LRG1 expression was downregulated in HCC tissues by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. In vitro assays demonstrated LRG1 had no effect on cell proliferation. Migratory and invasive potential of HCC cells was reduced by ectopic overexpression of LRG1, whereas silencing LRG1 could enhance migration and invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, exogenous recombinant human protein of LRG1 could inhibit migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. The above findings indicate that LGR1 is involved in the inhibition of HCC metastasis and it may function as a novel metastasis suppressor in HCC.
