Objectives:To investigate the effect of Lawsonia inermis total methanolic extract (LIE) and octreotide (OC) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, depending on somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR-2) and Alfa fetoprotein (AFP) perturbations.Methods:Sixty albino mice, divided into five groups (12/each); all except control were injected with single diethyl nitrosamine (DENA) dose of 90 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally (IP). DENA group was killed at the last day of week 18. LIE group was given 200 mg/100 ml drinking water from first day of DENA injection until end of week 18. OC group received OC (0.1 mg/kg body weight, twice daily by subcutaneous injection, SC from the first day of week 17 till end of week 18. LIE + OC was given medications till the last day of week 18. Serum AFP, liver tissue SSTR-2 mRNA, its protein expression, reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were analyzed.Results:A significant increase in plasma AFP and hepatic mRNA, associated to liver tissue neoplastic changes, SSTR-2 expression and MDA with decreased hepatic GSH were observed in DENA group. These changes were significantly improved by LIE and/or OC.Conclusions:LIE and/or OC treatment has effective chemopreventive action due to their ability to alleviate oxidative stress, desensitizing cellular growth receptor to SST.
