Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has a low rate of complication and is one of the most effective and minimally invasive techniques for the treatment of liver tumors. However, a number of complications may occur in rare cases, including bronchobiliary fistula, hollow viscera perforation, diaphragmatic perforation and hernia. The present study reports a case of hepatic abscess with hepatobronchial fistula following RFA of hepatocellular carcinoma; this led to severe lung infection, respiratory failure and mortality. The present case report aims to improve understanding of the cause and mechanism of the complications arising through RFA of the liver, and highlight important factors in the prevention and management process. This case indicates that the complications of RFA may be prevented or effectively managed through preoperative evaluation, intraoperative and postoperative monitoring.
