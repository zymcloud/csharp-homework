Background/aims:To evaluate the efficacy of different therapeutic methods for finding a promising treatment to this satanic disease and determined the prognostic factors affecting the survival time.Methodology:A retrospective study was carried out on 589 patients who underwent different treatment for Primary hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombus from January, 2005 to June, 2013. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the initial treatment: Group A (N = 48), conservative treatment; Group B (N = 86), chemotherapy; Group C (N = 122), surgical resection; and Group D (N = 333), surgical resection with postoperative chemotherapy.Results:There was no significant differences in clinical information (i.e., the number of tumor, the size of tumor, and the state of portal vein tumor thrombus) among the 4 groups (P > 0.05). Both surgical resection and chemotherapy can improve the survival rate of the patients, and comprehensive treatments are of greater effect over surgical resection or chemotherapy alone. Univariate and multiple analyses revealed that the levers of AFP(p=.001), the size of tumor (p Conclusions:Positive operation treatment is the most effective therapeutic strategy for this advanced disease. Surgical resection followed by postoperative chemotherapy would increase the survival rate.
