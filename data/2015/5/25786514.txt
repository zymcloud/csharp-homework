Background:Little is known about outcomes of Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hospitalisations.Aim:To compare the characteristics and outcomes of hospitalised HBV patients to those with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and to examine variables associated with poor outcomes.Methods:Using the 2011 US Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified hospitalised patients with HBV, HCV or ALD-related admissions using ICD-9-CM codes. We compared liver-related complications between the three groups. Multivariable regression was performed to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality and length of stay.Results:A total of 22 843 HBV, 203 300 HCV and 244 383 ALD-related discharges were included. Cirrhosis was noted less commonly in those with HBV (69.1%) compared to HCV (83.9%) or ALD (80.9%) (P < 0.001). In contrast, hepatocellular cancer and acute liver failure were more common with HBV (16.5% and 5.2%) compared to HCV (10.4% and 2.8%) or ALD (2.5% and 4.9%) respectively (P < 0.0001). On multivariable analysis, adjusting for demographics, liver and nonliver comorbidity, HBV infection was associated with higher mortality compared to HCV infection [Odds ratio (OR) 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.39) or ALD (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.05-1.40). Length of hospital stay was greater with HBV compared to HCV (+0.54 days) or ALD (+0.36 days). Among those with HBV, significant factors associated with mortality included renal failure, hepatocellular cancer, respiratory failure, ascites, coagulopathy and acute liver failure.Conclusion:Patients hospitalised with HBV infection represent a particularly high-risk group with poor in-hospital outcomes and increased mortality compared to HCV infection or alcoholic liver disease.
