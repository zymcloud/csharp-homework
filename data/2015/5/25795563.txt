Introduction:Hemophilia B is an inherited X-linked recessive bleeding disorder, due to a defect in human factor IX (FIX). The main treatment for hemophilia B is replacement therapy using FIX concentrates. Prophylactic treatment in severe hemophilia B is very effective but is limited by cost issues. Production of a recombinant FIX (rFIX) with enhanced clotting activity, offering the possibility of fewer infusions and fewer costs with similar efficacy, is one of the current challenges for hemophilia B treatment. The present study focused on an important amino acid sequence known to be involved in the interaction of activated FIX (FIXa) with its cofactor, activated factor VIII (FVIIIa).Materials and methods:Using site-directed mutagenesis of glutamate E410 (c240, chymotrypsin numbering), four recombinant FIX-E410 (E410H, A, L and N) mutants were developed and produced by the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7.Results:The in-vitro clotting activity of mutant FIX molecules was 3 to 5-fold higher than wild-type recombinant FIX (FIX-WT). FIX-E410H compound showed the highest in-vitro procoagulant activity. Enhanced specific activity was confirmed using thrombin generation assay. FIX-E410H induced 5.2-fold higher thrombin generation than FIX-WT. In hemophilia B mice, we observed significantly higher in-vivo clotting activity and thrombin generating capacity with FIX-E410H compared to FIX-WT. We demonstrated that increased procoagulant activity of FIX-E410H was mainly explained by 2.5- fold enhanced affinity of the mutant for human FVIIIa.Conclusion:We have engineered and characterized four improved FIX proteins with enhanced in-vitro and in-vivo activity. Future studies are required to evaluate the immunogenicity of FIX-E410.
