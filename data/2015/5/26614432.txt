Drug resistance is one characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and can affect the prognosis of patients directly. To explore drug resistance well, we established an oxaliplatin (OXA)-resistant cell line Bel-7402/OXA by exposure to gradually increased concentration of OXA. Some biological characters, such as proliferation, migration, and invasion, were studied. Drug sensitivity and the mechanisms of drug resistance were also investigated. We found that the resistant index of Bel-7402/OXA was 8.3. In comparison with Bel-7402, the percentages of cells in S and G2/M phase were increased. The nature apoptosis rate and drug-after apoptosis rate were all decreased in Bel-7402/OXA, as compared to Bel-7402. Bel-7402/OXA acquired increased migration and invasion ability with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Knockdown of EMT transcription factor Snail could reverse EMT and sensitized Bel-7402/OXA cells to OXA. EMT was one mechanism of drug resistance and may be a novel target of treatment for drug resistance.
