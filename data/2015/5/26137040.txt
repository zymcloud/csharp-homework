We previously reported the case of a 56-year-old male who underwent surgical treatment for gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma and splenic metastasis. The present study reports the case of the same patient who underwent successful ex vivo hepatectomy and partial liver autotransplantation. Computed tomography scans demonstrated that the tumor was located in the left and caudate lobes of the liver, with hepatic vein and inferior vena cava involvement, and right portal vein compression. To clarify the association between the vessels and the tumor, a three-dimensional imaging technique was used to reconstruct the liver architecture. During the surgery, the whole liver was removed with the retrohepatic vena cava, which was replaced with a prosthetic graft without a veno-venous bypass; a portacaval shunt for the anhepatic phase was performed simultaneously. The surgery lasted 9 h, and the anhepatic phase lasted 4 h. Blood loss during the surgery was recorded at 1,500 ml. The time taken for recovery was 21 days post-surgery, and at 20 months, the patient was disease-free. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of ex vivo liver resection performed for hepatic metastasis of hepatoid adenocarcinoma to be reported.
