Dysregulation of Wnt-mediated Î²-catenin signaling is associated with carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous studies showed that the Wnt10B gene, a member of Wnt gene family, over-activated in HCC tissues and cells. Here we demonstrate that stable silencing of Wnt10B reduces the viability of HCC cells in culture. HepG2, a human HCC cell line, was cultured in vitro and Wnt10B gene in the cells stably silenced, as showed in Western blotting analysis, by the shRNA interference with lentivirus plasmid transfection. Compared to the control (HepG2 cells without Wnt10B silencing), the Wnt10B-silencing cells showed significant reductions in proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, serum deprivation-induced apoptotic death, assessed by Hoechst 33342 staining and fluorescent microscopy, increased significantly in the Wnt10B-silencing cells. FACScan analysis indicated an arrest of the cell cycle in the Wnt10B-silencing HCC cells, with significant increases in the number of cells in G0-G1 and S phases. Thus, we hypothesize that Wnt10B plays an oncogenic role in HCC and is a potential therapeutic target.
