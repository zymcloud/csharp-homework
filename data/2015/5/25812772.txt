Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) plays an integral role in natural and pathological cell biology. Overexpression of NEDD9 protein has been correlated with poor prognosis in various types of cancer. However, few available data address the precise function of the NEDD9 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we investigated NEDD9 expression in 40 primary human HCC tissues compared with matched adjacent non-tumor hepatic tissues using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the correlations between NEDD9 expression and clinicopathological factors. Statistical analyses were applied to derive prognostic values of NEDD9 in HCC. The results showed that the NEDD9 mRNA and protein expression levels in HCC tissues were significantly higher than those in matched adjacent non-tumor hepatic tissues. High NEDD9 expression was correlated with larger tumor size, advanced tumor grade, metastasis, intrahepatic venous invasion and high UICC TNM stages in HCC patients. Patients with high NEDD9 expression levels exhibited poorer recurrence-free and overall survival than those with a low NEDD9 expression. Additionally, NEDD9 expression status was an independent prognostic factor for survival. This correlation remained significant in patients with early-stage HCC or with normal serum AFP levels. The results of this study suggest that NEDD9 may be a valuable prognostic biomarker for HCC, including early-stage and AFP-normal patients.
