Background:Whether obesity affects surgical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. Here we retrospectively evaluated the impact of obesity on outcomes in HCC patients after curative hepatectomy.Methods:Patients with Child-Pugh A liver function who underwent curative hepatectomy between 2006 and 2010 were categorized as obese (BMI â‰¥25 kg/m2, n = 68) and non-obese (Results:Obese patients had higher levels of albumin and aspartate aminotransferase, and more solitary tumors compared to the non-obese patients (all P0.05). Obese and non-obese patients had comparable 30-day mortality (1.6% vs. 2.6%, P = 1.000), 90-day mortality (3.3% vs. 4.3%, P = 1.000), and incidence of postoperative complications (19.7% vs. 18.3%, P = 0.819). Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was similar for obese patients (83.6%, 63.6%, 41.6%) as for non-obese patients (80.9%, 65.9%, 49.1%; P = 0.358). Disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was also similar for obese patients (71.5%, 36.3%, 24.3%) as for non-obese ones (60.2%, 43.7%, 27.7%; P = 0.969).Conclusion:Our propensity score-matched analysis strengthens the case that obesity does not adversely affect surgical outcomes of HCC patients undergoing curative hepatectomy.
