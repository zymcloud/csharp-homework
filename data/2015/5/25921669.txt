With a better understanding of the natural history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the improvement in imaging, locoregional therapies, surgical techniques, and postoperative care, patients with HCC are now managed by a multidisciplinary team. Partial hepatic resection can be curative in patients developing HCC in the setting of normal liver parenchyma and in patients with early cirrhosis but well-preserved hepatic synthetic function. Liver transplantation offers the best long-term survival and lowest incidence of tumor recurrence in select patients with HCC and underlying cirrhosis. This article discusses the role of surgical resection and liver transplantation in the management of HCC.
