Background:This study investigates the effects of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) on migration and proliferation ability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with high- and low-metastatic potential.Methods:The hMSC and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ-1) gene infected hMSC were co-cultured with hepatoma cells. The ability of cells migration was assessed by Transwell assay. The ability of cells proliferation was detected using CCK-8 assay. The mice were engrafted with hMSC and TGFβ-1 gene infected hMSC, respectively, after hepatoma cells inoculation 15 days, twice a week for 6 weeks successively. The tumor inhibition rate was calculated. TGFβ-1, osteopontin (OPN), and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) genes expression of hepatoma cells were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) before and after co-cultured experiments.Results:TGFβ-1 infected hMSC or hMSC co-culture with hepatoma cells groups can significantly promote hepatoma cells proliferation (P Conclusions:hMSC and TGFβ-1 gene infected hMSC can promote hepatoma cells proliferation and inhibit hepatoma cells migration. hMSC and TGFβ-1 gene infected hMSC exhibit anti-tumor activity in a time-dependent manner. TGFβ-1 cytokine may be the main factor in HCC proliferation. OPN makes a significant contribution to the changes of hepatoma cells metastasis.
