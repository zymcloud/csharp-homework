Survivin expression in the serum of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and nonmalignant chronic liver diseases remain to be elucidated. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the diagnostic role of survivin in the serum of patients with HCC and identify which ELISA kit performed best in detecting the levels of serum survivin. In total, 80 patients were included in the present study, including 20 patients with HCC, 20 patients with liver cirrhosis, 20 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and 20 healthy volunteers. The levels of survivin protein in the serum were detected using two different ELISA kits (R&D and Abnova). The positive ratios of serum survivin detected by the R&D ELISA kit in all the cases were 8.75% (7/80; median, 0 pg/ml; range, 0-39.8 pg/ml) and in HCC patients were 5% (1/20; median, 0 pg/ml; range, 0-39.8 pg/ml). For the same samples analyzed using the Abnova ELISA kit, the positive ratios of serum survivin in all the cases were 22.5% (18/80; median, 0 pg/ml; range, 0-553.5 pg/ml) and in HCC patients were 25% (5/20; median, 0 pg/ml; range, 0-93.5 pg/ml). The results obtained by the different ELISA kits demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the level of survivin between HCC patients and healthy controls. The correlation coefficient was 0.0064 (P=0.481) when analyzing the same serum samples with the different ELISA kits. In addition, the highest positive ratio of serum survivin was observed using the Abnova kit. A statistically significant difference in the results was observed between the R&D and Abnova kits. In general, the levels and positive ratios of serum survivin in the patients with HCC were significantly low. Furthermore, no difference was observed between HCC patients and controls in regard to the levels of serum survivin detected by the R&D and Abnova ELISA kits. In conclusion, survivin is unlikely to be a promising serological maker for the diagnosis of HCC.
