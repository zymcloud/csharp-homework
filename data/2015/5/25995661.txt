Background/aims:(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) has been used to assess the biological behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET for predicting tumor progression and survival in patients with intermediate Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) intermediate-stage HCC treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:From February 2006 to March 2013, 210 patients treated with TACE, including 77 patients with BCLC intermediate-stage HCC, underwent examination by (18)F-FDG PET. (18)F-FDG uptake was calculated based on the tumor maximum (Tmax) standardized uptake value (SUV), the liver mean (Lmean) SUV, and the ratio of the Tmax SUV to the Lmean SUV (Tmax/Lmean).Results:The mean follow-up period for the 77 patients (52 males, 25 females; average age, 63.3 years) was 22.2 months. The median time to progression of HCC in patients with a low Tmax/Lmean (Conclusions:(18)F-FDG uptake calculated by the Tmax/Lmean using PET predicted tumor progression and survival in patients with BCLC intermediate-stage HCC treated by TACE.
