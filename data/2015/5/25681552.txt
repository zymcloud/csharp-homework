Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard of care for patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC B). Further improvement of the use of TACE was the subject of intense clinical research over the past years. The introduction of DEB-TACE brought more technical standardization and reduction of TACE related toxicity. The use of dynamic radiologic response evaluation criteria (EASL, mRECIST), uncovered the prognostic significance of objective tumor response. Finally, new approaches for better patient selection for initial and subsequent TACE treatment schedules will limit the use of TACE to some extent but have the potential to improve outcome for patients at risk for TACE-induced harm.
