Treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains challenging, particularly with the limited systemic therapy options. Sorafenib remains the only approved, targeted molecule for the treatment of advanced HCC. Although a survival benefit was demonstrated with sorafenib, it remains only true in the population of patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A disease. Sorafenib also has distinct side effects that require close monitoring. Newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors and angiogenic inhibitors have been evaluated with disappointing results, particularly in phase III trials. Herein we review the pertinent trials for targeted therapy in HCC to date.
