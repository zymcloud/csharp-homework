Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a primary malignancy of the liver, is associated with high mortality rate and poor prognosis. Emerging evidence showed that novel biomarkers are required toward a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of HCC. NEAT1 (nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1, also known as MENε/β), a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), serves as a crucial regulator in several cancers. However, the correlation between NEAT1 expression with tumorigenesis and metastasis in HCC tissues remains out of the question so far. In the current study, the aim was to evaluate the potential role of NEAT1 expression in HCC tissues and its relationship with clinicopathological parameters.Method:The expression of NEAT1 was detected by qRT-PCR, in 95 cases of adjacent non-cancerous liver and their paired HCC tissues, respectively. The associations of NEAT1 with clinicopathological features and other biological factors were further analyzed.Result:Our results revealed that NEAT1 appeared to have higher expression in the HCC tissues, compared with the adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues. High levels of NEAT1 promoted the clinical features of HCC, including the number of tumor nodes, metastasis, clinical TNM stage, the status of portal vein tumor embolus, vaso-invasion and the infiltration of tumor cells. Additionally, high NEAT1 expression levels were significantly associated with the expression level of MDTH, NM23 and MALAT1.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates that NEAT1 acts as a pivotal player in tumorigenesis and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
