Background:On the basis of now dated studies, cirrhosis is usually considered to be a contraindication in pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head (APH).Objective:Examine the outcomes of PD for APH in the presence of cirrhosis.Methods:Retrospective, multicenter study of cirrhotic patients with APH having undergone PD between January 2004 and March 2012. Cirrhotic patients were matched 1:2 for demographic, surgical and histologic criteria with non-cirrhotic patients. Primary endpoint was morbidity and mortality. Secondary endpoints were surgical parameters, morbidity related to pancreatic surgery and cirrhosis, and follow-up.Results:We included 35 patients with cirrhosis. Twenty-four patients (69%) were Child A and none were Child C. The Child A cirrhotic patients and non-cirrhotic patients respectively had complication rates of 79% vs. 43% (P = 0.002), major complication rates of 33% vs. 21% (P = 0.26), pancreatic fistula rates of 13% vs. 9% (P = 0.57), post-operative mortality of 4% vs. 5% (P = 0.94), 3-year overall survival rates of 44% vs. 50% (P = 0.46). All Child B cirrhotic patients experienced post-operative complications.Conclusion:Pancreatoduodenectomy for APH was possible in Child A cirrhotic patients with a mortality and long-term outcomes equivalent to non-cirrhotic patients. Child B cirrhosis remains a clear contraindication to surgery.
