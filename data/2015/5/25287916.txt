Background:Small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) with poorly differentiated components (PDC) are reportedly at risk of dissemination and needle tract seeding after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, although it is the preferred treatment for HCC ≤ 2 cm because of the low rate of vascular invasion. On the other hand, the clinical outcomes after hepatectomy for these tumors are still unclear because of their rarity.Methods:A total of 233 cases of solitary HCC ≤ 2 cm were retrospectively reviewed and divided into two groups according to the presence of PDC: 199 without PDC (NP-HCCs) and 34 with PDC (P-HCCs). The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were compared.Results:A comparison of clinicopathological characteristics showed that the elevation of the tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (>20 ng/mL) and des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) (>40 AU/L) was significantly frequent in P-HCCs. The 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates for P-HCCS were 39 and 29 %, respectively, which were significantly worse than those for NP-HCCs (64 and 50 %, respectively) (p Conclusion:PDC is present in 15 % of HCC
