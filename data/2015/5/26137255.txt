The significance of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow (BM) on tumor recurrence has not been investigated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of te present study was to clarify the molecular characteristics of DTCs that affect postoperative recurrence based on microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in clinical HCC patients undergoing curative resection. DTCs were prospectively collected from the BM of preoperative HCC patients using immunomagnetic beads and subjected to miRNA microarray analysis. Microarray analysis of nine HCC patients (n=5 patients with postoperative HCC recurrence, n=4 patients without HCC recurrence) demonstrated that miR-615-3p is significantly upregulated in the DTCs of patients with recurrence compared to the DTCs from patients without recurrence. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the miR-615-3p expression level is significantly correlated with malignant characteristics in HCC cells. These data suggest that miR-615-3p in DTCs may play an important role in postoperative HCC recurrence, which suggests that miR-615-3p is a potential target molecule for regulating postoperative HCC recurrence.
