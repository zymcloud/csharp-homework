Background:The number of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased in Japan.Patients and methods:A total of 280 patients with HCC treated with endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (ERFA) were enrolled in the present study. The patients were divided into two groups, an elderly group (≥ 70 years) and a non-elderly group (Results:The cumulative overall survival rates in the elderly and non-elderly groups were equivalent: 73% and 70% at three years and 57% and 52% at five years, respectively (p=0.900). The disease-free survival rates were 21% and 23% at three years and 17% and 14% at five years, respectively (p=0.628). No significant effects were observed between the two groups due to any of the covariates in the survival analysis (all p-values for interaction ≥ 0.19). The complication rates were also comparable: 5.1% in the elderly group and 8.6% in the non-elderly group.Conclusion:ERFA is safe and provides excellent therapeutic effects in elderly as well as non-elderly patients with HCC.
