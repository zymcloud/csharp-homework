The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a global public health problem with more than 240 million people chronically infected worldwide, who are at risk for end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are an estimated 600000 deaths annually from complications of HBV-related liver disease. Antiviral therapy with nucleos/tide analogs (NA) targeting the HBV polymerase (P) can inhibit disease progression by long-term suppression of HBV replication. However, treatment may fail with first generation NA therapy due to the emergence of drug-resistant mutants, as well as incomplete medication adherence. The HBV replicates via an error-prone reverse transcriptase leading to quasispecies. Due to overlapping open reading frames mutations within the HBV P can cause concomitant changes in the HBV surface gene (S) and vice versa. HBV quasispecies diversity is associated with response to antiviral therapy, disease severity and long-term clinical outcomes. Specific mutants have been associated with antiviral drug resistance, immune escape, liver fibrosis development and tumorgenesis. An understanding of HBV variants and their clinical relevance may be important for monitoring chronic hepatitis B disease progression and treatment response. In this review, we will discuss HBV molecular virology, mechanism of variant development, and their potential clinical impact.
