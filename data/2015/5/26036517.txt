Background:Incidental hepatocellular carcinomas (iHCCs) are tumors discovered on the explanted liver that were not present on imaging before transplantation. The natural history, histopathologic characteristics, and prognosis are not clearly defined.Methods:We compared the characteristics of iHCC and previously known hepatocellular carcinoma (pkHCC) in patients who underwent liver transplantation from 1998 to 2012 in a retrospective study.Results:During this period a total of 675 patients were transplanted; 56 patients (9%) had pkHCC and 12 (2%) had iHCC. The sex and age distributions were similar. The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score in iHCC patients was 17.0 versus 13.0 in patients with pkHCC (P = .001). Thirty-three percent of iHCC patients had multiple tumors, and 25% had bilobar involvement. The median cumulative tumor size in iHCC was 1.8 cm, and 5.5 cm in pkHCC (P = .005). Incidence of microvascular invasion was not different (16.7% vs 38.9%; P = .191). American Joint Committee on Cancer T1 stage was found in 58.3% of patients with iHCC and in 22.2% of pkHCC patients. Patients with iHCC had 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals, respectively, of 100%, 83% and 64%, compared with 80%, 66%, and 38% for patients with pkHCC (P = .138). None of the patients with iHCC had recurrence of HCC, whereas incidence of recurrence in pkHCC patients was 12.5%.Conclusions:iHCC occurred in patients with more advanced liver disease. The cumulative tumor size of iHCC was smaller but one-third were multifocal. Survival was similar to patients with pkHCC, and recurrence was not noted in patients with iHCC.
