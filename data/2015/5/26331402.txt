Aim:A lack of donors in liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a big issue. There is no consensus regarding whether interventional radiology for HCC in patients with Child-Pugh C liver cirrhosis will improve prognosis. To elucidate the effectiveness of such treatment, we evaluated the clinical features of affected patients.Methods:Patients with naive HCC of Child-Pugh C (n = 236) were enrolled. Two of them were treated with LT after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were used as bridging treatments. After exclusion of a total of three patients who received LT, we evaluated clinical factors related to improved prognosis.Results:The percentage of all patients with total bilirubin of less than 3 mg/dL was 41.1%. The prognosis of patients who were received treatments (n = 30; ablative therapy 10, TACE 20) was better than non-treated patients (n = 18; mean survival time [MST] 22.2 vs 13.8 months, P = 0.021, respectively) in patients with up to 7 criteria and total bilirubin of less than 3 mg/dL (n = 48). On the other hand, there was no difference in prognosis between those who underwent ablative therapies (n = 10) and those who received TACE (n = 20) (MST 22.2 vs 16.9 months, P = 0.390).Conclusion:Therapy for HCC may prolong survival in patients with naive HCC, with up to 7 criteria and total bilirubin of less than 3 mg/dL.
