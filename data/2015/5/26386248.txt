Aim:Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (P-RFA) therapy is a widely applied treatment for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, local recurrence is a major issue of HCC located at the surface of the liver (surface HCC). The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of laparoscopic hepatic resection (LH) and P-RFA for surface HCC in case-control patient groups using the propensity score.Methods:Between 2011 and 2013, 40 and 52 patients underwent LH and P-RFA for surface HCC (â‰¤3 cm, 1-3 nodules). To correct the difference in clinicopathological factors between the two groups, propensity score matching was used at a 1:1 ratio, which resulted in a comparison of 27 patients/group. We compared outcomes between the two groups, with special reference to local recurrence.Results:Clinicopathological variables were well balanced between the two groups. One patient in the LH group was converted to open surgery due to adhesion. The incidence of complications was 0% in the P-RFA group and 15% (four patients) in the LH group (P = 0.11); however, none of these four patients in the LH group sustained severe complications. The duration of hospitalization following treatment was longer in the LH group than in the P-RFA group (12.6 vs 7.6 days, P Conclusion:LH is an effective treatment for surface HCC with regard to control of local recurrence.
