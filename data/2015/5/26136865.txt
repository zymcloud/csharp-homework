Elevated expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been reported in different human malignancies. To understand its role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the expression of GAPDH was quantitatively measured in a cohort of 72 male HCC patients without preoperative treatment, all with evidence of chronic HBV infection. Using C-terminal banding protein 1 (CTBP1) or hypoxanthine phosphori-bosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) as reference genes, the level of GAPDH mRNA in tumor tissue was found to be significantly higher compared with that in paired non tumor tissues (P=0.0087 for CTBP1; P=0.0116 for HPRT1). Accordingly, compared with the non-tumor tissue, 37.5% (27/72) of patients' tumor tissues had a more than 2-fold increase of GAPDH expression. Furthermore, following knockdown GAPDH expression via siRNA transient transfection, HepG2 cells exhibited enhanced resistance to cytosine arabinoside (IC50, 308.28 µM vs. 67.68 µM in the control; P=0.01). Notably, higher GAPDH expression was significantly associated with lower liver fibrosis score (P=0.0394) and a tendency towards higher survival rates for patients with HCC. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first study to report that the elevated expression levels of GAPDH in HCC tumor tissue may be relevant to an improved fibrosis score and survival probability in male patients with HBV infection; however, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation.
