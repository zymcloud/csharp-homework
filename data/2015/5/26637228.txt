Non-invasive biomarkers of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could offer immense benefits. Currently available tumor markers for HCC are of not much clinical relevance. In this study, we investigated the potential for using a panel of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel tumor markers in conjunction with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for diagnosis of HCC. Serum expression of four miRNAs was assessed in 150 subjects (90 cases of HCC and 60 cases without cancer) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the potential use of miRNAs for detection of HCC. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. A panel of serum miRNAs (miR-125b, miR-223, miR-27a, and miR-26a) used in conjunction with AFP helped differentiate HCC patients from those in the non-cancer group after adjusting for age and gender, with the area under the curve of 0.870. In addition, the use of miR-125b/miR-27a panel differentiated HBV-related early-stage HCC with a high sensitivity (80.0 %) and specificity (87.2 %) in AFP-negative (-) subjects. A combination of serum miR-125b, miR-223, miR-27a, and miR-26a as a second-line tests could help detect HCC in AFP (-) subjects. The panel of miR-125b/miR-27a/AFP had a higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of early-stage HCC as compared to that of a single marker.
