Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) deriving from cirrhosis with HBV infection harbors higher morbidity and poor prognosis. The diagnosis of HCC at its early stage is essential for improving the effect of treatment and survival rate of patients.Method:Affymetrix GeneChip was practiced to establish gene expression profile and significance analysis of microarray (SAM) as well as prediction analysis of microarray (PAM) was utilized to screen candidate marker genes in tissue of carcinoma and para-cancerous with cirrhosis from 15 hepatitis B virus (HBV) related HCC patients.Result:Total 497 differential genes were selected by microarray (fold change >2; P valueConclusion:Over-expression of FOXP1 and SPINK1 may participate in the carcinogenesis of HBV related cirrhosis. They could use as potential biomarkers for diagnosing early HCC.
Cirrhosis; Forkhead box protein 1 (FOXP1); Hepatitis B virus (HBV); Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); Serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1).
