Background & aims:Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is an option for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of the poor prognosis in HAIC non-responders, it is important to identify patients who may benefit from continuous HAIC treatment; however, there are currently no therapeutic assessment scores for this identification. Therefore, we aimed to establish a new therapeutic assessment score for such patients.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 90 advanced HCC patients with elevated baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) levels and analyzed various parameters for their possible use as predictors of response and survival. AFP and DCP responses were assessed after half a course of HAIC (2 weeks); a positive-response was defined as a reduction of â‰¥ 20% from baseline.Results:Multivariate analysis identified DCP response (odds ratio 16.03, p Conclusions:The ACTH score may be useful in the therapeutic assessment of HCC patients receiving HAIC.
