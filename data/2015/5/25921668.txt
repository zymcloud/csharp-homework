Diabetes and obesity are associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD is the commonest cause of chronic liver disease. HCC can develop in NAFLD patients even without cirrhosis, suggesting an association between the metabolic process and HCC and raising a concern that many cancers could be missed given high NAFLD prevalence and screening limitations. The increasing prevalence of these conditions and lack of effective treatments necessitate a better understanding of their connection. This article defines the known interrelationships and common pathways between NAFLD, diabetes, obesity and HCC and possible chemoprevention strategies.
