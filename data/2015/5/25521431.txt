Background:Liver transplant recipients have an increased risk of developing de novo malignancies.Methods:We conducted a prospective evaluation of clinicopathological data and predictors for overall survival (OS) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) after liver transplantation (1988 to 2010).Results:Thirty-three of 2040 patients who underwent liver transplantation (1.6%) developed de novo HNSCC. The incidence of HNSCC in liver transplant recipients with end-stage alcoholic liver disease (26) was 5%. After a median follow-up of 9 years, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS rates were 74%, 47%, and 34%, respectively. Tumor size, cervical lymph node metastases, tumor site, and therapy (surgery only vs surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy [RT]/chemoradiotherapy [CRT] vs RT/CRT only; p < .0001) were significantly associated with OS in univariate analysis. However, surgery only predicted OS independently in multivariate analysis.Conclusion:Early diagnosis and surgical treatment of de novo HNSCC are crucial to the outcome. HNSCC risk should be taken into close consideration during posttransplantation follow-up examinations, especially among patients with a positive history of smoking and alcohol consumption.
