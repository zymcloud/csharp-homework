Objective:Inflammation and complement activation initiated by mannose-binding lectin (MBL) may be implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications. We investigated serum MBL levels in patients with diabetes with and without diabetic retinopathy (DR).Research design and methods:Serum MBL levels were determined in 348 patients with diabetes and in 100 healthy control subjects. The prediction value of MBL was compared with diabetes duration, hs-CRP, and other known predictors. Multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression models.Results:MBL levels on admission were significantly increased in patients with diabetes with DR (P Conclusions:The current study demonstrated that MBL appears to be an independent biomarker for DR in the Chinese population, suggesting a possible role of MBL in the pathogenesis of DR complications in diabetes.
