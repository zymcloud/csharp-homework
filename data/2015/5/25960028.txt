Hepatitis C is a global public health burden. Long-term consequences are the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Introduction of different direct acting antivirals targeting the hepatitis C proteins has considerably increased rates of sustained viral response. First active substances introduced in 2011 were NS3/4A protease inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir. In 2013/2014 the second generation of direct acting antivirals sofosbuvir, simeprevir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir and 3D therapy containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir followed. This review focuses on treatment outcomes and costs of introduced direct acting antivirals. We provide an overview on SVR-rates in clinical trials and clinical practice, treatment costs in different countries as well as results of cost-effectiveness analyses for different treatment strategies.
