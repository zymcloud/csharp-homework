A 50-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis associated with hepatitis B virus was found to have a hypoechoic liver tumor of 20 mm in diameter on ultrasonography. Dynamic computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple tumors in the liver. The portal vein passed through the tumor, which is not a typical feature of hepatocellular carcinoma. We subsequently performed tumor biopsy and diagnosed mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma of hepatic origin. Here we report this rare case of hepatic MALT lymphoma in a patient with chronic hepatitis B, and present a review of the literature.
