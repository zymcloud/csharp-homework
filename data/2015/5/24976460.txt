Aim:To better define clinically relevant non-classic radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We retrospectively evaluated the influence of acute liver toxicities on fatal hepatic failure in HCC patients treated with SBRT. Between April 2006 and February 2012, 194 HCC were treated with SBRT. Among them, patients followed up for more than 6 months were eligible. Laboratory results and Child-Pugh (CP) scores were obtained before treatment and at monthly follow-up visits. Toxicities were evaluated by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Possible definitions of RILD were evaluated with respect to fatal hepatic failure within 12 months.Results:One hundred and eighty HCC were evaluated with a median follow-up of 28.2 months. Fatal hepatic failure within 12 months occurred in eight patients (4%). On univariate analysis, grade 3 or more elevated transaminases, CP score of 8 or more, and/or grade 3 or more decreased platelet count significantly predicted fatal hepatic failure within 12 months. Combinations of these factors (i.e. having at least one criterion) also predicted fatal hepatic failure within 12 months (16% with criteria vs 1% without criteria). Two-year overall survival rates for patients with and without RILD was 64.9% and 83.8% (P Conclusion:We identified three criteria that affected overall survival in HCC patients treated with SBRT. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate the safety and effect of SBRT for HCC.
