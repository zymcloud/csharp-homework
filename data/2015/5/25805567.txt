Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are aggressive cancers, and the prognosis of HCC patients is poor. This study investigated the roles of CD29 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemoresistance and radioresistance in HCC tumors. CD29 expression in HCC and peritumoral tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry. CD29 overexpression was established by an adenovirus-carrying CD29 gene expression cassette, while silencing of CD29 expression was established by an adenovirus-carrying shRNA. Western blot was used to measure protein expression, and MTT was used to analyze cell viability. Xenograft HCC mouse model was established by inoculating isolated CD29(+) and CD29(-) HCC tumor cells. Significantly higher percentage of positive CD29 expression was observed in HCC tissues compared to peritumoral tissues. Xenograft CD29(+) tumors grew more quickly than CD29(-) tumors. CD29(+) tumors were more resistant to radiotherapy and cisplatin therapy than CD29(-) tumors. Overexpression of CD29 significantly increased the resistance of CD29(-) tumors to radiation and cisplatin treatment. In contrast, silencing of CD29 expression significantly sensitized CD29(+) tumors to irradiation and cisplatin treatment. Overexpression of CD29 decreased E-cadherin, but increased fibronectin, vimentin, ILK activity, Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation, and mTORC1 protein expression in Hep G2 and THLE-3 cells. Moreover, overexpression of CD29 significantly increased the resistance of Hep G2 and THLE-3 cells to starvation, radiation, and cisplatin treatments. This study suggests that CD29 plays a crucial role in the resistance of HCC to chemo/radiotherapy and EMT of liver epithelial cells.
