Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), a member of the transforming growth factor beta family, functions as a multi-functional cytokine and plays a key role in cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The 509 C/T polymorphism in the TGF-β1 gene has been implicated in the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; however, little is known regarding the relationship between TGF-β1 gene mutations and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HCV-infected patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the TGF-β1 polymorphisms 509 C>T on the occurrence of HCC in patients chronically infected with HCV in a Chinese Han population. The results showed that HCC patients had a higher frequency of the TGF-β1 -509 TT genotype distribution of the TGF-β1 -509 polymorphism and a lower frequency of the CC genotype. Serum TGF-β1 levels were significantly higher in patients with the TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype. In this study, we confirmed that the TGF-β1 polymorphism 509 C>T is associated with the risk of HCC in HCV-infected patients.
