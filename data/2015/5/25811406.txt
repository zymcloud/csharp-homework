To evaluate the anticancer mechanism of the new ruthenium complex-Λ-WH0402 at the cellular level, the in vitro cytotoxicity of Λ-WH0402 was investigated on 10 human tumor cell lines. Λ-WH0402 was found to have higher anticancer activity than cisplatin toward human liver cancer HCCLM6 cells that have high tumor metastatic characteristics. Meanwhile, Λ-WH0402 showed an antimetastatic effect on HCCLM6 cells in vitro, mostly through its effect on cell adhesion, invasion and migration. In addition, Λ-WH0402 significantly reduced tumor metastasis to the lungs in orthotopic mouse hepatocellular cancer (HCC) models induced by HCCLM6 cells. Furthermore, Λ-WH0402 exerted an inhibitory effect on tumor cell growth and proliferation and induced dose-dependent cell cycle arrest in the S phase in HCCLM6 cells. Immunoblotting analysis showed that Λ-WH0402 not only decreased the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1 (NAF-1), but also significantly increased the expression of Beclin-1 in HCCLM6 cells. More importantly, we identified that Λ-WH0402 treatment reduced the interaction between Bcl-2 and Beclin-1, and increased the expression of autophagic activation marker LC3B-II in HCCLM6 cells. On the whole, our results suggested that the anitcancer activity of Λ-WH0402 is mediated through promoting the Beclin-1-dependent autophagy pathway in HCCLM6 cells.
