EMMPRIN plays important roles in cancer development, which includes EMMPRIN 1, 2, 3, and 4 isoforms. EMMPRIN2 is the main component in human cancers, but its regulation by miRNAs is still unclear. In this study, we will investigate the mechanism of EMMPRIN regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by miRNAs. Through RT-PCR, we found that EMMPRIN2 was the main isoform in HCC cells. EMMPRIN2 was down-regulated significantly by predicted miRNAs and miR-485-5p was one of the miRNA that regulated EMMPRIN in HCC cell lines. It was verified that EMMPRIN was a target gene of miR-485-5p by using luciferase analysis assay. We found that miR-485-5p was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and that its expression was inversely correlated with the TNM stage and metastasis in HCC samples. Results of cellular functions in HCC showed that miR-485-5p could inhibit cell proliferation and metastasis. Additionally, miR-485-5p overexpression suppressed HCC growth in vivo by down-regulation of EMMPRIN. Our study for the first time demonstrated that miR-485-5p represses HCC invasive and metastatic capacities by targeting EMMPRIN expression.
