In order to determine the protein expression of S‑phase kinase‑associated protein 2 (Skp2) and p27kip1, and to evaluate their possible prognostic values in malignant liver cancer, tissue samples from 50 patients and 40 controls were assessed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Positive expression of Skp2 was observed in 35 (70.0%) of the hepatocellular carcinoma samples; however, the positive expression of p27kip1 was observed in 6 (15.0%) of the hepatocellular carcinoma samples. The expression of Skp2 was significantly negatively correlated with the expression of p27 (P
