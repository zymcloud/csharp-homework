Purpose:To compare long-term survival after hepatic resection and transarterial chemoembolization of large solitary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:Analysis of 91 and 68 consecutive patients with large (â‰¥ 5 cm) solitary HCCs who underwent hepatic resection and transarterial chemoembolization, respectively, was performed. Overall survival and time to progression (TTP) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Cox proportional hazards model. To control for treatment-selection bias, matched groups of patients were selected using a propensity score matching method, and survival analysis was repeated.Results:During the follow-up period (median, 60.7 mo; range, 0.5-122.2 mo), 42 (46%) patients in the hepatic resection group and 35 (51%) patients in the transarterial chemoembolization group died. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates of the hepatic resection and transarterial chemoembolization groups were 91.1%, 80.0%, and 66.4% (hepatic resection group) and 89.8%, 72.8%, and 49.6% (transarterial chemoembolization group) (P = .023). TTP was significantly longer in patients who underwent hepatic resection (P Conclusions:Transarterial chemoembolization can lead to results comparable to hepatic resection in the treatment of large solitary HCCs, particularly in patients with clinically presumed portal hypertension.
