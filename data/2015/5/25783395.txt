Background/purpose:Although the usefulness of intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent imaging for the resection of hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported, its usefulness for the resection of hepatoblastoma remains unclear. This study clarifies the feasibility of intraoperative ICG fluorescent imaging for the resection of hepatoblastoma.Methods:In three hepatoblastoma patients, a primary tumor, recurrent tumor, and lung metastatic lesions were intraoperatively examined using a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system after the preoperative administration of ICG.Results:ICG fluorescent imaging was useful for the surgical navigation in hepatoblastoma patients. In the first case, the primary hepatoblastoma exhibited intense fluorescence during right hepatectomy, but no fluorescence was detected in the residual liver. In the second case, a recurrent tumor exhibited fluorescence between the residual liver and diaphragm. A complete resection of the residual liver, with a partial resection of the diaphragm, followed by liver transplantation was performed. In the third case with multiple lung metastases, each metastatic lesion showed positive fluorescence, and all were completely resected. These fluorescence-positive lesions were pathologically proven to be viable hepatoblastoma cells.Conclusion:Intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging for patients with hepatoblastoma was feasible and useful for identifying small viable lesions and confirming that no remnant tumor remained after resection.
