Aim:To compare the prognostic ability of inflammation scores for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Data of 224 consecutive patients who underwent TACE for unresectable HBV-related HCC from September 2009 to November 2011 were retrieved from a prospective database. The association of inflammation scores with clinicopathologic variables and overall survival (OS) were analyzed, and receiver operating characteristic curves were generated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the discriminatory ability of each inflammation score and staging system, including tumor-node-metastasis, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, and Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) scores.Results:The median follow-up period was 390 d, the one-, two-, and three-year OS were 38.4%, 18.3%, and 11.1%, respectively, and the median OS was 390 d. The Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), modifed GPS, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and Prognostic Index were associated with OS. The GPS consistently had a higher AUC value at 6 mo (0.702), 12 mo (0.676), and 24 mo (0.687) in comparison with other inflammation scores. CLIP consistently had a higher AUC value at 6 mo (0.656), 12 mo (0.711), and 24 mo (0.721) in comparison with tumor-node-metastasis and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging systems. Multivariate analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase, GPS, and CLIP were independent prognostic factors for OS. The combination of GPS and CLIP (AUC = 0.777) was superior to CLIP or GPS alone in prognostic ability for OS.Conclusion:The prognostic ability of GPS is superior to other inflammation scores for HCC patients undergoing TACE. Combining GPS and CLIP improved the prognostic power for OS.
