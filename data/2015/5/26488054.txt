A laparoscopic approach is being used increasingly in specialist centres for the resection of hepatocellular carcinomas and compares favourably with the traditional open approach, in terms of perioperative morbidity and mortality as well as long-term survival. We present a case of port site recurrence in a patient who underwent a laparoscopic left lateral segmentectomy for a hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed during investigation of symptomatic gallstones. Nearly three years following surgery, surveillance computed tomography demonstrated a suspicious lesion at the site of one of the laparoscopic ports. Further resection was carried out and the lesion was confirmed histologically to be an isolated recurrence of the primary hepatocellular carcinoma, involving peritoneum and adominal wall. This case demonstrates that it is possible to encounter port site metastasis following laparoscopic resection of primary liver tumours although the incidence is very rare.
