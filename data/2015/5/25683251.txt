To improve the outcome of cancer chemotherapy, strategies to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs are required. Sorafenib is the only drug to prolong overall survival of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, the outcome is still not satisfactory. Retinoids, vitamin A derivatives, have been known to exhibit inhibitory effects on various cancers including HCC. In this study, we investigated the effects of combined treatment using sorafenib and retinoids including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), NIK-333, and Am80 on HCC cells. Cell viability assays in six HCC cell lines, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, HuH6, HLE, HLF, and Hep3B, revealed that 5 and 10 Î¼M ATRA, concentrations that do not exert cytotoxic effects, enhanced the cytotoxicity of sorafenib, being much more effective than NIK-333 and Am80. We found that ATRA induced AMP-activated protein kinase activation, which was followed by reduced intracellular ATP level. Gene expression analysis revealed that ATRA decreased the expression of glycolytic genes such as GLUT-1 and LDHA. In the combination treatment using ATRA and sorafenib, increased apoptosis, followed by the activation of p38 MAPK and JNK, the upregulation and translocation of Bax to mitochondria, and the activation of caspase-3, was observed. Suppression of AMP-activated protein kinase by siRNA restored the viability of the cells treated with ATRA and sorafenib. Our results thus indicate that ATRA is useful for enhancing the cytotoxicity of sorafenib against HCC cells by regulating the energy metabolism of HCC cells.
