Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and is known to most often present with symptomatology pertaining to local hepatic disease. Although HCC is known to metastasize to lungs, abdominal lymph nodes, adrenal glands and the vertebral column, it is rather rare to come across patients with skull metastasis. The manifestation of a solitary frontal bone metastasis leading to a painless lump over the forehead as the initial presenting feature of HCC is highly unusual. This case report pertains to a 40-year-old male patient who had initially observed a painless lump over his forehead that was gradually increasing in size over a span of 3 months. He sought medical attention when, after several months, the "painless lump" suddenly became painful. Investigations revealed the involvement of both the outer and the inner table of the frontal bone, and a biopsy revealed the histopathology to be that of HCC. On further investigation, he was found to have systemic disseminated disease involving both the left and right lungs and vertebrae and treatment was initiated with sorafenib. Despite an initial partial response, the patient subsequently succumbed to hepatic failure. This case report illustrates the fact that HCC can silently progress, and even lead to dissemination and distant metastases before becoming clinically evident.
