Objective:The objective of our study was to compare diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) with conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for assessing the response to treatment in hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Subjects and methods:Sixty-two consecutive patients with treated or untreated hypervascular HCC underwent MRI of the liver including DKI (b values of 0, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 s/mm(2)). The mean kurtosis (MK) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the hepatic parenchyma and of the HCCs were computed. The detectability of viable HCC based on MK and ADC values was compared. We also assessed the correlation between Child-Pugh grades and MK or ADC values.Results:For a total of 112 HCC nodules (viable, n = 63; nonviable, n = 49), the MK value was significantly higher for the viable group (mean ± SD, 0.81 ± 0.11) than for the non-viable group (0.57 ± 0.11) (p Conclusion:DKI can be a new option for the assessment of posttherapeutic response in HCC.
