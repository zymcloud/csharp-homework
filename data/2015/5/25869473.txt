Heptatocellular (HCC) is a rapidly progressive fatal malignancy often presenting at an advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis. Loco-regional therapies for early-stage HCC including surgical options (surgical resection and liver transplant) and percutaneous ablations could be potentially curative. Recent technological advances in percutaneous image-guided ablations have provided clinicians with a range of options which have proven to be equal to or better than surgical resection. For intermediate- and advanced-stage HCC, palliative therapies are available which significantly increase overall and progression-free survival. These palliative therapies include intra-arterial chemo- or radioembolization as monotherapy or in combination with percutaneous ablation or antiangiogenic drugs. Availability of a multitude of treatment options for various stages of HCC as well as conflicting data comparing their safety and efficacy presented in the several randomized controlled trials poses a significant challenge to hepatologists, surgeons, and interventional radiologists in selecting optimal therapy for their patients. The aim of this article is to review and discuss currently available therapies at each stage of HCC along with presenting clinical data published in most recent and relevant randomized controlled trials.
