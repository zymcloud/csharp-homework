In the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, tumor hypoxia plays an important role, as does activation of the Wnt pathway. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression and interrelationship between hypoxia and Wnt-pathway-associated proteins as prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. Expression of HIF-1α, CA-IX, E-cadherin, β-catenin, and Ki-67 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 179 primary hepatocellular carcinoma cases. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationship between the clinicopathological factors, protein expression, overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). By univariate analysis, tumor stage, size, satellitosis, and vascular invasion were confirmed as prognostic factors for worse OS and RFS. High expression of HIF-1α, CA-IX, β-catenin, Ki-67, and E-cadherin was observed in 60, 15, 64, 8, and 64 % of tumors, respectively, and this was significantly associated with poor OS. CA-IX, HIF-1α, and E-cadherin were independent predictors of poor prognosis. We stratified 169 patients into four groups according to the expression level of hypoxia and Wnt pathway markers. The group with high expression of both hypoxia and Wnt-pathway-associated proteins showed worst OS. The poor survival of this group was also significant in patients with early stage disease and tumor size of less than 5 cm (p
