Background:The oncogenic PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is frequently activated in HCC. Data on the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus, is limited in HCC patients with concomitant chronic liver disease. The objectives of this study were: (1) In phase I, to determine DLTs and MTD of temsirolimus in HCC patients with chronic liver disease; (2) In phase II, to assess activity of temsirolimus in HCC, and (3) to explore potential biomarkers for response.Methods:Major eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed advanced HCC and adequate organ function. In Phase I part of the study, temsirolimus was given weekly in 3-weekly cycle; dose levels were 20 mg (level 1), 25 mg (level 2) and 30 mg (level 3). The MTD was used in the subsequent phase II part; the primary endpoint was PFS and secondary endpoints were response and OS. In addition, exploratory analysis was conducted on pre-treatment tumour tissues to determine stathmin, pS6, pMTOR or p-AKT expressions as potential biomarkers for response. Overall survival and PFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Reassessment CT scans were done every 6 weeks. All adverse events were reported using CTCAE v3.Results:The Phase I part consisted of 19 patients, 2 of 6 patients at level 3 experienced DLT; dose level 2 was determined to be the MTD. The phase II part consisted of 36 patients. Amongst 35 assessable patients, there were 1 PR, 20 SD and 14 PD. Overall, the median PFS was 2.83 months (95% C.I. 1.63-5.24). The median OS was 8.89 months (95% C.I. 5.89-13.30). Grade â‰¥ 3 that occurred in > 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia (4) and hyponatraemia (4). Exploratory analysis revealed that disease stabilization (defined as CR + PR + SD > 12 weeks) in tumours having high and low pMTOR H-scores to be 70% and 29% respectively (OR 5.667, 95% CI 1.129-28.454, p = 0.035).Conclusions:In HCC patients with chronic liver disease, the MTD of temsirolimus was 25 mg weekly in a 3-week cycle. The targeted PFS endpoint was not reached. However, further studies to identify appropriate patient subgroup are warranted.Trial registration:This study has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Id: NCT00321594) on 1 December 2010.
