Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically recurs following primary treatment. The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ablative therapies for recurrent HCC. The secondary objective was to identify any factors associated with prognosis following ablation for recurrent disease.Methods:A systematic search of the literature published between January 2000 and December 2013 was undertaken using the PubMed, Medline and Scopus databases. Reference lists from selected studies were manually searched to ensure complete capture of any relevant data.Results:A total of 19 studies were included in the review. The median age of patients undergoing ablation for recurrent HCC was 58 years (range 52-69 years) and 85 % of patients had cirrhosis (range 56-100 %). HCC recurred as a single nodule in 79 % of those treated with ablation (range 46-100 %). There were few significant complications associated with any form of ablation. Sufficient data were only available to allow analysis of survival outcomes following radiofrequency ablation (RFA). After RFA the median, 1, 3 and 5-year survivals were 84 % (73-99 %), 51 % (42-84 %) and 40 % (28-83 %), respectively. The only factor consistently associated with overall survival following ablation for recurrence was the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level.Conclusion:Comparable survival figures from previously published systematic reviews suggest that hepatic resection is the most effective treatment for recurrent HCC. However, ablation can be a safe and effective option for the majority of patients with recurrent disease who are unsuitable for surgery. Elevated levels of AFP suggest a poorer prognosis following ablation.
