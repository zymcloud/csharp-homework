Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major obstacle in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. MicroRNA&mdash;145 (miR&mdash;145) has been shown to be down&mdash;regulated in several cancers and may be involved in the process of carcinogenesis. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of miR&mdash;145 in adriamycin (ADM)&mdash;resistant human HCC cells. We found that miR&mdash;145 was significantly reduced in HepG2/ADM and HuH7/ADM cells compared with the chemosensitive parental cells. Up&mdash;regulation of miR&mdash;145 increased the ADM cytotoxicity in chemoresistant tumor cells. In addition, Smad3 was identied as the target of miR&mdash;145 and miR&mdash;145 overexpression inhibited Smad3 expression both at the mRNA and protein levels. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Smad3 was a direct target of miR&mdash;145. Moreover, up&mdash;regulation of miR&mdash;145 suppressed Smad3 related EMT features as shown by increased expression of E&mdash;cadherin and reduced vimentin level in HepG2/ADM and HuH7/ADM cells. Our study demonstrated that miR&mdash;145 modulated both chemoresistance and EMT in HCC cells, and up&mdash;regulation of miR&mdash;145 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of chemoresistant HCC.
