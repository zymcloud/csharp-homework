Aims:To characterize serum amyloid A (SAA)-positive hepatocellular neoplasms/nodules arising in alcoholic cirrhosis, which are detected as hypervascular hepatocellular nodules resembling hepatocellular carcinoma on imaging.Methods and results:Fifty-three hepatocellular nodules were examined with immunostaining for SAA, glutamine synthetase and glypican-3 in 23 patients (four women and 19 men) with alcoholic cirrhosis. Sixteen nodules were examined with magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid enhancement (EOB-MRI). Somatic mutations in IL6ST, GNAS and STAT3 were examined in 19 nodules. Thirty-six nodules in 18 patients were diagnosed as SAA-positive hepatocellular neoplasms/nodules, and the remaining 17 nodules in eight patients were SAA-negative focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)-like nodules. SAA-positive hepatocellular neoplasms/nodules showed significantly more extensive sinusoidal dilatation, inflammatory reaction, abnormally thick arteries and cellular atypia than FNH-like nodules (P Conclusions:This study showed that approximately two-thirds of hypervascular hepatocellular nodules arising in alcoholic cirrhosis were SAA-positive hepatocellular neoplasms/nodules, which show different findings on the EOB-MRI. STAT3 mutations were detected in 11.8% of SAA-positive hepatocellular neoplasms/nodules, supporting a neoplastic nature.
