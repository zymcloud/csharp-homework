Background/aims:The aim of the present study was to define the prognostic factors for survival after hepatic metastasectomy from breast cancer.Methodology:Between October 2003 and December 2013, 28 patients with hepatic metastases from breast cancer underwent liver resection with curative intent. All patients had obtained locoregional control of their primary breast tumors. Various perioperative variables were investigated retrospectively to confirm the role of pulmonary metastasectomy and to identify possible prognostic factors for survival after hepatic metastasectomy.Results:Overall survival after liver resection was 53% and 23% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Disease-free survival after hepatic metastasectomy was 20% and 0% at 5 and 10 years. On multivariate analysis, disease-free interval longer than 36 months (P = 0.003), no tumor recurrence before hepatic metastasectomy (P = 0.020) and complete resection (P = 0.008) provided a significantly favorable overall survival.Conclusion:Hepatic metastasectomy for breast cancer can be associated with prolonged survival. Complete resection, longer disease-free interval and no tumor recurrence before liver resection are the most predictive factors for prolonged survival. However, the accumulation of more cases is necessary to evaluate the prognostic factors properly and to determine the selection criteria for liver resection.
