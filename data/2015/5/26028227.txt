Purpose:To describe efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for the treatment of inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The records of 77 consecutive patients treated with SBRT for 97 liver-confined HCC were reviewed. A total dose of 45Gy in 3 fractions was prescribed to the 80% isodose line. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity were studied.Results:The median follow-up was 12months. The median tumor diameter was 2.4cm. The LC rate was 99% at 1 and 2years. The 1 and 2-year OS were 81.8% and 56.6% respectively. The median time to progression was 9months (0-38). The rate of hepatic toxicity was 7.7% [1.6-13.7], 14.9% [5.7-23.2] and 23.1% [9.9-34.3] at 6months, 1year and 2years respectively. In multivariate analysis, female gender (HR 7.87 [3.14-19.69]), a BCLC B-C stage (HR 3.71 [1.41-9.76]), a sum of all lesion diameters â©¾2cm (HR 7.48 [2.09-26.83]) and a previous treatment (HR 0.10 [0.01-0.79]) were independent prognostic factors of overall survival.Conclusion:SBRT allows high local control for inoperable hepatocellular carcinomas. It should be considered when an ablative treatment is indicated in Child A patients.
