Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide, which is especially prevalent in Asia. Elucidating the molecular basis of HCC is crucial to develop targeted diagnostic tools and novel therapies. Recent studies have identified AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) as a broad-spectrum tumor suppressor. We evaluated the clinical implications of decreased ARID1A expression in HCC, and investigated the mechanisms of ARID1A-mediated tumor suppression.Methods:Quantitative PCR, western blotting, immunohistochemical analysis of ARID1A mRNA and protein expression was conducted in 64 paired HCC and adjacent non-tumorous tissues. ARID1A function was evaluated in vitro in MHCC-97H and Huh7 HCC cell lines, and in vivo in a xenografted HCC tumor model.Results:ARID1A mRNA and protein expression were significantly decreased in HCC tissues, and decreased expression was significantly associated with overall metastasis, including local lymph node and distant metastasis, and poor prognosis. ARID1A knockdown promoted HCC cell migration and invasion in vitro, whereas overexpression of ARID1A inhibited migration and invasion. E-cadherin levels were closely correlated with ARID1A expression, suggesting a role in migration and invasion. In addition, ARID1A and E-cadherin (CDH1) expression were found to be regulated in a coordinated fashion in HCC samples. Furthermore, ARID1A knockdown significantly increased HCC tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo.Conclusions:ARID1A served as an important tumor suppressor. Decreased expression of ARID1A was associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and reduced overall survival in mice and humans. ARID1A could represent a promising candidate therapeutic target for HCC.
