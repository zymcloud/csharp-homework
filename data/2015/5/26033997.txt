Objective:To explore the clinical efficacy and complications of treating sternal tumors by resection and titanium mesh thoracic reconstruction.Methods:This retrospective analysis of eight patients with sternal tumors treated in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2008 to June 2012 included five men and three women aged 37-66 years (mean, 50.4 years). The histological diagnoses were chondrosarcoma (two cases), osteosarcoma (one), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (two), eosinophilic granuloma (one) and sternal metastasis from breast cancer (two). The tumors were invading the manubrium sterni (three cases), manubrium sterni and body (three) and sternal body (two). All patients underwent needle or incisional biopsy prior to sternal tumor resection and titanium mesh thoracic reconstruction.Results:All patients were followed for 9 months to 4 years. There were no intraoperative complications or operative or postoperative deaths. One patient developed a deep wound hematoma 1 week postoperatively; incisional drainage and debridement resulting in healing within 2 weeks. There was no loosening or exsertion of the titanium mesh and no patients developed respiratory complications or thoracic deformity. One patient with malignant fibrous histiocytoma died of lung metastases 9 months postoperatively, another with malignant fibrous histiocytoma died of liver metastases 14 months postoperatively; the remaining patients survived without tumor recurrence.Conclusion:Titanium mesh chest reconstruction after sternal tumor resection has the advantages of simplifying the procedure, achieving a good shape and having few complications. Titanium mesh is an ideal material for reconstruction of the sternum.
