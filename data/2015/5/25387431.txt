Background and aim:Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the liver (IMTL) is a very rare benign disease with a good prognosis. The study aims to determine the clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics of IMTL. The diagnosis and treatment strategies were discussed.Methods:A total of 11 patients with pathologically confirmed IMTL receiving treatment over a 15-year period were reviewed retrospectively. The analysis included demographics information and pertinent clinical data. Results obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), and metastatic liver cancer (MLC) receiving surgical resection were compared.Results:In comparison to HCC, IHCC, and MLC, IMTL has an earlier onset (P Conclusion:Lab tests, imaging features, and patient history are helpful in the differential diagnosis of IMTL from HCC/IHCC/MLC. Surgical resection is curative for IMTL.
