Aim:To evaluate long-term outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) ablation as first-line therapy for single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤ 3 cm and to determine survival and prognostic factors.Methods:We included all 184 patients who underwent RF ablation as a first-line treatment for single HCC ≤ 3 cm between April 2005 and December 2013. According to the criteria of Livraghi, the 184 patients were divided into two groups: those suitable for surgical resection (84 cases) and those unsuitable for surgical resection (100 cases). The primary endpoints were the overall survival (OS) rate and safety; the secondary endpoints were primary technique effectiveness and recurrence rate.Results:There were 19 (10.3%) cases of ablation related minor complications. The complete tumor ablation rate after one RF session was 97.8% (180/184). The rate of local tumor progression, extrahepatic metastases and intrahepatic distant recurrence were 4.9% (9/184), 9.8% (18/184) and 37.5% (69/184), respectively. In the 184 patients, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 99.5%, 81.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 100%, 86.9%, and 71.4%, respectively, in those suitable for surgical resection and 99.0%, 76.0%, and 55.0%, respectively, in those unsuitable for surgical resection (P = 0.021). On univariate and multivariate analyses, poorer OS was associated with Child-Pugh B class and portal hypertension (P Conclusion:RF ablation is a safe and effective treatment for single HCC ≤ 3 cm. The OS rate of patients suitable for surgical resection was similar to those reported in surgical series.
