The late and fast developments in the field of viral hepatitis were highly expected in the 2014 AASLD Liver Meeting®. Several combinations using direct acting antivirals (DAAs) showed high rates of sustained virological response (∼95%). Importantly, high cure rates were also demonstrated in patients with previous treatment failures, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatitis C recurrence after transplantation, making it clear that the interferon era is over (not so clear for ribavirin, which might still have a role in difficult-to-treat populations). Importantly, sustained virological response was associated with an improvement in liver function (MELD and Child-Pugh scores) in patients with advanced liver disease. In the field of liver cirrhosis, there were relevant data assessing the optimal empirical antibiotic therapy in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and high risk of resistant bacteria, as well as studies evaluating the role of terlipressin in type I hepatorenal syndrome and in septic shock. Regarding hepatic encephalopathy, two randomized trials suggest that the manipulation of the microbioma in patients with cirrhosis may have a role in the management of this complication. Some novel data on NASH support the beneficial effect of bariatric surgery (after failure of lifestyle intervention) in morbid obese patients with such diagnosis: clinical and histological improvements after surgery were evident in most patients with sufficient follow-up. A few controlled studies focused on the treatment of severe acute alcoholic hepatitis. Finally, several studies on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were presented, covering topics such as ultrasound screening in cirrhosis, cryoablation treatment of early HCC and the relevance of downstaging in patients with HCC awaiting liver transplantation.
