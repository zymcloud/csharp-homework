Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumour thrombus (BDTT) is rare. The aim of the present study was to determine the prognosis of HCC with BDTT after a hepatectomy.Methods:A retrospective analysis was performed on all HCC patients with BDTT having a hepatectomy from 1989 to 2012. The outcomes in these patients were compared with those in the control patients matched on a 1:6 ratio.Results:Thirty-seven HCC patients with BDTT having a hepatectomy (the BDTT group) were compared with 222 control patients. Patients in the BDTT group had poorer liver function (43.2% had Child-Pugh B disease). More patients in this group had a major hepatectomy (91.9% versus 27.5%, P = 0.001), portal vein resection (10.8% versus 1.4%, P = 0.006), en-bloc resection with adjacent structures (16.2% versus 5.4%, P = 0.041), hepaticojejunostomy (75.7% versus 1.6%, P Discussion:A major hepatectomy, extrahepatic biliary resection and hepaticojejunostomy should be the standard for HCC with BDTT, and long-term survival is possible after radical surgery.
