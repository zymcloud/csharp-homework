The AC3-33 gene encodes a secretory protein that can inhibit Elk1 transcriptional activity via the ERK1/2 pathway. In the current study, in situ RNA hybridization was used to detect the AC3-33 gene expression in multiple organ cancer and cancer-adjacent normal tissue. The results showed that the expression level of AC3-33 varies across different tissues. AC3-33 exhibited positive expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, adenocarcinoma of the rectum, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, cancer-adjacent normal hepatic tissue, clear cell carcinoma of the kidney, invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, SCC of the uterine cervix and cancer-adjacent normal kidney tissue. Negative expression of AC3-33 was observed in adenocarcinoma of the stomach and colon, cancer-adjacent normal esophageal tissue, cancer-adjacent normal gastric tissue, cancer-adjacent normal colon tissue, cancer-adjacent normal rectal tissue, serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary and cancer-adjacent normal ovarian tissue. However, the expression of AC3-33 in cancer adjacent normal breast tissue was partially positive. In conclusion, the AC3-33 gene does exhibit positive expression in certain carcinomas, which may indicate that AC3-33 has a significant involvement in the development and progression of these carcinomas.
