Background/aims:Laparoscopic approaches are increasingly used in selected patients with either colorectal or liver disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopy-assisted combined colorectal and liver resection for primary colorectal cancer (CRC) with synchronous liver metastases.Methodology:Thirteen patients with CRC with synchronous liver metastases who underwent simultaneous laparoscopic colectomy and hepatic resection from January 2009 through July 2013 were evaluated.Results:The patients' median age was 65 years and the median body mass index was 23.7 kg/M2. The primary sites were the right colon in 4 cases, left colon in 6, and rectum in 3. Liver resections consisted of 14 partial resections or 3 left lateral hepatectomies. One patient was converted to open hepatectomy. The median surgical time was 616 (range, 200-907) min, and the median estimated blood loss was 520 (range, 70-2016) mL. Postoperative mortality did not occur. Three patients experienced minor postoperative complications: bile leakage and wound infection. The median hospital stay was 14 (range, 9-58) days.Conclusions:This study shows that combined colon and liver resection with the laparoscopic approach is technically feasible and safe in selected patients with primary CRC and synchronous liver metastases.
