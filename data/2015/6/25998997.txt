Interventional radiology is involved practically at each stage in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, as recommended in the EASL-EORTC guidelines. It is even becoming more important as technological advances progress and as its long-term efficacy is assessed. Used curatively, thermoablation can obtain five-year survival rates of 40 to 70%, with a survival rate of 30% at 10years. As there are many tools available in order to be used, it requires a thorough pre-treatment assessment and discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting. Regular patient reassessment is needed in order to be able to adjust treatment because of the complementarity of the treatments available and the course of the disease.
