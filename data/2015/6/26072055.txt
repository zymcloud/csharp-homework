Background:This study is to evaluate the toxicity and outcomes of helical tomotherapy (HT) in patients treated for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From March 2008 to September 2010, 38 patients with unresectable HCC were treated with HT. The median patient age was 67 years (range, 45-85). The median follow-up period was 17.2 months (range, 7-46). All patients had liver cirrhosis. Median radiation dose was 54 Gy (range, 46-71.8) delivered in 1.8 to 2.4-Gy fractions. The planning target volumes were 241.2 Â± 153.1 cm(3) (range, 45.8-722.4). Treatment responses were assessed in 3-6 months after HT.Results:There was a complete response in 2 patients (5.2 %), partial response in 18 patients (47.4 %), stable disease in 13 patients (34.2 %), and progressive disease in 5 patients (13.2 %). The median overall survival was 12.6 months, and 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 56.2 and 31.7 %, respectively. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG score, p = 0.008), Child-Pugh classification (p = 0.012), albumin (p = 0.046), and hemoglobin (p = 0.028) were significant parameters that predicted primary tumor response to radiotherapy in multivariate analysis. ECOG score (p = 0.012), Child-Pugh class (p = 0.026), and response to radiotherapy (p = 0.016) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival in multivariate analysis. Responders had better overall survival than non-responders (23.6 vs. 5.8 months, p Conclusions:Radiotherapy using HT seems to be a safe and effective treatment option for unresectable HCC patients. This study indicates that HT is a feasible treatment even in patients without good performance status and hepatic function reservation.
