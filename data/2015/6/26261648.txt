Purpose:We carried out this study to find out the relevance between rs2281388 T/C polymorphism of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in Chinese Han population.Methods:The method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to amplify the genomic DNA. Then the PCR products were sequenced to test the HLA-DP gene rs2281388T/C polymorphism of the case and control groups. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CIs) were utilized to evaluate the potential correlation between rs2281388 variants and HCC risk.Results:We analyzed the rs2281388 polymorphism distribution among the clinical pathological features. The results showed that there existed a significant statistic correlation between rs2281388T/C polymorphism of HLA-DP gene and HBsAg feature, and no significant correlation was found between rs2281388 and other clinical features. Further analysis showed that the TT genotype of rs2281388 was significantly correlated with HCC risk, and the same to T allele, but there was no significant difference of CT genotype distribution in case and control groups.Conclusion:TT genotype and T allele of HLA-DP gene rs2281388 polymorphism may increase the risk of HCC.
