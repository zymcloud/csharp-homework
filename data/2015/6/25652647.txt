Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) on pre-treatment F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 59 HCC patients who underwent FDG PET/CT before transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial chemotherapy infusion (TACI) were retrospectively enrolled. The region of interest was drawn in the HCC and normal liver tissue. MTV2SD, defined as the sum of the voxels with higher standardized uptake values (SUV) than the SUV of the 97.5th percentile of voxels of the normal liver for each patient, was calculated using an intensity-volume histogram (IVH). The ratio of the maximum SUV of the tumor to the mean SUV of normal liver (T max/L mean) was also calculated. The prognostic significance of MTV2SD and Tmax/Lmean for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated along with other clinical factors.Results:The tumor number, Tmax/Lmean, and MTV2SD were significant prognostic factors affecting PFS (p Conclusions:Metabolic tumor volume was an independent prognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients with HCC. Therefore, FDG PET/CT can provide valuable prognostic information for HCC patients who undergo TACE or TACI.
