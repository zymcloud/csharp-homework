Aim:to evaluate the efficacy and to determine safety and survival benefit after quaternary cytoreduction in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.Patients and methods:We retrospectively reviewed data of all patients submitted to quaternary cytoreduction at the Dan Setlacec Center of Gastrointestinal Disease and Liver Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute between January 2002 and May 2014.Results:Twenty patients with a mean age of 54.3 years were submitted to quaternary cytoreduction. At the time of initial diagnosis, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stages were IA in four cases, IIA in three cases, IIC in two cases, IIIA in three cases, IIIB in two cases and IIIC in six cases. At the time of quaternary cytoreduction, R0 resection was achieved in seven cases. Postoperative complications occurred in three cases (15%), while the 30-day mortality was 0. The median overall survival after quaternary cytoreduction was 16 months.Conclusion:quaternary cytoreduction in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer appears to be a safe procedure and may bring survival benefit in selected cases.
Epithelial ovarian cancer; prolonged survival; quaternary cytoreduction; recurrence.
