Cancer metastasis is a highly tissue-specific and organ-selective process. It has been shown that the affected tissues and/or organs play a major role in this complex process. The lung is the most common target organ of extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis, but the precise molecular mechanism underlying this organ-specific metastasis remains unclear. We hypothesized that lung microenvironment was able to promote the metastasis of HCC cells to the lungs leading to distant metastases. In support of our hypothesis, we provided evidence from targeted metastasis in various types of cancer and contributing factors in the microenvironment of targeted tissues/organs. A better understanding of the steps involved in the interplay between HCC cells and lung microenvironment may offer new perspectives for the medical management of lung metastases of HCC.
