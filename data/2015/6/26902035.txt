Background/aims:Oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) has been registered as adjuncts to stimulate hemostasis in liver surgery. However, most previous studies were primarily designed to study the intra-operative hemostatic efficacy, and the effect on prophylactic application was never studied as a primary endpoint. This randomized prospective clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate whether ORC is safe and effective when used as a prophylactic agent covering the raw cut surface during the hepatectomy to reduce the volume and duration of drainage.Methodology:Between June 2011 and August 2012, a total of 40 patients undergoing major hepatectomy were randomly assigned to ORC or control groups (20 in each group). Patient characteristics, resection-related factors, debit of drainage and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups.Results:The two groups were comparable in terms of demographics, indications for surgery, extent of hepatectomy, and intraoperative blood loss. The amount of drainage after operation was significantly less in the ORC group compared with the control group (406.9 ± 308.1 vs. 627.0 ± 301.6 ml, P = 0.028).Conclusions:Application of ORC covering the raw cut surface during the hepatectomy can significantly decrease the amount of drainage.
