Background/aims:Intraoperative blood loss is an independent predictor of recurrence and survival after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors associated with intraoperative major blood loss in patients undergoing liver resection for HCC.Methodology:Clinicopathologic data and perioperative outcomes of 386 patients who underwent liver resection for HCC were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into high (> 1,000 mL) and low (51,000 mL) blood loss groups according to the intraoperative blood loss. Intraoperative blood loss,more than 1,000 mL was defined as major blood loss. The risk factors associated with intraoperative major blood loss were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Vascular invasion, major hepatectomy and prolonged operation time were risk factors associated with intraoperative major blood loss during resection of HCC on multivariate analysis. Moreover, HCC patients with intraoperative major blood loss had prolonged hospital stay, higher incidence of postoperative complication and mortality compared with patients' with blood loss 1,000 mL.Conclusions:Vascular invasion, major hepatectomy and prolonged operation time are independent predictors of intraoperative major blood loss during resection of HCC.
