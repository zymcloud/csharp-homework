Background:The fatigue and symptom distress of cancer patients have been researched extensively. However, few studies have focused on the fatigue and symptom distress experienced by hepatic cancer patients following tran-scatheter arterial embolization (TAE) treatment.Purpose:This study explores the levels of symptom distress and fatigue in hepatic cancer patients and related factors.Methods:This cross-sectional study used purposive sampling to recruit 100 hepatic cancer patients who had received TAE treatment from a medical center in southern Taiwan. Structured questionnaires were used to collect the data from the first, second, and third days following the TAE treatment.Results:Notable reductions in fatigue and symptom distress levels were observed in post-TAE-treatment patients. The 5 main symptoms were abdominal pain, fatigue, sleeplessness, fever, and abdominal distention. Factors identified as influencing the level of fatigue were marital status, family members' accompaniment during the TAE treatment, physical performance status, age, and symptom distress.Conclusions / implications for practice:Physicians treating hepatic cancer patients should better explain to patients the symptoms and fatigue associated with TAE treatment. Physicians should also provide interventions that may reduce the related symptoms, fatigue levels, and mental distress.
