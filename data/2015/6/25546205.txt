We report a case of solitary splenic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma detected on F-FDG PET/CT. A 67-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma was referred for F-FDG PET/CT to determine the cause of his elevated serum Î±-fetoprotein levels after liver segmentectomy and radio-frequency ablation. F-FDG PET/CT imaging showed focal FDG uptake in the spleen, with no other abnormal findings. A splenectomy was performed, and histopathologic examination confirmed the lesion as a metastasis from the hepatocellular carcinoma.
