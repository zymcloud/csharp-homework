Background/aims:PET is a highly specific tool in liver cancer diagnosis. However, in small hepatic lesions, typical imaging characteristics are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of PET-CT and ultrasound-guided biopsy for diagnosis of liver carcinomas.Methodology:Clinical data of 58 patients who were diagnosed and treated in our hospital from January 2008 to December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Before surgery, patients received PET-CT assessment, ultrasound examination, and ultrasound-guided biopsy of liver tissues. Forty three patients with cancer underwent partial hepatectomy. Clinical data were collected from hospital records and follow-up questionnaires.Results:Postoperative histology revealed hepatocellular carcinoma in 26 patients (46.4%), liver metastases in 12 patients (21.4%). Only 4 patients (7.1%) had cholangiocarcinoma. The sensitivity of PET-CT, ultrasound, and ultrasound-guided biopsy for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 92.9%, 95.5%, and 100%, respectively. The surgery-related complication rate was 3.6%. Prognosis was good, with 1- and 3-year survival rates of 83.4% and 67.9%, respectively.Conclusions:PET-CT is highly specific for diagnosis of hepatic cancer, which is consistent with the diagnosis of ultrasound-guided biopsy and postoperative histological assessments. Combination use of PET-CT, ultrasound assessment and ultrasound-guided biopsy will provide the most accurate diagnosis of liver cancer.
