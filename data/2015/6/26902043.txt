Background/aims:This paper aims to investigate the effect of acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) used with controlled low central venous pressure (LCVP) technology on perioperative bleeding and coagulation in hepatocellular carcinoma operation patients.Methodology:A total of 60 cases undergoing hepatic resection operation were randomly divided into the control group, LCVP group (Group II), and ANH + LCVP group (Group III). The changes of hemodynamic indexes at different time points in each group were observed and recorded, along with the volume of allogenous blood transfusion and the number of patients undergoing allogenous blood transfusion.Results:Compared with Group I (control), there was evident reduction of the bleeding volume, allogenic blood transfusion volume, and number of patients undergoing allogenic blood transfusion in Groups II and III.Conclusion:The application of ANH combined with LCVP in hepatic resection can evidently reduce intraoperative hemorrhages and homologous blood transfusions; moreover, it has no significant adverse effect on the coagulation function.
