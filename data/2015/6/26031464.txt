Background:Leucine zipper protein (LUZP) plays key roles in development. Overexpression of LUZP was documented in several types of solid tumors. In this study, expression of LUZP messenger RNA (LUZP mRNA) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was examined, and the correlations of LUZP mRNA level with patients' characteristics and prognosis were also investigated.Methods:Total RNA was extracted from HCC and paired noncancerous liver tissues of 77 patients. Expression of LUZP mRNA in the tissues was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Using average LUZP mRNA level in noncancerous liver tissues as the cutoff, patients with HCC were categorized into high-expression group and low-expression group. Correlations of LUZP mRNA with clinical parameters were analyzed. Overall survival of the patients in the 2 groups was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The LUZP mRNA level was significantly higher in HCC samples than in the noncancerous liver tissues (1.87 ± 0.11 vs 0.58 ± 0.05, P Conclusion:The LUZP mRNA is a prognostic indicator in HCC, and overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC.
