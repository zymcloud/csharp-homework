Background/aims:Mean survival in hepatocellular carcinoma remains low. Many efforts have been done during the last years through screening, diagnosis and treatment to improve the results. The aim of this work is to present the experience of our hospital multidisciplinary group during the first decade of this century.Methodology:The patients with hepatocellullar carcinoma presented at the multidisciplinary meeting from 1999 to 2009 were prospectively studied. According to the tumor and functional status they were treated through the current available guidelines by transplant, partial hepatectomy, local/regional procedures, systemic or symptomatic treatment.Results:One hundred and forty two patients were studied. Median tumor size was 3 cm. A single tumor was diagnosed in 64.8% of the patients. Eighteen patients had liver resection (6 transplantation and 12 with partial resection), 53 tumors were not treated due to advanced stage or liver dysfunction, and in the remaining patients radiofrequency, ethanol or embolization treatments were used, single or combined.Conclusions:a multidisciplinary approach of hepatocellular carcinoma in a second level hospital with trained professionals permits a diagnosis in early tumoral and functional stages in the majority of patients, and a variety of possible treatments with adequate survival outcomes.
