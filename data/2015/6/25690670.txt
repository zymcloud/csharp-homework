Background:Genes involved in the angiopoietin and pericyte pathways may become escape mechanisms under antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. The authors investigated whether variations within genes in these pathways are associated with clinical outcome in patients with colorectal liver metastases who undergo liver resection and receive perioperative, bevacizumab-based chemotherapy.Methods:Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 9 genes (angiopoietin-1 [ANGPT1]; ANGPT2; TEK tyrosine kinase, endothelial [TEK]; platelet-derived growth factor β [PDGFB]; β-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFRB]; insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF1]; transforming growth factor β1 [TGFB1]; RalA binding protein 1 [RALBP1]; and regulator of G-protein signaling 5 [RGS5]) were analyzed in samples of genomic DNA from 149 patients and were evaluated for associations with clinical outcome.Results:RALBP1 reference SNP 329007 (rs329007) A>G resulted in a significant difference in recurrence-free survival (A/A genotype, 14.0 months; A/G or G/G genotype, 9.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.60; P = .024). PDGFB rs1800818 A>G was associated with 3-year overall survival rates (A/A genotype, 78%; A/G genotype, 69%; [HR 1.37]; G/G genotype, 53%; [HR 2.12]; P = .048). In multivariate analysis, RALBP1 rs329007 A>G remained significant (HR, 1.99; P = .002). PDGFB rs1800818 A>G and RALBP1 rs329007 A>G were correlated with radiologic response (A/A or A/G genotype, 86%; G/G genotype, 71% [P = .042]; A/A genotype, 78%; A/G or G/G genotype, 94% [P = .018], respectively). RALBP1 rs329007 A>G demonstrated significantly different rates of histologic response (A/A genotype: major histologic response, 35%; partial histologic response, 34%; no histologic response, 30%; A/G or G/G genotype: 46%, 13%, and 41%, respectively; P = .029). Recursive partitioning analysis revealed that ANGPT2 rs2442599 T>C and RALBP1 rs329007 A>G were the main SNPs that predicted histologic response and recurrence-free survival, whereas PDGFB rs1800818 A>G was the leading SNP that predicted overall survival. ANGPT2 rs2916702 C>T and rs2442631 G>A were significantly associated with the probability of achieving a cure.Conclusions:The current data suggest that variations in genes involved in the angiopoietin and pericyte pathways may be predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers in patients with resected colorectal liver metastases who receive bevacizumab-based chemotherapy.
