Colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are common causes of cancer incidence and mortality in the USA, particularly among underserved populations such as racial/ethnic minorities, the under-/uninsured, and individuals with low socioeconomic status. Although screening can reduce cancer-related mortality, participation is suboptimal among underserved populations, likely serving as the largest contributor to observed inequities in HCC and CRC outcomes among US populations. In this narrative review, we highlight inequities across populations in the USA with respect to incidence and mortality for CRC and HCC and highlight potential causes, with a focus on screening rates. In addition, drawing from the recent literature, we highlight promising strategies for increasing screening for HCC and CRC and propose future research and policy solutions to optimize screening rates. With focused implementation of screening strategies and novel research, the burden of HCC and CRC can be reduced among underserved populations.
