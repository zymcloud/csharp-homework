Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1) is critical for genome organizer that reprograms chromatin organization and transcription profiles, and associated with tumor growth and metastasis in several cancer types. Many studies suggest that SATB1 overexpression is an indicator of poor prognosis in various cancers, such as breast cancer, malignant cutaneous melanoma, and liver cancer. However, their expression patterns and function values for adult T cell leukemia (ATL) are still largely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the levels of SATB1 in ATL and to explore its function and mechanisms in Jurkat cell line. Here, we reported that SATB1 expressions were decreased in ATL cells (p < 0.001) compared with normal controls. Knockdown of SATB1 expression significantly enhanced invasion of Jurkat cell in vitro. Furthermore, knockdown of SATB1 gene enhances β-catenin nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity and thus may increase the invasiveness of Jurkat cell through the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in vitro.
