The aim of the present study is to verify the trapping effect of combretastatin A-4-phosphate (CA4P) on small molecular drugs in rodent tumors. Mice with H22 hepatocarcinoma were randomized into groups A and B. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of T1WI, T2WI, and DWI was performed as baseline. Mice in group A were injected with Gd-DTPA and PBS. Mice in group B were injected with Gd-DTPA and CA4P. All mice undergo CE-T1WI at 0 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h. Enhancing efficacy of the two groups on CE-T1WI was compared with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculated. Concentrations of gadolinium measured by ICP-AES in the tumor were compared between groups. On the early CE-T1WI, tumors were equally enhanced in both groups. On the delayed CE-T1WI, the enhancing effect of group A was weaker than that of group B. The SNR and the concentration of gadolinium within the tumor of group A were lower than that of group B at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after administration. This study indicates that CA4P could improve the retention of Gd-DTPA in the tumor and MRI allowed dynamically monitoring trapping effects of CA4P on local retention of Gd-DTPA as a small molecular drug.
