Background/aims:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin-eluting beads combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) compared with conventional TACE (cTACE).Methodology:PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for articles published to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating efficacy and side effects between DEB-TACE and cTACE. The RR (relative risk) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by the Revman 5.0 software.Results:Totally 4 studies, including 527 patients, compared the efficacy and safety of DEB-TACE with cTACE. The DEB-TACE achieved fewer side effects in alopecia (p = 0.0002, RR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01-0.24) and myelosuppression (p = 0.009, RR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14-0.75). Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in efficacy evaluation including complete response (p = 0.16, RR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.89-2.08), partial response (p = 0.48, RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.80-1.62), stable disease (p = 0.73, RR = 0.93,95% CI: 0.60-1.40), progressive disease (p 0.19, RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.56-1.12), objective response (p = 0.26, RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.48-1.72) and disease control (p = 0.05, RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.00-1.39).Conclusions:DEB-TACE shows similar therapeutic efficacy to cTACE method and fewer adverse events.
