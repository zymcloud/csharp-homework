Purpose:To compare radiofrequency (RF) ablation with nonanatomic resection (NAR) as first-line treatment in patients with a single Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 or A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to evaluate the long-term outcomes of both therapies.Materials and methods:This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent was waived. Data were reviewed from 580 patients with HCCs measuring 3 cm or smaller (BCLC stage 0 or A) who underwent ultrasonographically (US) guided percutaneous RF ablation (n = 438) or NAR (n = 142) as a first-line treatment. Local tumor progression, intrahepatic distant recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were analyzed by using propensity score matching to compare therapeutic efficacy. In addition, major complications and length of postoperative hospital stay were compared.Results:Before propensity score matching (n = 580), the 5-year cumulative rates of local tumor progression for RF ablation and NAR (20.9% vs 12.7%, respectively; P = .093) and overall survival rates (85.5% vs 90.9%, respectively; P = .194) were comparable, while the 5-year cumulative intrahepatic distant recurrence rates (62.7% vs 36.6%, respectively; P Conclusion:In patients with one BCLC stage 0 or A (â‰¤ 3 cm) HCC who received RF ablation or NAR as first-line treatment, there were no significant differences in long-term therapeutic outcomes; however, RF ablation was associated with fewer major complications and a shorter hospital stay after treatment.
