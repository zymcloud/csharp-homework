Purpose:To assess the prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with unresectable intermediate- or advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with yttrium-90 radioembolization (RE).Materials and methods:Retrospective chart review was performed for 176 patients with intermediate- or advanced-stage HCC treated with RE between August 2000 and November 2012. The appropriate NLR cutoff was determined by receiver operating characteristic curves. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and pathologic parameters were compared between patients with a normal NLR (Results:Under univariate analyses, patients with a normal NLR were found to have longer survival than individuals with a high NLR in intermediate/advanced-disease and advanced-disease cohorts. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model in the advanced-disease group confirmed that elevated NLR, high Î±-fetoprotein level, and low albumin level were independent predictors of worse survival.Conclusions:This study provides stage-dependent evidence for the prognostic role of NLR in the radioembolized HCC cohort. Patients with BCLC stage C disease with elevated NLR may not derive benefit from RE, and other intervening modalities should be explored in this subpopulation.
