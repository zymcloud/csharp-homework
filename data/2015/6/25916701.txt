Introduction:The use of thiopurines is frequently accompanied by hepatotoxicity. Studies on hepatocyte cultures showed a time- and dose-dependent increase of thiopurine toxicity. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and allopurinol can influence thiopurine metabolism; however, it is unknown whether this affects in vitro cytotoxicity.Methods:Human hepatoma cells (Huh7, HepG2 and HepaRG) were incubated with increasing concentrations of thiopurines, 5-ASA or allopurinol. Water-soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (WST-1) cytotoxicity assays were used to calculate cell survival curves and half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50). Combination experiments with thiopurines with a fixed dose of 200 μM 5-ASA or 100 μM allopurinol were conducted in HepaRG cells. Caspase-3/7 activation was evaluated, and single cell electrophoresis analysis was performed.Results:A time- and dose-related cytotoxic effect was seen with azathioprine (AZA) in all hepatoma cells, whereas Huh7 and HepG2 cells did not show toxicity to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). HepaRG cells expressed the highest levels of drug metabolising enzymes, and therefore, combination experiments were conducted in HepaRG cells. Addition of a non-toxic dose of allopurinol resulted in a twofold to threefold increased cytotoxicity of all thiopurines, which seemed to be mediated by apoptosis/DNA damage.Conclusion:The addition of allopurinol to thiopurines leads to a two-threefold increased cytotoxicity in HepaRG cells.
