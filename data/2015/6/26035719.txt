Here we review the development of tivantinib, a selective oral inhibitor of c-MET. The initially identified dose and schedule for clinical use was 360 mg twice daily. Biological considerations and early results suggested its activity against hepatocellular carcinoma after progression on sorafenib. The results of randomized Phase II study in this setting have already been reported; while in the overall population, the risk of progression was reduced by 36% (HR: 0.64; 90% CI: 0.43-0.94; p = 0.04), in the pre-defined MET-high population median overall survival (7.2 vs 3.8 months; p = 0.01), median time to progression (2.7 vs 1.4 months; p = 0.03) as well as disease control rate (50 vs 20%), were increased by tivantinib. During study conduction, tivantinib dose was amended to 240 mg twice daily, due to a high incidence of neutropenia, without losing clinical efficacy. Presently, a global Phase III trial is being conducted.
