Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth common cancer. The differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been associated with the prognosis of various cancers. However, limited information is available regarding genome-wide miRNA expression profiles in HCC to generate a tumor-specific miRNA signature of prognostic values. In this study, the miRNA profiles in 327 HCC patients, including 327 tumor and 43 adjacent non-tumor tissues, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) were analyzed. The associations of the differentially expressed miRNAs with patient survival and other clinical characteristics were examined with t-test and Cox proportional regression model. Finally, a tumor-specific miRNA signature was generated and examined with Kaplan-Meier survival, univariate\multivariate Cox regression analyses and KEGG pathway analysis. Results showed that a total of 207 miRNAs were found differentially expressed between tumor and adjacent non-tumor HCC tissues. 78 of them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade and AJCC tumor stage. Seven miRNAs were significantly associated with survival (P value
