Aim:To evaluate the response, survival and safety on 3-D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for major portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In this retrospective study, 83 advanced HCC patients treated with HAIC who met the following criteria were enrolled: (i) PVTT of the main trunk or first branch of the portal vein; (ii) no extrahepatic metastasis; (iii) Child-Pugh score of 5-7; (iv) performance status of 0 or 1; and (v) no history of sorafenib treatment. The response, overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure (TTF), post-progression survival (PPS) and safety were compared between HAIC combined with 3D-CRT for PVTT (RT group, n = 41) and HAIC alone (non-RT group, n = 42).Results:The objective response of PVTT was significantly higher in the RT group (56.1%) than in the non-RT group (33.3%), while that of intrahepatic tumor and OS were not significantly different between groups. Median OS, TTF and PPS were significantly longer in the RT group than in the non-RT group (8.6 and 5.0 months, 5.0 and 2.7 months, and 5.3 and 1.5 months, respectively) among intrahepatic tumor non-responders to HAIC, whereas those were not significantly different between groups among intrahepatic tumor responders to HAIC. By multivariate analysis, the combination of 3D-CRT with HAIC was an independent contributing factor for OS (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.692-6.021; P Conclusion:3D-CRT for PVTT combined with HAIC could provide survival benefit to non-responder to HAIC.
