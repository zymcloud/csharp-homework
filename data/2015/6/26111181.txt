In this work, 3-bromoacetylcoumarin was used as the key starting material for the synthesis of pyran, pyridine, thiophene, thiazole and pyrazole derivatives through its reaction with different reagents. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed on the basis of their spectral data and elemental analyses. All of the synthesized compounds were screened for their in vitro anticancer activity against six human cancer cell lines, namely: human gastric cancer (NUGC), human colon cancer (DLD1), human liver cancer (HA22T and HEPG2), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (HONE1), human breast cancer (MCF) and normal fibroblast cells (WI38). The IC50 values (the sample concentration that produces 50% reduction in cell growth) in nanomolars (nM)) showed most of the compounds exhibited significant cytotoxic effect. Among these derivatives, compound 6d showed almost equipotent cytotoxic activity against NUGC (IC50 = 29 nM) compared to the standard CHS 828 (IC50 = 25 nM).
