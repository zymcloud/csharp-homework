Background:The median survival for patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma is usually limited to approximately 1 year. In the case of liver metastasis, resection and ablation can achieve long-term survival. This study aimed to describe the outcomes after liver resection or ablation for metastatic melanoma to the liver and identify preoperative prognostic factors.Methods:Forty eight patients who underwent liver resection (n = 32) or percutaneous ablation (n = 16) were identified from the 1,523 patients with melanoma liver metastases evaluated between January1993 and January 2013.Results:Median OS was 25.9 months. Median OS was not different after ablation (18 months) and resection (26 months; P > 0.2). Patients in the ablation group more often presented with extrahepatic disease (EHD) (P = 0.008) and received more frequently systemic therapy before ablation (P = 0.005). Patients without EHD tended to have longer OS (26.5 vs. 12 months; P = 0.076) and PFS (13 vs. 5 months; P = 0.11) in the whole cohort. EHD was significantly associated with a worse OS in the resection group (P = 0.034).Conclusion:Liver resection is associated to prolonged survival over 24 months and should be considered only in selected patients with metastatic disease confined to the liver. In patients not candidate for surgery, tumor ablation can be considered.
