Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major pathogens causing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. For a long time, standard therapy against HCV infection involved a combination of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). However, the sustained virological response (SVR) rate with this therapy can be up to 50%. Therefore, to predict the interferon response prior to treatment, novel viral and host factors were explored, and several novel examinations were developed. Recently, several classes of novel direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting protease, NS5A, and polymerase of HCV have been developed and tested in clinical trials. HCV protease inhibitors, simeprevir and telaprevir, have been approved for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV infection in Japan. Moreover, recently, IFN-free regimens, the NS5A inhibitor Daclatasvir, and protease inhibitor Asunaprevir combination therapy have been approved in Japan. Treatment outcomes have been improved; however, viral resistance against DAAs has become a new issue. The aim of this review was to summarize the progress in examination and treatment of hepatitis C virus.
