Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. Acute infection often progresses to chronicity resulting frequently in fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in rare cases, in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Although HCV has proven to be an arduous object of research and has raised important technical challenges, several experimental models have been developed all over the last two decades in order to improve our understanding of the virus life cycle, pathogenesis and virus-host interactions. The recent development of direct acting-agents, leading to considerable progress in treatment of patients, represents the direct outcomes of these achievements. Proteomic approaches have been of critical help to shed light on several aspect of the HCV biology such as virion composition, viral replication, and virus assembly and to unveil diagnostic or prognostic markers of HCV-induced liver disease. Here, we review how proteomic approaches have led to improve our understanding of HCV life cycle and liver disease, thus highlighting the relevance of these approaches for studying the complex interactions between other challenging human viral pathogens and their host.
