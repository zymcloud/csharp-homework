Introduction:Colon cancer in pregnancy is uncommon. Only a small number of case reports have been published in the literature on the use of chemotherapeutic drugs during pregnancy. Reports of such cases assist clinicians in further investigating the use of chemotherapy in pregnancy.Case presentation:FOLFOX-6 was administered to a pregnant, 33-year-old Saudi woman with metastatic colon cancer from 22 to 30 weeks of gestation. Her cancer was diagnosed during her pregnancy. She tolerated the chemotherapy well and delivered a full-term baby girl with no obvious harm, and normal development was documented at her 2-year follow-up examination.Conclusion:Colon cancer during pregnancy is not easily detected and is difficult to manage. A detailed history and high clinical suspicion are needed in patients who present with symptoms and signs suggestive of malignancy. A multidisciplinary approach with patient involvement is needed to decrease morbidity and mortality caused by both treatment and the cancer in the mother and to limit side effects for the fetus. Further data and long-term follow-up are needed to better understand the potential long-term side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on offspring.
