Aiming to find novel non-invasive biomarkers with high accuracy for the detention of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we examined the predictive power of two microRNAs (miR; miR-375 and miR-199a-3p) as potential biomarkers in early-stage HCC. A total of 234 serum samples (78 samples from HCC patients, 156 samples from healthy controls) were collected. We measured the levels of the two mature microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-375 and miR-199a-3p) with probe-based stem-loop quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) in all subjects. In addition, the correlation between the expression levels of two miRs and clinicopathological factors was explored. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses revealed that the two serum miRs could be promising biomarkers for HCC, with relatively high area under the curve (AUC) values as follows: miR-375, 0. 637 with 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 0.560-0.741; miR-199a-3p, 0. 883 with 95 % CI of 0.827-0.938. Stratified analyses indicated that circulating miR-199a-3p showed better predictive value in patients with long-term drinking. Our data suggested that circulating miR-375 and miR-199a-3p could be a novel serum biomarker for HCC. Nevertheless, further validating and improving study with larger sample should be conducted to confirm our results.
