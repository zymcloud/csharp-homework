Background:Liver transplantation (LT) remains the best curative option for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but is limited by the ongoing graft shortage. The present study aimed at defining the population in which primary liver resection (LR) could represent the best alternative to LT.Methods:An exploration set of 357 HCC patients (LR n = 221 and LT n = 136) operated between 2000-2012 was used in order to identify factors associated with survival following LR and define a good prognosis (GP) group for which LR may challenge the results of upfront LT. These factors were validated in an external validation set of 565 HCC patients operated at another center (LR n = 287 LR and LT n = 278).Results:In the exploration set, factors associated with survival on multivariate analysis were a solitary lesion, a diameter Conclusion:In a group of early HCC patients gathering all factors of GP, primary LR achieves at least similar survival as upfront LT and should be the approach of choice.
