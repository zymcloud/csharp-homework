Background/aims:This study was designed to investigate the effect of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy such as pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by maintenance bevacizumab in patients with advanced, nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer.Methodology:Previously untreated patients with advanced, non-squamous nonsmall cell lung cancer received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin atan area under the concentration-time curve of 6 intravenously on day 1 every 21 days. Responding or stable patients who completed 6 cycles then received bevacizumab maintenance every 21 days until disease progression. In total, 32 patients were entered on the study.Results:No complete responses were observed, and 16 patients (50%) had a partial response. Sixteen patients (50%) displayed disease stability. The progression-free survival was 11.92 ± 6.12 months, and the overall survival was 12.52 ± 5.56 months. Treatment-related grade adverse events were obsearved gastrointestinal reaction (68%), rash (2%), Pectoralgia (1%), headache (1%), rlopecia (1%), renal function (1%), liver function (1%), and diarrhea (1%).Conclusions:Combined pemetrexed, and carboplatin followed by maintenance bevacizumab was well tolerated and displayed remarkable effect in patients with advanced, nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer.
