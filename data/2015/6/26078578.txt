Aim:To determine the predictive value of increased prolidase activity that reflects increased collagen turnover in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Sixty-eight patients with HCC (mean age of 69.1 ± 10.1), 31 cirrhosis patients (mean age of 59.3 ± 6.3) and 33 healthy volunteers (mean age of 51.4 ± 12.6) were enrolled in this study. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the association of serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) values with HCC clinicopathological features, such as tumor size, number and presence of vascular and macrovascular invasion. The patients with HCC were divided into groups according to tumor size, number and presence of vascular invasion (diameters; ≤ 3 cm, 3-5 cm and ≥ 5 cm, number; 1, 2 and ≥ 3, macrovascular invasion; yes/no). Barcelona-clinic liver cancer (BCLC) criteria were used to stage HCC patients. Serum samples for measurement of prolidase and alpha-fetoprotein levels were kept at -80 °C until use. Prolidase levels were measured spectrophotometrically and AFP concentrations were determined by a chemiluminescence immunometric commercial diagnostic assay.Results:In patients with HCC, prolidase and AFP values were evaluated according to tumor size, number, presence of macrovascular invasion and BCLC staging classification. Prolidase values were significantly higher in patients with HCC compared with controls (P Conclusion:Considering the levels of both serum prolidase and AFP could contribute to the early diagnosing of hepatocellular carcinoma.
