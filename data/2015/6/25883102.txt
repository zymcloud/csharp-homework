Objective:The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of distant metastasis (DM) after curative surgical treatment and assess the multivariate relationships among various risk factors for DM in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).Study design:Case series with chart review.Setting:Tertiary referral center.Subjects and methods:The medical records of all patients with OSCC without DM who underwent curative surgery with or without postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation between January 2001 and February 2014 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. There were a total of 451 patients, including 271 men and 180 women, with a mean age of 65.9 Â± 13.5 years.Results:Of these patients, 30 (6.7%) developed DM. During the follow-up period, the 5-year overall survival rate was 76.2%. Sites of DM comprised the lungs (80.0%), skin (13.3%), liver (10.0%), bone (6.7%), and brain (3.3%). We found the T classification and N classification as well as the histologic grade to be significant risk factors associated with the development of DM in the univariate analysis only (P = .003), whereas locoregional failure (odds ratio [OR], 4.03), multiple lymph node metastases (more than 4 positive nodes; OR, 3.32) and positive extracapsular spread (OR, 3.06) were identified to be significant risk factors associated with the development of DM in the multivariate analysis.Conclusion:We demonstrated multivariate relationships among various risk factors for DM in OSCC patients. Clinicians should consider these risk factors and pay special attention to detecting DM early during the postoperative management of OSCC patients with these risk factors.
