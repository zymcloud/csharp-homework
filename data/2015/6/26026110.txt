Aim:To retrospectively compare the efficacy of two irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimens combined with bevacizumab in first-line therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).Patients and methods:The data of 558 patients with mCRC treated with first-line bevacizumab plus irinotecan-containing regimen were obtained from the national CORECT registry that collects data of all patients with mCRC treated with targeted-agents. The treatment outcomes of patients treated with bevacizumab plus irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid (FOLFIRI) were compared to patients treated with bevacizumab plus irinotecan and capecitabine (XELIRI).Results:Among 4,312 patients with CRC treated with bevacizumab, only 13% (558) received irinotecan-based chemotherapy. No significant differences were observed in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival between FOLFIRI and XELIRI groups. Moreover, the toxicity of both regimens was also comparable.Conclusion:This retrospective analysis confirms the comparable activity of FOLFIRI and XELIRI regimens when combined with bevacizumab.
