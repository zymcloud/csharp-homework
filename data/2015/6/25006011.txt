Background:Chronic hepatitis B infection is endemic in New Zealand and has high prevalence in New Zealand Māori. Previous longitudinal studies in populations with predominantly vertically acquired chronic hepatitis B have shown low spontaneous hepatitis B surface-antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance rates: 0.5-1.4% annually (mean age of clearance 48 years). We report the 28-year follow-up data on clinical and serological outcomes in indigenous New Zealand Māori with early horizontally acquired HBV.Methods:In 1984, community seroprevalence study identified 572 HBsAg-positive individuals, followed for 28 years. Liver-related mortality and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence were compared between these 572 HBV carriers and 1140 HBsAg-negative matched case-controls. Surviving HBsAg-positive individuals have been followed up in 2012 with clinical assessment, blood tests and liver transient elastography. Rates of hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) and HBsAg seroconversion were determined.Results:After total 13 187.4 person-years follow-up, 15 HBsAg-positive patients have developed HCC compared with none of the HBsAg-negative controls (p40 years at entry, pConclusions:Horizontally transmitted HBV in Maori is similarly associated with increased risk of liver-related mortality and HCC compared with Chinese, although absolute incidence rates are lower. The rates of HBeAg and HBsAg loss are high, and occur at an earlier age than previously reported.
