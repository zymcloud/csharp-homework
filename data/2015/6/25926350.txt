Lessons learned:Novaferon showed moderate efficacy and was well-tolerated in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), especially with the 20 μg injected 3 times a week strategy.Although Novaferon did not provide a survival benefit for mCRC patients who have failed standard treatment, it may play a role in improvement of immune function.Background:To observe the efficacy, safety, and optimal dosage of recombinant antitumor and antivirus protein (Novaferon) in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who failed at least two prior palliative regimens.Methods:We enrolled 108 patients from May 2011 to December 2012. According to different treatment modalities and therapeutic dosages, the participants were randomly divided into four cohorts at a 2:2:2:1 ratio: (a) 20 μg Novaferon (Genova Biotech, Beijing, People's Republic of China, http://www.genovabiotech.net) injected twice per week, (b) 20 μg Novaferon injected 3 times per week, (c) 40 μg Novaferon injected 3 times per week, or (d) saline injected 3 times per week. The primary endpoint was overall survival.Results:There was no significant difference in overall survival among the four cohorts. The 20-μg dose of Novaferon injected 3 times per week had the highest disease control rate (44.0%) at 6 weeks but without significant differences when compared with placebo (p = .159). Major adverse events with Novaferon were influenza-like symptoms, bone marrow suppression, liver dysfunction, and gastrointestinal discomfort. The level of natural killer cells increased and regulatory T cells decreased significantly after treatment with Novaferon, whereas levels in the placebo group remained the same.Conclusion:Novaferon showed moderate efficacy and was well tolerated in patients with mCRC, especially with the 20-μg dose injected 3 times per week. Furthermore, Novaferon might improve immune function of these patients.
