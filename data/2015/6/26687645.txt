Oxymatrine (OMT), one of the main active components of extracts from the dry roots of Sophora flavescens, has long been employed clinically to treat cancers. Here, we investigated the synergistic effect of OMT with 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) on the tumor growth inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC; Hep-G2 and SMMC-7721) and explored the underlying mechanism. Cells were treated with OMT and/or 5-Fu and subjected to cell viability, colony formation, apoptosis, cell cycle, western blotting, xenograft tumorigenicity assay, and immunohistochemistry. OMT and 5-Fu inhibited the proliferation of Hep-G2 and SMMC-7721 cells, and combination treatment with OMT and 5-Fu resulted in a combination index
