Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and remains a serious health problem worldwide. Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the liver cell nucleus sustains HBV infection. Major treatments for HBV infection include the use of interferon-Î± and nucleotide analogs, but they cannot eradicate cccDNA. As a novel tool for genome editing, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system developed from bacteria can be used to accurately and efficiently engineer and modify genomic DNA. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to target the HBV genome and efficiently inhibit HBV infection. We synthesized four single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the conserved regions of HBV. The expression of these sgRNAS with Cas9 reduced the viral production in Huh7 cells as well as in HBV-replication cell HepG2.2.15. We further demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 direct cleavage and cleavage-mediated mutagenesis occurred in HBV cccDNA of transfected cells. In the new mouse model carrying HBV cccDNA, injection of sgRNA-Cas9 plasmids via rapid tail vein resulted in the low level of cccDNA and HBV protein. In conclusion, the designed CRISPR/Cas9 system can accurately and efficiently target HBV cccDNA and inhibit HBV replication. This system may be used as a novel therapeutic strategy against chronic HBV infection.
