Background and aims:A number of studies have confirmed that antiviral therapy with nucleotide analogs (NAs) can improve the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative therapy. However, what factors affected the prognosis of HBV-HCC after removal of the primary tumor and inhibition of HBV replication? A meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore the prognostic factor for this subgroup of patients.Methods:MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane library were searched from January 1995 to February 2014 for clinical trials evaluating the effect of NAs on the prognosis of HBV-HCC after curative therapy. Data were extracted for host, viral, and intervention information. Single-arm meta-analysis was performed to assess overall survival (OS) rates and HCC recurrence. Meta-regression analysis was carried out to explore risk factors for 1-year OS rate and HCC recurrence for HBV-HCC patients after curative therapy and antiviral therapy.Results:Fourteen observational studies with 1284 patients met the inclusion criteria. Influential factors for prognosis of HCC were mainly baseline HBeAg positivity, cirrhotic stage, advanced Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage, macrovascular invasion, and antiviral agent type. The 1-year OS rate decreased by more than four times (coefficient -4.45, PConclusions:HBV mutation may play a role in HCC recurrence. Entecavir or tenofovir, a high genetic barrier to resistance, should be recommended for HBV-HCC patients.
