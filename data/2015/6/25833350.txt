Objective:The use of three-dimensional T1 weighted gradient echo sequences such as the Dixon technique and the frequency-selective fat suppression (FS) technique is currently widely accepted method in MRI examinations of the liver. To assess the image qualities of the Dixon technique and the frequency-selective FS technique, the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-to-liver and fat-to-liver were compared between the two techniques in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) following administration of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid.Methods:MR images of 59 patients with a total of 86 HCCs were retrospectively evaluated. Images were consecutively obtained with the Dixon and frequency-selective FS methods in the HBP and their CNRs of HCC-to-liver and fat-to-liver were compared. CNRs and contrast ratios were calculated by the mean value of the liver parenchyma, HCC, fat and standard deviation of the liver parenchyma. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used for statistical analysis.Results:The median CNRs for the frequency-selective FS and Dixon techniques of HCC-to-liver were 4.3 and 5.4 (p Conclusion:The Dixon technique yielded higher CNRs of HCC-to-liver than that of the frequency-selective FS technique.Advances in knowledge:There are a limited number of reports on quantitative analysis of the image qualities of the Dixon technique and the frequency-selective FS technique, particularly within the same patient and examination.
