MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through pairing with miRNA recognition elements (MREs), usually in 3'-UTRs. miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of several types of cancers. Specifically, microRNA-32 (miR-32) is overexpressed in colorectal carcinoma, wherein accumulating evidence indicates that it functions as an oncogene. However, the function of miR-32 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been totally elucidated. In the present study, we found the expression of miR-32 was up-regulated in HCC tissue and cell lines, inversely the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) decreased. Besides, miRNA-32 down-regulates PTEN through binding to 3'-UTR of PTEN mRNA from luciferase reporter assay, and the expression level of miR-32 could affect the proliferation, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cell lines via PTEN/Akt signaling pathway. Down-expression of PTEN could significantly attenuate the inhibitory effects of knockdown miR-32 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cells, suggesting that miR-32 could be a potential target for HCC treatment.
