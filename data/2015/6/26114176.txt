Background & aims:Even though Romania has one of the highest incidence and mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC) in Europe, there is currently no organized screening program. We aimed to assess the results of our opportunistic CRC screening using colonoscopy.Methods:A single center retrospective study to include all opportunistic screening colonoscopies performed in two 18 month periods (2007-2008 and 2012-2013) was designed. All asymptomatic individuals without a personal or family history of adenoma or CRC and with complete colonoscopy performed in these two time periods were included.Results:We included 1,807 individuals, 882 in the first period, 925 in the second period. There were 389 individuals aged below 50, 1,351 between 50 and 75 and 67 older than 75 years. There were 956 women (52.9%), with a mean age of 58.5 (median 59, range 23-97). The detection rates were 12.6% for adenomas (6.1% for advanced adenoma) and 3.4% for adenocarcinoma. Adenoma incidence (4.9% in subjects under 50, 14.7% in those aged 50 to 75, and 16.4% in those older than 75, p<0.0001) and size (6.3mm in subjects younger than 50, 9.2mm in those 50 to 75 and 10.8mm in those older than 75, p=0.015) significantly increased with age. Adenoma incidence increased in the second period (14.8% vs. 10.3%, p=0.005), while adenoma size decreased in the second period (8.4mm vs. 10mm, p=0.006). There were no procedure related complications.Conclusions:The neoplasia detection rate was 16% (12.6% adenoma, 3.4% adenocarcinoma). Adenoma incidence and size increased with age in both cohorts. In the second screening period significantly more and smaller adenomas were detected.
