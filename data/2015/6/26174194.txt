This survey provides an overview about current spread of Minimally Invasive Liver Resection (MILR) in Italy. Primary endpoint was to assess evolution of MILR in recent years and its degree of application among centres with different experience in laparoscopic and hepatic surgery. A questionnaire with items describing activity MILR was sent to Italian surgical centers. Diagnosis, technical approaches, resection extent, devices and vascular control, reasons for conversion, morbidity and mortality were recorded. Level of expertise per centre was analysed in terms of learning curve acquisition and relationship with hepatobiliary background. 1497 MILRs from 39 centers (median 27 patients/center, range 1-145, period 1995-2012) were collected. Conversion rate was 10.7% (180 patients out of 1677, excluded from subsequent analysis), with bleeding representing most frequent cause of conversion (34.4%). Eleven centers completed learning curve, performing >60 MILR. Benign lesions were 27.5% and malignant 72.5%, with hepatocellular carcinoma being the most frequent indication. 92.6% of cases were performed with a totally laparoscopic technique (1.3% were hand-assisted, 1.9% single-port and 4.2% robotic). Minor resections accounted for 92.9% (left lateral sectionectomy resulted the most frequent procedure; 23.8%), while major resections represented 7.1%. Overall mortality was 0.2% (3 of 1497 patients) and morbidity 22.8%. Mean length of stay was 5 days. Correlation between MILR activity and a hepatobiliary background was not clear comparing MILR cases and liver resection volumes per center. MILR has been significantly widespread in Italy in recent years, with several centers having definitely completed the learning curve as attested by clinical results consistent with major series from the Western and Eastern countries. MILR programs in Italy seem to arise from both centers with specific hepatobiliary expertise and centers performing advanced general laparoscopic surgery.
