Backgrounds & aims:The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic significances of not only the initial and the best response during repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but if eligible, also the time point of achieving treatment responses.Methods:Three hundred and fourteen treatment-naïve patients with well-preserved liver function undergoing TACE were recruited. Treatment responses were assessed using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods, and Cox regression analysis was performed for multivariate analysis.Results:After adjusting other variables, objective response (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]) as the initial response (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.410) and the best response (adjusted HR 0.335) had independent prognostic significances for OS, respectively (both p 5 cm) and multiple (⩾ 4) tumors were independently associated with failure to achieve CR after the initial TACE (both p Conclusion:Both the initial and the best response predicts OS effectively. However, achievement of treatment response at an early time point is still the most robust predictor for favorable outcomes.
