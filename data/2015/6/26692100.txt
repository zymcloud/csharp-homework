Rab25 was reported to be associated with several human cancers and malignant biological behavior of cancer cells. The goal of the present study was to determine its expression pattern and biological function in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined Rab25 protein in 92 cases of HCC tissues and 3 HCC cell lines. The results showed that Rab25 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells compared with normal liver tissues and cell line. Rab25 overexpression correlated with advanced tumor stage and nodal metastasis. Rab25 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was employed in Bel7402 and SK-Hep-1 cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assay showed that Rab25 depletion blocked cell growth rate and inhibited colony formation ability. Transwell assay showed that Rab25 depletion negatively regulated the invading ability of HCC cells. To explore the possible mechanisms, we checked several signaling pathways and found that Rab25 depletion downregulated AKT phosphorylation. In addition, luciferase reporter assay showed that Rab25 depletion inhibited the Wnt signaling pathway and its target genes such as cyclin D1, c-myc, and MMP7. In conclusion, Rab25 is overexpressed in human HCC and contributes to cancer cell proliferation and invasion possibly through regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway.
