Background:The red cell distribution width is a biomarker of early mortality across various disease states.Aim:To verify whether it may refine estimates of survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The red cell distribution width measured at diagnosis was analyzed in relationship to mortality by any cause both in a retrospective training cohort (N=208), and in an independent prospectively collected validation cohort (N=106) of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on Cox proportional hazards modelling, a prognostic index was validated.Results:In the training and the validation cohort, median survival time was respectively 1026 and 868 days in patients with red cell distribution width â‰¤14.6%, vs. 282 and 340 days in patients with red cell distribution width >14.6%; the corresponding hazard ratios were 0.43 (95% CI: 0.31-0.60), pConclusions:The red cell distribution width is a novel, reproducible, prospectively validated predictor of survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
