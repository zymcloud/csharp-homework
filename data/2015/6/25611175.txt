Background and aim:Sorafenib is now considered as a standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We evaluated the effect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titers on prognosis in HCC patients treated with sorafenib.Methods:From 2008 to 2012, 78 HBV-related HCC patients who received sorafenib treatment at Severance Hospital were included in our analysis. The effect of pretreatment HBV-DNA levels on clinical outcomes for use in predicting prognosis after treatment with sorafenib was examined by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:Median overall survival and median progression-free survival were 5.2 months (95% confidence interval: 4.0-6.4) and 3.5 months (95% confidence interval: 2.3-4.7), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed high levels of HBV-DNA (> 2000 IU/mL) to be an independent risk factor for worse overall survival (P=0.005; hazard ratio, 2.85) and disease progression among patients who did not receive concomitant prophylactic antiviral therapy during sorafenib treatment (P=0.008; hazard ratio, 87.4). Moreover, viral reactivation occurred more frequently in patients who did not receive concomitant prophylactic antiviral therapy than in those who did (4/38 vs 0/40; P=0.025).Conclusion:Higher HBV-DNA levels prior to sorafenib treatment were associated with poorer prognosis and increased viral reactivation thereafter. These results suggest the potential usefulness of prophylactic antiviral therapy when treating HBV-related HCC patients with sorafenib.
