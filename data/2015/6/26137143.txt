Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been reported to augment c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activity in HCC SMMC-7721 cells. By contrast, activator protein-1, a downstream JNK transcription factor, has been revealed to mediate the overexpression of RACK1 in melanoma cells. Therefore, the association between RACK1 and JNK activity in HCC cells has yet to be completely elucidated. The present study analyzed the effects of RACK1 or JNK loss of function on the levels of RACK1 protein, JNK activity, cell proliferation and apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand in HCC SMMC-7721 cells. It was found that JNK loss of function exhibited no effect on RACK1 expression, whereas a loss of RACK1 function led to reduced JNK activity in SMMC-7721 cells. RACK1 and JNK loss of function resulted in the impaired oncogenic growth of SMMC-7721 cells. The present data further support a pivotal role of RACK1 in mediating enhanced JNK activity in HCC cells and also indicate that a novel mechanism exists for RACK1 overexpression in HCC SMMC-7721 cells.
