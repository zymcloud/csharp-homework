Purpose:The purpose of the study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of the balloon blocking technique (BBT).Materials and methods:The BBT was performed in six patients (all males, mean 73.5 years) in whom superselective catheterization for transcatheter arterial embolization by the conventional microcatheter techniques had failed due to anatomical difficulty, including targeted arteries originating steeply or hooked from parent arteries. All BBT procedures were performed using Seldinger's transfemoral method. Occlusive balloons were deployed and inflated at the distal side of the target artery branching site in the parent artery via transfemoral access. A microcatheter was delivered from a 5-F catheter via another femoral access and was advanced over the microguidewire into the target artery, under balloon blockage of advancement of the microguidewire into non-target branches. After the balloon catheter was deflated and withdrawn, optimal interventions were performed through the microcatheter.Results:After success of accessing the targeted artery by BBT, optimal interventions were accomplished in all patients with no complications other than vasovagal hypotension, which responded to nominal therapy.Conclusion:The BBT may be useful in superselective catheterization of inaccessible arteries due to anatomical difficulties.
