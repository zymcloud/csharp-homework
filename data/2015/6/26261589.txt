Objective:By the detection of HBV infection, AFP and AST, the targets of biological behavior and the gene expression of multi-drug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we investigate characteristics of the expression of MDR1 in HCC and its relationship with HCC biological behavior.Methods:Using real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) to detect the expressions of MDR1 in 102 samples of HCC tissue and 20 samples of non-cancerous tissue, we analyze the relationship between expressions of MDR1 and biological characteristics of HCC.Results:The expression of MDR1 in HCC is 0.55 ± 0.27, and in normal liver tissues is 0.23 ± 0.10, respectively. The expression in HCC is higher than it in normal liver tissue, the difference is statistically significant (PConclusion:There are drug resistance phenomena in HCC, MDR1 expression may play an important role in primary HCC drug resistance. HBV infection can be detected as a reference indicator of HCC chemotherapy resistance, plasma levels of AFP, AST can be used as a reference index change dynamic monitoring of MDR1 expression.
