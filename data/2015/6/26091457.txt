The aim of this study is to assess whether preoperative serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) can predict recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The association between preoperative IL-6 levels and HCC recurrence following curative hepatectomy in 146 patients with chronic HBV infection was determined. Patients were divided into groups based on the presence or absence of HCC recurrence. Serum IL-6 levels were compared between groups, and the association between serum IL-6 level and greatest tumor dimension was also analyzed. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to define the optimal cutoff value for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates. The OS and RFS rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Out of 146 patients, 80 (54.8%) patients were documented as having HCC recurrence during the follow-up period. After adjusting for potential confounders, serum IL-6 levels were significantly associated with HCC recurrence, and a saturation effect existed with serum IL-6 levels up to 3.7 pg/mL. In addition, patients with preoperative serum IL-6 levels over 3.1 pg/mL had lower RFS and OS rates (P
