Introduction:Obstructive jaundice as a result of bile duct tumour thrombus (BDTT) is an unusual clinical entity and an uncommon presenting feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluates the outcome of hepatectomy for HCC with obstructive jaundice as a result of BDTT in non-cirrhotic livers.Methods:Between 1997 and 2012, out of 426 patients with HCC in non-cirrhotic livers, 39 patients with BDTT (Group I n = 39), who underwent a hepatectomy, were analysed and compared with the non-BDTT group (Group II n = 387).Results:The demographic profile and biochemical parameters between Group I and Group II were compared; apart from the presence of jaundice at presentation and an elevated serum bilirubin, there were no significant differences. Post-operative morbidity and mortality were 11 (28.2%) and 2 (5.1%), respectively, in Group I. There were no differences between the groups with regards to the operative variables and short-term outcomes. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in Group I were 82%, 48% and 10%, respectively, with a median survival of 28.6 months and were significantly poorer than Group II (90%, 55% and 38%, respectively, with a median survival of 39.2 months).Conclusion:The mere presence of BDTT in HCC does not indicate an advanced or inoperable lesion. When technically feasible, a formal hepatic resection is the preferred first-line treatment option in these patients.
