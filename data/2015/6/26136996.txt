This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the association between xeroderma pigmentosum complementary group D (XPD) Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn polymorphisms and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Chinese Biomedicine databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies published up to June 1, 2014. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 12.0 software. A total of 11 case-control studies, comprising 2,852 cases and 2,936 controls, were included. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that a significant association between the risk of HCC and variant genotypes of the XPD Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn polymorphisms was evident in the homozygote comparison [Gln/Gln versus Lys/Lys: Odds ratio (OR), 1.831; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.001-3.349], heterozygote comparison (Lys/Gln versus Lys/Lys: OR, 1.486; 95% CI, 1.044-2.114), dominant model (Gln/Gln + Lys/Gln versus Lys/Lys: OR, 1.540; 95% CI, 1.054-2.249) and allelic contrast (Gln-allele versus Lys-allele: OR, 1.453; 95% CI, 1.032-2.046) for the Lys751Gln polymorphism and the homozygote comparison for the Asp312Asn polymorphism (Asn/Asn versus Asp/Asp: OR, 1.352; 95% CI, 1.010-1.808). By contrast, no significant association was observed in the recessive model for the Lys751Gln polymorphism (Gln/Gln versus Lys/Gln + Lys/Lys: OR, 1.603; 95% CI, 0.924-2.779), or for the heterozygote comparison (Asn/Asp versus Asp/Asp: OR, 1.229; 95% CI, 0.857-1.762), dominant model (Asn/Asn + Asp/Asn versus Asp/Asp: OR, 1.249; 95% CI, 0.910-1.715), recessive model (Asn/Asn versus Asp/Asn + Asp/Asp: OR, 1.250; 95% CI, 0.940-1.663) or allelic contrast (Asn-allele versus Asp-allele: OR, 1.226; 95% CI, 0.965-1.557) for the Asp312Asn polymorphism. The present meta-analysis has indicated that the XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism could be a potential biomarker of HCC susceptibility and that the XPD Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn polymorphisms could be risk factors for HCC susceptibility in an Asian population; however, further large-scale and well-designed studies are required to reach a more precise and comprehensive conclusion.
