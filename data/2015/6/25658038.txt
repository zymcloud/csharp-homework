Purpose:To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for hepatic nodules 20 mm or smaller detected during ultrasonographic (US) surveillance in patients with cirrhosis.Materials and methods:Between November 2003 and January 2010, patients with cirrhosis with a newly US-detected solitary hepatic nodule 20 mm or smaller were included in this institutional ethics committee-approved study. All patients provided written informed consent before the study; the need to obtain consent for reanalysis of the data was waived. Patients underwent MR imaging and fine-needle biopsy (the reference standard). Nodules without pathologic confirmation were followed up with MR imaging every 6 months. A LI-RADS category was retrospectively assigned to nodules seen at MR imaging. The diagnostic accuracy for each LI-RADS category was described by sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with 95% confidence intervals.Results:Final diagnoses of 133 nodules in 159 patients were as follows: 102 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), three intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs), one neuroendocrine metastasis, and 27 benign lesions (median MR imaging follow-up, 95 months). None (0%) of five LI-RADS category 1 lesions, three (25%) of 12 category 2 lesions, 29 (69%) of 42 category 3 lesions, 24 (96%) of 25 category 4 lesions, and 44 (98%) of 45 category 5 lesions were HCCs. One category 3 lesion was ICC, one category 5 lesion was a neuroendocrine metastasis, and two (50%) of four lesions categorized as other malignancies were HCCs. In patients with nodules detected at surveillance US, LI-RADS category 4 criteria were as effective as category 5 criteria for HCC diagnosis. Combining both categories would improve sensitivity without impairing specificity or positive or negative predictive value for HCC diagnosis (42.3%, 98.2%, 97.8%, and 47.4% vs 65.4%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 59.6%, respectively).Conclusion:In patients with cirrhosis with US-detected nodules 20 mm or smaller, both LI-RADS category 4 and category 5 have high specificity for HCC. In addition, a relevant proportion of lesions categorized as LI-RADS category 2 or 3 or as other malignancies were HCCs. Thus, active diagnostic work-up, including biopsy to allow prompt treatment, is recommended in such patients. Online supplemental material is available for this article.
