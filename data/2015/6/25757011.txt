Background information:Tumour-associated lymphangiogenesis was identified as an important clinical determinant for the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and significantly influences patient survival. However, in this context, little is known about regulation of lymphangiogenesis by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF). In HCC, mainly HIF-1α was positively correlated with lymphatic invasion and metastasis, whereas a defined role of HIF-2α is missing.Results:We created a stable knockdown (k/d) of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in HepG2 cells and generated co-cultures of HepG2 spheroids with embryonic bodies. This constitutes an in vitro tumour model mimicking the cancer microenvironment and allows addressing the role of distinct HIF isoforms in regulating HCC lymphangiogenesis. In co-cultures with a HIF-2α k/d, lymphangiogenesis was significantly increased, whereas the k/d of HIF-1α showed no effect. The HIF-2α-dependent lymphangiogenic phenotype was confirmed in vivo using matrigel plug assays with supernatants of HIF-2α k/d HepG2 cells. We identified and verified insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) as a HIF-2α target gene. The potential of HepG2 cells to induce lymphangiogenesis in two independent functional assays was significantly enhanced either by a k/d of HIF-2α or by silencing IGFBP1. Moreover, we confirmed IGF as a potent pro-lymphatic growth factor with IGFBP1 being its negative modulator.Conclusions:We propose that HIF-2α acts as an important negative regulator of hepatic lymphangiogenesis in vitro and in vivo by inducing IGFBP1 and thus, interfering with IGF signalling. Therefore, HIF-2α may constitute a critical target in HCC therapy.
