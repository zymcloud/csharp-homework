Introduction:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus thermal ablation has been widely used recently in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to compare results of the combination of TACE and percutaneous thermal ablation with those of hepatectomy in patients with HCC.Methods:The clinical data of 137 HCC patients who sequentially received TACE and computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous thermal ablation as an initial curative treatment (combination group) and 148 matched HCC patients who received hepatectomy (surgery group) between 2004 and 2011 were collected and analyzed. After TACE, multiphase contrast-enhanced CT was performed to identify the total number of tumors as well as lipiodol deposition in the liver. Survival was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test. The prognostic factors were assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.Results:Of all 285 patients, 225 (79.0%) had cancerous lesionsâ‰¤5 cm in diameter. In preoperative contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging, the number of tumors was 1-4 for each patient. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 95, 74%, and 67% in the combination group and 88, 66, and 47% in the surgery group, respectively (P=0.004); the corresponding recurrence-free survival rates for the two groups were 92, 69, and 61% and 75, 58, and 44%, respectively (P=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, treatment allocation was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Only 60 patients in the combination group had sufficient imaging data, and 135 new lesions with lipiodol deposition were diagnosed as malignancies in 22 of 60 patients, whereas 20 new lesions were found in 11 of 148 patients in the surgery group.Conclusion:The combination of TACE and CT-guided percutaneous thermal ablation for HCC improves survival of HCC patients compared with hepatectomy.
