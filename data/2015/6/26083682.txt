Three new N-methyladenine-containing diterpenes, 2-oxoagelasines A (1) and F (2) and 10-hydro-9-hydroxyagelasine F (3), were isolated from the Okinawan marine sponge Agelas nakamurai Hoshino together with eight known agelasine derivatives, 2-oxoagelasine B (4), agelasines A (5), B (6), D (7), E (8), F (9), and G (10), and ageline B (11). The structures of 1-3 were assigned on the basis of their spectroscopic data and their comparison with those of the literature. Compounds 3 and 5-11 inhibited the growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis with inhibition zones of 10, 14, 15, 18, 14, 20, 12, and 12 mm at 20 μg/disc, respectively. All compounds were inactive (IC50 > 10 μM) against Huh-7 (hepatoma) and EJ-1 (bladder carcinoma) human cancer cell lines. Three 2-oxo derivatives (1, 2, and 4) exhibited markedly reduced biological activity against M. smegmatis. Moreover, compound 10 inhibited protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity with an IC50 value of 15 μM.
