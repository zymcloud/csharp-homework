Background and aim:To evaluate the role of antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogs (NAs) in sorafenib-treated patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A retrospective cohort study was done in 151 HBV-related HCC patients treated with sorafenib at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between 2007 and 2012. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival and adverse events were compared in patients treated with/without NAs. Subgroup analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to determine the efficiency of NAs and prognostic factors for OS.Results:HBV-related HCC patients (n=151) were identified from our database of HCC patients treated with sorafenib. Patients treated with NAs (antiviral group, n=88) had significantly improved OS compared with the patients who received no NAs (non-antiviral group, n=63; median OS: 16.47 months vs 13.10 months, P=0.03). Patients in the antiviral group had a significant risk reduction of death compared with the non-antiviral group (hazard ratio: 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.98, P=0.04). By subgroup analysis, patients of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C and patients with higher presorafenib HBV-DNA level achieved better survival improvement. Antiviral therapy with NAs was one of the independent prognostic factors for OS of HBV-related HCC patients who were treated with sorafenib.Conclusion:Antiviral therapy with NAs improved OS of HBV-related HCC patients treated with sorafenib, especially in patients with BCLC stage C disease and higher HBV-DNA level.
