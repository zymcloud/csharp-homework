Background and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often associated with chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis-B or -C viruses. Active specific immunotherapy (ASI) with autologous dendritic cells (DC) presenting antigens from autologous tumor stem cell (TC) lines is associated with promising long-term survival in metastatic cancer, but hepatitis patients were excluded. ASI might benefit high-risk primary HCC patients following surgical resection, but first it is important to show that ASI does not exacerbate hepatitis.Methods:Previously untreated HCC patients with a solitary lesion > 5 cm, or three lesions with at least one > 3 cm, or more than three lesions, underwent surgical resection from which autologous TC lines were established. Irradiated TC were incubated with autologous DC to create DC-TC. After one course of trans-arterial chemoembolization therapy (TACE), three weekly subcutaneous injections of DC-TC suspended in granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor were administered. Patients were monitored for eight weeks.Results:HCC cell lines were established within five weeks for 15/15 patients. Eight patients, all with chronic hepatitis B, were treated. There was no increase in hepatic transaminases, hepatitis B antigens, or viral DNA.Conclusion:Autologous DC-TC did not exacerbate HBV in these HCC patients. A phase II efficacy trial is being planned.
