In living donor liver transplantations, right liver grafts have been commonly used to meet the metabolic demands of the recipient. However, a small left remnant liver volume sometimes limits its use due to donor safety concerns. Here, we report an innovative living donor hepatectomy using a left liver extended to the right anterior sector (segments 2-5 and 8), which can be considered for donors who are unsuited for right liver donation.
