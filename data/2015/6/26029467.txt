Chronic hepatitis C induced cirrhosis predisposes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is no data regarding the impact of hepatitis C treatment on HCC. We report a case of a 53-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C and HCC with lung metastasis who failed treatment with sorafenib but the tumor regressed after treatment of hepatitis C with ribavirin and sofosbuvir for 24 weeks.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); hepatitis C; ribavirin; sofosbuvir.
