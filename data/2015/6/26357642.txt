Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, a major public health problem, causes acute and chronic hepatitis that is often complicated by liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenic mechanisms of HBV-related liver disease are not well understood, and the current licensed therapies are not effective in permanently clearing virus from the circulation. In recent years, the role of micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) in HBV infection has attracted great interest. Cellular miRNAs can influence HBV replication directly by binding to HBV transcripts and indirectly by targeting cellular factors relevant to the HBV life cycle. They are also involved in the regulation of cellular genes and signaling pathways that have critical roles in HBV pathogenesis. HBV infection, in turn, can trigger changes in cellular miRNA expression that are associated with distinctive miRNA expression profiles depending on the phase of liver disease. These alterations in miRNA expression have been linked to disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis. We provide here an up to date review regarding the field of miRNAs and HBV interplay and highlight the potential utility of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the management of HBV-related liver disease.
