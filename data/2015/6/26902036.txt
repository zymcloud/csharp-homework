Background/aims:Selection of patients with hepa- to-cellular carcinoma for liver transplantation is gen- erally performed according to the so-called Milan cri- teria. The aim of this study was to learn whether, after down-staging loco-regional therapies, patients origi- nally non-fulfilling the MC (Milan-OUT) meet these criteria (Milan-IN).Methodology:Between January 2000 and December 2008, 172 patients with HCC re- ceived LT at our Department. Of these, 142 were sub- jected to DS before LT.Results:Of the 142 patients who received DS, 115 (81%) were Milan-IN and 27 (19%) were Milan-OUT at the time of their enrollment in the waiting list for LT. After a median follow-up of 50 months, overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival and dis- ease recurrence-free survival were not significantly different.Conclusions:Patients with Milan-OUT HCC can be successfully subjected to LT when they fulfill the MC after being subjected to DS. Imaging progres- sion while on the waiting list is a strong predictor of high rates of HCC recurrence even in patients meet- ing the MC. Lack of imaging progression seems to be a strong predictor of positive LT outcome and should be added to the eligibility criteria for the assessment of LT candidates with HCC.
