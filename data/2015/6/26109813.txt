Aim:To determine the cut-off value of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and assess the correlation of ICAM-1 with clinicopathological features and the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who underwent surgical resection.Methods:We prospectively collected clinicopathological data from 236 HCC patients who had undergone successful hepatectomy. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off value of ICAM-1. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the concentration of ICAM-1 in 236 serum samples isolated from HCC patients and the stratified analysis was used to compare the serum level of ICAM-1 in different HCC subgroups. Immunohistochemistry was performed to test the expression level of the ICAM-1 protein in 76 cases of HCC tissues and their adjacent normal liver tissues (ANLT). The survival probability of HCC patients was estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots and differences between the groups were obtained using the log-rank test. Furthermore, independent indicators of the prognosis were acquired using a stepwise Cox proportional hazard model to analyze a series of predictors that were associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in HCC patients.Results:Our findings suggested that ICAM-1 promotes HCC metastasis and high serum ICAM-1 is significantly associated with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (P = 0.022), clinical tumor-node-metastasis stage (P 684 ng/mL was an independent factor for DFS (HR = 1.643; 95%CI: 1.125-2.401; P = 0.010) and OS (HR = 1.692; 95%CI: 1.152-2.486; P = 0.007).Conclusion:ICAM-1 may be a promising serological biomarker for HCC diagnosis and an independent predictor of DFS and OS after surgical resection and may provide a useful reference for the prediction of intra- and extrahepatic metastasis.
