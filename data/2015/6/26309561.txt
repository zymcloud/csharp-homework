Background:To investigate the characteristics of Budd-Chiari syndrome (B-CS) types, rate of HCC complicated by different types of B-CS and values of CTA in diagnosis of B-CS and HCC complicated by B-CS.Material and methods:494 patients with B-CS were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent CTA, which was used to assess the accuracy of diagnosing B-CS and the rate of HCC complicated by various kinds of B-CS. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and pathological examination were used as gold standard.Results:Among 494 patients diagnosed by DSA, there were 21 (4.3%) cases of inferior vena cava type, 80 (16.2%) cases of hepatic vein type and 393 (79.6%) cases of hepatic vein combined with inferior vena cava complex type. The accuracy of diagnosing B-CS by CTA was 86.6% (428/494), in which the accuracy of diagnosing inferior vena cava type was 85.7% (18/21), 83.8% (67/80) for hepatic vein type and 87.3% (343/393) for complex type. The rate of HCC complicated by B-CS was 12.8% (63/494), among which inferior vena cava type was 4.8% (1/21), hepatic vein type was 11.3% (9/80) and complex type was 13.5% (53/393). There were no statistic differences between these three types (P=0.459). The accuracy of diagnosing HCC by CTA was 82.5% (52/63).Conclusion:B-CS in patients from China's Yellow River basin is mainly hepatic vein combined with inferior vena cava complex type, which is more likely to be complicated by HCC. CTA plays an important role in diagnosing B-CS and HCC complicated by B-CS.
