Background:Ehrlich ascites carcinoma is the one of the animal cancer models having high malignancy and rapid growth resistance. Silibin has reported to be an antioxidant in previous studies. We aimed to investigate the effects of silibin on mouse liver with Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells in different time periods.Methods:Balb/c mice were divided into five groups. Group I (Control): The saline buffer (sb) was injected intraperitoneally (ip) to the mice for 15 days. Group II (Silibin): 150mg/kg silibin was injected ip for 15 days. Group III (Ehrlich): 2Ã—10(5) cells were transferred from the donor mouse to healthy mice on first day. Group IV (Ehrlich+Silibin): Silibin was given between 5th and 15th days to mice inoculated with EAT. Group V (Silibin+Ehrlich): Silibin was injected for 15 days after EAT cells. The liver sections were stained with matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9), caspase 3, caspase 8, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibodies by the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. Biochemical analysis and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method were performed in the liver.Results:Superoxide dismutase levels of liver increased in Ehrlich+Silibin group compared with Ehrlich group. Malondialdehyde levels significantly decreased in Silibin+Ehrlich group compared with Ehrlich+Silibin. MMP-2 and MMP-9 immunopositive cells increased in Silibin+Ehrlich compared with Ehrlich group. Caspase 3 and TUNEL signals significantly increased in Silibin+Ehrlich group compared with Ehrlich group. PCNA positive signals significantly increased in Ehrlich+Silibin group compared with Ehrlich group.Conclusion:According to our findings, we suggest that silibin treatment after EAT cells inoculation has more effective than concurrently EAT and silibin treatment.
