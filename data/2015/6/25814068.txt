Using 3β-hydroxy-5-androsten-17-one as a starting material, a series of novel nitrogen-containing B-nor-D-homosteroids were designed and synthesized by the oximation, Beckman rearrangement, ozonation, cyclization and condensation reaction. The structures of all new compounds were determined by analysis of their NMR, MS and IR spectra. The antiproliferative activity of compounds was evaluated against HT-29 (colonic carcinoma), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) and Bel 7404 (human liver carcinoma) cells.
