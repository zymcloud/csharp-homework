In Japan, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections have decreased; however, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has increased. Antiviral treatment against these viruses has been established. With antiviral medicines, HBV DNA and HIV RNA levels decrease to under the detectable limits and HCV is completely eliminated from almost 90% of infected patients. Furthermore, the morbidities associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have decreased. The: appearance of antiviral-resistant HBV and HCV is a concern because long-term treatment is needed against these viruses. Patients infected with HBV in the past have the potential to develop de novo hepatitis with immunosuppressive treatment, in spite of being HBsAg-negative and with HBV DNA under the detectable level.
