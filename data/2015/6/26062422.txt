Objective:To observe the expression of nuclear protein 1 (Nupr1), a stress-related nuclear protein, in a panel of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and its effects on the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by RNA interference-mediated knockdown.Methods:Real-time quantitative PCR was employed to detect Nupr1 mRNA levels in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, including BEL-7402, QSG-7703, SMMC-7721 and HepG2. After Nupr1 expression was knocked down by RNA interference, cell proliferation was monitored by MTT assay and colony formation in plate. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry and cell migration was assayed by TranswellTM assay.Results:Higher expression of Nupr1 was detected in HepG2 as compared with the other cell lines. Nupr1 expression in HepG2 cells were efficiently knocked down by two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), with inhibitory rates being 72.25% and 84.25%, respectively. HepG2 cells with Nupr1 knockdown displayed lower rate of proliferation, G1 arrest, and significantly decreased abilities of cell migration and colony formation. Western blotting showed that Nupr1 knockdown increased the expressions of p21 and p27, two negative regulators of cell cycle.Conclusion:Knockdown of Nupr1 inhibited the proliferation and migration of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
