Background/aims:This study aimed to investigate the association between comorbidity, anti-cancer treatment, and overall survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastases.Methodology:We retrospectively analyzed data from 57 patients diagnosed as having treatment-naïve stage IV HCC with extrahepatic metastases between 2007 and 2010. Comorbidity was assessed using two scoring systems, the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the Kaplan-Feinstein index. Associations between comorbidity, demographic variables, treatment modality, and overall survival were analyzed.Results:Univariate analysis showed that a CCI of ≥ 2 (P = 0.017), an Okuda score of II/III (P = 0.026), and the use of anti-cancer therapy (P = 0.039) was associated with overall survival. Fewer patients with a CCI of ≥ 2 received treatment (P Conclusions:The pre-treatment comorbidity status played an important role in overall survival because of its association with the administration of anti-cancer therapy. Therefore, comprehensive evaluation of comorbidities before treatment is recommended for HCC patients with extrahepatic metastases.
