To study the potential molecular mechanism of tumor angiogenesis in its microenvironment, we investigated the effects of HepG2 conditioned medium on the proliferation of vascular endothelial cell and vascular angiogenesis in our laboratory. Human umbilical vein endothelial EA. hy926 cells were co-cultured with HepG2 conditioned medium in vitro. The proliferation and the tubulogenesis of EA. hy926 cells were detected by teramethylazo salt azole (MTT) and tube formation assay, respectively. The results showed that the survival rate of the EA. hy926 cells was significantly increased under the co-culture condition. HepG2 conditioned medium also enhanced the angiogenesis ability of EA. hy926 cells. In addition, the expressions of intracellular VEGF and extracellular VEGFR (Flk-1) were regulated upward in a time-dependent manner. In conclusion, the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and Vascula angiogenesis were improved under the condition of indirect co-culture.
