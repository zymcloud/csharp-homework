Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) as treatment for single, focal hepatic malignancies.Materials and methods:Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. From December 2003 to May 2012, 64 patients were treated with MWA for a single hepatic lesion, in 64 sessions. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was treated in 25 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 3.33-cm; 95% CI, 2.65-4.18-cm; range, 1.0-12.0-cm), metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) was treated in 27 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 2.7-cm; 95% CI, 2.20-3.40-cm; range, 0.8-6.0-cm), and other histological-types were treated in 12 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 3.79-cm; 95% CI, 2.72-5.26-cm; range, 1.7-8.0-cm). Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was used to analyze time event data. Chi-square and correlation evaluated the relationship between tumor size and treatment parameters.Results:Technical success rate was 95.3% (61/64). Treatment parameters were tailored to tumor size; as size increased more antennae were used (pConclusion:In our sample, tumor size did not appear to impact complete ablation rates or local recurrence rates for focal hepatic malignancies treated with MWA.
