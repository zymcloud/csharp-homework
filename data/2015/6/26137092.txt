Human glioblastoma multiforme is one of the most aggressive malignant brain tumor types, and the mean survival time of patients with a brain tumor is <2 years when traditional therapies are administered. Thus, numerous studies have focused on the development of novel treatments for brain tumors. Frog ribonucleases, such as Onconase and Rana catesbeiana ribonuclease (RC-RNase), exert antitumor effects on various tumor cells, including cervical cancer, breast cancer, hepatoma, leukemia, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer cells. In addition, frog Onconase has been applied as a treatment in clinical trials. However, the antitumor effects of frog ribonucleases on brain tumors are unclear. Previous studies have indicated that RC-RNase demonstrates a decreased cytotoxic effect in normal cells compared with Onconase. Therefore, the present study investigated the ability of RC-RNase to exert antitumor activities on human glioblastoma. It was found that RC-RNase inhibits the growth of the human glioblastoma DBTRG, GBM8901 and GBM8401 cells. In addition, the present study revealed that RC-RNase induces caspase-9/-3 activity and triggers the apoptotic cell death pathway in human glioblastoma cells. Notably, it was also demonstrated that RC-RNase effectively inhibits the growth of human glioblastoma tumors in a nude mouse model. Overall, the present study indicates that RC-RNase may be a potential agent for the treatment of human glioblastoma.
