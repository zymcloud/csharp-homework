Background/aims:The predictive role of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) before performing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has not been determined. We assessed the possible predictive factors of CEUS for the response to TACE.Methods:Seventeen patients with 18 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) underwent TACE. All of the tumors were studied with CEUS before TACE using a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent (SonoVue®, Bracco, Milan, Italy). The tumor response to TACE was classified with a score between 1 and 4 according to the remaining enhancing-tumor percentage based on modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST): 1, enhancing tumor Results:The median tumor size was 3.1 cm. The distribution of tumor response scores after TACE in all tumors was as follows: 1, n=11; 2, n=4; 3, n=2; and 4, n=1. Fifteen tumors showed feeding arteries. The presence of a feeding artery and the tumor size (≤5 cm) were the predictive factors for a good response (P=0.043 and P=0.047, respectively).Conclusions:The presence of a feeding artery and a tumor size of less than 5 cm were the predictive factors for a good response of HCC to TACE on CEUS.
