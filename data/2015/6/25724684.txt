Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is asymptomatic at early stages, and thus, initial diagnosis frequently occurs at advanced or even metastatic stages, leading to a high rate of mortality. Ferric nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA)-induced RCC model is a useful tool to analyze molecular events at different stages of the carcinogenesis process in vivo. MAPKs' alterations seem to play an important role in the development and maintenance of human RCC tumors. Based on the above, p38α/β/γ, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 statuses were studied at early stages of FeNTA-induced renal carcinogenesis (1 and 2 months of carcinogen treatment) as well as in tumor tissue. MAPKs showed distinct response along carcinogenesis process, either as total proteins and/or as their phosphorylated forms. While the increase in total and phospho-p38α/β levels became lower as carcinogenesis progressed, p38γ overexpression grew. Instead, total JNK2 diminished, but JNK1 was elevated at all studied times, and p-JNK1 levels increased at early stages, but not in tumors. In contrast, p-JNK2 rose at 2 months of treatment and in tumor tissue. Increased levels of p-ERK1/2 were observed at all stages analyzed. Very interestingly, at 1 and 2 months of FeNTA treatment, no alterations in MAPKs were found in liver or lung, where no primary tumors are induced with the scheme of FeNTA administration followed here. In conclusion, MAPKs' behavior evolved differentially as renal carcinogenesis advanced, even among isoforms of the same family, but it did not change in other tissues. All this strongly suggests a role of these kinases in FeNTA-induced RCC tumor development and maintenance.
