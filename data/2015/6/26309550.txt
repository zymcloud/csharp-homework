Background:Since, the relationship between hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and HCC was inconsistent in the recent literatures. The present meta-analysis based on previous studies was to obtain precise estimation on the issue.Methods:A computer search was carried out from PubMed, CBM and EMBASE databases. A total of nine case-control publications with 2583 HCC patients and 2271 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the relationship of Ser326Cys polymorphism and HCC susceptibility. Z test was used to assess the significance of pooled OR. The fixed-effect model or random-effect model was employed according to heterogeneity.Results:Overall, hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism was in relation with increased risk for HCC under the following genetic models: GG versus CC: OR=2.51, 95% CI=1.67-3.78; GG versus CG + CC: OR=2.27, 95% CI=1.57-3.30; GG + CG versus CC: OR=1.13, 95% CI=1.03-1.24. The subgroup analysis by ethnicity suggested that high risk for HCC was observed in Asians with GG and GG + CG genotype (GG versus CC: OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.49-3.17; GG versus CG + CC: OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.41-2.73; GG + CG versus CC: OR=1.13, 95% CI=1.03-1.25). For subgroup analysis based on source of control, GG genotype of Ser326Cys was significantly associated with HCC risk in hospital-based (HB) controls (GG versus CC: OR=2.31, 95% CI=1.50-3.56; GG versus CG + CC: OR=2.17, 95% CI=1.44-3.28), as well as in population-based (PB) models (GG vs. CC: OR=2.80, 95% CI=1.16-6.77; GG versus CG + CC: OR=2.39, 95% CI=1.08-5.30).Conclusions:According to the results, hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism was associated with increased risk of HCC.
