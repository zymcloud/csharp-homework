Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading primary liver cancer and its clinical outcome is still poor. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have demonstrated an interesting potential to regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. Current findings suggest that miRNAs deregulation in cancer is caused by genetic and/or epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications resulting in abnormal expression and hallmarks of malignant transformation: aberrant cell growth, cell death, differentiation, angiogenesis, invasion and met√°stasis. The important role of miRNAs in the development and progression of HCC has increased the efforts to understand and develop mechanisms of control overt this single-stranded RNAs. Several studies have analyzed tumoral response to the regulation and control of deregulated miRNAs with good results in vitro and in vivo, proving that targeting aberrant expression of miRNAs is a powerful anticancer therapeutic. Identification of up and/or down regulated miRNAs related to HCC has led to the discovery of new potential application for detection of their presence in the affected organism. MiRNAs represent a relevant new target for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment in a wide variety of pathologic entities, including HCC. This manuscript intends to summarize current knowledge regarding miRNAs and their role in HCC development.
