Background:Tumor resection in non-metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with adequate liver reserve offers a potential cure, but has a high 5-year recurrence rate. We analyzed the patterns of cancer relapse after partial hepatectomy to guide post-operative management.Methods:A total of 144 HCC patients (1996-2011) after partial hepatectomy were reviewed. Statistical correlations were determined using univariate and partition analyses.Results:A median follow-up of 20 months showed recurrence in 71 (49%) patients, and the median time to recurrence was 11.9 months. Vascular invasion (PConclusions:Intrahepatic recurrence after partial hepatectomy is common and is significantly associated with vascular invasion and tumor stage. About 57% of patients with intrahepatic relapse had a recurrence close (â‰¤2.5 cm) to the SM. Additionally, patients with SM
