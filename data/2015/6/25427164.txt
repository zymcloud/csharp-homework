Background:Vascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high incidence of recurrence after liver transplantation. Patients with microvascular invasion (MVI) show a high tumor grade; however, some show a good prognosis. This retrospective study aimed to investigate whether the degree of MVI affects prognosis after living-donor liver transplantation.Methods:A total of 142 patients with HCC who had undergone living-donor liver transplantation were histologically evaluated about the number of invaded vessels and the maximum number of invading carcinoma cells. Patients with MVI were classified into two subgroups: high MVI group (n = 38), which showed more than 50 carcinoma cells in the vessels, with multiple invaded vessels; and low MVI group (n = 17), which showed MVI, but not high MVI.Results:Analysis of recurrence-free survival showed that high MVI group had significantly poorer outcomes than the other groups (P Conclusion:In living-donor liver transplantation for HCC, high MVI is a novel pathologic marker for predicting prognosis.
