Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment for patients suffering from intermediate, B stage, hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite an undisputed pharmacokinetic advantage, TACE with microspheres has not been shown to be superior in terms of survival compared to conventional TACE using Lipiodol(®). The best guarantee to reduce toxicity and maximize the efficacy of TACE is to strictly observe the contraindications for the procedure (Child-Pugh>B8, reduced portal flow, very large tumor, any technical contraindication and renal impairment), and rigorous application of the administration requirements for the Lipiodol(®) emulsion or loaded microspheres (assessment of hepatic vascularization investigating for accessory vascularization, injection methods). Tumor response should be assessed after four weeks by CT or MRI using the modified RECIST criteria.
