One new monoterpene glucoside and five dihydroflavonols were isolated for the first time from the aerial parts of Pulicaria jaubertii and identified as p-menthane-2-O-β-D-glucopyranoside [1], dihydroquercetin (taxifolin) [2], 7,3'-di-O-methyltaxifolin [3], 3'-O-methyltaxifolin [4], 7-O-methyltaxifolin (padmatin) [5] and 7-O-methyl-dihydrokampferol (7-O-methylaromadenderin) [6]. The structures of these compounds were unambiguously assigned on the basis of NMR spectroscopic data ((1)H, (13)C, DEPT, HSQC, HMBC) and MS analysis. 2D-NMR methods required revision of assignments of H-6 and H-8 for dihydroflavonol compounds. Possible cytotoxic activity as well as blood pressure (BP) lowering activity were tested. The alcoholic extract showed cytotoxic activity against prostate carcinoma (PC-3), breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2) human cell lines with IC50 19.1, 20.0 and 24.1 μg, respectively. The higher dose levels of the alcoholic extract significantly reduced normal BP of rats in a dose-dependent manner.
