Objective:The long-term prognosis after hepatic resection for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been disappointing because of the high recurrence rates in the remnant liver, which constitutes the major cause of death. The purpose of this study was to identify the prognostic factors for overall survival after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in recurrent HCC after the initial curative surgical resection.Materials and methods:From January 2003 through October 2012, 362 patients who developed recurrent HCC after initial surgical resection and underwent TACE as the first-line therapy were retrospectively studied at a single institution in our hospital. Patients who met our inclusion criteria were followed until December 2012. Prognostic factors for overall survival were analyzed.Results:In total, 287 patients were enrolled. The median overall survival period was 747 days. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates after TACE were 72.9%, 51.8%, and 31.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that the number of resected HCCs (≥ 2, p 5 cm, p = 0.022) of the recurrent HCCs, and the number of TACE sessions (≤ 3, p Conclusion:TACE appears to be an effective treatment of patients who experienced a recurrence after curative HCC resection. An initial solitary HCC, a solitary recurrence, and recurrent tumor mass 5 cm or smaller are statistically significant independent prognostic factors for survival.
