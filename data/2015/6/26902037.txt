Background/aims:To determine the utility of the quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values at various b values, in the differentiation of malignant hepatic masses on 3.0 Tesla (T) MRI.Methodology:We evaluated 81 consecutive patients presenting with 529 malignant masses in the liver. Of those patients 27 had a primary hepatic malignancy while the other 54 patients had metastases in the liver. Quantitative ADC values of malignant hepatic masses was measured at four b values (b 400, b 800, b 1600, b 2000 mm2/s) on MR-DWI. We compared the primary and metastatic tumors within their groups and also with each other in terms of their ADC values.Results:In 4 various b value measurements, the mean ADC values of the primary and metastatic hepatic masses were 1. x 10(-3), 1.06 x 10(-3), 0.87 x 10(-3), and 0.736 x 10(-3)mm2/ seconds, 1.30 x 10(-3), 1.10 x 10(-3), 0.84 x 10(-3), and 0.715 x 10(-3) mm2/seconds respectively. There was no significant difference between mean ADC values of HCCs and metastases at b 400, 800, 1600 and 2000 gradients (P > 0.05).Conclusions:The ADC values obtained at intermediate (400, 800) and high (b 1600, 2000) diffusion gradients are not helpful in differentiation between HCCs and liver metastases.
