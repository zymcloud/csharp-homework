Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common tumors worldwide and liver transplantation (LT) is considered as the best therapeutic option for patients with HCC combined with cirrhosis. However, tumor recurrence after LT for HCC remains the major obstacle for long-term survival. The present study was to evaluate the efficacy and necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HCC who had undergone LT.Data sources:Several databases were searched to identify comparative studies fulfilling the predefined selection criteria before October 2014. Suitable studies were chosen and data extracted for meta-analysis. Three authors independently evaluated the bias of each study according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Intervention. Stata 12 was used for statistical analysis. Hazard ratio (HR) was considered as a summary statistic for overall survival, disease-free survival and recurrence rate.Results:Three prospective studies and 5 retrospective studies including 360 patients (166 in the adjuvant chemotherapy group, and 194 in the control group) were included. Compared with the control group, post-LT adjuvant chemotherapy conferred significant benefit for overall survival (HR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.22-0.52; P=0.000). Meanwhile, the results showed an improvement for disease-free survival on favoring adjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78-0.95; P=0.004). However, no significant difference in HCC recurrence rate was observed between the two groups (HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.40-4.00; P=0.696). Descriptions of adverse events were of anecdotal nature and did not allow meta-analytic calculations.Conclusions:Adjuvant chemotherapy after LT for HCC can significantly prolong patient's survival and delay the recurrence of HCC. For advanced HCC with poor differentiation, patients may perhaps benefit from the early implantation of adjuvant chemotherapy after LT.
