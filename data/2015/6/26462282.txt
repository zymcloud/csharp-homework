Aim:To study predictive factors for hepatic decompensation after transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between November 2009 and August 2010, of 254 patients with HCC who presented to our multidisciplinary HCC clinic for evaluation, 102 (40%) were amenable for TACE. In this prospective study, there were 102 patients with compensated cirrhosis with HCC and Child-Pugh Class A cirrhosis who underwent TACE at the National Liver Institute, Menoufiya University, Egypt. We excluded all patients with prior locoregional therapy, systemic therapy and/or surgical intervention. At baseline and at 1 month postprocedure, laboratory criteria, tumour criteria (size, number) and Child-Pugh score were recorded. Patients were classified into group 1 (no Child-Pugh point increase after TACE) and group 2 (one or more added Child-Pugh points after TACE, defining hepatic decompensation). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of hepatic decompensation.Results:Patients were mostly males (82.4%) of mean age 58.4±8.1 years. The only significant changes in laboratory findings at 1 month after TACE were increased international normalised ratio, serum total bilirubin, alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase and decreased serum albumin and α-fetoprotein (AFP). The statistically significant predictive factors for hepatic decompensation using univariate analysis were found to be baseline lower serum albumin, higher serum α-fetoprotein, more advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, larger tumour size and a greater number of tumour nodules; with logistic regression, multivariate analysis found that at baseline larger tumour size (p=0.004 at 95% CI), higher serum AFP (p=0.046 at 95% CI) and lower serum albumin (p=0.033 at 95% CI) predicted decompensation; BCLC stage, number of tumour nodules and pre-TACE bilirubin did not predict changes in liver function.Conclusions:Lower serum albumin and increased tumour burden (larger tumour size/more nodules and higher α-fetoprotein) at baseline may help predict post-TACE decompensation.
