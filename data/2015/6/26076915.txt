Laparoscopic resection of liver tumors located in the posterosuperior segments is a challenging operation that could be facilitated by robotic assistance. Laparoscopic resection of 12 tumors located in posterosuperior segments (IVa: 1; VII: 5; VIII: 6) was carried out under robotic assistance. All patients had a single tumor nodule. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. Surgery required a mean of 260.4 min (115-430) and was completed laparoscopically in all but one patient, who required conversion to mini-laparotomy because of intolerance of pneumoperitoneum (8.3%). Mean estimated blood loss was 252.7 ml (50-600), making transfusion necessary in 3 patients (25.0%). Post-operative complications occurred in 4 patients (33.3%), being of Clavien-Dindo grade II in 3 patients (25.0%) and Clavien-Dindo grade IV in 1 patient (8.3%). Reoperation was required in 1 patient, who subsequently had a long hospital stay, because of decompensated cirrhosis. Median length of hospital stay was 8.5 days (7-96). No patient was readmitted. Pathology showed hepatocellular carcinoma in 7 patients (58.3%), liver metastasis in 2 patients (16.6%), and hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hemangioma in one patient each (8.3%). All patients had a margin negative resection. After a mean follow-up period of 21.4 months (Â±24.4), no patient with malignant histology developed recurrence. Our initial experience confirms that laparoscopic robot-assisted resection of tumors located in the posterosuperior segments is feasible. Further experience is needed before final conclusions can be drawn and meaningful comparison with other surgical techniques becomes possible.
