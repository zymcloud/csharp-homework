Objective:To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of percutaneous cryoablation for the treatment of liver metastases from ovarian cancer.Methods/materials:A retrospective review was performed on 13 patients with liver metastases from ovarian cancer who underwent percutaneous cryoablation with computed tomography (CT) guidance. The tumor response was assessed by enhanced computed tomography performed before treatment, 1 month after, and every 3 months after treatment. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General quality of life (QOL) was used to assess the patients' QOL before, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after cryoablation.Results:A total of 27 procedures of cryoablation were performed on these patients, and 5 patients underwent repeat procedures. Complete ablation was achieved for all lesions. Months are counted from the time of cryoablation, and the median duration of follow-up was 15 months (4-22 months). At the 1-month follow-up, the primary technique effectiveness was 100%. At the 3-month follow-up, local tumor progression was observed in 2 (7.14%) of 28 lesions. The 1-year survival from the time of cryoablation was 92.3%. Two patients died after 9 and 14 months, respectively. The QOL symptoms and functioning scales were preserved in patients alive at 3 months after cryoablation. No major complications such as cryoshock, hepatic bleeding, liver abscess, biliary fistula, and renal insufficiency were encountered.Conclusions:Our initial experience showed that cryoablation is a safe and effective ablative therapy, providing a high rate of local tumor control in ovarian cancer liver metastases.
