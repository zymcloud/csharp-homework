We previously reported our data on telaprevir or simeprevir used in combination with pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) for the treatment of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection after liver transplantation (LT). Here, we report three patients who achieved viral responses with no effect on the blood concentrations of immunosuppressive agents following daclatasvir and asunaprevir treatment. The first patient was a 57-year-old man with HCV-related liver cirrhosis who failed to respond to PEG IFN/RBV after living donor LT. He had been treated with 1 mg/day of tacrolimus. The second was a 63-year-old man with HCV-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who failed to respond to PEG IFN/RBV after living donor LT. He had been treated with 1 mg/day of tacrolimus. The third was a 61-year-old man with HCV-related liver cirrhosis. He had been treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Serum HCV RNA became undetectable by TaqMan polymerase chain reaction test after 4 weeks of daclatasvir and asunaprevir treatment in all patients, and no remarkable fluctuations in blood concentration were observed either in tacrolimus or in MMF during 24 weeks of therapy. No adverse events were observed, and all patients received the full dose of daclatasvir and asunaprevir over 24 weeks. Serum HCV RNA remained negative at 12 weeks after the end of treatment in all patients. The daclatasvir and asunaprevir treatment showed a remarkable viral response with little effect on blood levels of immunosuppressive agents for recurrent HCV genotype 1 infection after LT.
