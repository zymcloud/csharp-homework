Aim:To explore whether the aberrant DNA methylation status in plasma could be used as a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening among high-risk individuals.Methods:The promoter methylation status of ELF, RASSF1A, p16, and GSTP1 was investigated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 34 paired HCC and nontumor liver tissue from HCC patients and 10 tissues from patients with liver cirrhosis (LC). Plasma samples from 31 HCC patients, 10 LC patients as well as 7 patients with benign hepatic conditions were also collected and characterized using the same method.Results:Among liver specimens, HCC tissues displayed a significantly higher methylation frequency of each gene compared with nontumor tissue (pConclusions:These results suggested that the methylation of tumor suppressor genes may participate in the development and progression of HCC. Additionally, it may be useful to combine the plasma DNA methylation status of a panel of gene markers and the serum AFP for HCC screening.
