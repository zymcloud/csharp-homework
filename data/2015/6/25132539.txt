Aim:Balloon-occluded transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (B-TACE) using a microballoon catheter was performed to administrate miriplatin, and the early therapeutic efficacy and safety of the procedure were evaluated.Methods:Out of 158 patients who received miriplatin using B-TACE for hepatocellular carcinoma, 49 patients with a single lesion at either stage I or II (according to the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan) were evaluated in comparison with 48 matched patients who received miriplatin using conventional TACE (C-TACE).Results:The mean total dose and median dose of miriplatin in each group were 32.5 ± 31.7 mg and 20 mg (C-TACE) and 50.1 ± 31.3 mg and 40 mg (B-TACE), respectively (P Conclusion:Compared with C-TACE, B-TACE significantly improved cancer nodule control, and it was satisfactory in terms of safety. B-TACE is an effective procedure that enhances the effects of catheterization with miriplatin.
