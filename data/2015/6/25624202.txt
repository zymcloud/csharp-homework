Aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus are commonly found in olive and its derivatives. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a predominant toxin detected abundantly and has been implicated in the etiology of human hepatocellular carcinoma. This study proposes a sensitive and convenient electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method for determining AFB1 by MWCNTs/RTIL composite films-based immunosensor. The calibration curve for AFB1 was linear in the range of 0.1-10ngmL(-1) with the limit of detection (LOD) 0.03ngmL(-1). The presence of MWCNTs warrant fast electron transfer, and the ionic liquid provides a benign microenvironment for antibody. The experimental parameters, such as pH and incubating time, have been investigated and optimized. Furthermore, the detection of AFB1 is presented to test this method after extracted from olive oils. It can be anticipated that this method would be used for the detection of AFB1 in various agriculture products and vegetable oils.
