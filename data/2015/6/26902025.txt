Background/aims:We aimed to investigate the efficacy of second line treatment with modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) following cisplatin- plus 5-fluorourasil (CF) chemotherapy in patients with metastatic esophagus cancer (mEC).Methodology:In our oncology clinic, between March 2011 and September 2014, we reviewed patients admitted with progressive mEC following first line CF chemotherapy and those with >60 kanofsky performance status performed second line mFOLFOX6 regimen.Results:A total of 242 patients with mEC were evaluated. 94 of 242 patients (38.8%) had received second-line chemotherapy treatment. All of these patients had received mFOLFOX6 regime. Median age was 53 years (range: 28-71). The received median number of chemotherapy cycles was 6 (2-12). Objective response rate (ORR) was obtained in 39 of 94 (41.4%) patients, 6 (6.3%) of these had complete response (CR) and 33 (35.1%) had partial response (PR). Stable disease (SD) was obtained in 20 (21.3%) patients and progression was observed in 35 (37.3%) patients. Grade Â¾ toxicity was observed in 67 (71.2%) patients. The hematologic toxicity was found as the most common toxicity (69.1%).Conclusions:mFOLFOX6 regimen as a second line treatment can be applied to the mEC patients with progressive disease following CF chemotherapy.
