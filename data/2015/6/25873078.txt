Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common liver disease worldwide affecting over one-third of the population in the U.S. It has been associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance and is initiated by the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes. Isolated hepatic steatosis (IHS) remains a benign process, while a subset develops superimposed inflammatory activity and progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with or without fibrosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD progression are not completely understood. Liver biopsy is still required to differentiate IHS from NASH as easily accessible noninvasive biomarkers are lacking. In terms of treatments for NASH, pioglitazone, vitamin E, and obeticholic acid have shown some benefit. All of these agents have potential complications associated with long-term use. Nowadays, a complex hypothesis suggests that multiple parallel hits are involved in NASH development. However, the 'key switch' between IHS and NASH remains to be discovered. We have recently shown that knocking out enzymes involved in S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) metabolism, the main biological methyl donor in humans that is abundant in the liver, will lead to NASH development in mice. This could be due to the fact that a normal SAMe level is required to establish the proper ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine that has been found to be important in NAFLD progression. New data from humans have also suggested that these enzymes play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and that some of SAMe cycle metabolites may serve as noninvasive biomarkers of NASH. In this review, we discuss the evidence of the role of SAMe in animal models and humans with NAFLD and how studying this area may lead to the discovery of new noninvasive biomarkers and possibly personalized treatment for NASH.
