C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant synthesized by hepatocytes that is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, particulary interleukin-6 (IL-6). Over the last decade, CRP has been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with various types of cancer. Although the mechanisms by which the systemic inflammatory response reflected by an elevated serum CRP level influences survival in patients with cancer have not been fully elucidated, several possibilities involving the activation of IL-6, thereby elevating the CRP level, in cancer patients have been proposed. With regard to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), since Hashimoto et al. first demonstrated that the preoperative serum CRP level is an independent and significant factor predictive of a poor prognosis in patients undergoing surgical resection, several investigators have identified an elevated serum CRP level to be an indicator of poor outcomes in HCC patients undergoing transplantation, transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection and best supportive care. Recently, the CRP level has been reported to be clinically applicable as a marker of treatment outcomes in HCC patients. However, large-scale, prospective validation studies are needed to confirm these results.
