Aim:To study the expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The lncRNA profiles between HBV-related HCC tissues and corresponding normal liver tissues were generated using microarray analysis. Datasets were analyzed using multiple algorithms to depict alterations in gene expression on the basis of gene ontology (GO), pathway analysis, and lncRNA levels.Results:The microarray revealed that 1772 lncRNAs and 2508 mRNAs were differently expressed. The pathway analysis demonstrated that the cell cycle, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B signaling pathway may play important roles in HCC. Several GO terms, such as cell cycle, DNA replication, immune response, and signal transduction, were enriched in gene lists, suggesting a potential correlation with HBV-related HCC. The upregulated large intergenic noncoding RNA ULK4P2 was physically combined with enhancer of zeste homolog 2. Therefore, the lncRNAs may participate in regulating HBV-related HCC.Conclusion:lncRNAs play important roles in HCC, future studies should verify whether large intergenic noncoding ULK4P2 functions by combining with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 in HCC.
