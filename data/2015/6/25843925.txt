Background:Several medical conditions that mimic ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have been reported previously, but acute abdominal disease mimicking STEMI is rare.Case report:We report on a 72-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) with epigastric pain. Meanwhile, STEMI with shock developed. Anticoagulation medication and emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were arranged in a timely manner. However, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rupture was the true cause of the ST-segment elevation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case report highlights the fact that acute myocardial infarction is not the only cause of ST-segment elevation. HCC rupture should be one of the differential diagnoses.
ST-segment elevation; hepatocellular carcinoma rupture; myocardial infarction.
