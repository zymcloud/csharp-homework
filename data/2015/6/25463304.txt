AKR1B10 is a human member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, and is considered to be a tumor biomarker because its expression is known to be significantly induced in the cells of various cancers such as lung non-small-cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of its gene remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), down-regulated the expression of the AKR1B10 gene in the human lung cancer cell line, A549. The treatment of A549 cells with TPA for 24h significantly reduced the mRNA levels, protein levels, and promoter activity of AKR1B10 as well as the growth of A549 cells. TPA induced the phosphorylation of the MAP kinase, ERK, and U0126, an inhibitor of the MAP kinase kinase, MEK1, blocked the down-regulation of AKR1B10 by TPA, indicating that the MAP kinase ERK plays a role in regulating the expression of AKR1B10. TPA also induced c-jun gene expression in an ERK-dependent manner. The co-introduction of the c-Jun protein resulted in a decrease in the mRNA levels and promoter activity of AKR1B10 as well as A549 cell proliferation. These results suggested that the ERK/c-Jun signaling pathway may play an important role in the TPA-triggered down-regulation of AKR1B10 gene expression.
