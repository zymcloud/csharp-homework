Hepatitis B virus (HBV) currently infects an estimated population of 2 billion individuals in the world, including 400 million people with chronic HBV infection. HBV virology, replication and the host's immune response to HBV infection contribute to different infection outcomes. Acute hepatitis HBV infection is self-limiting but it leaves a residual infection that can become active in an individual during immunosuppression. In chronic HBV infection, the virus persistently replicates in hepatocytes leading to immune mediated hepatocellular damage. Despite the inability to remove the virus in more than 70 % of patients, current treatments for chronic HBV infection, interferon alpha and antiviral nucleotide/nucleoside analogues, aim to reduce viral replication to prevent or at least delay the progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In both self resolved acute and persistent HBV infection, the long term existence of chromatinised covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes cannot be targeted by current treatments to eliminate these templates to eradicate the viral persistence. Identifying the mechanisms involve in the removal of infected hepatocytes will be useful as treatment options. In this context, DNA based novel therapeutic and immunization strategies might help to remove stable cccDNA and thus viral persistence.
