Background & aims:Mortality related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not well known in developed countries. The aim of this study was to investigate in a population-based cohort the excess risk of death in HBV patients compared with mortality in the general population and to identify risk factors related to all-cause mortality and HBV-related mortality.Methods:A specialized population-based registry has recorded data from patients with chronic HBV infection in a population of one million inhabitants in France since 1994. Standardized mortality rates for all-cause death and HBV-related death were calculated. Cumulative mortality rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox model.Results:Between 1994 and 2009, 1117 people were diagnosed with chronic HBV infection. Of these 136 (12.2%) died. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in HBV-infected people (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) 1.7 [1.4-2.0]). There was substantial excess mortality due to hepatocellular carcinoma (SMR 15.9 [10-24.1]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR 8.6 [3.1-18.6]) and liver disease (SMR 10.2 [5.8-16.6]). The cumulative rates for all-cause mortality were 8.6% at 5 years, 12.6% at 10 years and 18.5% at 15 years. The corresponding values for HBV-related mortality were 3.5%, 4.2%, and 5.8%. The multivariate analysis for all-cause mortality and for HBV-related mortality showed that male sex, age over 45 at diagnosis, current alcoholism and nosocomial risk factors were predictors of increased mortality.Conclusion:This study shows increased all-cause mortality in HBsAg-positive patients, with considerable excess mortality due to chronic liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
