Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous disease displaying differences in angiogenesis, extracellular matrix proteins, the immune microenvironment and tumor cell populations. Additionally, genetic variations and epigenetic changes of HCC cells could lead to aberrant signaling pathways, induce cancer stem cells and enhance tumor progression. Thus, the heterogeneity in HCC contributes to disease progression and a better understanding of its heterogeneity will greatly aid in the development of strategies for the HCC treatment.
