Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Egypt has markedly increased in the recent years, mainly due to the high incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Consequently, the frequency of metastatic HCC has also increased. The current study presents a series of 47 patients who were initially diagnosed as metastatic HCC.Methods:Forty seven patients with the diagnosis of extrahepatic metastases of HCC at initial presentation were included in the study. The sites of metastases were bones (17), lymph nodes (9), soft tissue (7), omentum (7), maxillary sinus (2), adrenal gland (2), brain (2) and skin (1). The diagnosis of metastatic HCC was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.Results:The patients included in the study were 38 males and 9 females, ranging from 40 to 80 years (median 60 years). All patients were HCV-positive and 36 were cirrhotic. The diagnosis of primary HCC was confirmed in all cases, based on the typical hypervascular radiological features and/or high serum Î±-fetoprotein concentration, or histologic examination of liver biopsy.Conclusion:Metastasis of HCC should be put into consideration when evaluating metastatic carcinoma with unknown primary. This is of particular importance in the Egyptian population who has the highest prevalence of HCV infection in the world.
