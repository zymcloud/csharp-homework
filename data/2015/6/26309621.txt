Background:To further investigate the relationship between ADH2 Arg47His variation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility through a meta-analysis.Methods:The related articles were searched in PubMed, Embase and CNKI databases. And finally 518 cases and 607 controls were included in our meta-analysis Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the relationship between ADH2 Arg47His variation and HCC risk. A fixed-effect model or a random-effect model was applied according to the between-study heterogeneity.Results:Quantitative synthesis demonstrated that no significant association was found between ADH2 Arg47His variation and HCC susceptibility (His/His vs. Arg/Arg: OR=0.99, 95% CI=0.79-1.25; His/His + Arg/His vs. Arg/Arg: OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.86-1.20; His/His vs. Arg/Arg + Arg/His: OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.74-1.11; His vs. Arg: OR=0.98, 95% CI=0.86-1.11; Arg/His vs. Arg/Arg: OR=1.05, 95% CI=0.82-1.34).Conclusion:Our analysis showed that ADH2 Arg47His vvariation may not be associated with HCC susceptibility.
