Background:In Japan, the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with nonviral liver disease, especially with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD-HCC) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD-HCC), has been increasing. Clarification of the clinical features of NAFLD-HCC and ALD-HCC is needed. We performed a large retrospective multicenter survey to clarify the clinical course of these two types of HCC.Methods:Clinical characteristics, survival, and recurrence were examined in 532 patients with ALD-HCC and 209 patients with NAFLD-HCC who were diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2013.Results:The ALD-HCC patients were predominantly male and were younger than the patients with NAFLD-HCC. Lifestyle-related diseases were significantly more common in the NAFLD-HCC group, but the prevalence of cirrhosis was significantly higher in the ALD-HCC group. The histological diagnosis of NAFLD-HCC showed a gender difference (F4; 72.7 % in the females vs. 37.6 % in the males). The characteristic features of HCC including histology, survival rate, and recurrence rate were quite similar in the NAFLD-HCC and ALD-HCC groups: 5-year survival rates 49.1 vs. 43.7 %; 5-year recurrence rates 69.6 vs. 65.4 %, respectively. However, the risk factors for recurrence differed between the two groups: des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin was a risk factor in NAFLD-HCC and Î±-fetoprotein was a risk factor in ALD-HCC.Conclusions:Although the characteristic features underlying these two diseases are different, the two HCC groups showed a similar clinical course. The recurrence rates of the two HCC groups were relatively high. We found that critical tumor markers for recurrence differed between the two diseases.
