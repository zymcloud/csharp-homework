Background and aim:Several papers have shown that preoperative inflammation-based prognostic scores and/or immunonutritional status are associated with survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the validity of prognostic factors of these scores remains controversial. This study aimed to validate the power of prognostic scores based on the preoperative inflammatory and immunonutritional indices of patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC with curative intent.Methods:Clinicopathological parameters and inflammation-based prognostic scores and immunonutritional status, including the Glasgow Prognostic Score, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), were retrospectively analyzed to identify the predictors of overall and recurrence-free survival in 256 patients.Results:In multivariate analysis, NLR was an independent prognostic factor for overall, and recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56-4.31, P Conclusions:The present study shows that the NLR and PNI based on preoperative inflammatory and immunonutritional indices are predictors of overall survival in patients who undergo hepatectomy for HCC with curative intent.
