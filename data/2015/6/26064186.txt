Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the commonest cancers in the world. Metastasis is one of the most significant factors affecting prognosis. Common sites of extrahepatic metastases include lungs, regional lymph nodes and less commonly bone.Case presentation:A 56-year-old male presented with a painless occipital scalp lump of three months duration, with recent rapid enlargement. His skull x-ray showed a lytic lesion over occipital bone and the contrast CT scan of the brain showed a scalp mass with destruction of the adjacent skull. Core biopsy of the lesion revealed a metastatic deposit from a hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:Primary presentation with skeletal metastases are rare in HCC with only a few reported cases. Here we report a case of HCC presenting as a solitary scalp lump.
Hepatocellular carcinoma; Skull metastasis.
