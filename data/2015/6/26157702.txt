Hepatocellular adenomas are a benign, focal, hepatic neoplasm that have been divided into four subtypes according to the genetic and pathological features. The β-catenin activated subtype accounts for 10-15% of all hepatocellular adenomas and specific magnetic resonance imaging features have been defined for different hepatocellular adenomas subtypes. The current study aimed to report the magnetic resonance imaging features of a well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma that developed on the basis of β-catenin activated hepatocellular adenomas in a child. In this case, atypical diffuse steatosis was determined in the lesion. In the literature, diffuse steatosis, which is defined as a feature of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α-inactivated hepatocellular adenomas subtype, has not been previously reported in any β-catenin activated hepatocellular adenomas case. Interlacing magnetic resonance imaging findings between subtypes show that there are still many mysteries about this topic and larger studies are warranted.
