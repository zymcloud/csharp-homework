Background:Hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex process that is influenced by many factors. Several studies have investigated the relationship between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, but the results are inconsistent. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis covering a large sample size to address this controversy.Methods:Eligible studies were searched using PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. A total of 7 studies from 6 publications with 2035 cases and 3096 controls were included. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated by the fixed or random effects to evaluate the correlation between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and HCC risk. The Q statistic and I(2) statistic were used to assess the statistical heterogeneity among studies. Publication bias was evaluated by Egger's linear regression test and Begg's funnel plot.Results:In present study, the results showed that MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was not significantly associated with risk of HCC based on CC + AC vs. AA genetic model (OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.90-1.13). Similarly, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no significant HCC risk was found in Asian population (OR=1.02, 95% CI=0.91-1.14). In the subgroup analysis based on source of control, we found that MTHFR A1298C polymorphism showed no effects on the occurrence of HCC in the population-based (PB) and hospital-based (HB) group (OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.83-1.15; OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.89-1.21).Conclusion:This meta-analysis suggested that MTHFR A1298C polymorphism may not be a risk factor for HCC.
