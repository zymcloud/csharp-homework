Kindlin-1 is a member of the Kindlin family of focal adhesion proteins and is implicated in cell adhesion, proliferation, polarity, and motility. Although expression of Kindlin-1 has recently been reported in a variety of human cancers, studies on its expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are currently lacking. This study aimed to determine the clinicopathological parameters and prognostic value of Kindlin-1 in HCC patients after surgical resection. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of Kindlin-1 in 22 matched HCC specimens were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting assays. The clinical and prognostic significance of Kindlin-1 in 68 cases of HCC was determined by immunohistochemistry. Kindlin-1 expression was higher in HCC tumor tissues relative to that in adjacent normal tissue at the both mRNA and protein levels (p
