Objective:To determine the patterns of peritoneal involvement in patients with abdominopelvic malignancies.Study design:Retrospective observational study.Place and duration of study:Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan, from May 2004 to May 2012.Methodology:Two hundred and three patients with histopathologically proven abdominopelvic malignancies with peritoneal involvement who underwent contrast-enhanced CT abdomen and pelvis were identified through electronic data base system and were included in this study after ethical committee approval. Peritoneal disease pattern, predominant sites of involvement and associated findings of ascites, lymph nodes and metastasis were assessed. Patients with tuberculosis and lymphoproliferative disorders were excluded.Results:The malignancies showing peritoneal involvement, in decreasing order of frequency, were ovarian cancer (n=118), colorectal cancer (n=45), pancreatic cancer (n=11), gastric cancer (n=7), endometrial cancer (n=6), gallbladder/ cholangio-carcinoma and hepatocellular cancer (n=5 each), cervical cancer (n=3), renal cell carcinoma (n=2) and transitional cell urinary bladder cancer (n=1). The most common pattern of peritoneal involvement was mixed in 79 patients (39%), omental caking in 74 patients (37%) and nodular deposits in 50 patients (24%). The most common sites of peritoneal involvement were pelvic peritoneum followed by greater omentum.Conclusion:Peritoneal involvement is the commonest with ovarian and colorectal carcinoma. Mixed pattern of peritoneal disease was most frequently seen in these patients followed by omental caking and nodular peritoneal deposits.
