Purpose:This study employed 3'-deoxy-3'-[(18)F]-fluorothymidine ([(18)F]FLT) microPET scanning to assess the treatment response of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), e.g., N1-hydroxy-N8-phenyloctanediamide (SAHA) and its iodinated derivative ISAHA, in a hepatoma mouse model.Procedures:The in vitro cytotoxicity of HDACi in various hepatoma cell lines was determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry. ISAHA and SAHA were used to treat HepG2 hepatoma xenograft-bearing mice. The treatment responses were characterized in terms of tumor burden, microPET imaging, and immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections.Results:ISAHA effectively inhibited HepG2 hepatoma cell survival and tumor growth. A significantly reduced tumor uptake during HDACi treatment was noticed in [(18)F]FLT microPET imaging, which was consistent with the findings in immunohistochemical staining.Conclusions:ISAHA can suppress tumor cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. [(18)F]FLT PET is a promising modality for evaluating the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of HDACi at the early stage of treatment.
