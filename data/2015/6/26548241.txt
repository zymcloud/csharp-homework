Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health problem. HBV has been classified into eight genotypes (A to H) based on complete nucleotide sequencing. The prevalence of specific genotype varies geographically. The rationale for treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B is to reduce the risk of progressive chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment strategies for chronic HBV infection include interferon and nucleotide analogues (lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, and tenofovir disoproxil). HBV persists in the body even after serological recovery from acute hepatitis B. Thus, individuals who have been exposed to HBV are at risk of the reactivation of infection, which may result in an increase in serum aminotransferases or a flare when the immune response is suppressed. Patients requiring immunosuppressive therapy should undergo serologic testing for markers of HBV infection. This topic review summarizes these issues related to the management of hepatitis B.
