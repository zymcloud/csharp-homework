Purpose:Ultrasound is the most common imaging tool used to scan the tumours of hepatic carcinoma patients. However, very few studies have been performed to evaluate ultrasound imaging features for predicting tumour prognosis. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to evaluate preoperative ultrasound characteristics as prognostic factors that could affect survival rate after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A total of 104 HCC patients who underwent resection were retrospectively reviewed with regard to their clinical data, preoperative ultrasound characteristics, and survival rate. Preoperative ultrasound parameters included cirrhosis, tumour site, size, echo pattern, portal vein thrombosis, intra-tumour blood flow signal, peak systolic velocity (V max), and resistance index (RI). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival. Pre-resection prognostic factors were assessed using univariate log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.Results:The median survival was 37 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 78.85, 53.85, and 26.92 %, respectively, and the overall survival (OS) rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 85.58, 69.23, and 46.15 %, respectively. On univariate analysis, shorter survival was associated with mixed echo pattern, larger tumour size, portal vein thrombus, affluent flow signal, and higher V max. Application of the Cox multivariate proportional hazards model indicated that tumour size and blood flow signal in the tumours were independent prognostic factors.Conclusions:The overall survival for HCC patients undergoing hepatic resection can be stratified on a sonographic basis of tumour size and intra-nodular vasculature. These prognostic factors may be useful to determine appropriate treatment for HCC patients.
