Autologous formalin-fixed tumor vaccine (AFTV) suppressed re-recurrence for more than 32 months of multiple-recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma based on hepatitis C virus-induced liver cirrhosis in a case with previous recurrence interval, 51-, 28-, 12-, and 4-months. We detected glypican-3-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood at 12 months after AFTV.
