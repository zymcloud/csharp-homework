Establishing realistic exposure scenarios is critical for cytotoxic investigation of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in the gastrointestinal tract. This study investigated the potential interaction with and effect of biofluid components, namely cholic acid, deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, on AgNP toxicity. Two cell lines corresponding to organs related to the biofluid components were employed. These were HepG-2 a hepatocellular carcinoma derived from liver tissue and Hep2 an epithelial cell line. Physiochemical and cytotoxic screening was performed and the ability of biofluid components to modify AgNP cytotoxicity was explored. No alteration to the physiochemical characteristics of AgNP by biofluid components was demonstrated. However, biofluid component addition resulted in alteration of AgNP toxicity. Greater reactive oxygen species induction was noted in the presence of cholic acid and deoxycholic acid. Ursodeoxycholic acid demonstrated no modification of toxicity in HepG-2 cells; however, significant modification was noted in Hep2 cells. It is concluded that biofluid components can modify AgNP toxicity but this is dependent on the biofluid component itself and the location where it acts.
