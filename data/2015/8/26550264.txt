This study is to investigate the effects of decorin (DCN) on human hepatoma HepG2 cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) condition. HepG2 cells were cultured under OGD condition. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the cell survival, and flow cytometry was performed to detect the apoptosis. Protein expression levels were detected with Western blot analysis. Transfection was performed with liposome, and cells were screened with G418. The cell survival rates were significantly decreased in the OGD groups. When treated with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, the survival rates were further declined in these cells. Moreover, flow cytometry indicated that apoptosis occurred in the HepG2 cells under OGD condition, and the apoptosis rates were significantly increased by the 3-MA treatment. Western blot analysis showed that, the expression levels of DCN were significantly elevated in OGD-preconditioned HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, the expression level of Beclin1 and the LC3BI/LC3BII ratio were significantly increased, while the expression level of P62 was significantly decreased, in HepG2 cells under OGD condition. Over-expression of DCN significantly increased the expression level of Beclin1 and the LC3BI/LC3BII ratio, while no significant changes were observed in the P62 expression level, in HepG2 cells. Under the OGD condition, the apoptosis rate was also significantly decreased in DCN-transfected HepG2 cells. DCN protects HepG2 cells against OGD-induced injury, via regulating autophagy. These results might contribute to a better understanding of the roles of DCN and autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma, and the potential treatment for the disease.
