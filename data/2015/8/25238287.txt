The 'omics revolution is facilitating a personalized approach to improving outcome by refining diagnosis, staging, treatment, and monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, the promise of being able to target a range of specific tumor drivers at a molecular level offers exciting new therapy prospects for a disease that is notoriously difficult to treat. We provide a unique perspective combining our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma development with the potential of circulating tumor cells and radiogenomics to change the drivers of decision-making used in current practice.
