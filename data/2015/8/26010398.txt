Cecropin-P17 is a peptide derived from Cecropin B. In this study, we investigated the effects and relative mechanisms of Cecropin-P17 in a human liver cancer cell line (HepG-2) in vitro and in vivo. A cell viability assay, Annexin V/propidium iodide assay, western blot, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and a tumor-xenograft model were applied to elucidate the mechanism exerted by Cecropin-P17 on HepG-2 cells. Cecropin-P17 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG-2 cells and demonstrated low cytotoxicity to normal liver cells in vitro. The apoptotic rate of HepG-2 cells was increased after Cecropin-P17 treatment together with increased production of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, Cecropin-P17 stimulated caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax and inhibited Bcl-2 on both the transcriptional and translational levels. Finally, Cecropin-P17 significantly suppressed tumor growth in a HepG-2-bearing nude mouse model. All of these results indicated that Cecropin-P17 could be a potential agent for the treatment of liver cancer.
