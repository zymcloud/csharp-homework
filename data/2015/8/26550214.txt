Objective:To study the expression and molecular mechanism of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) including HEIH and HULC in proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells.Methods:We detected the expression of HEIH and HULC in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (MHCC97L and HepG2), as well as in human normal hepatocyte line (cHL-7702) by real-time PCR. Using MTT and transwell, we investigated the effect of HEIH and HULC on proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells with siRNA and expression plasmid. To explore the molecular mechanism, we use western blot to reveal the role of HEIH and HULC in tumor invasion related gene expression.Results:The expression of HEIH and HULC in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line was significantly increased compared with human normal hepatocyte line (PConclusions:The expression of HEIH and HULC increased significantly in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line compared with that in human normal hepatocyte line. HULC could promote proliferation of hepatoma cells. HEIH and HULC play an important role in the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cell.
