Background:The TGF-β signaling pathway is crucial in the progression and metastasis of malignancies. We investigated whether the serum TGF-β1 level was related to the outcomes of patients treated with sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Experimental design:We selected patients who had received sorafenib-containing regimens as first-line therapy for advanced HCC between 2007 and 2012. Serum TGF-β1 levels were measured and correlated with the treatment outcomes. The expression TGF-β1 and the sensitivity to sorafenib were examined in HCC cell lines.Results:Ninety-one patients were included; 62 (68%) were hepatitis B virus surface antigen (+), and 11 (12%) were anti-hepatitis C virus (+). High (≥ median) pretreatment serum TGF-β1 levels (median 13.7 ng/mL; range, 3.0-41.8) were associated with high α-fetoprotein levels, but not with age, gender, or disease stage. Patients with high pretreatment serum TGF-β1 levels exhibited significantly shorter progression-free survival (median, 2.5 vs. 4.3 months; P = 0.022) and overall survival (median 5.6 vs. 11.6 months; P = 0.029) than did patients with low serum TGF-β1 levels. Compared with pretreatment levels, the serum TGF-β1 levels were significantly increased at disease progression (n = 29, P = 0.010). In preclinical models of HCC, higher TGF-β1 expression levels were associated with poorer sensitivity to sorafenib.Conclusions:High pretreatment serum TGF-β1 levels were associated with poor prognoses, and increased serum TGF-β1 levels were associated with the disease progression of advanced HCC patients. TGF-β pathway may be explored as a therapeutic target for advanced HCC.
