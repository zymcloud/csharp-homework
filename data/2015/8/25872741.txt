Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes a persistent infection that in many cases leads to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The non-structural 5A protein (NS5A) has been implicated in this process as it contains a C-terminal polyproline motif (termed P2) that binds to Src homology 3 (SH3) domains to regulate cellular signalling and trafficking pathways. We have shown previously that NS5A impaired epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) endocytosis, thereby inhibiting EGF-stimulated EGFR degradation by a mechanism that remained unclear. As EGFR has been implicated in HCV cell entry and trafficking of the receptor involves several SH3-domain containing proteins, we investigated in more detail the mechanisms by which NS5A perturbs EGFR trafficking. We demonstrated that the P2 motif was required for the NS5A-mediated disruption to EGFR trafficking. We further demonstrated that the P2 motif was required for an interaction between NS5A and CMS, a homologue of CIN85 that has previously been implicated in EGFR endocytosis. We provided evidence that CMS was involved in the NS5A-mediated perturbation of EGFR trafficking. We also showed that NS5A effected a loss of EGFR ubiquitination in a P2-motif-dependent fashion. These data provide clues to the mechanism by which NS5A regulates the trafficking of a key cellular receptor and demonstrate for the first time the ability of NS5A to regulate host cell ubiquitination pathways.
