The aim of the study is to evaluate the practicability and therapeutic efficacy of (125)iodine seeds implantation percutaneously for portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nineteen patients with HCC accompanied with PVTT received ultrasound-guided implantation of 8-30 (125)iodine seeds, 8 mm apart within the portal vein tumor thrombi. The patients were followed up postoperatively for a period of 3-22 months. The successful rates of the procedure, postoperative changes of liver and renal function, hemogram, complications and therapeutic response were monitored. (125)I seeds were successfully implanted in the portal veins in all patients without serious complications. During the follow-up period, the portal vein tumor thrombi all shrunk obviously. Percutaneous implantation of (125)iodine seeds into the portal vein is an effective and safe treatment for PVTT accompanying HCC.
