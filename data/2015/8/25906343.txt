Purpose:The purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and protocol optimization of whole-body hybrid MR-PET system performed 1-month after post-locoregional thermoablative procedures for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:Eight patients (6 men and 2 women; mean age, 56.6 Â± 5.5 years) with 9 ablated HCCs constituted our study population. Three readers interpreted the studies to determine the presence or absence of residual malignancy. Two readers independently assessed the fused MR-PET images to compare registration accuracy of two types of T2-weighted (triggered T2 half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo and turbo spin-echo) and T1-weighted [Cartesian and radial 3D gradient echo (GRE)]. Image quality evaluation of both 3D-GRE T1-weighted sequences was evaluated. Kappa statistics were used to measure inter-observer agreement. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for qualitative data analysis.Results:Definite residual tumor was observed in 3/9 ablations; two were PET positive. All residual tumors were isovascular on MRI. Radial 3D-GRE demonstrated significantly superior MR-PET subjective co-registration in comparison with the remaining sequences and showed a non-significant trend toward higher image quality scores than Cartesian GRE.Conclusion:Whole-body hybrid MR-PET is feasible as a part of 1-month follow-up post-locoregional thermoablative treatment for HCC. Radial 3D-GRE offers improved co-registration with PET data, with overall good image quality.
