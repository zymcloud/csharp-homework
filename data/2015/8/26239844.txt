Background:Transarterial-chemo-embolization (TACE) is used for palliation of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We studied the tolerability of TACE in a cohort of patients with NASH and alcoholic cirrhosis related HCC.Methods:Of 290 patients with HCC (July 2011 - December 2014), 84 underwent TACE. They were monitored for post-TACE complications: postembolization fever (PEF), nausea and vomiting (NV), abdominal pain, infection, acute hepatic decompensation (AHD) and acute kidney injury (AKI).Results:84 patients [90.5% males, 89.2% cirrhotics, 89.2% nodular HCC, median age 63 (34-84) years] underwent 111 TACE sessions. All were Child class A [69.4% sessions (n = 77)] or B; ascites and portal vein invasion was present in 18 (16.2%) and 15 (13.6%), respectively. 42 (38.2%) TACE procedures resulted in complications [PEF 28 (25.2%), NV 4 (3.6%), abdominal pain 9 (8.1%), infection 7 (6.3 %), AHD 13 (11.7%), AKI 3 (2.7 %)]. There were no immediate post-TACE deaths. On univariate analysis elevated serum bilirubin (p = 0.046) and low serum albumin (p = 0.035) predicted PEF while low serum albumin (p = 0.021) and low platelet counts (p = 0.041) predicted AHD. In the multivariate model, factors with p 5 cm (p = 0.049, OR = 2.410) and elevated serum bilirubin (p = 0.036, OR = 1.517) predicted AHD.Conclusion:In NASH and alcoholic cirrhosis related HCC patients pre-procedure serum bilirubin, ascites, tumour size and female gender predicted PEF post-TACE. Tumours larger 5 cm with elevated bilirubin predicted AHD post-TACE.
