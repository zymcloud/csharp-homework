Purpose:To construct prognostic nomograms capable of estimating individual probabilities of tumor progression and overall survival (OS) at specific time points during serial transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:The study included 1,181 consecutive patients with nonmetastatic HCC undergoing repeated transarterial chemoembolization at a single tertiary referral center. Patients were assigned to 2 cohorts according to the first transarterial chemoembolization date: derivation (2004-2006; n = 854) and validation (2007; n = 327) sets. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were developed based on covariates derived before transarterial chemoembolization and assessed for their association with 5-year OS and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS). The accuracy of the models was internally and externally validated.Results:The 5-year OS of the derivation set was 25.4%, and 3-year PFS was 20.8%. Nomograms for OS and PFS were built into the derivation set incorporating the following factors: log [tumor volume] calculated as 4/3 × 3.14 × (maximum radius of tumor in cm(3)); tumor number; tumor type (nodular or infiltrative); Child-Pugh class (A or B); (model for end-stage liver disease score/10)(-2); log [α-fetoprotein]; and portal vein invasion. The models had good discrimination and calibration abilities with C-indexes of 0.80 (5-y survival) and 0.77 (3-y progression). The results of external validation confirmed that these models performed well in terms of discrimination and goodness-of-fit (C-indexes 0.77 for 5-y survival and 0.73 for 3-y progression).Conclusion:Nomograms quantifying the survival and progression outcomes in patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization are useful clinical aids in providing personalized care.
