This study aimed to identify a single miRNA or miR (microRNA) which regulates the three insulin-like growth factor-2-mRNA-binding proteins (IGF2BP1, 2 and 3). Bioinformatics predicted miR-1275 to simultaneously target the three IGF2BPs, and screening revealed miR-1275 to be underexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Transfection of HuH-7 cells with miR-1275 suppressed IGF2BPs expression and all three IGF2BPs were confirmed as targets of miR-1275. Ectopic expression of miR-1275 and knockdown of IGF2BPs inhibited malignant cell behaviors, and also reduced IGF1R protein and mRNA. Finally IGF1R was validated as a direct target of miR-1275. These findings indicate that the tumor-suppressor miR-1275 can control HCC tumor growth partially through simultaneously regulating the oncogenic IGF2BPs and IGF1R.
