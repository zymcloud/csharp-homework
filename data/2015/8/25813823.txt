Background:It has been speculated that, when right-sided major hepatectomy (RSMH) is planned for patients with large tumors in the right liver, it may not lead to a marked decrease in normally functional hepatic mass.Methods:We collected data for patients who had undergone RSMH for tumors more than 8 cm in diameter (n=50) and compared them with control patients who had undergone RSMH for tumors less than 5 cm in diameter (n=21).Results:The ratio of the remnant left liver volume to the nontumorous liver volume (left liver ratio) in the patients with large tumors was significantly greater than that in the control group (50.0±12.8% vs. 40.2±8.3%, p=0.002). Left liver ratio was significantly correlated with tumor volume (pConclusions:Left liver volume in patients with large tumors in the right liver was larger than usual, perhaps reducing the risk of postoperative liver insufficiency after RSMH.
