Background and aims:The outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver cirrhosis was limitedly studied in a hepatitis B virus-endemic area. This multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted to elucidate the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mortality in the Korean patients with HCV-related cirrhosis.Methods:From January 2007 through June 2012, 196 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled and regularly followed at six university hospitals to determine HCC occurrence and mortality. A multivariable analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to clarify the related factors to the outcomes.Results:During a mean follow-up period of 39.2 months, 31 (15.8%) patients developed HCC, and 33 (16.8%) patients died or underwent liver transplantation. The estimated HCC incidence was 5.8 per 100 person-years, and the independent factors for HCC were absence of anti-HBV surface antibody (HBs hazard ratio [HR], 5.018; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.710-14.726; P = 0.003) and serum albumin Conclusion:The incidence of HCC in HCV-related cirrhosis seems to be high in Korea, and advanced liver disease and no achievement of SVR were associated with mortality. The absence of anti-HBs in hepatocarcinogenesis related to HCV warrants further study.
