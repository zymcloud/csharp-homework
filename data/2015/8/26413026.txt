Hepatic dysfunction after the Fontan surgical palliation runs an indolent course. Moreover, there is no standard method of evaluating hepatic dysfunction. Magnetic resonance elastography has emerged as an advanced screening tool for preclinical detection of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. We describe the case of a patient who had undergone Fontan palliation, and then developed liver nodules and elevated tumor markers 18 years later. Her case illustrates the challenges in diagnostic management of hepatic dysfunction and the potential role of magnetic resonance elastography in monitoring these patients.
Carcinoma, hepatocellular; Fontan procedure/adverse effects; cirrhosis; congenital heart disease; magnetic resonance imaging; pulmonary atresia.
