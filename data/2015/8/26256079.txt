Background:The carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a multi-factorial, multi-step and complex process. Early diagnosis and effective treatments are of utmost importance. This review summarized the recent studies of oncofetal glypican-3 (GPC-3), a membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.Data sources:English-language reports published from June 2001 to September 2014 were searched from MEDLINE. The key words searched included: GPC-3, biomarker, target and HCC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were extracted, and the effect of GPC-3 targeted therapy on HCC was also evaluated.Results:GPC-3 plays a crucial role in HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. It mediates oncogenesis involving signaling pathways during hepatocyte malignant transformation. GPC-3 expression is increased in atypical hyperplasia and cancerous tissues. GPC-3 levels in HCC patients are related to HBV infection, TNM stage, periportal cancerous embolus, and extrahepatic metastasis. The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of serum GPC-3 and alpha-fetoprotein in HCC is up to 94.3%. Down-regulation of GPC-3 with specific siRNA or anti-GPC-3 antibody alters cell migration, metastasis and invasion behaviors. The nude mice xenograft tumor growth is inhibited by silencing GPC-3 gene transcription.Conclusion:Oncofetal GPC-3 is a highly specific biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC and a promising target molecule for HCC gene therapy.
