Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate the dynamic enhancement pattern of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) of varying sizes and hepatic backgrounds.Materials and methods:CEUS was performed in 98 pathologically confirmed ICCs (n = 39 30 mm; n = 45 with cirrhosis and n = 53 with normal liver). The dynamic enhancement pattern of CEUS was retrospectively analyzed.Results:In the arterial phase, heterogeneous hyper-enhancement was more frequent in ICCs with cirrhosis (21/45, 46.7% vs. 11/53, 20.8% in ICCs with normal liver, p = 0.009), while peripheral hyper-enhancement and hypo-enhancement were more common in ICCs with normal liver (14/53, 26.4%; 11/53, 20.8% vs. 2/45, 4.4%; 2/45, 4.4% in ICCs with cirrhosis, p = 0.005 and 0.033, respectively). There were no significant differences between portal and delayed phases. In ICCs 30 mm, p 30 mm, heterogeneous, and peripheral hyper-enhancement were more commonly observed (26/59, 44.1% vs. 6/39, 15.4% in ICCs 30 mm with cirrhosis, together with 66.7% (14/21) ICCs 30 mm with normal liver (34.4%, 11/32, p Conclusion:The CEUS dynamic enhancement pattern of ICC varies with size and hepatic background. The enhancement pattern is indistinguishable from hepatocellular carcinoma on CEUS in most ICCs with cirrhosis and in most ICCs
