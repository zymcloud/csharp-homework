This study explored the effects of microRNA-3178 (miR-3178) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor endothelial cells (TECs) and on the target mRNA. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the differential expression of miR-3178 in hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs) and HCC TECs. Furthermore, HCC TECs were transfected with miR-3178 mimic/inhibitor or their respective negative controls. The expression of miR-3178 before and after transfection was confirmed through RT-PCR. The effects of miR-3178 on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis of HCC TECs were also investigated through methyl thiazol tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, matrigel invasion assay, transwell migration assay, and tube formation assay. Early growth responsive gene 3 (EGR3), as the putative target of miR-3178, was detected through RT-PCR and Western blot. Compared with HSECs, HCC TECs had lower miR-3178 expression levels (P
