Cyclin B2 (CCNB2), a member of cyclin family proteins, serves a key role in progression of G2/M transition. The clinical value of CCNB2 in non-small cell lung cancer is still unknown. The aim of our study is to identify the role of CCNB2 in NSCLC patients. The status of CCNB2 in NSCLC tissues and normal lung tissues was observed in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: GSE19804). CCNB2 mRNA and protein expressions were detected in NSCLC and normal lung tissues by using Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. The association of CCNB protein expression with clinical characteristics of 186 NSCLC patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Based on microarray data (GEO: GSE19804), we observed that CCNB2 was significantly overexpressed in NSCLC tissues compared with paired adjacent normal lung tissue. Furthermore, we verified mRNA and protein levels of CCNB2 expression were both increased in NSCLC tissues. We found high levels of CCNB2 protein were positively associated with the status of differentiated degree, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and clinical stage. Meanwhile, CCNB2 protein overexpression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for the overall survival of patients with NSCLC. In conclusion, overexpression of CCNB2 protein is associated with clinical progression and poor prognosis in NSCLC.
