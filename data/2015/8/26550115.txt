Current opinion varies in the roles of the IL-10 polymorphisms in the process of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We have performed a systemic review and up-dated meta-analysis including 37 eligible case-control studies to summarize all the available data on the association between IL-10 polymorphisms and development of HBV infection. In the present study, we found that the IL-10-1082 G/A, -592 C/A polymorphisms were associated with a significantly decreased risk of chronic HBV infection (AA + GA vs. GG: P = 0.003, OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37-0.82; AA vs. CA + CC: P = 0.03, OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.71-0.98). While the -819 C/T TT carriers were associated with a borderline significantly decreased risk of chronic HBV infection (TT vs. CT + CC: P = 0.05, OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68-1.00). Significant result was observed in the association between IL-10-1082 G/A polymorphism and HBV clearance (AA vs. GG: P = 0.04, OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.01-1.75). In addition, significant association was found between the -1082 G/A, -819 C/T polymorphisms and an increased risk of progression of HBV infection from asymptomatic carrier to chronic hepatitis B (AA + GA vs. GG: P = 0.0003, OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.41-3.22; TT + CT vs. CC: P = 0.005, OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.13-2.07), whereas the -592 C/A polymorphism was associated with a significantly decreased risk of progression from asymptomatic carrier to hepatocellular carcinoma (AA vs. CC: P = 0.02, OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.43-0.92). Our meta-analysis suggested that the IL-10 polymorphisms might be associated with a decreased risk of chronic HBV infection, while the -1082 AA carriers might be more likely to clear HBV following acute infection. In addition, these three polymorphisms might cast in roles of the progression of HBV infection.
