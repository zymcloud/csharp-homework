Background:Although some recent reports have shown that the expression level of miR-193a varied in different cancers, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unidentified. The aim of the current study was to validate the relationship between miR-193a-3p and clinicopathological characteristics in HCC patients.Material and methods:Expression of miR-193a-3p in 95 HCC cases and their corresponding peritumoral tissues (PT) was examined by using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). miR-193a-3p expression and its correlation with a variety of clinicopathological features and patient recurrence were analyzed.Results:The relative level of miR-193a-3p was 3.2028±1.1951 in PT, significantly higher than its expression in HCC tissues (1.5941±0.7079, PConclusions:MiR-193a-3p may be a tumor-suppressive miRNA which is down-regulated in HCC tissues. It could be regarded as a predictor for the deterioration of HCC patients.
