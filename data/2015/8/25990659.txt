Background:Liver metastases are associated with a poor prognosis. We investigated the use of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of irinotecan combination therapy in patients with liver metastases.Patients and methods:Patients with histologically confirmed advanced cancer with liver metastases that was refractory to standard therapy were eligible. A standard "3 + 3" phase I study design was used to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Three cohorts were evaluated: HAI of irinotecan with systemic intravenous (IV) (a) bevacizumab, (b) oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, or (c) bevacizumab and cetuximab.Results:From October 2009 through December 2013, 98 patients with various tumor types were enrolled (median age, 62 years, range, 34-85; and median number of prior therapies, 4, range, 1-11). In cohorts A and C, dose escalation continued until the highest dose level-considered the MTD-was reached. In cohort B, dose escalation continued until dose level 3, and dose level 2 was considered the MTD. Rates of grade 3/4 adverse events were as follows: diarrhea, 8 %; fatigue, 4 %; neutropenia, 4 %; thrombocytopenia, 2 %; and skin rash, 2 %. Seventy-seven patients were evaluable for response. Partial response was noted in 5 (6.5 %) patients (neuroendocrine cancer, n = 2; CRC, n = 2; NSCLC, n = 1); and stable disease â‰¥ 6 months in 17 (22.1 %) patients (CRC, n = 13; breast, n = 1; neuroendocrine, n = 1; NSCLC, n = 1; pancreatic, n = 1).Conclusions:HAI irinotecan in combination with bevacizumab; oxaliplatin plus bevacizumab; or cetuximab plus bevacizumab was safe and may be a treatment option for selected patients with advanced cancer and liver involvement.
