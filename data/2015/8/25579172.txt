Aim:Differentiating intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) from poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (p-HCC) is often difficult, but it is important for providing appropriate treatments. The purpose of this study was to examine the features differentiating ICC from p-HCC on contrast-enhanced dynamic-computed tomography (CT).Methods:This study examined 42 patients with pathologically confirmed ICC (n = 19) or p-HCC (n = 23) for which contrast-enhanced dynamic CT data were available. CT images were analyzed for enhancement patterns during the arterial phase, washout pattern, delayed enhancement, satellite nodules, capsular retraction, lesion shape, and presence of an intratumoral hepatic artery, intratumoral hepatic vein, intratumoral portal vein, and bile duct dilation around the tumor, portal vein tumor thrombus, lobar atrophy, or lymphadenopathy.Results:Univariate analysis revealed the presence of rim enhancement (p = 0.037), lobulated shape (p = 0.004), intratumoral artery (p Conclusion:The presence of an intratumoral artery in the arterial phase on contrast-enhanced dynamic CT was a predictable finding for ICC, and the presence of a washout pattern was a predictable finding for p-HCC, differentiating between ICC and p-HCC.
