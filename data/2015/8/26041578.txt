Reactivation of hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may cause interruption of chemotherapy and lead to liver failure and death. In our institute, a computerized order entry-based alert system was introduced in September 2011 to remind healthcare providers of HBV testing when prescribing chemotherapy. Since August 2012, an order entry-based therapeutic control system has been applied to ensure HBV prophylaxis during chemotherapy. This retrospective cohort study included cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital from November 2009 to June 2013. The prechemotherapy HBV screening rate, HBV prophylactic rate, and severe HBV acute exacerbation rate were compared between stages with different order systems. Newly diagnosed cancer patients (n = 2512) were included. The HBV testing rate in the screening reminder stage was higher than that in the educational stage (93.5% versus 40.2%, P < 0.001), whereas the adequate HBV prophylactic rates in the two order entry-based stages were comparable (41.1% versus 39.2%). Patients in the order entry-based therapeutic control stage had a higher HBV screening rate (99.3% versus 40.2%, P < 0.001) and a higher HBV prophylactic rate (95.8% versus 39.2%, P < 0.001) than those in the educational stage. Additionally, the severe HBV acute exacerbation rate in the therapeutic control stage was lower than those in the educational and screening reminder stages (0% versus 1.2% and 1.2%, respectively; both P < 0.01).Conclusion:A computerized order entry-based therapeutic control system can provide excellent prechemotherapy HBV screening for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and can effectively prevent severe acute exacerbation of HBV infection in hospitals among HBV endemic areas.
