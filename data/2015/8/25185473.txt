Objectives:To investigate the feasibility and prognostic benefits of third or more hepatectomy (third or more Hx) for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.Background:Second hepatectomy (second Hx) has been accepted as an effective treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after first hepatectomy (first Hx). However, the feasibility and efficacy of third or more Hx have not been adequately assessed.Methods:Data were reviewed from 1340 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent curative hepatectomy. Among them, 941, 289, and 110 underwent first Hx, second Hx, and third or more Hx, respectively. Surgical outcomes and long-term survival were compared among the groups.Results:Surgical duration was significantly longer in third or more Hx (median, 6.4 hours) than in second Hx (median, 5.9 hours). Postoperative bile leakage and wound infection were more frequently observed in third or more Hx versus second Hx (12.5% vs 6.2%, [P = 0.04] and 2.9% vs 0.4% [P = 0.03], respectively). Three and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 36.8% and 27.1% in first Hx, 24.4% and 17.9 % in second Hx, and 26.1% and 12.8% in third or more Hx, respectively (P Conclusions:Third or more Hx is technically demanding in terms of surgical duration and morbidity compared with second Hx. However, aggressive repeat resection offers a survival similar to second Hx, leading to cumulative long-term survival from initial resection.
