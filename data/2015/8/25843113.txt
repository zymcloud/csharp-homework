Liver contrast X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been used for evaluation of hepatic vessels for liver transplantation, liver lobectomy, interventional radiology and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. However, there remains scant available anatomical information on normal hepatic vessels in the veterinary field. In this study, visualization of hepatic vessels was evaluated in 32 normal beagle dogs by X-ray contrast CT using triple phase images. The following hepatic vessels were clearly visualized: arterial, portal and hepatic veins. With regards to the running patterns of the portal vein and hepatic vein, there were no significant differences between the dogs. However, the hepatic artery exhibited some differences in each dog. In particular, the hepatic artery of the quadrate lobe and the right lateral lobe had many running patterns. The results of the present study could be useful for veterinary diagnosis, surgery and interventional radiology.
