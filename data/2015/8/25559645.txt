Background & aims:To compare the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and its evolution over time in currently followed HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients.Methods:A total of 709 consecutive patients with past or present positive HBs antigenemia seen in October 2012 in 19 French participating centres were included. The data were retrospectively collected from the first visit onwards through standardized questionnaires.Results:Chronic hepatitis B was less often assessed in the 299 HIV-positive patients, who were older, more likely to be male, excessive alcohol drinkers and HBe antigen-, HCV- and HDV-positive. They were also followed up for a longer time (11.3 +/-8.8 vs. 8.6 +/-6.9 years, P Conclusions:Although the assessment of CHB still has to be improved in HIV-positive patients, the negative impact of HIV on the virological, histological and clinical evolution of CHB seems to be disappearing, probably because of the immunovirological impact of HAART and the more frequent and longer use of HBV therapy.
