Background:Transecting cirrhotic liver in pure laparoscopic hepatectomy (PLH) is generally considered technically demanding. We have preferentially used BiClamp in PLH by fracturing liver parenchyma using this device. The aim of the current study was to retrospectively verify the efficacy of BiClamp-fracture method in transecting cirrhotic parenchyma.Methods:The medical records of 21 patients who underwent PLH using BiClamp-fracture method between April 2011 and September 2014 were examined. The patients were divided into the Nonstiff group (F0-F2, n=11) and the Stiff group (F3 and F4, n=10) and various surgical factors were compared between the groups.Results:The mean operation time, the mean intraoperative blood loss, and the mean postoperative hospital stay in the Stiff group were comparable with those in the Nonstiff group. There were no postoperative complications in both groups.Conclusion:BiClamp-fracture method was effective in transecting liver parenchyma irrespective of liver stiffness in PLH.
