In this study, we followed a DNA vector-based RNAi approach to silence the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) expression in Bel-7402 cells, to explore how the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT3 signaling pathway influences the apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma cells. According to GenBank's STAT3 cDNA, the plasmid pGCsi.U6/neoRFP STAT3, which was designed for expression of STAT3 small interfering RNA (siRNA), was constructed and synthesized, and then transfected into Bel-7402 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells with or without siRNA transfection were treated in wells. The apoptotic rate was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) and by staining with the Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit. Simultaneously, the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was visualized by JC-1 fluorescence staining and observed using the inverted fluorescence microscope. Furthermore, the expression of caspase-3 protein was analyzed by Western blotting. The results showed that treatment with STAT3 siRNA displayed effects in the Bel-7402 cells, causing a significantly increased apoptotic ratio (P
