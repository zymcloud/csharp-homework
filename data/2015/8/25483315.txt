Background:"Skip" lymphovascular invasion presenting as discontinuous foci of tumor cells within the colon wall is now excluded from consideration when determining T stage in the TNM classification. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinicopathological characteristics of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with such skip lymphovascular invasion.Methods:First, a retrospective questionnaire survey of the incidence of skip lymphovascular invasion was performed for a total of 1,868 patients with CRCs at ten institutions. Next, we comparatively assessed clinicopathological data for 896 CRC patients with or without skip lymphovascular invasion.Results:The incidence of skip lymphovascular invasion was 1.1 % (20 out of 1,868). Most of the affected cases were rectal, pT2, and node negative, with moderately differentiated histology. Skip lymphovascular invasion was present in the muscularis propria and subserosa, with the tumors directly invading submucosa (pT1) or muscularis propria (pT2). Hepatic metastasis was greater in CRC with skip lymphovascular invasion (25 %) than in pT1/2 CRC (0 %; P < 0.001) or pT3 CRC without such invasion (13.8 %; P = 0.185).Conclusions:Our study suggests that skip lymphovascular invasion is associated with hepatic metastasis in CRC cases. Thus, definition of a T category including such invasion would be useful for clinical practice.
