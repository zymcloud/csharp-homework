Surgical treatment for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has progressed enormously over time. The aim of this study was to analyze the evolution of surgical techniques and outcomes of patients undergoing major right hepatectomy (RH) over the last few decades.A retrospective review of 557 consecutive patients who had undergone RH for HCC between January 1982 and December 2011 was performed. Patients were categorized into subgroups and analyzed according to period and surgical approach to hepatectomy. Based on a propensity score-matching model, the surgical approach in patients in the second period was also analyzed in terms of anterior approach (AA) and conventional approach (CA)-RH.Tumor factors remained the most important prognostic factors related to postoperative HCC recurrence throughout the 2 periods examined in this study. Comparison of patients selected by a propensity score-matching model showed that AA-RH led to significantly better outcomes including recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.011) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.012) in patients with HCC as compared with CA-RH. The 5-year RFS and OS were 33.4% and 52.2% after AA-RH, and 21.0% and 36.5% after CA-RH.Major hepatectomy has evolved into a safe procedure that can be performed with confidence. RH by an AA has shown several advantages over CA-RH, and can thus be recommended as the standard procedure for liver resection in patients who require right hepatectomy.
