The aim of the present study was to determine the correlation between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), involved in tumor angiogenesis, and to evaluate the effect of AUY922, a HSP90 inhibitor, in HCC. The expression of HSP90 and microvessel density (MVD) were measured in tissue samples from 76 patients with HCC by immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of HSP90 in the HCC tissues and different HCC cell lines. The effects of time and concentration treatment with the AUY922 HSP90 inhibitor were investigated in HepG2 cells. Cell proliferation was measured using an MTT assay and a Transwell assay was performed to evaluate the migration of the HepG2 cells following treatment with different concentrations of AUY922. Positive staining of HSP90 was observed in 88.16% (67/76) of the HCC tissues, compared with 16.67% (4/24) of the normal tissues. The difference in the expression of HSP90 between the HCC and normal tissues was statistically significant (P
