In addition to DNA methylation, hydroxymethylation of DNA is recognized as a novel epigenetic mark. Primary liver cancers, i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC), are highly prevalent but epigenetically poorly characterized, so far. In the present study we measured global methylcytosine (mCyt) and hydroxymethylcytosine (hmCyt) in HCC and CC tissues and in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA to define mCyt and hmCyt status and, accordingly, the survival rate. Both mCyt and hmCyt were measured by a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method in neoplastic and homologous nonneoplastic tissues, i.e., liver and gallbladder, and in PBMCs of 31 HCC and 16 CC patients. Content of mCyt was notably lower in HCC than in CC tissues (3.97% versus 5.26%, respectively; P Conclusion:A significant DNA hypomethylation distinguishes HCC from CC, while DNA hypo-hydroxymethylation characterizes both HCC and CC, and a PBMC DNA mCyt content â‰¥5.59% relates to a favorable outcome in primary liver cancers.
