Objective:To determine the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for initial recurrence of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; ≤3 nodules, each nodule ≤3cm in diameter) after curative treatment and identify prognostic factors affecting therapeutic outcome, we compared clinical and outcome factors between patients with primary HCC and those with initial recurrent HCC who underwent RFA.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, 211 HCC patients who underwent RFA were enrolled and comprised two groups: primary group (n=139) and initial recurrent group (n=72). We compared local tumor progression, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and RFA safety between the groups.Results:Median follow-up was 53 months. Local tumor progression rate was 5.8% in the primary group and 4.2% in the recurrent group. OS rates at 5 years and 10 years were 63.2% and 25.5% in the primary group and 54.5% and 33.4% in the recurrent group, respectively. Corresponding DFS rates were 30.7% and 14.6% and 19.2% and 11.0%. DFS was significantly shorter in the recurrent group (hazard ratio [HR]=1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-2.57; P=0.001). In the recurrent group, time from primary HCC development to recurrence was a determinant of OS (≤2 years; HR=3.42; 95% CI, 1.52-7.72; P=0.003).Conclusion:Although local tumor control and OS were similar between the groups, the recurrent group had shorter DFS than the primary group. Time from primary HCC development to recurrence was a prognostic factor for recurrence of HCC.
