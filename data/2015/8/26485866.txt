Laparoscopic assisted percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (LAPRFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under guidance of intra-operative laparoscopic ultrasound (IOLUS) is a new modality for obtaining additional assessment of the liver situation, better tumor staging and effective treatment for the hepatic focal lesion (HFL), in patients with a difficult percutaneous approach. Between September 2010 and July 2014, 1150 patients with HCC on top of liver cirrhosis were referred to HCC clinic (MDT clinic) at National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute (NHTMRI). Fourty nine patients were submitted to LAPRFA under IOLUS guidanceby the Multidiscipplinary team decision. Operation time, hospital stay, post procedure complications were recorded. A routine spiral CT scan one month postoperative and laporatory investigations with AFP were mandatory during follow up. The results showed that LAPRFA was completed in all patients. The IOLUS examination identified new HFL in three patients. A total of 52 lesions were treated. The mean operative time was 92 minutes; eight procedures were associated in six patients: cholecystectomy (6) and adhesiolysis (2). A complete tumor ablation was observed in all patients during the procedure by the U/S assessment intra-operatively, and was documented via spiral computed tomography (CT scan) one mopth after treatment.
