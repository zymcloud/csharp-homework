Purpose:The roles of intravisceral and subcutaneous fat are unknown, and the prevalence of precancerous lesions in obese patients was never evaluated. This study aims to assess the frequency and severity of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and to correlate pathologic findings with metabolic abnormalities, type of fat, and fatty pancreatic infiltration.Experimental design:Normal pancreatic tissue from surgical specimens was analyzed. Fatty infiltration and fibrosis in intra- and extralobular locations and PanIN lesions were assessed. General characteristics were collected: body mass index (BMI), diabetes, and tobacco intake. Liver steatosis and subcutaneous and intravisceral fat were assessed by CT scan (ImageJ software).Results:Of note, 110 patients were included [median age, 53.8 (17-85) years]. Arterial hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco intake were found in 19%, 9%, and 23%, respectively. Median BMI was 24 (16-37; BMI < 25: 45%, 25 ≤ 30: 24%, ≥30: 11%). Overall, PanIN lesions were found in 65% (type I, II, and III PanIN in 62%, 38%, and 1%, respectively). Fibrosis and fatty pancreas (intra- and extralobular locations) were found in 1% and 24% and in 30% and 51%, respectively. A correlation was observed between PanIN lesions and fatty pancreas [extralobular (0.01) and intralobular (<0.0001)], intralobular fibrosis (0.003), high BMI (P = 0.02), and subcutaneous (P = 0.02) and intravisceral fat (P = 0.02). The number of PanIN lesions was correlated with intravisceral fat (r = 0.22, P = 0.04), but not with subcutaneous fat (r = 0.14, P = 0.22). In multivariate analysis, PanIN lesions were associated with intralobular fibrosis [OR, 5.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-42.99] and intralobular fat (OR, 17.86; 95% CI, 4.935-88.12).Conclusions:Obesity (especially android obesity) and pancreatic fatty infiltration are risk factors for pancreatic precancerous lesions.
