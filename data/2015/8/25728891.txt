Background:Several studies suggest that surgical manipulation of the intestine and increased intra-abdominal pressure promotes bacterial translocation (BT). This prospective randomized study has investigated the effect of surgery on BT in patients undergoing elective colectomy for colon cancer by comparing the laparoscopic with the open approach.Methods:One hundred nineteen consecutive patients underwent colectomy for colon cancer: 59 cases underwent open resection and 60 cases underwent laparoscopic resection. For bacterial identification, tissue samples were taken from the liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes.Results:The incidence of BT increased in laparoscopic and open group after bowel mobilization (prior to ligation of the vascular pedicle), compared with the before mobilization (P < .05). There was not a statistically significant difference in BT value between the 2 groups.Conclusion:BT increase was observed during the open and laparoscopic resection for colon cancer, without significant statistical difference between the 2 groups.
