The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is extremely high in China. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of gross classification on solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy.A total of 144 patients with solitary HCC who underwent hepatectomy were identified retrospectively. Based on the gross appearance, the tumors were divided into single nodular (SN), single nodular with extranodular growth (SNEG), confluent multinodular (CMN), and infiltrative types. Clinicopathologic variables and survival information were compared among patients with those 4 types.The 144 tumors composed of 25 SN, 34 SNEG, 33 CMN, and 52 infiltrative types. The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and HBV infection rate of infiltrative type were significantly higher than other 3 types. The disease-free and overall survival times of infiltrative type were significantly shorter than other 3 types. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that gross classification, microvascular invasion, and T stage were independent risk factors.In Chinese patients with solitary HCC, the infiltrative type accounted for a much higher proportion compared with other regions of the world. Infiltrative HCC had higher serum AFP level, HBV infection, and microvascular invasion rates with poorer prognosis compared with other 3 types.
