Background:Our previous research suggested that p57 downregulation could accelerate the growth and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo.Aim:To evaluate the role of cytoplasmic p57 and its regulatory mechanism during hepatocellular carcinoma invasion.Methods:We examined the subcellular localization of p57 by immunohistochemistry in 45 pairs of cancerous tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, we generated stable p57 knockdown hepatoma cell lines to investigate the mechanism of cytoplasmic p57-mediated regulation of invasion by immunoprecipitation, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts.Results:Our results showed that cytoplasmic expression of p57 was reduced in specimens from patients with capsular invasion and metastasis (P Conclusions:Cytoplasmic p57 might be a key regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma invasion via the LIM domain kinase 1/p-cofilin pathway.
