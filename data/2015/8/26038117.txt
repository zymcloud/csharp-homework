Chronic hepatitis, including viral hepatitis and steatihepatitis, is a well-known high-risk condition for hepatocellular carcinoma. We previously reported that continuous hepatocyte apoptosis drives liver tumors in hepatocyte-specific Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 knockout mice. In this study, we further examine the underlying cellular mechanisms of generating tumors in apoptosis-prone liver. In cultured hepatocytes, the administration of ABT-737, a Bcl-xL/-2/-w inhibitor, led to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as activation of caspases. Mitochondria isolated from murine liver, upon administration of truncated-Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, released cytochrome c and produced ROS, which was dependent on mitochondrial respiration. Hepatic apoptosis, regeneration, accumulation of oxidative damages, and tumorigenesis observed in hepatocyte-specific Mcl-1 knockout mice were substantially attenuated by further deficiency of Bax or Bid, suggesting that a balance of mitochondrial Bcl-2 family proteins governs generation of oxidative stress and other pathologies. Whole-exome sequencing clarified that C>A/G>T transversion, which is often caused by oxidative DNA damage in proliferating cells, was a frequently observed mutation pattern in liver tumors of Mcl-1 knockout mice. The administration of antioxidant L-N-acetylcysteine did not affect apoptosis, compensatory regeneration, or fibrotic responses but significantly reduced oxidative DNA damage and incidence and multiplicity of live tumors in Mcl-1 knockout mice. In conclusion, activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in hepatocytes accumulates intracellular oxidative damages, leading to liver tumorigenesis, independently of liver regeneration or fibrosis. This study supports a concept that antioxidant therapy may be useful for suppressing liver carcinogenesis in patients with chronic liver disease.
