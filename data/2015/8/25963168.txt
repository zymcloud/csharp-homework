Background:Previous studies have suggested the abnormal expression of soluble B7-H4 (sB7-H4) in circulation in cancer patients. The aim of present study was to examine the sB7-H4 expression in serum and to investigate the correlations between sB7-H4 levels and clinicopathologic parameters as well as the survival rate of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Circulating sB7-H4 levels in blood specimens from 93 patients with HCC and 55 healthy volunteers were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The association of sB7-H4 levels with clinicopathologic factors, overall survival (OS), and time to recurrence were statistically analyzed.Results:sB7-H4 levels in HCC patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls (49.12 ± 3.10 versus 31.66 ± 2.59 ng/mL, P Conclusions:Detection of sB7-H4 in serum might serve as a clinical predictor in the diagnosis or prediction of clinical outcomes for the patients with HCC.
