Background & aims:Chronic hepatitis C is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. DNA methylation and histone covalent modifications constitute crucial mechanisms of genomic instability in human disease, including liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The present work studies the consequences of HCV-induced histone modifications in early stages of infection.Methods:Human primary hepatocytes and HuH7.5 cells were transiently transfected with the core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1a, 1b, and 2a. Infectious genotype 2a HCV in culture was also used.Results:We show that HCV and core protein inhibit the phosphorylation of Serine 10 in histone 3. The inhibition is due to the direct interaction between HCV core and Aurora B kinase (AURKB) that results in a decrease of AURKB activity. HCV and core significantly downregulate NF-κB and COX-2 transcription, two proteins with anti-apoptotic and proliferative effects implicated in the control of the inflammatory response. AURKB depletion reduced HCV and core repression of NF-κB and COX-2 gene transcription and AURKB overexpression reversed the viral effect. AURKB abrogation increased HCV specific infectivity which was decreased when AURKB was overexpressed.Conclusions:The core-mediated decrease of AURKB activity may play a role in the inflammatory pathway during the initial steps of viral infection, while ensuring HCV infectivity.
