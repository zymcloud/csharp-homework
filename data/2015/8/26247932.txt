Hepatitis B virus (HBV) attacks the liver and can cause both acute as well as chronic liver diseases which might lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Regardless of the availability of a vaccine and numerous treatment options, HBV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality across the world. Recently,microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important modulators of gene function. Studies on the role of miRNA in the regulation of hepatitis B virus gene expression have been the focus of modern antiviral research. miRNAs can regulate viral replication and pathogenesis in a number of different ways, which includefacilitation, direct or indirect inhibition, activation of immune response, epigenetic modulation, etc. Nevertheless, these mechanisms can appropriately be used with a diagnosticand/or therapeutic approach. The present review is an attempt to classify specific miRNAs that are reported to be associated with various aspects of hepatitis B biology, in order to precisely present the participation of individual miRNAs in multiple aspects relating to HBV.
