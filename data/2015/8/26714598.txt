Objective:To detect the expression of interleukin-17A(IL-17A) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCs) tissues, and to analyze its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Methods:The expression of IL-17A, E-cadherin, vimentin proteins and Snail mRNA were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization histochemistry in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues of 74 patients.Results:IL-17A staining was detected in 54.1% (40/74) specimens of human HCCs, but only 25.0% (5/20) in corresponding peritumoral tissues (PConclusions:Our results suggest that IL-17A is closely related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma. IL-17A-positive hepatocellular carcinoma demonstrates more aggressive biological behavior, and IL-17A may serve as a potential prognostic marker for this cancer.
