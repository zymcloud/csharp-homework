Background:Hypermethylation of the promoter region of the RAS association domain family 1A gene (RASSF1A) occurs widely in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. While the diagnostic performance of the use of RASSF1A methylation as a serum or plasma marker in patients with HCC has varied largely in the literature,we confirmed the clinical application value of serum RASSF1A methylation for HBV related HCC in this study.Methods:A total of 584 participants were recruited into this study, including 190 patients with HCC, 114 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 120 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 160 healthy individuals. Serum RASSF1A methylation was determined by the MethyLight method. In addition, we followed up 43 HCC patients who were unable to undergo surgery for 24 months.Results:Serum RASSF1A methylation occurred significantly more frequently in patients with HCC (122/190, 64.2%) than in patients with LC (20/114, 17.5%), patients with CHB (6/120, 5.0%) and in healthy individuals (0/160, 0) (P Conclusion:Serum RASSF1A methylation demonstrated a satisfactory value for in the diagnosis of HBV related HCC, and could predict clinical progression and prognosis. In addition, our findings suggested that the combination of serum RASSF1A methylation and AFP level may be a promising non-invasive biomarker for the discrimination of patients with HCC from those with CHB.Virtual slides:The virtual slides for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/13000_DPAT-D-15-00090.1.
