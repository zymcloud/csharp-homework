Backgrounds/aims:We compared the efficacy and safety of a hepatectomy, combined with intraoperative radiofrequency ablation to those of wider extent hepatectomy, alone, in patients with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Methods:Between January 2004 and December 2013, 78 patients with multiple HCCs underwent surgery. 25 patients were treated by hepatectomy, combined with intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (group A), and 53 underwent hepatectomy only (group B). We retrospectively analyzed medical records to compare the clinical features of these two groups.Results:Patients in group A had more limited resections (less than 2 segments) than those in group B (pConclusions:Hepatectomy combined with intraoperative RFA could be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with multiple HCCs, comparable to extended hepatectomy alone.
