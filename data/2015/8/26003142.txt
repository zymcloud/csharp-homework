Objective:To measure the efficacy and the safety of Visceral-Peritoneal Debulking (VPD) in patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian cancer and to compare the outcomes before and after chemotherapy.Methods:Between 2008 and 2013, 200 consecutive patients were offered VPD for stage IIIC/IV ovarian cancer. Exclusion criteria were: metastases in the lungs or 3 liver segments at CT review and/or disease on small bowel serosa or encasing the porta hepatis at explorative laparoscopy. The endpoints were efficacy (rate of complete resection, CR) and safety (morbidity and mortality). The results were compared between patients in group 1 (upfront surgery) and group 2 (during or after chemotherapy).Results:Ninety-eight patients were in group 1 and 102 in group 2. Twenty out of 200 patients (10%) did not have VPD, 180 out of 200 patients (90%) had VPD and CR: 90.8% in group 1, 89.8% in group 2. The mortality (1%) and intra-operative complication rate (3.3%) were similar. Post-operative complications rate was 34.8% in group 1 vs. 30.7% in group 2 (P=0.669). The difference in grade III (15.7% vs. 5.5%, P=0.053) and grade IIIb complications (13.4% vs. 4.4%, P=0.062) approached statistical significance. All other outcomes were not significantly different in the 2 groups.Conclusion:VPD achieved CR in 90% of the patients. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy did not increase the rate of CR and did not significantly decrease the morbidity or the complexity of the surgery.
