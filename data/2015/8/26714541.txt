Objective:To analyze the cancer incidence and mortality in Hebei cancer registry available areas in 2011.Methods:Data were collected from 8 population-based cancer registries systems in Hebei province. Incidence and mortality rates stratified by areas (urban/rural), sex, age group and cancer site were analyzed. 10 common cancers in different groups, proportions and cumulative rates were calculated. The Chinese population census in the year 2000 and Segi's populations were used for age-standardized incidence/mortality rates.Results:In all the 8 cancer registries that covering a total of 4 573 293 population (2 139 779 in urban and 2 433 514 in rural areas), data was used for the analysis. The total new cancer incidence cases and deaths were 11 269 and 7 477, respectively. All the morphologically verified cancer cases (MV%) accounted for 75.26% while 3.85% of the incident cases were identified only through death certification records (DCO%). The mortality to incidence ratio appeared as 0.66. The crude incidence appeared in the Hebei cancer registration areas was 246.41/10⁵ (264.55/10⁵ in males and 227.75/10⁵ in females). The age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) appeared as 207.13/10⁵ and 206.61/10⁵ respectively, with the cumulative incidence rates as (0-74 age years old) 23.57%. The cancer incidence and ASIRC were 242.64/10⁵ and 200.19/10⁵ in urban areas, whereas 249.72/10⁵ and 214.11/10⁵, respectively in rural areas. The crude mortality in Hebei cancer registration areas was 163.49/10⁵ (196.54/10⁵ in male, 129.51/10⁵ in female), with age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) as 144.48/10⁵ and 147.69/10⁵. The cumulative mortality rate (0-74 age years old) was 14.71%. The cancer mortality (167.91/10⁵) in rural areas seemed higher than the mortality (158.47/10⁵) in urban areas. The most common sites of cancers were: stomach, lung, esophagus, breast, liver and colorectal, which accounted for 71.66% of all the cancer cases. Lung cancer, stomach cancer, esophagus cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer were the major causes responsible for the cancer deaths in the areas with data of cancer registration, which accounted for 74.79% of all the cancer deaths.Conclusion:The coverage of Hebei cancer registration population could reflect the cancer burden in various areas and populations. The most commonly seen cancers were stomach, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, and colorectal, in Hebei province. In order to reduce the burden of cancers, prevention and control measures should be strengthened.
