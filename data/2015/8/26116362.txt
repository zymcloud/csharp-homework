Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation for treatment of hepatic metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma.Materials and methods:Of 24 patients who underwent percutaneous RF ablation after gastrectomy for a hepatic metastasis from a gastric cancer during the period 2000-2013, 19 were enrolled (median age, 63 y) with 21 metastatic tumors (mean diameter, 2.3 cm). Patient overall survival (OS) and local tumor progression-free survival (PFS) outcomes were assessed and compared according to patient and tumor characteristics, including tumor size and lobar distribution. The difference in diameter between tumor and ablation zone was compared according to lobar distribution.Results:The median OS after RF ablation was 20.3 months, and the median local tumor PFS was 10.4 months. The OS rate was not significantly influenced by any patient or tumor characteristics. In multivariate analysis, independent negative prognostic factors for local tumor PFS were a tumor ≥ 3 cm in diameter (hazard ratio, 10.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-62.5; P = .009) and a tumor located in the left lobe (hazard ratio, 9.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-63.5; P = .026). The difference in diameter between the tumor and ablation zone was significantly different between the right and left lobes (right 1.8 cm ± 0.6 vs left 1.1 cm ± 0.70, P = .028).Conclusions:With the appropriate selection of patients with tumors ≤ 3 cm in diameter and with the possibility of sufficient safety margins, RF ablation is a safe and feasible treatment option for hepatic metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma.
