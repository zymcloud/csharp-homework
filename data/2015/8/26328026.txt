Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is best treated by liver transplantation, but the applicability of transplantation is greatly limited. Tumor resection in partial hepatectomy is hence resorted to. However, in most parts of the world, only 20%-30% of HCCs are resectable. The main reason for such a low resectability is a future liver remnant too small to be sufficient for the patient. To allow more HCC patients to undergo curative hepatectomy, a variety of ways have been developed to increase the resectability of HCC, mainly ways to increase the future liver remnants in patients through hypertrophy. They include portal vein embolization, sequential transarterial chemoembolization and portal vein embolization, staged hepatectomy, two-staged hepatectomy with portal vein ligation, and Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation in Staged Hepatectomy. Herein we review, describe and evaluate these different ways, ways that can be life-saving.
