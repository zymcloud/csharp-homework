Previous studies indicated a role of hepatocellular carcinoma-related protein-1(HCRP-1) in human cancers, however, its expression pattern in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the molecular mechanism of HCRP-1 on cancer progression have not been characterized. In the present study, HCRP-1 expression was examined in a RCC tissue microarray. The negative expression of HCRP-1 was significantly correlated with tumor grade (P = 0.002), TNM stage (P = 0.001) and pT status (P = 0.003). Furthermore, we showed a strong correlation between negative HCRP-1 expression and worse overall and disease-specific survival (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0012, respectively). Knockdown of HCRP-1 promoted cell migration and invasion in 786-O and OS-RC-2 cell lines. HCRP-1 depletion increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 protein level, with increased extracellular signal-regulatedkinase (ERK) phosphorylation, which could be reversed by ERK siRNA or ERK inhibitor, PD98059. Further analysis showed that HCRP-1 knockdown induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation. Treatment with EGFR inhibitor or EGFR siRNA blocked HCRP-1-mediated up-regulation of EGFR, ERK phosphorylation and MMP-2 expression. In summary, our results showed that negative HCRP-1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for RCC patients and promotes migration and invasion by EGFR-ERK-mediated up-regulation of MMP-2. HCRP-1 may serve as a therapeutic target for RCC.
