Although it is common to have extra-hepatic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the time of presentation, it is extremely rare to have extra-hepatic metastatic HCC without a detectable primary in the liver. We report a unique case in which a patient presented with bilateral large adrenal masses which were subsequently proven to be metastases from HCC. However, there was no tumour seen in the liver on imaging.
