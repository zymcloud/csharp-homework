Background:Survival estimates with first-line treatment for patients with metastatic poor prognosis germ cell tumors (GCT) are still suboptimal in the literature. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the outcome of patients referred to our tertiary cancer center.Patients and methods:A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who received at least first-line chemotherapy at our center. Distribution of clinical characteristics was evaluated in the periods < 1997, 1997 to 2001, 2001 to 2006, and 2007 to 2013. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Univariable and multivariable Cox models with prespecified clinical variables were undertaken for PFS and OS. All tests and confidence intervals were 2-sided and set at a P = .05 level of significance.Results:Between 1982 and 2013, 168 patients were identified. The median age was 27 years (interquartile range [IQR], 22-34). The presence of liver, bone, or brain metastases trended to greater incidence from 1997 onward (27.5% < 1997 to 55.6% in 2007-2013; Ï‡(2)P = .054). Median follow-up was 102 (IQR, 63-166) months. Global 5-year PFS was 48.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.5-56.8) and OS was 63.2% (95% CI, 56.0-71.2). In multivariable analysis, treatment period was not significantly associated with either PFS (overall P = .229) or OS (overall P = .216).Conclusion:In this single-center series of consecutive poor prognosis GCT we could observe greater PFS and OS than the historical estimates. This observation was independent from the period of treatment. Based on the present results, studies focused on improving the outcome in the sole poor-risk cohort should be discouraged. Results were biased by their retrospective quality.
