Over 90% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an advanced stage. This study investigated the antitumor efficacy of the inhibition of cell division cycle protein 20 (CDC20) and heparanase (HPSE) expression in Hepa1-6 mouse hepatoma cells. Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay. Cell cycle was analyzed by cytometry. The invasion assay was performed using the Transwell chamber. The orthotopic liver tumor model was established by inoculating the livers of immunocompetent Kunming mice with Hepa1-6 cells. The MTT assay showed that 50 and 100 nM CDC20 siRNA-1 and HPSE siRNA-2 significantly reduced Hepa1-6 cell viability with the combination of CDC20 and HPSE siRNA being the most effective. Silencing of CDC20 or both CDC20 and HPSE expression significantly induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in Hepa1-6 HCC cells. Silencing HPSE expression significantly inhibited the invasion ability of Hepa1-6 cells with the combination of CDC20 and HPSE silencing being more effective than HPSE alone. Silencing CDC20 and HPSE expression significantly inhibited HCC tumor growth in the orthotopic liver tumor model, but the combination was most effective. Silencing CDC20 and HPSE expression activated cell apoptosis and autophagy. In conclusion, targeting inhibition of both CDC20 and HPSE expression is an ideal strategy for HCC therapy.
