Purpose:Perifosine has shown antitumor activity via inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in many advanced solid tumors. This study investigated the efficacy of perifosine alone and in combination with sorafenib in a transgenic mouse model of HCC.Methods:The mouse model of HCC was generated by hydrodynamic injection of transposons encoding HrasG12V and short-hairpin RNA downregulating p53. The transgenic mice were treated with perifosine alone and in combination with sorafenib to evaluate efficacy of drugs on tumor growth and survival.Results:Treatment with perifosine for 5 weeks, alone and in combination with sorafenib, strongly inhibited tumor growth and increased survival. Perifosine inhibited HCC cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, its combination with sorafenib enhanced these effects. In addition, Akt phosphorylation was decreased by perifosine and further decreased by combination treatment. Although perifosine alone did not appear to activate the caspase pathway, combination treatment increased the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.Conclusions:The preclinical effect that current study showed represents a strong rationale for clinical trials using perifosine alone and in combination with sorafenib in the treatment of HCC patients.
