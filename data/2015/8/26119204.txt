Purpose:To describe full explant pathology and radiographic correlation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with irreversible electroporation (IRE) who subsequently underwent liver transplant.Materials and methods:In a retrospective study, 6 patients who had undergone IRE for HCC and subsequent orthotopic liver transplant during the period 2011-2013 were evaluated. Of the 6 patients, 4 had Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, and 2 had class B cirrhosis. Irreversible electroporation was performed for a single focal HCC with median tumor diameter of 22 mm (range, 6-26 mm). After IRE, follow-up multiphasic cross-sectional imaging was performed at 1 month and every 3 months thereafter until liver transplant. Mean time between IRE and transplant was 10 months (range, 3-17 mo). Assessment of imaging response was based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors. Liver explants were evaluated for necrosis and viable carcinoma in IRE-treated tumors.Results:After IRE, all tumors showed a complete response on follow-up imaging. Five tumors showed complete pathologic necrosis without any viable carcinoma, sharply demarcated from the surrounding hepatic parenchyma. Bile ducts within the treatment area were preserved. A single tumor treated with a bipolar IRE probe had Conclusions:This study demonstrates the efficacy of IRE for HCC based on pathologic evaluation and correlation to radiologic findings.
