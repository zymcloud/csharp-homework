Few studies have elucidated the relationship between preoperative aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to lymphocyte ratio and high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In search of a simple non-invasive prognostic marker, we investigated the prognostic significance of AST to lymphocyte ratio index (ALRI) in HCC.We reviewed retrospectively clinical parameters of 371 HCC patients who were treated with hepatectomy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-off value of preoperative ALRI. The predictive value of preoperative ALRI in HCC was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, and the survival probability of HCC patients was acquired by the Kaplan-Meier plots. In addition, stratified analysis was used to investigate the impact of preoperative ALRI on survival in different HCC subgroups. The results showed that preoperative ALRI was closely correlated with age (p = 0.007), median size (p = 0.004), clinical tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (p 25.2 have a poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) after tumor resection. Multivariate analysis further identified preoperative ALRI > 25.2 (p = 0.002), III-IV of TNM stage (p = 0.011), PVTT (p = 0.035), size of tumor > 5 cm (p 25.2 (p = 0.001), III-IV of TNM stage (p = 0.005), PVTT (p = 0.012), size of tumor > 5 cm (p
