In continuation of previous efforts to investigate the biological potency of tetrahydropyridinol derivatives, the present study synthesized three target compounds: N-(bromoacetyl)-3-carboxyethyl-2,6-diphenyl-4-O-(pentafluorobenzoyl)-Δ3-tetra-hydropyridine (5a), N-(chloroacetyl)-3-carboxyethyl-2,6-diphenyl-4-O-(pentafluorobenzoyl)-Δ3-tetrahydropyridine (5b) and N-(2-bromopropanoyl)-3-carboxyethyl-2,6-diphenyl-4-O-(pentafluorobenzoyl)-Δ3-tetrahydropyridine (5c), and examined their anticancer potency. Experiments were performed using the Sk-Hep1 and Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cell line. Among the three compounds, 5a and 5b were comparably and significantly cytotoxic to the Sk-Hep1, Hep3B and MDA-MB-231 cells. The highest level of cytotoxicity was detected in theSk-Hep1 cells with half maximal inhibitory concentrations for compounds 5a and 5b at 12 and 6 µM, respectively. These two compounds induced cell cycle arrest in the Sk-Hep1 and MDA-MB-231 cells through the downregulation of β-catenin and upregulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and E-cadherin. By contrast, 5a and 5b induced G1 arrest in the Hep3B cells by modulating the p21 and p27 cell cycle regulatory molecules and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. In addition, 5a and 5b significantly inhibited the invasion of Sk-Hep1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggested that the 5a and 5b compounds induce cell cycle arrest by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling in highly invasive Sk-Hep1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and by inducing p53 independent cell cycle arrest in Hep3B cells.
