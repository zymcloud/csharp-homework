The sustained virological response (SVR) rate in the patients with HCV has currently reached to 90% by the progression of anti-viral therapy. However, several reports demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma develops even in the patients with SVR. It is widely accepted that liver fibrosis plays a pivotal role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Thus, an accurate staging for liver fibrosis is necessary to improve long-term prognosis of hepatitis C patients. Recently, Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) was identified as a novel hepatic fibrosis marker. In the present study, we compared the value of M2BPGi in serum before and after the anti-viral therapy in hepatitis C patients. The value of M2BPGi in patients with F2, F3, or F4 stagings was significantly higher than that in F1 staging. Moreover, the value of M2BPGi significantly decreased after the treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin similarly to other liver fibrosis-related markers. In addition, the value of M2BPGi in patients with SVR was significantly decreased after the anti-viral therapy (P
