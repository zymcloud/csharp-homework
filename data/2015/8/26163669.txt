A 65-year-old male was brought to our hospital with right upper abdominal fullness sensation and recent body weight loss of about 3 kg. The patient had developed episodes of melena following progressive abdominal muscular guarding and drop of haemoglobin level to 6.3 g/dL. An abdominal computed tomography scan disclosed a ruptured hepatocellular cell carcinoma. A segmental arterial mediolysis was found on the superior mesenteric artery in the process of repairing the ruptured right hepatic artery with the assistance of angiography. Transarterial embolization was carried out and permanent haemostasis was achieved.
