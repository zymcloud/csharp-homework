Hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a rare variant of extra hepatic adenocarcinoma, consisting of foci of both adenomatous and hepatocellular differentiation with morphological and functional resemblance to hepatocellular carcinoma and hence correct diagnosis is a challenge. The most frequent site is stomach. We present this case of hepatoid carcinoma of the gallbladder for its rarity and difficulty in diagnosis which on histology showed papillae, sheets and trabaculae of polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli with adjacent foci showing high grade dysplasia.
Alpha feto protein; Hep Par1; High grade dysplasia.
