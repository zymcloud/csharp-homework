Background:Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a promising biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It decreases after surgical resection, and resumes upon recurrence, indicating a potential indicator for the effectiveness of the treatment. But changes of GP73 after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) have not been reported so far. This study was to investigate the dynamic changes of GP73 in HCC patients after TACE treatment, and the possible underlying mechanisms in the cell cultures.Methods:Blood samples were collected from 72 HCC patients, before TACE, at day 1 and day 30 after TACE. GP73 levels were measured by Western blotting. The dynamic changes of GP73 were analyzed and compared with image changes and clinical data. The effects of chemotherapeutic agents (5-FU and pirarubicin) on GP73 expression were tested in three HCC cell lines (HepG2, HCCLM3 and MHCC97H).Results:The GP73 level was significantly elevated at day 1 and day 30 after TACE in HCC patients compared with that before the procedure (PConclusions:Unlike surgical resection which decreases the GP73 level, TACE significantly increased GP73 expression in patients with HCC. No correlations were observed among GP73 levels, tumor characteristics and prognosis of patients with HCC.
