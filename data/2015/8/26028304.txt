Metastectomy has been performed for many years in situations where the functional consequences allow it, for example in the liver, lung, adrenal glands, and ovaries. This history suggests that selected patients may benefit from aggressive treatment of metastases. Technological developments now allow for ablative treatment of other tumor sites and perhaps for larger volume and/or increasing multiplicity of disease using Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy (SABR) with relatively lower risk of morbidity to patients. Here we further explore the concept of aggressive local treatment of metastatic disease in adult patients and review the rationale for use of SABR to treat metastases and highlight new data supporting this approach in metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
