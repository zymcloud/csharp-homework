Objectives:To analyze the diagnostic performance of dual time point imaging (DTPI) for pre-therapeutic lymph node (LN) staging in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods:This was a retrospective analysis of 47 patients with NSCLC who had undergone DTPI by PET (early + delayed) using F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). PET raw data were reconstructed iteratively (point spread function + time-of-flight). LN uptake in PET was assessed visually (four-step score) and semi-quantitatively (SUVmax, SUVmean, ratios LN/primary, LN/liver, and LN/mediastinal blood pool). DTPI analyses included retention indices (RIs), Δ-ratios and changes in visual score. Histology or cytology served as standards of reference. Accuracy was determined based on ROC analyses.Results:Thirty-six of 155 LNs were malignant. DTPI accuracy was low for all measures (visual assessment, 24.5%; RI SUVmax, 68.4%; RI SUVmean, 65.8%; Δ-ratios, 63.9-76.1%) and significantly inferior to early PET. Accuracies of early (range, 86.5-92.9%) and delayed PET (range, 85.2-92.9%) were comparable. At early PET, accuracy of the visual score (92.9%) was similar or superior to semi-quantitative analyses (range, 86.5-92.3%).Conclusions:Using a modern PET/CT device and novel image reconstruction, neither additional delayed PET nor DTPI analyses improved the accuracy of PET-based LN staging. Dedicated visual assessment criteria performed very well.Key points:• DTPI did not improve accuracy of PET-based LN staging in NSCLC. • Analyzed SUV ratios were not superior to LN SUVmax or SUVmean. • A four-step visual score may allow highly accurate, standardized LN assessment.
