We report a case of a 54-year-old Caucasian male with exertional dyspnea who underwent palliative resection of a solitary right ventricular metastasis one year after liver transplant for a multifocal HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After nine months the patient remains asymptomatic and cardiac MRI shows no local progression of the tumor.
