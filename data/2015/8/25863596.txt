Purpose:To develop a clinically relevant, minimally invasive technique for transarterial embolization in a translational rat model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Oral diethylnitrosamine was administered to 53 male Wistar rats ad libitum for 12 weeks. Tumor induction was monitored using magnetic resonance imaging. Minimally invasive lobar or segmental transarterial embolization was performed through a left common carotid artery approach. Necropsy was performed to evaluate periprocedural mortality. Histologic analysis of tumors that received embolization was performed to assess percent tumor necrosis.Results:Severe cirrhosis and autochthonous HCCs were characterized in a cohort of rats composed of two groups of rats identically treated with diethylnitrosamine with median survival times of 101 days and 105 days (n = 10/group). A second cohort was used to develop minimally invasive transarterial embolization of HCCs (n = 10). In a third cohort, lobar embolization was successfully performed in 9 of 10 rats and demonstrated a high rate of periprocedural mortality (n = 5). Necropsy performed for periprocedural mortality after lobar embolization demonstrated extensive tissue necrosis within the liver (n = 3) and lungs (n = 2), indicating nontarget embolization as the likely cause of mortality. In a fourth cohort of rats, a segmental embolization technique was successfully applied in 10 of 13 rats. Segmental embolization resulted in a reduction in periprocedural mortality (P = .06) relative to selective embolization and a 19% increase in average tumor necrosis (P = .04).Conclusions:Minimally invasive, segmental embolization mimicking the currently applied clinical approach is feasible in a translational rat model of HCC and offers the critical advantage of reduced nontarget embolization relative to lobar embolization.
