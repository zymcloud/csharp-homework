Purpose:To evaluate the clinical value of 320-detector row CT in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Sixty-four patients with HCC underwent CT perfusion scanning with a 320-detector row CT before and after TACE. With the help of built-in dual-source CT perfusion software, color perfusion images of hepatic arterial perfusion (HAP), portal vein perfusion (PVP) and hepatic arterial perfusion index (HAPI) of all HCC lesions were obtained, and the above perfusion parameters were measured on the color images. The parameters obtained after TACE were compared with those obtained before TACE, and the differences were statistically analyzed.Results:There were significant differences in HAP, PVP and HAPI between cancer tissues and non-cancerous tissues before TACE (P Conclusions:The 320-row CT upper abdominal one-stop examination can display the whole liver perfusion well, especially the abnormal perfusion of HCC tissues and postoperative active tissues. Angiography can display the hepatic and nutrient arteries of tumors from three dimensions, and has important guiding significance in preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow up of TACE.
