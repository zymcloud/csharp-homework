Sorafenib is a type of multikinase inhibitor that exhibits antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects; in addition, sorafenib is a unique first-line drug recommended for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the effectiveness of HCC treatment remains poor due to acquired drug resistance. It has been suggested that hypoxia, induced as a results of the antiangiogenic effects of sustained sorafenib treatment, may be an important factor in sorafenib resistance. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α has been reported to be associated with cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions; therefore, it was hypothesized that hypoxia may enhance tumor cell proliferation via this mechanism. The present study aimed to evaluate whether the knock-down of HIF-2α was able to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib in order to effectively treat HCC. The results demonstrated that hypoxia protected HCC cells against sorafenib; however, short hairpin RNA-HIF-2α transfection in combination with sorafenib treatment exhibited a significantly synergistic effect against HCC cell proliferation. In addition, HCC cells acquired increased β-catenin/C-Myc expression, which enhanced proliferation under hypoxic conditions; however, targeted knock-down of HIF-2α or C-Myc markedly decreased cell proliferation in HCC cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that the targeted knock-down of HIF-2α in combination with sorafenib may be a promising strategy for the treatment of HCC.
