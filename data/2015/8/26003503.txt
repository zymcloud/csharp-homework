Introduction:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading global cause of cancer death. While bone metastases (BM) commonly cause morbidity, bone-targeted agent (BTA) use is variable. We investigated the incidence and impact of BM among unselected NSCLC patients.Methods:A retrospective chart review of all NSCLC patients seen at a single institution from January 2007 to January 2008 was performed. Various clinical and pathology data were collected. In BM patients, skeletal related events (SRE), interventions and outcomes were recorded.Results:We identified 383 patients; median age 68 (IQR 60-76); 54% female. Initially 156 patients (41%) were treated with curative intent of whom 91 subsequently relapsed; 227 (59%) were considered palliative from time of diagnosis, including 22 with early stage disease not amenable to radical therapy. Of 296 patients with advanced NSCLC, common metastatic sites were: lung/pleura (80%), mediastinal nodes (69%), bone (39%), brain (30%), and liver (24%). Of 118 patients with BM, 69 (59%) had â‰¥1 SREs (range 1-18). Common SREs were radiotherapy (63%), pathologic fractures (22%), spinal cord compression (6%) or surgery to bone (5%). Opioid analgesia was required in 69% of BM patients, only 6% of patients with BM received BTA. Overall survival (OS) in pts with mNSCLC was 7.3 months (IQR 3.1-20.5). Pts with BM had significantly shorter OS compared to those without BM (5.8 versus 10.2 months, p=0.03).Conclusions:BM are common in patients with advanced NSCLC and associated with shorter survival. In this cohort, despite SREs occurred in many patients, BTA were rarely used.
