In order to explore the regulation of the invasive ability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and the underlying mechanism, mimics sequences of microRNA (miR)-125a (miR-125a-3p/5p) and scramble sequences (miR-125a-3p-s/5p-s) were transfected into human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, HCC-LM3 and HepG2, and the non-malignant epithelioid hepatic cell line QZG. To inhibit and upregulate the expression of miR-125a individually. Protein expression was detected by western blotting, and the cell proliferation and migration abilities were evaluated by soft agar colony formation and Transwell assay, respectively. It was revealed that the expression of miR-125a was downregulated in HepG2 and HCC-LM3 cells compared with that of QZG cells, and expression was markedly lower in HCC-LM3 cells than that in HepG2 cells (P
