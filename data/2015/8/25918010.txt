The pleiotropic HBx oncoprotein of hepatitis B virus is well known to promote the expression of ribosomal RNAs and several host proteins that are known to support the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While overexpression of the nucleolar phosphoprotein, nucleophosmin (NPM), correlates with HCC progression, its upregulation by viral HBx and the resulting impact on perturbed nucleolar functions remain enigmatic. The present study shows that HBx up-regulates NPM levels and hijacks its functions to promote cellular proliferation. We found that HBx expression stabilizes NPM through post-translational modifications. Enhanced CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of NPM at Thr199 upon HBx expression prevented its proteolytic cleavage and provided resistance to apoptosis. Further, HBx directly interacted with the C-terminal domain of NPM and got translocated into the nucleolus where it facilitated the recruitment of RNA polymerase I transcriptional machinery onto the rDNA promoter. Our results indicate that HBx enhances rDNA transcription via a novel regulatory mechanism involving acetylation of NPM and the subsequent depletion of histones from the rDNA promoter. Enhanced production of ribosomal RNA resulting from co-expression of HBx and NPM promoted ribosome biogenesis, cellular proliferation and transformation. Taken together, our study strongly suggests an important role of NPM in mediating the oncogenic effects of HBx and the corresponding nucleolar perturbations induced by this viral oncoprotein.
