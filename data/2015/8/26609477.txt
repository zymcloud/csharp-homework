Our previous study indicates microRNA-506 (miR-506) is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the current study, we investigate the effects of miR-506 on proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC. We report that enforced expression of miR-506 inhibits proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Conversely, suppression of miR-506 exhibits promoting effects on proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and on tumor growth in vivo. In addition, miR-506 binds to the 3'UTR of F-spondin 1(SPON1), and enforced expression of miR-506 decreases accumulation of SPON1. Moreover, enforced expression of SPON1 and suppression of SPON1 alleviates effects of miR-506 mimics and inhibitors on proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, respectively. In conclusion, microRNA-506 regulates proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC by targeting SPON1.
