There is an urgent need for more potent and safer approaches to eradicate cancer stem cells (CSCs) for curing cancer. In this study, we investigate cancer-killing activity (CKA) of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells against CSCs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To visualize CSCs in vitro by fluorescence imaging, and image and quantify CSCs in tumor xenograft-bearing mice by bioluminescence imaging, HCC cells were engineered with CSC detector vector encoding GFP and luciferase controlled by Nanog promoter. We found that CIK cells have a strong CKA in vitro against putative CSCs of HCC, as shown by tumorsphere formation and time-lapse imaging. Additionally, time-lapse recording firstly revealed that putative CSCs were attacked simultaneously by many CIK cells and finally eradicated by CIK cells, indicating the necessity of achieving sufficient effector-to-target ratios. We firstly illustrated that anti-NKG2D antibody blocking partially but significantly inhibited CKA of CIK cells against putative CSCs. More importantly, intravenous infusion of CIK cells remarkably delayed tumor growth in mice with a significant decrease in putative CSC number monitored by bioluminescence imaging. Taken together, these findings demonstrate CKA of CIK cells against putative CSCs of HCC, at least in part, by NKG2D-ligands recognition.
