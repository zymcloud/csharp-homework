Aim:The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathological features, surgical management, and prognosis of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) of the pancreas.Methods:This study conducted a retrospective analysis of 97 patients who underwent surgery for a pathologically confirmed SPN in five hospitals between January 1996 and December 2014.Results:The 97 cases included 93 female and 4 male patients, and the average age was 31.2 years. The tumor was located in the body or tail (70.1%), the head (20.6%), and the neck (9.3%). All patients underwent surgical exploration, including distal pancreatectomy (63.9%), pancreaticoduodenectomy (20.6%) (partial portal vein or superior mesenteric vein resection and artificial vascular graft reconstruction performed in 4.1% of the patients), central pancreatectomy (10.3%), enucleation (5.2%), and liver resection (1.0%). 16.5% of the patients had malignant tumors. The positive rate of Ki-67 was 66.7% in patients diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm and was comparable to 8.4% of the patients diagnosed to have a benign neoplasm (p < 0.001). After a median follow-up of 70.1 months, three patients had recurrence and one patient died of liver metastasis.Conclusions:SPN is a rare neoplasm with low malignant potential. Surgical resection is warranted even in the presence of local invasion or metastases as patients demonstrate excellent long-term survival. Positive immunoreactivity for Ki-67 may predict the malignant potential and poor outcome of SPNs.
