Objective:To determine the clinical effect of Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) for residual lung metastases from breast cancer after systemic chemotherapy.Study design:An experimental study.Place and duration of study:The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China, from January 2008 to October 2014.Methodology:Thirty-five breast cancer patients with 67 pulmonary metastases were involved in this study. All lesions were treated by RFA and followed by CT-scan. Primary endpoint of this clinical study was local control; secondary endpoints were overall survival and treatment-related toxicities.Results:Complete Response (CR) was observed in 59 lesions, with Partial Response (PR) in 4 lesions, Stable Disease (SD) in 1 lesion and Progression Disease (PD) in 3 lesions. The lesion diameter > 2 cm was related to poor local control (p=0.04). The median Overall Survival (OS) was 33 months (95%CI: 21.6 - 44.4). One-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 88.6%, 59.3% and 42.8% respectively. The mumber of pulmonary metastases (â‰¥2), the diameter of lesion (> 2 cm) and coexisting with liver metastases were significantly correlated to poor OS by multivariate analysis. Log-rank test showed statistically significant difference of OS in diameter of lesion and coexisting with other metastases.Conclusion:RFA is a promising treatment option for patients with residual lung metastases from breast cancer after systemic chemotherapy in selected patients.
