Intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC) is the second most common type of primary liver cancer. However, its etiology and molecular pathogenesis remain largely unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the association between adrenomedullin (ADM) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ICC and to elucidate the underlying signaling pathway. We evaluated the clinical significance of ADM in 133 ICC patients using tissue microarray analysis of ICC tissues. We also investigated the mechanisms of ADM in ICC EMT-mediated metastasis in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines in vitro. The results revealed that ADM was upregulated in human ICC tissues (73/133) compared with that in healthy controls. ADM expression was positively correlated with shorter overall survival (P<0.01). The characteristics of EMT were induced in vitro by adenoviral transduction of ADM into HuCCT1 cells, resulting in the downregulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1, and the concomitant upregulation of N-cadherin and vimentin. Knockdown of ADM by short hairpin RNA in HUH28 cells expressing high levels of ADM was associated with the reversal of EMT. Functional studies revealed that ADM regulated the activation of ZEB1, which subsequently mediated EMT. The results of the present study suggest that ADM plays an important role in ICC metastasis, and that ADM signaling of EMT may represent a valuable therapeutic target in cancer patients.
