Background:Several recent studies have revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are stably detectable in the circulation and can be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of malignancy. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate serum miR-218 expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to analyze its potential diagnostic and prognostic value in HCC.Methods:Quantitative real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted to detect serum miR-218 expression from 156 HCC and 98 benign liver diseases (BLD) as well as 64 healthy controls. The relevance of serum miR-218 expression to the clinicopathological factors was assessed. In addition, the prediction of cutoff values of the markers was performed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate independent prognostic factors.Results:Consequently, our findings revealed that serum miR-218 levels were remarkably underexpressed in HCC patients as compared to BLD patients and healthy controls. And its low level was obviously related to tumor size (p = 0.048), tumor number (p = 0.018), vascular invasion (p = 0.039), Edmondson grade (p = 0.042), and higher TNM stage (III-IV). ROC curve analysis showed that miR-218 had a significant diagnostic accuracy, yielded an AUC (the areas under the ROC curve) of 0.734 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.68-0.789, p 5 cm) from patients with small tumors (Conclusion:Taken together, this study suggested that serum expression of miR-218 might be a potential noninvasive tumor biomarker in the diagnosis and assessment of prognosis of HCC.
