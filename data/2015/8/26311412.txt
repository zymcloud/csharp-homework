Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health issue in many countries. The prognosis of HCC is still poor due to its high recurrence rate and its resistance to chemotherapy. Retinoids have long been known to have a connection with liver diseases, including HCC. Many experimental and clinical investigations have demonstrated associations between retinoids and hepatic disease, including the loss of retinoid activity in HCC cell lines and decreased hepatic retinoid stores and altered retinoid signaling in patients with cirrhosis and HCC. Based on these findings, preclinical and clinical investigations of retinoid effects on HCC have been undertaken. Recently, clinical trial results for the use of a synthetic retinoid, acyclic retinoid (ACR), to prevent HCC recurrence were published. In addition, extensive experimental studies on the action of retinoids in liver disease, including chronic viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which lead to HCC have been performed. In the first section of this review, we will summarize the effectiveness and roles of retinoid for treating liver disease and blocking HCC. Subsequently, we will focus on ACR actions in blocking HCC.
