Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 Cell line were cultured with different concentrations of excretory/secretory proteins from Trichinella spiralis, and MTT assay was used to evaluate the cell inhibition rate. After co-cultured with 300 µg/ml excretory/secretory proteins for 24 h, the HepG2 cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope with AO and EB staining. When co-cultured with 75 µg/ml excretory/secretory proteins for 24 h, the HepG2 cells were quantified by flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI stain, and the expression of cleaved-caspase 9 was detected by immunofluorescence assay. The proliferation of HepG2 cells was inhibited significantly by excretory/secretory proteins in a dosage dependant manner. Under fluorescence microscope, some HepG2 cells presented typical apoptotic morphologic changes and the cleaved-caspase 9 protein expression was higher than that of the control. The early and late apoptotic cells and necrotic ones occupied 17.9%, 7.3%, and 6.6%, respectively.
