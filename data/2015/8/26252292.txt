Previous studies have reported the association between excess body mass index (BMI) and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, whether BMI is associated with the prognosis and postoperative complications of HCC is still not clear.We searched PubMed and Embase for relevant studies published until the date of August 30, 2014. Additional studies were manually identified by searching reference lists of retrieved articles. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for postoperative complications were calculated using random effects or fixed effects models according to heterogeneities between studies.A total of 14 studies were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that excess BMI was not significantly associated with improved OS (HR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.74-1.19, P = 0.588) or DFS (HR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.79-1.10, P = 0.382). In addition, higher BMI was not associated with increased rate of a number of complications including ascites (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 0.94-1.65, P = 0.119), bile leaks (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.81-1.83, P = 0.345), and 30-day mortality (RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.57-1.96, P = 0.871). However, HCC patients with higher BMI had increased incidence of wound infections (RR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.28-3.68, P = 0.004).BMI was not an independent prognostic factor for the evaluation of the prognosis in HCC patients, and it was not associated with postoperative complications except for wound infections that as significantly associated with higher BMI scores.
