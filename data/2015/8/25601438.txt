Purpose:The aim of the study is to retrospectively evaluate and compare the therapeutic response of Radiofrequency (RF) and Microwave (MW) ablation therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:53 consecutive patients (42 males, 11 females; mean age 59 years, range: 40-68, SD: 4.2) underwent CT-guided percutaneous RF and MW ablation of 68 HCC liver lesions. The morphologic tumor response (number, location and size) was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. The follow-up protocol was 24 h post-ablation then within 3 monthly intervals post-ablation in the first year and 6 monthly intervals thereafter.Results:Complete therapeutic response was noted in 84.4% (27/32) of lesions treated with RFA and in 88.9% (32/36) of lesions treated with MW ablation (P = 0.6). Complete response was achieved in all lesions â‰¤2.0 cm in diameter in both groups. There was no significant difference in rates of residual foci of HCC lesions between RF and MW ablation groups (P = 0.15, Log-rank test). Recurrence rate for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in patients with HCC who underwent RF ablation compared with MW ablation were 6.3%, 3.1%, 3.1% versus 0%, 5.6%, 2.8%, and 2.8%. Progression-Free Survival rates for treated patients with RF ablation of 1, 2, and 3 years were 96.9%, 93.8%, and 90.6% and treated with MW ablation therapy were 97.2%, 94.5%, and 91.7, respectively (P = 0.98).Conclusion:In conclusion, RF and MW ablation therapy showed no significant difference in the treatment of HCC regarding the complete response, rates of residual foci of untreated disease, and recurrence rate.
