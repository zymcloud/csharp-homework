Background and aim:Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) is a regulator in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to determine whether radiation-induced SHH signaling occurs in HCC and whether SHH inhibitor acts as a radiosensitizer.Methods:The in vitro effects of combining SHH ligand (recombinant human SHH) or inhibitor (cyclopamine) with irradiation were evaluated in the human HCC cell lines, Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5, and murine cell line BNL. Cell survival and apoptosis were measured using a colony formation assay, annexin-V staining, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect protein expression. The in vivo response to radiotherapy and/or cyclopamine was tested in BALB/c mice bearing an orthotopic allogeneic tumor.Results:Treatment of HCC cells with irradiation and SHH ligand had a protective effect on clonogenic cell survival. Treatment with irradiation and cyclopamine was a more potent inhibitor of cell proliferation than either modality alone. The antiproliferative activity of cyclopamine was attributable to apoptosis induction. Radiation dose-dependently upregulated the expression of Gli-1 (a transcription factor induced by SHH), and this effect was observed mainly in the nucleus. When combined with cyclopamine, irradiation inhibited Gli-1 and increased DNA double-strand breakage. Radiotherapy increased SHH and Gli-1 expression in allogeneic tumor. When compared with radiotherapy alone, cyclopamine with radiotherapy reduced the mean tumor size of orthotopic tumors by 67% (P Conclusion:Combining an SHH inhibitor with radiotherapy may enhance HCC cell and orthotopic tumor radiosensitivity.
