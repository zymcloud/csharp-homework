We compared the benefits of sorafenib with that of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (ad-HCC) refractory to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). We evaluated the patient characteristics, the median survival time (MST), and the prognostic factors in 17 patients in the sorafenib group and in 26 patients in the HAIC group. No significant difference was observed in the patient characteristics between the groups. The MST in the sorafenib group and HAIC group was 483 days and 284 days, respectively. A significantly longer survival time was noted in the sorafenib group (p=0.033). The prognostic factors were sorafenib therapy in all 43 patients(hazard ratio: 3.32 [95% CI: 1.36-8.10], p=0.008) and the longer treatment period of sorafenib in the sorafenib group(hazard ratio: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.984- 0.999], p=0.009). When compared with HAIC, sorafenib showed favorable treatment results in patients with ad-HCC refractory to TACE.
