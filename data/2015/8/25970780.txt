B cell CLL/lymphoma 6 member B (BCL6B) is expressed in many normal tissues but expressed at very low levels in cancer tissues. It was reported that BCL6B inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases, but the exact role of BCL6B in HCC remains to be investigated. BCL6B expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissues compared with paired non-cancer tissues. Low BCL6B expression in tumors was correlated with shorter overall survival in patients, and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that BCL6B expression was an independent prognostic factor for human HCC patients. Moreover, a positive correlation between BCL6B expression and hepatic cirrhosis was found in an analysis of HCC clinicopathological characteristics. BCL6B expression was increased in rat fibrotic liver samples in response to liver injury. BCL6B transgenic rats were less susceptible to hepatocellular damage, inflammation and fibrosis. In vitro studies demonstrated that BCL6B inhibited the activation of hepatic stellate cells though upregulation of hepatocyte growth factor. In addition, transcriptomic microarray analysis was performed to explore the mechanisms in which BCL6B confers protection from tumorigenesis. In conclusion, BCL6B plays a pivotal role as a prognostic biomarker for HCC, and the restoration of BCL6B may be a novel strategy as an anti-fibrogenic therapy for human HCC.
