Morbidity and mortality from tuberculosis (TB) are high in Taiwan. We conducted a nationwide population-based matched cohort study using data retrieved from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to determine the impact of TB after liver transplantation (LT). During 2000-2011, we identified 3202 liver transplant recipients and selected subjects from the general population matched for age, sex, and comorbidities on the same index date of recognition of LT with a 1:10 ratio. The data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. Compared to the matched cohort, liver transplant patients had a higher risk for TB (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.65-3.05, p < 0.001), and those with TB showed higher mortality (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.30-3.97, p = 0.004). Old age (HR 2.64, 95% CI 1.25-5.54, p = 0.011) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORis) (HR 3.09, 95% CI 1.68-5.69, p < 0.001) were significant risk factors for TB in LT; mTORis were also associated with mortality after adjusting for confounders (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.73-2.62, p < 0.001). Therefore, regular surveillance of TB and treatment of latent TB infection in high-risk patients after LT are important, especially in TB-endemic areas.
