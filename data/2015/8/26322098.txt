Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of malignancy with high incidence and poor prognosis. Brucea javanica is extracted from Simaroubaceae plants. It is found to have low toxicity but high anti-cancer efficiency. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of Brucea javanica oil-loaded liposomes (BJOL) on human hepatocellular cancer cell line HepG2. The related molecular mechanisms were determined.Material and methods:Morphologic changes of HepG2 cells were observed by transmission electron microscope after treatment with BJOL in vitro. Cell proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay after cell treatment with different doses of BJOL. Flow cytometry was performed. Nude mice were divided into 4 groups randomly and treated with different doses of BJOL. The apoptosis hepatocellular carcinoma was detected by TUNEL.Results:Proliferation of HepG2 was inhibited significantly by BJOL in a dose-dependent manner (2.5 mg/l or 5 mg/l). Compared with the animal models treated with the negative control, the animal models in the BJOL group had higher weight and lower metastasis rates (p Conclusions:Brucea javanica oil-loaded liposomes inhibits proliferation of HepG2. The effect appears to be dose-dependent, possibly by inducing apoptosis of cancer cells.
