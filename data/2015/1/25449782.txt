MicroRNAs are increasingly recognized as playing important roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis. Here we identified an essential role for miR-362-5p in the regulation of HCC development. We found that miR-362-5p was significantly up-regulated in HCCs and associated with HCC progression. Inhibition of miR-362-5p in HCC cells dramatically decreased cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration and invasion in vitro as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We subsequently identified that CYLD was a target gene of miR-362-5p. Furthermore, knockdown of CYLD expression partially counteracted the tumor suppressive effects of miR-362-5p inhibitors. Finally, we have shown that miR-362-5p acts through CYLD to activate the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, which contributes to HCC progression. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-362-5p belongs to a new class of oncomiR that regulates HCC cell aggressiveness, thus providing new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC development. This study also suggests that miR-362-5p may serve as a novel therapeutic target for miRNA based HCC therapy.
