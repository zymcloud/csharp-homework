Pharmacokinetics and dose-finding studies on sorafenib were conducted on heterogeneous groups of patients with solid tumors. Portal hypertension, gut motility impairment and altered bile enterohepatic circulation may explain different sorafenib toxicological profile in cirrhotic patients. This study evaluated sorafenib plasma concentration in a homogeneous group of cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography in 12 consecutive patients. Data have been evaluated by the generalized estimating equations method (p value statistical level was set at Î± = 0.05). (1) There were not significant differences between sorafenib concentrations in patients who tolerate the full dose versus patients with reduced dose due to toxicity; (2) the average sorafenib concentrations measured 3 h after the morning dosing were lower than those measured 12 h after the evening dosing (p = 0.005); (3) sorafenib concentrations decrease overtime (p
