Malignant tumors are the most serious threat to human health. Much research has focused on revealing the characteristics of this disease and developing methods of treatment. Because tumor cells are more sensitive to heat than normal cells, thermotherapy for the treatment of tumors has attracted much attention. In this paper, we presented functional Mn-Zn ferrite nanoparticles with the molecular composition of Mn0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 as the magnetic response material for the thermotherapy. The suggested Mn-Zn ferrite nanoparticles were with a self-regulation temperature of 43 degrees C which was ideal for tumor thermotherapy. The biocompatibility and anti-tumor effect of this material were well investigated. It was found that the Mn0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 nanoparticles have no hemolysis activity, no genotoxic effects and cytotoxicity. Its Median Lethal Dose (LD50) arrived at 6.026 g/kg and it did not induce any abnormal clinical signs in laboratory animals. Moreover, the suggested nanoparticles can increase the inhibitory ratio of weight and volume of tumors, cause tumor tissues necrosis and show the therapeutic effect on the xenograft live cancers in vivo. Based on these results, we could envision the valuable application of the Mn0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 nanoparticles for the practical thermotherapy.
