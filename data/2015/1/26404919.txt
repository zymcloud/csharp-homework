The present study is aimed at evaluating the antineoplastic activity of N[(2-hydroxybenzylidene)2'-hydroxyphenylimine] aqua nickel(II) complex abbreviated as [Ni(H2O)HHP] complex against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells in Swiss albino mice. The effectiveness of the drug at doses of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg body weight was assessed for five consecutive days in previously inoculated tumor (137Ã—10(4) EAC) cells containing mice. After administration of the last dose followed by 16 h fasting, the effect of the [Ni(H2O)HHP] complex on tumor was assessed by EAC cell growth inhibition, solid tumor mass, survival time, peritoneal cell count, hematological profiles like red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), haemoglobin (Hb)% and differential counts (i.e., lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes) and biochemical parameters like serum glucose, total cholesterol, total protein, serum urea and liver enzymes, respectively. The results have been compared with the data obtained by using a standard and highly effective clinically used anticancer drug bleomycin. [Ni(H2O)HHP] complex at dose 2.0 mg/kg i.p. (intra peritoneal) showed a significant (P=0.001) decrease in tumor volume of each mice and increased the life span as well as mean survival time of EAC bearing mice. Hematological and biochemical parameters of EAC bearing mice get back normal values after 15 days of the initial treatment. From the above outcomes indicate the possible potential use of the compound as antitumor agent in advanced researches.
