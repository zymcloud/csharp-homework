Nintedanib (Ofev(Â®)) is an orally available, small, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cancer. Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF. Nintedanib has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of IPF, and for the second-line treatment in combination with docetaxel of locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma tumour histology. Phase 3 development programmes are also underway for colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer. Phase 2 investigation is being conducted for a variety of other solid tumours, including hepatocellular carcinoma, mesothelioma, prostate cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of nintedanib leading to this first approval for IPF.
