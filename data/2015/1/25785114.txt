Aims:Early onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (males and females under the age of 40 or 50 years old, respectively) has a significant prevalence and poor prognosis; however, few studies have reported the risk factors and development of HCC in such cases.Methods:In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical, laboratory and demographic data from 588 treatment-na√Øve HCC patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver cirrhosis (LC) and 708 age-matched HBV-associated LC patients as control in Beijing 302 Hospital.Results:15.1% (89/588) of the HCC patients and 36.7% (181/708) of the LC patients were classified as early onset. Compared with age-matched LC controls, male gender (odds ratio (OR) = 2.09, P 200 ng/ml (OR = 30.8, P 200 ng/ml (OR = 12.0, P 200 ng/ml is associated with HCC development across all ages, whereas a family history of HBV infection may identify younger HBV-associated LC patients at risk for HCC.Conclusion:Our data suggest that a family history of HBV infection is a unique risk factor for naturally-occurring early-onset HCC patients with HBV-associated LC, who should be considered for intensive screening programs.
