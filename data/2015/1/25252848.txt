Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), a calcium-binding matricellular glycoprotein, is implicated in the progression of many cancers. Currently, there is growing evidence for important functions of SPARC in a variety of cancers and its role in cancer depends on tumor types. In this study, we reported SPARC negatively regulated glucose metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of SPARC inhibited glucose uptake and lactate product through downregulation of key enzymes of glucose metabolism. On the other hand, knock down of SPARC reversed the phenotypes. Meanwhile, exogenous expression of SPARC in HepG2 cells resulted in tolerance to low glucose and was correlated with AMPK pathway. Interestingly, the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant HepG2 cells showed increased glucose metabolism and downregulated SPARC levels. Finally, we reported the overexpression of SPARC re-sensitize 5-FU-resistant cells to 5-FU through inhibition of glycolysis both in vitro and in vivo. Our study proposed a novel function of SPARC in the regulation of glucose metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma and will facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatments of liver tumor patients.
