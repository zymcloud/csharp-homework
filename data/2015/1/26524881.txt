The degree of liver fibrosis progression is an important factor in hepatocarcinogenesis, and monitoring liver fibrosis is important for predicting and preventing hepatocellular carcinoma. It is proportional to the appearance of a new hepatitis C therapy, or the expectation of liver fibrosis therapy, and liver fibrosis research is attracting attention. Although the Gold Standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis is liver biopsy, various problems, such as in the difficulty of invasive and frequent measurement, exist. The present non-invasive examination methods for the assessment of liver fibrosis also have a problem in the fields of organ specificity and diagnostic performance. Using a fully automated immunoassay system "HISCL", an assay system based on the lectin bound sugar reaction which is not an antigen-bound antibody reaction was developed. Measurements using the fully automated immunoassay system "HISCL" series and HISCL M2BPGi assay kit facilitated rapid assay (17 minutes) with a small sample volume (10 Î¼L). Serum M2BPGi values can be used in various ways, such as for assessment of the risk and treatment associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, reflecting the liver fibrosis stage. Furthermore, many studies are currently in progress. The development of a new assay system for the detection of a cancer production sugar chain marker is expected in the future owing to the advent of a lectin-bound sugar chain reaction system.
