In this study, we aimed to determine whether the pseudogene integrator complex subunit 6 pseudogene 1 (INTS6P1) in plasma could be used as a novel approach to screen for and detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We explored the clinical role of INTS6P1: First, the expression level of INTS6P1 was measured in a cohort of 33 HCC tissue samples and adjacent normal liver tissue, next, the INTS6P1 expression was detected in the culture medium and tumor cells in a cellular experiment, and last, the diagnostic performance of INTS6P1 was examined in an independent cohort of 100 people. The expression level of INTS6P1 was remarkably downregulated in the HCC tissues compared with that in the normal liver tissues (p = 0.0066). In plasma, the INTS6P1 levels were significantly decreased in HCC patients compared with non-HCC patients (p
