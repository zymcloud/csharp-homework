We aimed to investigate the enhancement patterns of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with SonoVue and determine the utility of this method for differential diagnosis between hepatic inflammatory lesions with arterial phase enhancement and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Twenty-three patients with arterial-enhanced inflammatory liver lesions and 46 HCC patients were included. These lesions had been subjected to CEUS examination and confirmed by pathologic results or imaging follow-up for at least 1 y. In the arterial phase of CEUS, 65.2% of the inflammatory lesions showed patchy (slight enhancement with poorly defined margins) or centripetal enhancement, whereas 89.1% of the HCC lesions showed homogeneous or heterogeneous enhancement (p
