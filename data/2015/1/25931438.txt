Objective:To investigate the financial burden of patients who had various stages of hepatitis B virus-related diseases and the level of alleviation from financial burden by health insurance schemes in Yunnan province of China.Study design:A cross-sectional survey.Methods:Patients' information was consecutively recorded at the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, from December 2012 to June 2013. Consecutive cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (520), compensated cirrhosis (91), decompensated cirrhosis (198) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (131) were recruited from the outpatient and inpatient departments. The total direct costs, hospital charge, outpatient costs, hospitalization fees being reimbursed and household catastrophic health expenditure were estimated for each disease group.Results:The average annual direct costs for each disease group were 19,496 RMB for HBV, 28,466 RMB in compensated cirrhosis, 46,061 RMB for decompensated cirrhosis, and 33,044 RMB for HCC patients. Catastrophic health expenditure occurred in all four groups. Health insurance reimbursement released the financial burden incurred by medical expenses of patients under a high level of household economic status. Public health insurance schemes helped the patients to various extents.Conclusions:Among these patient groups, direct costs represent a significant economic burden. Health expenditure and financing systems must be considered to prevent the increase of household catastrophe, particularly among the poor.
