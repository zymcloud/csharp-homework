Background:The efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinomas still poor due to multidrug resistance. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the over-expressed mitochondrial human telomerase reverse transcriptase on multidrug resistance of hepatocellular carcinomas.Methods:HepG2 and SK-Hep1 cell lines were used. And sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs was detected.Results:Mitochondrial human telomerase reverse transcriptase over-expression in hepatocellular carcinomas cells could significantly reduce its sensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro and in vivo. Hepatocellular carcinomas cells over-expressing mitochondrial human telomerase reverse transcriptase showed a significantly higher mitochondrial membrane potential, a markedly lower activated caspase-3 after drug treatment, and an increased mtDNA copy number, which explained the drastically decreased drug-induced apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinomas cells with mitochondrial human telomerase reverse transcriptase over-expression.Conclusion:Over-expressed mitochondrial human telomerase reverse transcriptase may increase the mtDNA copy number and inhibit the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway to contribute to the multidrug resistance of hepatocellular carcinomas cells.
