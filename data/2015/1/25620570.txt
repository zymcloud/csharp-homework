Damnacanthal, an anthraquinone present in noni plants, targets several tyrosine kinases and has antitumoral effects. This study aims at getting additional insight on the potential of damnacanthal as a natural antitumor compound. The direct effect of damnacanthal on c-Met was tested by in vitro activity assays. Additionally, Western blots of c-Met phosphorylation in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep G2 cells were performed. The antitumor effects of damnacanthal were tested by using cell growth, soft agar clonogenic, migration and invasion assays. Their mechanisms were studied by Western blot, and cell cycle, apoptosis and zymographic assays. Results show that damnacanthal targets c-Met both in vitro and in cell culture. On the other hand, damnacanthal also decreases the phosphorylation levels of Akt and targets matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion in Hep G2 cells. These molecular effects are accompanied by inhibition of the growth and clonogenic potential of Hep G2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, as well as induction of Hep G2 apoptosis. Since c-Met has been identified as a new potential therapeutical target for personalized treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, damnacanthal and noni extract supplements containing it could be potentially interesting for the treatment and/or chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma through its inhibitory effects on the HGF/c-Met axis.
