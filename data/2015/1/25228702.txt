Complications of cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) are increasing, and liver transplantation (LT) is the most effective treatment for those with liver decompensation or small hepatocellular carcinoma. However, for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, barriers to LT exist. This is related to the poorer survival rates post-LT (55% at 5 years) and, up until this year, the limited options for treating those coinfected LT recipients with progressive recurrent HCV disease, the commonest reason for reduced survival. The newly approved antiviral therapies sofosbuvir and simeprevir, with significantly improved efficacy and markedly better safety and tolerability in HIV and transplant patients, offer the opportunity to transform the outcomes of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with liver complications. Additional new therapies, anticipated within the year, are expected to further simplify the management of coinfected patients in the transplant setting.
