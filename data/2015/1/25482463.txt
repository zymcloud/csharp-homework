Background:The benefits of anatomic resection in patients with small (Methods:Factors affecting overall survival and disease-free survival were investigated in 330 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for solitary (≤5 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas without macroscopic vascular invasion. In addition, a propensity score matching model with 330 patients was constructed to overcome bias, with subgroups analyzed by tumor diameter (Results:ICG-R15 ≥25% was confirmed as being independently associated with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. One-to-one matching of preoperative characteristics yielded 72 pairs of patients receiving anatomic resection and nonanatomic resection, with long-term outcomes, including overall survival and disease-free survival, being similar in these 2 groups. Subgroup analysis showed that, in patients with tumors Conclusion:Anatomic resection was not superior to nonanatomic resection in survival outcomes in patients with solitary small hepatocellular carcinomas without macroscopic vascular invasion. Rather, postoperative short-term outcomes were more favorable with nonanatomic resection.
