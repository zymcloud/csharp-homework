Objective:To investigate the expressions of miR-143 and miR-145 in gastric cancer tissues and their biological functions.Methods:A set of gastric cancer metastasis-related miRNAs was screened by comparing the miRNA profiles between the primary gastric cancer and matched liver metastasis. Among these miRNAs, expressions of miR-143 and miR-145 were further validated. The influence on metastasis was analyzed by transwell assay.Results:Expressions of miR-143 and miR-145 down-regulated significantly in gastric cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues(miR-143, 0.028±0.005 vs. 0.052±0.014, P=0.058; miR-145, 0.922±0.135 vs. 1.722±0.285, P=0.007), and decreased significantly in the metastatic lesion compared with the primary lesion(miR-143, 0.059±0.025 vs. 0.182±0.045, P=0.021; miR-145, 0.164±0.076 vs. 0.594±0.283, P=0.042). Expressions of miR-143 and miR-145 were significantly correlated(r=0.400, P=0.000), and they synergistically inhibited gastric cancer cell migration.Conclusion:miR-143 and miR-145 may take part in the progression of gastric cancer metastasis, and they may have synergetic effects.
