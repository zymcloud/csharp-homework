Girdin has been proven to play a vital role in the process of proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion in various cancer cells, yet the underlying molecular mechanism in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been clarified. Thereafter, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of Girdin in 40 primary HCC tissues and 30 matched adjacent tissues using hepatic carcinoma tissue microarray. Our data showed that the positive expression rate of Girdin in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was 67.5%, higher than that found in adjacent tissues of 16.7% (P
