Background:Limited knowledge about the molecular mechanism of avian influenza H9N2 virus pathogenicity in birds as well as human hosts has limited the development of effective control against the disease. To overcome this issue detailed understanding of the infectious characteristics of the virus in host cells should be obtained.Objectives:In this study we examined the replication kinetics of H9N2 virus in a chicken hepatoma cell line to obtain insight into the pathogenesis of H9N2 viruses.Materials and methods:The kinetic replication of H9N2 influenza virus in chicken hepatoma and fibroblastic cells was studied in the presence and absence of supplemental trypsin. High viral titers observed in liver cells in a short time correlated with the degree of cytopathic effects. To determine whether the ultimate outcome of infection results in programmed cell death, the infected cells were observed by the cell viability assay, DNA fragmentation, caspase cascade activation, and quantified lactate dehydrogenase release.Results:The degree of viability was significantly reduced in infected hepatoma cells. Observations of caspase activation and cell DNA laddering in infected cells were not indicative of apoptosis. The infected hepatoma cells released lactate dehydrogenase, which is consistent with cell death by necrosis.Conclusions:Taken together, these data reveal that cellular protease of chicken liver cells allows the replication of high yields of H9N2 virus in the absence of trypsin and also cell death in the infected cells is due to necrosis.
