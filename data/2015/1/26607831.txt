Background:A temporary stoma is often created to protect a distal anastomosis in colorectal surgery. Short-chain fatty acids, mainly butyrate, are the major fuel source for the epithelium and their absence in the diverted tract may produce mucosal atrophy and inflammation.Aims:To investigate whether the administration of sodium butyrate enemas (Naburen(Â©), Promefarm, Italy) could prevent mucosal inflammation and atrophy and affect gene expression profiles after ileo/colostomy.Methods:We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, in patients with enterostomy performed for inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer or diverticulitis. Twenty patients were randomly allocated to receive 30ml of sodium butyrate 600mmol/L (group A) or saline (group B), b.i.d. for 30 days.Results:In group A endoscopic scores were significantly improved (p<0.01) while mucosal atrophy was reduced or unchanged; in group B mucosal atrophy was increased in 42.8% of patients. Despite the high dose of butyrate used, no short-chain fatty acids were detectable by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in colorectal biopsies. Group A patients showed up-regulation of genes associated with mucosal repair such as Wnt signalling, cytoskeleton regulation and bone morphogenetic protein-antagonists.Conclusion:Butyrate enemas may prevent the atrophy of the diverted colon/rectum, thus improving the recovery of tissue integrity.
