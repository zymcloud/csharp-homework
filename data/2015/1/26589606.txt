The study aimed to explore the correlation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation with tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan. Patients diagnosed with NSCLC who underwent EGFR mutation status testing and PET/CT or PET/CT plus brain magnetic resonance imaging scan at initial diagnosis in Nanfang Hospital between July 2010 and June 2014 were consecutively enrolled. The correlation of EGFR mutation status with TNM stage and distant metastasis organs including brain, bone, liver, pleural, adrenals and contralateral lobe of lung were analyzed. A total of 401 patients were enrolled. Tumor size in EGFR mutation group was significantly smaller than the wild-type group (P < 0.001). Further, patients with EGFR mutations were demonstrated significantly more frequent in patients with distant metastasis than non-metastasis (45.7 vs 32.2 %, P = 0.007). The rates of bone (32.2 vs 22.8 %, P = 0.007) and brain (16.3 vs 9.4 %, P = 0.008) metastasis were significantly higher in EGFR mutation group than the wild-type group. In the subgroup of 199 metastatic NSCLC patients, patients with EGFR mutation were significantly associated with a smaller tumor size (P = 0.013) and earlier N stage (P = 0.033). Of note, compared with the EGFR wild-type group, patients had a higher likelihood of developing brain plus bone metastases at initial diagnosis of EGFR mutation group (20.9 vs 7.5 %, P = 0.018). Taken together, we identify that EGFR mutations might associate with more aggressive tumor progression than the wild types in NSCLC. In addition, patients with tumor having EGFR mutation had a smaller tumor size than without mutation.
