To investigate the association between preoperative HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) level and risk of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) recurrence following curative resection, we enrolled 826 HBV-related HCC patients who underwent curative resection and received long-term follow-up at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (Shanghai, China). Multivariate analyses showed that serum HBsAg ≥ 2000 S/CO, seropositive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase > 61 U/L, prothrombin time > 13 s, multinodularity, lager tumor size, and major portal vein invasion were independently associated with a increased risk of HCC recurrence. Compared with HCC patients with HBsAg level
Hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatocellular carcinoma; recurrence.
