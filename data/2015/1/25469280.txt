Pioglitazone is an insulin sensitizer used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM). DM with insulin resistance is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We aimed to investigate the effects of pioglitazone on HCC recurrence following treatment in HCV-infected patients. Between 2009 and 2011, 85 HCV-infected HCC patients who underwent curative treatment were enrolled in this prospective study. Among 45 patients with type 2 DM, 27 were administered pioglitazone (pioglitazone group) following treatment. The remaining 58 patients were assigned to the control group. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival. Changes in insulin resistance and serum adiponectin levels resulting from pioglitazone treatment were also assessed. In the whole analysis (n=85), no significant difference in recurrence-free survival was observed between the pioglitazone and control groups. However, in a spline model analysis of DM patients, a decreased risk of HCC recurrence was associated with increased body weight in patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥23; this association became significant at BMI ≥24 (hazard ratio=0.17; 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.95). In addition, significantly decreased homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance values (P=0.002) and significantly increased serum high-molecular-weight adiponectin levels (P
