Background:Gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has an important role in preoperative evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, no studies have prospectively performed intraindividual comparison of gadoxetic acid-enhanced 3T MRI and multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) with histopathological examination for the detection of HCCs. We prospectively compared the efficacies of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and multiphasic contrast-enhanced MDCT with that of histopathological examination, used as a reference standard, for the detection of HCC in surgical candidates.Methods:The study was approved by the institutional review boards at each of four centers. Patients scheduled to undergo multiphasic CT, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, and liver surgery were prospectively included in this study. The diagnostic abilities of MRI and CT were evaluated and compared on the basis of sensitivity and positive predictive value for detection of and differentiation between HCCs and benign lesions.Results:Fifty-four patients with 83 histopathologically confirmed HCCs were included in the study. Combined interpretation of the dynamic and hepatobiliary phases of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI showed statistically higher sensitivity for lesion detection (83 %) than did interpretation of multiphasic MDCT images (70 %; p Conclusions:The sensitivity for preoperative detection of HCCs was higher for gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI than for multiphasic MDCT imaging.
