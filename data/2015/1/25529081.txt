Eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, at least in compensated patients, can help improve the outcomes of liver disease such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver transplantation, as well as perhaps extra-hepatic complications such as diabetes and cardiovascular risk. In the past few years, the landscape of antiviral therapy has evolved at a breathtaking pace from pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) (PEG-IFN/RBV) to IFN-based strategies combining direct acting antivirals (DDAs) with PEG-IFN/RBV and finally IFN-free combinations of DAAs. In particular with these most recent developments, treatment regimens have become shorter, safer and even more effective, with a wide range of indications. Nevertheless, research continues and newer antiviral drugs are still under development. At a point when a >90% sustained virological response (SVR) is being claimed with all new available regimens, pharmacological and clinical research should be addressing unresolved areas, such as cases of suboptimal SVR or to increase effectiveness rather than pursuing the development of new 'me-too' drugs. The issues which should be given priority for further development include the following: Improving the results of IFN-free regimens in patients with genotype 3 (HCV-3) infection. Identifying the indications for the treatment in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. Identifying standardized or personalized backup strategies in patients who do not respond to IFN-free regimens. Finally, because of financial constraints, the high cost of IFN-free strategies prevents their universal use in CHC patients and coverage by national healthcare systems. Thus, efforts must be made to document cost-effectiveness in all clinical scenarios and to develop more affordable IFN-free regimens.
