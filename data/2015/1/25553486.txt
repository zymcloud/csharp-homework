Aspartyl-(asparaginyl)-β-hydroxylase (AAH) is a member of the α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family that catalyzes the hydroxylation of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of protein. In human tumorous cell lines from main systems of body, including tumor cells of kidney, throat, breast, liver, bladder, cervical and ovary, the AAH can be detected at both the transcriptional level and the translational level, and moreover, the AAH expression is usually increased, which is associated with the development and progression of carcinomas. Thus, AAH may play an important role in different carcinomas and may be a potential hub in carcinogenesis. In this review, we will discuss the role of AAH in carcinomas, focusing on liver cancers and other digestive tumors, lung cancers, and tumors of nervous system.
