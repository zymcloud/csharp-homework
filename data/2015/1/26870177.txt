The aim of the present study was to detect the expression levels of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and investigate its significance in the incidence and development of the cancer. HCC tissues and corresponding para-carcinoma liver tissues were surgically collected from 78 patients with HCC who presented to Shandong Provincial Hospital (Jinan, Shandong, China). hTERT expression at the protein and mRNA levels were detected by immunohistochemistry (streptavidin peroxidase method) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively, in the HCC tissues and corresponding para-carcinoma liver tissues of 78 HCC patients and in 12 samples of normal liver tissue. The data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 statistical software, and employing χ2 tests and t-tests. hTERT protein was mainly expressed in the HCC cell cytoplasm, but was occasionally observed in the cell nucleus. The positive rates of hTERT protein and mRNA expression in the HCC patients were 84.62% (66/78) and 78.21% (61/78), respectively, which was significantly higher compared with the rates of 10.26% (8/78) and 8.97% (7/78) in the paired para-carcinoma liver tissues (P<0.01). hTERT protein and mRNA were not expressed in the normal liver tissues (0/12). χ2 test and t-test analysis revealed that hTERT gene expression was correlated with tumor grade, the presence/absence of a portal vein tumor thrombus, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and a high α-fetoprotein level (P<0.05) rather than patient age, gender or tumor size. Expression of the hTERT gene may play a pivotal role in the incidence and development of HCC. The hTERT gene potentially serves as an important molecular and biological index for diagnosing and predicating the biological behavior of HCC.
