The aim of present investigation is to explore the molecular mechanisms of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) induced by hypoxia. Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were treated with CoCl2, and the VM-related parameters were assayed by real-time qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Matrigel tube structure was also detected. We demonstrated that the expression of pMEK, MEK, pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 had a positive correlation with VM induced by hypoxia in MHCC97H while HepG2 signified VM under normoxia condition. PD98059 was negatively while epidermal growth factor positively participated in the increased tubes and area of VM. At the meaning time, the increased VM-related genes VE-cadherin, MMP2, MMP9, EphA2 and LAMC2 in hypoxia group were down-regulated by PD98059 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we elucidated that PKA, but not PKC, mediated the MEK/ERK pathway in a negative manner in VM. In conclusion, MEK/ERK pathway is positively involved in VM in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, which was mediated by PKA negatively.
