Objective:To analyze the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in hepatocyte apoptosis induced by oxidative stress.Methods:Human HL-7702 hepatoma cells were induced by H₂O₂/antimycin A to establish oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis models. SB216763, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β, was given to the cells two hours before H₂O₂/antimycin A induction. Cell survival was observed using calcein acetoxymethyl ester/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, and cell apoptosis was detected using annexin V-FITC/PI staining combined with flow cytometry. In the meanwhile, the cell culture supernatant was subjected to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay to evaluate the extent of cell death. The expressions of p-GSK3β, GSK3β, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and cytochrome C (CytC) proteins were examined using Western blotting.Results:Oxidative stress triggered by H₂O₂/antimycin A promoted GSK3β activity; inhibition of GSK3β activity by SB216763 relieved oxidative stress and reduced cell apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. Compared with the model groups, SB216763 intervened group showed that the cell apoptosis rate and the level of LDH were reduced significantly, and that the expressions of cleaved caspase-3, JNK, CytC proteins decreased.Conclusion:GSK3β is an important signaling molecule in the apoptosis pathway induced by oxidative stress. The inhibition on GSK3β may alleviate the oxidative stress-induced hepatocyte apoptosis.
