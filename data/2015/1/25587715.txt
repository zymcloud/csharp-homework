Background:Available evidence has demonstrated that osteocalcin may play a role in pathogenesis of cancer, and mutation of the osteocalcin gene may be involved in the cancer development. The aim of this study is to determine whether osteocalcin gene polymorphisms are associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among Chinese population.Methods:A total of 515 subjects were divided into four groups: 129 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 62 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), 154 patients with HBV-related HCC, and 170 healthy controls. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism strategy was used to detect osteocalcin gene rs1800247 and rs1543297 polymorphisms.Results:Compared with healthy controls, the rs1800247 HH and Hh genotypes were associated with a significantly increased susceptibility to HCC (HH versus hh: OR = 6.828, 95% CI 2.620-17.795, P Conclusions:These findings for the first time suggest that genetic variant in osteocalcin gene rs1800247 polymorphisms may be a risk factor for HBV-related HCC. We also find an inverse association of serum osteocalcin levels with HCC.
