MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large class of short RNAs (e.g., 20-24 nucleotides in length), whose main function is to posttranscriptionally regulate the expression of protein-coding genes. Their importance in tumorigenesis has been demonstrated over the past decade, and correspondingly, they have emerged as potential therapeutic molecules and targets. Liver cancer is one of the most common neoplastic diseases worldwide, and it currently has a poor prognosis owing to largely ineffective therapeutic options. Liver cancer is also an excellent model for testing miRNA-based therapy approaches as it can be easily targeted with the systemic delivery of oligonucleotides. In recent years, the role of miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been established with molecular studies and the development of animal models. These studies have also provided the basis for evaluating the therapeutic potential of miRNAs, or anti-miRNAs. In general, the safety of miRNAs has been proven and antitumor activity has been observed. Moreover, because of the absence or presence of mild side effects, the prophylactic use of miRNA-based approaches may be foreseen.
