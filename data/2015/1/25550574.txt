Background:Salvage-line regorafenib monotherapy exhibited a marked survival benefit for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the toxicity of this regimen has resulted in the clinical use of a reduced dose of regorafenib.Patients and methods:Thirty-two Japanese mCRC patients (median age=61 years) who had been treated with regorafenib were retrospectively examined.Results:Best objective response rate was 0% and stable disease (SD) was 31%. Median progression-free survival was 81 days and median overall survival was 233 days. Adverse events of any grade were observed in all patients: 17 (53%) patients suffered grade 3 or 4 adverse events including fatigue (13%), anorexia (13%), hand-foot skin reaction (22%) and elevations of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (19%/16%). One patient with grade 5 liver dysfunction was identified (3%). Twenty-nine (91%) patients required treatment dose reduction or a delay in treatment. The relative dose intensity was 59%. Regorafenib treatments were terminated because of disease progression (59%) or adverse events (34%).Conclusion:Despite a decrease in the intensity of regorafenib treatment, because of severe adverse events, a fairly favorable efficacy was achieved in Japanese patients.
