Background:The effect of antiviral therapy on the post-hepatectomy long-term survival in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncertain.Aim:To evaluate the effect of antiviral therapy on post-hepatectomy survival and recurrence in patients with HBV-related HCC.Methods:This was a prospective-retrospective study of a total of 404 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HBV-related HCC in a tertiary academic hospital. Data on patient and tumour characteristics, tumour recurrence, treatment for recurrence and survival were compared between antiviral and no antiviral groups.Results:Patient's and tumour characteristics were comparable between the two groups, except a higher proportion of patients with cirrhosis in the antiviral group. With a mean follow-up time of 52.4 months, antiviral group had a better 5-year overall survival (66.7% vs. 56.0%, P = 0.001) while there was no significant difference in the 5-year disease-free survival (44.7% vs. 38.1%, P = 0.166). Use of antiviral therapy was associated with better liver function reserve at the time of recurrence and a greater proportion of patients could receive curative treatment for recurrence (38.5% vs. 24.3%, P = 0.041). There was no significant different in the hazard ratios of patients who started antiviral therapy before or after operation (P = 0.054).Conclusions:Use of antiviral therapy improves the long-term post-hepatectomy survival in patients with HBV-related HCC. With a better liver function reserve at the time of recurrence, a greater proportion of patients in antiviral group could receive curative treatment for recurrence.
