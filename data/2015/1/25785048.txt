Objectives:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that have been increasingly shown important roles in various classes of cancers. However, miR-1269 has not been comprehensively studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the relationship between the expression of miR-1269 and clinicopathological parameters in HCC patients, and to predict its potential target genes.Methods:Total RNA was extracted from 95 pairs of HCC and matching adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The level of miR-1269 expression was detected by using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and calculated with the 2(-ΔCq) method. Eighteen online biological databases were used for targets prediction.Results:MiR-1269 expression was up-regulated in HCC tissues (1.9264±0.7160) compared to their non-tumor livers (1.5518±0.7273, P Conclusions:MiR-1269 may be possibly involved in the tumorigenesis and progress of HCC. MiR-1269 could also act as a potential biomarker for the prognosis prediction for HCC.
