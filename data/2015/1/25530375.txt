Objective:To evaluate the long-term results of patients surgically treated for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) with a unique pancreatic secondary localization to assess the importance of radical treatment in this rare group of patients.Patients and methods:This is a retrospective monocentric study including 20 surgically treated patients between 1997 and 2012 for a unique pancreatic metastasis of a CCRCC. The main objective was to evaluate the outcome after surgical resection.Results:Twenty patients were followed up for a CCRCC. The M/F ratio was 1.2. The average age of onset of kidney cancer was 57.05 ± 7.78 years. Two patients who had synchronous pancreatic metastasis and 18 patients who had metachronous metastasis appeared after an average of 130 ± 59 months (24-240 months). The average size of the metastases was 20 ± 11.6 mm. Pancreatic metastasis was unique in all patients, with 35% of patients having multiple lesions of the pancreas. All patients underwent a pancreatic resection of metastasis. Histologic examination confirmed the location of a secondary CCRCC in all patients. Median follow-up after pancreatectomy was 69 months (1-150 months). Disease-free survival at 2 years was 60%. Overall survival rates at 2 and 4 years were 79% and 72%, respectively. There was no difference found between patients with multiple and unique pancreatic metastases in overall survival.Conclusion:Unique pancreatic metastasis of CCRCC is rare. The literature on this subject is limited. Surgical resection might be an option and can be associated with long-term disease-free intervals in highly selected patients.
