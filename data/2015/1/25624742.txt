Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign hepatic tumor characterized by hepatocyte hyperplasia and a central stellate scar. The association of FNH with other hepatic lesions, such as adenomas, hemangiomas and hepatocellular carcinoma, has been previously reported, but FNH associated with another hepatic tumor is rare in infants. Here we report a case of FNH coexistent with hepatoblastoma in a 36-d-old girl. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an ill-delineated, inhomogeneous enhanced mass with a central star-like scar in the right lobe of the liver. The tumor showed early mild enhancement at the arterial phase (from 40HU without contrast to 52HU at the arterial phase), intense enhancement at the portal phase (87.7HU) and 98.1HU in the 3-min delay scan. A central scar in the tumor presented as low density on non-contrast CT and slightly enhanced at delayed contrast-enhanced scanning. This infant underwent surgical resection of the tumor. Histopathology demonstrated typical FNH coexistent with a focal hepatoblastoma, which showed epithelioid tumor cells separated by proliferated fibrous tissue.
