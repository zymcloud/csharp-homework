Aim:To investigate whether adjuvant antiviral treatment could improve prognosis and entecavir is the optimal nucleoside/nucleotide analog (NA) regimen after curative therapy of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A comprehensive electronic search was performed. All controlled trials comparing antiviral treatment with placebo or no treatment for HBV-related HCC after curative treatment were included. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Stata 12.0 software. An indirect treatment comparison method was used to compare the relative efficacy of different NA strategies.Results:Twenty-one studies containing 8072 patients were included. NA was found to significantly improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Alternatively, for interferon, a non-significant benefit was found. By adjusted indirect comparisons among entecavir, lamivudine and adefovir, entecavir were found to display almost but not significant superiority to the other NA in improving RFS. No tendency favoring a specific NA regimen was found for OS.Conclusion:In HBV-HCC patient after curative treatment, NA improve the prognosis significantly but the role of interferon remains to be elucidated; entecavir was not found to be superior to other NA based on available data.
