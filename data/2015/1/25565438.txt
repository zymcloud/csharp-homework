Aim:Our hypothesis was to prove that surface modifiers themselves can be used as stabilizers and that their entrapment efficiency is directly influenced by the type of stabilizers used.Materials & methods:Particle size and the polydispersity index of the nanoparticles (NPs) were measured by dynamic light scattering, whereas the morphology of the NPs was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Percentage nanoparticle yield, entrapment efficiency and drug loading capacity were measured by ultraviolet absorbance. The physical rigidity, robustness and drug releasing capability of these NPs were also assessed.Conclusion:Physiochemical characterization and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay suggest that polysorbate 80 has the dual capability of being a stabilizer and a surface modifier in addition to having better drug entrapment properties than PluronicÂ® 188. Disulfiram, the drug that was loaded on these NPs, is also observed for the first time to show significant anticancer potential against hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B) cell lines.
