The Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) transcription factor plays crucial roles in multiple biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and transformation. Recent studies have reported that aberrant expression of FoxM1 was found in a variety of human cancers. However, the expression pattern of FoxM1 and its clinical significance in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well characterized to date. In this study, the expression of FoxM1 was evaluated in 46 pairs of human HCC, the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues, and 12 pairs of normal liver tissues by immumohistochemistry. FoxM1 expression was upregulated in the HCC (76.09 %) compared with non-tumorous liver tissues (39.13 %) and normal liver tissues (8.33 %) (P
