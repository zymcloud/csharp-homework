Background:The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the outcomes of operations based on 3-dimensional (3D) operation planning with non 3D-assisted operations in the treatment of centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma.Study design:From April 2008 to March 2014, 116 patients with centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma received surgical treatment in our department. Among these cases, a total of 60 patients received resection with operation planning based on 3D reconstructions (group A); the remaining 56 received treatment with the aid of traditional imaging (group B). Three-dimensional surgical planning, including the classification system for centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma, was elaborated in the study.Results:Compared with group B, group A was linked to shorter operation time (294.5 ± 61.9 minutes vs 324.3 ± 83.1 minutes; p = 0.028) and lower rate of hepatic inflow occlusion (51.7% vs 71.4%; p = 0.029). No differences were found in surgical methods, intraoperative blood transfusion, and intraoperative blood loss. The groups were similar in their rates of complications, except that group B was more liable to have Clavien Grade III to V complications (3.3% vs 14.3%; p = 0.048). In addition, a significant difference in ascites was found across the 2 cohorts (2 in group A and 8 in group B; p = 0.048), and the 2 groups also differed significantly in total bilirubin (23.2 ± 16.1 g/L vs 31.1 ± 24.1 g/L; p = 0.032) and albumin (29.3 ± 5.2 g/L vs 27.8 ± 7.9 g/L; p = 0.033).Conclusions:Compared with non 3D-assisted operations, the operation planning based on 3D reconstruction is a more effective and reasonable method in the treatment of centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, the classification system may facilitate the 3D operation planning.
