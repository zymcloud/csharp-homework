Background:Hepatitis C virus non-structural protein 5A is known to play a role in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via interactions with host cell pathways.Objectives:Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b strains presenting a wide insertion of 31 amino acids in the non-structural protein 5A V3 domain (V3 DI) were studied to determine whether this V3-like additional domain (V3 DII) was associated with HCC occurrence.Study design:Seventy-four patients' sera were screened for V3 DII presence regarding clinical status.Results:Three strains with duplicated V3 were detected among patients with progression to HCC (n=28), two strains among patients with liver cirrhosis (Ci, n=27) and none among patients with chronic hepatitis (Chr, n=19). Phylogenetic trees built from V3 DI and V3 DII sequences indicated that the latter clustered separately. In between-group clonal analysis, V3 DII sequences from the HCC group were found to be more distant from HCV-J than V3 DI sequences (pConclusions:Taken together, our results suggest that V3 DII evolution may differ in strains associated with HCC occurrence. The presence of an intrinsically "disordered" V3 duplicate may alter the NS5A protein network. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the potential impact of V3 duplication in the context of carcinogenesis.
