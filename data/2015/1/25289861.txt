Hepatoma upregulated protein (HURP) is originally isolated during the search for the genes associated with hepatoma. HURP is upregulated in many human cancers. Culture cells exhibit transformed and invasive phenotype when ectopic HURP is introduced, revealing HURP as an oncogene candidate. Our previous studies demonstrated that Aurora-A regulated the cell transforming activities of HURP by phosphorylating HURP at four serines. To unravel how the Aurora-A/HURP cascade contributes to cell transformation, we firstly noticed that HURP shuttled between cytoplasm and nucleus. The nuclear localization activity of HURP was promoted or abolished by overexpression or knockdown of Aurora-A. Similarly, the HURP phosphorylation mimicking mutant 4E had higher nuclear targeting activity than the phosphorylation deficient mutant 4A. The HURP 4E accelerated G1 progression and upregulated cyclin E1, and the cyclin E1 upregulating and cell transforming activities of HURP were diminished when the nuclear localization signal (NLS) was removed from HURP. Furthermore, HURP employed p38/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) cascade to stimulate cell growth. Interestingly, NF-κB trapped HURP in nucleus by interacting with HURP 4E. At last, the HURP/NF-κB complex activated the cyclin E1 promoter. Collectively, Aurora-A/HURP relays cell transforming signal to NF-κB, and the HURP/NF-κB complex is engaged in the regulation of cyclin E1 expression.
