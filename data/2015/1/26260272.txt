As the most important detoxifying enzymes in liver, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) can protect hepatocytes against carcinogens. We conducted a large cohort study to investigate the prognostic value of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven encoding genes of GSTs for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Twelve SNPs were genotyped and correlated with overall survival in 469 HCC patients. The median follow-up time of all patients was 21 (range 3-60) months, and the median survival time was 22 months. By the end of the study, 135 (28.8 %) patients were alive. Only rs4147581 in GSTP1 gene exhibited a significant association with survival of HCC patients (P = 0.006), with its mutant allele bearing a significantly lower risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95 % confidence interval 0.53-0.90), compared with the homozygous wide-type. A longer median survival time in patients with rs4147581 mutant allele was noticed than those homozygous wide-type (P = 0.03), and there was a marked adverse effect on survival conferred by smoking exposure in these patients. Conclusively, our findings provide supporting evidence for a contributory role of GSTP1 rs4147581 polymorphism in predicting the prognosis of HCC.
