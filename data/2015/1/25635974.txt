Objective:To study the prognosis of large hepatocellular carcinoma after interventional radiology and to compare the efficacy of different microinvasive treatments.Patients and methods:The clinical data of 46 large hepatocellular carcinoma patients confirmed by clinical treatment or pathological examination were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups (TACE+RFA n=23 cases, and Combination group n=23 cases), according to the treatments method. two groups were followed up for 5-48 months. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the survival curve was compared by log-rank test.Results:Median follow-up time was 33 months in both groups. The median survival time in Combination group (n=41 months) was significantly longer than TACE+RFA group (n=33 months) (p = 0.052). Median progress-free survival (PFS) is 10 months in Combination group and 8 months in TACE+RFA group. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.023). The tumor inhibition rate was 82.6% and 52.2%, respectively and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.028). The overall survival rate at l, 2 and 3 years was 100%, 95.7% and 55.8% respectively in Combination group was higher than TACE+RFA group at 91.3%, 55.8% and 38.3% respectively. The difference was not statistically significant.Conclusions:For large hepatocellular carcinoma, combined method was superior to TACE+RFA and comprehensive treatment can improve the local-control rate.
