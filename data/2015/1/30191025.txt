Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Chronic, heavy ethanol consumption is a major risk for developing the worsening liver pathologies that culminate in hepatic cirrhosis, the leading risk factor for developing HCC. A significant body of work reports the biochemical and pathological consequences of ethanol consumption and metabolism during hepatocarcinogeneis. The systemic effects of ethanol means organ system interactions are equally important in understanding the initiation and progression of HCC within the alcoholic liver. This review aims to summarize the effects of ethanol-ethanol metabolism during the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease, the progression toward HCC and the importance of ethanol as a comorbid factor for HCC development.
