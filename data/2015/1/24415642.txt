Fatigue is the most common symptom associated with cancer and cancer treatment. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis to determine the incidence and relative risk (RR) of fatigue in patients (pts) with cancer treated with sorafenib (SO), sunitinib (SU) and pazopanib (PZ). PubMed databases were searched for articles published till August 2013. Eligible studies were selected according to PRISMA statement. Summary incidence, RR and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of selected studies. Fifteen studies were included in our analysis. A total of 6,996 pts was enrolled: 2,260 had renal cell carcinomas (RCC), 1,691 non-small cell lung cancers, 1,290 breast cancers, 823 hepatocellular carcinomas, 362 soft tissue sarcomas, 304 gastrointestinal solid tumors, 165 neuroendocrine tumors and 101 melanomas. When stratified by drug, SO registered lower incidence and RR of all and high-grade fatigue when compared to SU, whereas the difference between SO and PZ was significant only for all-grade fatigue (p
