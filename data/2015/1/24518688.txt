Background:Ultrasound (US)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is frequently infeasible even for very early or early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to various reasons such as inconspicuous tumors or absence of a safe electrode path and the infeasibility rate is reportedly as high as 45%. In such cases, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a commonly practiced alternative.Purpose:To analyze long-term outcomes including tumor progression patterns and factors contributing to survival of patients who received TACE as the first line of therapy for very early or early stage HCC infeasible for US-guided RFA.Material and methods:From October 2006 through October 2009, 116 patients with very early or early stage HCCs underwent the first-line therapy TACE after their tumors were deemed infeasible for RFA. Long-term survival rates were calculated and prognostic factors were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The patterns and rates of tumor progression or recurrence were also evaluated.Results:The 1, 3, and 5-year survival rates of the whole cohort were 94.7%, 68.4%, and 47.2% with a mean overall survival of 53.1 months (95% CI: 48.2-58.0). Preserved liver function with Child-Pugh class A was the only independent factor associated with longer survival. The most common first tumor progression pattern was intrahepatic distant recurrence. The cumulative rates of local tumor progression and intrahepatic distant recurrence at 1, 3, and 5 years were 33% and 22%, 52% and 49%, and 73% and 75%, respectively.Conclusion:TACE is a viable first-line treatment of HCC infeasible for RFA, especially when liver function was preserved.
