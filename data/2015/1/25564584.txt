Purpose:To report a long-term follow-up of a young woman affected by cystic fibrosis (CF) with a residual retroperitoneal mass of neuroblastoma (NBL) after treatment.Case report:We reviewed the patient's database and analysed a 20-year follow-up by considering pulmonary exacerbation, nutritional condition, pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s), microbiological data and residual retroperitoneal mass volume. We observed stable pulmonary and nutritional conditions. No variation was found in the residual retroperitoneal mass volume.Discussion:We report this case of a patient with CF with previous NBL because such a long time of follow-up of a NBL with a stable retroperitoneal remaining tumour is uncommon and needs to be reported. Multidisciplinary management has been crucial in this case because of the presence of concomitant diseases and consequently, differential diagnosis challenges.
