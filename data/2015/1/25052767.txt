Purpose:To assess the feasibility of fusion of pre- and post-ablation gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI) to evaluate the effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared with similarly fused CT imagesPatients and methods:This retrospective study included 67 patients with 92 HCCs treated with RFA. Fusion images of pre- and post-RFA dynamic CT, and pre- and post-RFA Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI were created, using a rigid registration method. The minimal ablative margin measured on fusion imaging was categorized into three groups: (1) tumor protruding outside the ablation zone boundary, (2) ablative margin 0-Results:In 57 (62.0%) HCCs, treatment evaluation was possible both on CT and MR fusion images, and the overall agreement between them for the categorization of minimal ablative margin was good (Îº coefficient = 0.676, P Conclusions:Fusion of pre- and post-ablation Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI is feasible for treatment evaluation after RFA. It may enable accurate treatment evaluation in cases where CT fusion imaging is not helpful.
