It is an honour to be invited to recount the progress in our understanding and management of hepatitis B 50 years after the discovery of Australia antigen (Au Ag). During this half century, we have gone from identifying the causative agent--hepatitis B virus (HBV), understanding its biology and the disease it causes, to having vaccines that can prevent HBV infection and antiviral therapy that can suppress HBV replication and prevent progression of HBV-related liver disease. As a result of the progress, prevalence of HBV infection and morbidity and mortality from chronic HBV infection has declined.
