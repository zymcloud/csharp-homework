A 40-year-old woman visited her primary care physician because she had pain in the upper right part of the abdomen. She was diagnosed with descending colon cancer with multiple liver metastases, and was referred to our department. After a laparoscopic abdominal colectomy for removal of the original lesion, chemotherapy was initiated with a modified combination of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) + panitumumab. After 12 courses of treatment with the mFOL FOX6 + panitumumab combination, followed by 13 courses of the simplified biweekly 5-fluorouracil and Leucovorin (sLV5FU2) + panitumumab combination, her liver tumors had regressed to about 90% of their original size. A laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was successfully performed. Histopathological examination indicated a Grade 2 regression of the tumor in response to chemotherapy. This report highlights the effectiveness of "conversion therapy" after chemotherapy with the mFOLFOX6+panitumumab combination, especially in those patients with multiple liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
