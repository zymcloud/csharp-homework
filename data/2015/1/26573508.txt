The underlying molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3), has been reported as a novel tumor suppressor in breast cancer. However, its potential suppressive role in HCC has not been evaluated. In the current study, the biologic functions of MKK3 in HCC were investigated and a previously unreported cell cycle regulation mechanism was observed. MKK3 overexpression suppressed HepG2 and PLC‑PRF‑5 cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in the two cell lines. In addition, MKK3 overexpression upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16 INK4A and p15 INK4B in HCC cells. Their negative regulator, Bim‑1, was downregulated following MKK3 overexpression. Moreover, MKK3 activated p38 in HCC cells and SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, reversed the tumor suppressive effect of MKK3. In conclusion, the results identify MKK3 as a tumor suppressor and highlighted the significance of p38 pathway aberration in HCC.
