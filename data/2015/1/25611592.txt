Background and aims:Thrombopoietin (TPO) has been implicated in the process of liver regeneration and was found to correlate with hepatic function in patients with liver disease. With this investigation we aimed to determine if perioperative TPO levels were associated with postoperative outcome in patients undergoing liver resection.Methods:Perioperative TPO was analyzed prior to liver resection as well as on the first and fifth postoperative day in 46 colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis (mCRC) as well as 23 hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HCC). Serum markers of liver function within the first postoperative week were used to define liver dysfunction.Results:While circulating TPO levels significantly increased one day after liver resection in patients without liver cirrhosis (mCRC) (P Conclusions:We here demonstrate that perioperative TPO dynamics are associated with postoperative LD. Postoperative TPO levels were found to be lowest in high-risk patients (HCC patients undergoing major resection) but showed an independent predictive value. Thus, a dampened TPO increase after liver resection reflects a poor capacity for hepatic recovery and may help to identify patients who require close monitoring or intervention for potential complications.
