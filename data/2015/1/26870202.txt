Double primary hepatic cancer, consisting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) located separately within a single liver simultaneously, is extremely rare. The present study reports a case of double hepatic nodules, in which HCC and ICC occurred simultaneously in the right hepatic lobe. The 47-year-old male patient, who was a carrier of hepatitis B virus, was admitted to our hospital for physical examination, which revealed two liver masses. The results of initial laboratory tests, including liver function tests, were within normal limits, with the exception of mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and decreased albumin levels. Î±-fetoprotein was in the normal range, while carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was marginally elevated. Abdominal ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography revealed two tumors located in segments (S) VI and VII of the liver, respectively, with malignant behavior. Examination of the two masses following resection of S VI and VII confirmed a diagnosis of combined HCC and ICC. After 8 months of follow-up, no signs of recurrence have been observed with chemical therapy.
