Objective:To identify imaging characteristics that differentiate small (≤2 cm) HCCs from small (≤2 cm) benign nodules in cirrhotic liver on gadoxetic acid-enhanced and diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) images.Materials and methods:On gadoxetic acid-enhanced and DW MR images, we analysed signal intensity of 222 small HCCs and 61 benign nodules (diameter, 0.5-2 cm) at each sequence and rim enhancement during portal or equilibrium phases. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified predictors of HCC. Combinations of significant MR findings in multivariate analysis were compared with American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) practice guidelines.Results:In multivariate analysis, arterial enhancement (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.6), T2 hyperintensity (aOR, 5.8), and hyperintensity on DW images (aOR, 3.8) were significant for differentiating small HCCs from benign nodules (p ≤ 0.004). When two or all three findings were applied as diagnostic criteria for differentiating small HCCs from benign nodules, sensitivity and accuracy were significantly higher compared with AASLD practice guidelines (91% vs. 78% and 89% vs. 81%, respectively; each p Conclusion:On gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging, arterial enhancement and hyperintensity on T2-weighted and DW MR images are helpful for differentiating small HCCs from benign nodules in liver cirrhosis.
