Background:The efficacy of surgical resection for gastric cancer liver metastases (GCLMs) is currently debated. Hitherto, no large-scale clinical studies have been conducted.Methods:This retrospective multicentre study analysed a database of consecutive patients with either synchronous or metachronous metastases who underwent surgical R0 resection for GCLM between 1990 and 2010. Clinical data were collected from five cancer centres in Japan. Survival curves were assessed, and clinical parameters were evaluated to identify predictors of prognosis.Results:A total of 256 patients were enrolled. The mean(s.d.) number of hepatic tumours resected was 2.0(2.4). The surgical mortality rate was 1.6 per cent. Median follow-up was 65 (range 1-261) months. Recurrences were detected in 192 patients (75.0 per cent). The median interval from hepatic resection to recurrence was 7 (range 1-72) months, and the dominant site of recurrence was the liver (72.4 per cent). Actuarial 1-, 3- and 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 77.3, 41.9 and 31.1 per cent, and 43.6, 32.4 and 30.1 per cent, respectively. Median overall and recurrence-free survival times were 31.1 and 9.4 months respectively. Multivariable analysis identified serosal invasion of the primary gastric cancer (hazard ratio (HR) 1.50; P = 0.012), three or more liver metastases (HR 2.33; P < 0.001) and liver tumour diameter at least 5 cm (HR 1.62; P = 0.005) as independent predictors of poor survival.Conclusion:Clinically resectable GCLM is rare, but strict and careful patient selection can lead to long-term survival following R0 surgical resection.
