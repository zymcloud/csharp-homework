It is well known that the presence of end-stage liver disease increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver transplantation (LT) for patients within the Milan criteria has become a standard treatment for HCC in most developed centers worldwide. However, a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients with HCC after transplantation is tumor recurrence, including peritoneal recurrences, which develops rarely but presents a significant problem with regard to their management. Our experience includes two cases with HCC within the Milan criteria of peritoneal recurrences after living donor LT. Both patients had interventions for HCC in their medical history before LT, and we propose that these might have been a possible cause of the HCC peritoneal recurrence.
