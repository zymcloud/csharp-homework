Safety and efficacy of hepatic resection for large hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs 10 cm or greater in diameter) remain controversial. Surgical results of patients with HCCs 10 cm or greater (n = 24) who underwent hepatic resection over an 11-year period were compared with those of patients with HCCs less than 10 cm (n = 291). There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (P > 0.99). Overall 5-year survival rate was 44.6 per cent among patients with HCCs 10 cm or greater and 70.5 per cent among those with HCCs less than 10 cm (P = 0.010); however, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival rate between the two groups (P = 0.16). Incidence of synchronous intra- and extrahepatic recurrence was higher in patients with HCCs 10 cm or greater than in those with HCCs less than 10 cm (P = 0.0012). Macrovascular invasion alone was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis (hazard ratio [HR],: 11.1) and recurrence (HR, 6.02) after hepatic resection for HCCs 10 cm or greater, which was correlated with synchronous intra- and extrahepatic recurrence. Hepatic resection for large HCCs is safe and efficacious. However, incidence of synchronous intra- and extrahepatic recurrence is high, especially in patients with macrovascular invasion.
