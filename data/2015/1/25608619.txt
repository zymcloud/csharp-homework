Growing evidence indicates that miR-146a is involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression in several human malignancies. However, the molecular details underlying miR-146a mediated regulation of its target genes and its precise biological function in cancer, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.Methods:The expression levels of genes including miR-146a, APC, VEGF and HAb18G were examined in HCC cell lines and patient specimens were compared with control levels using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The functions of miR-146a and HAb18G in migration/invasion and liver metastasis formation were determined by transwell and spleen injection assays, respectively. miR-146a related genes were determined by PCR array. The potential regulatory targets of miR-146a were determined by bioinformatics and prediction tools, correlation with target protein expression, and luciferase reporter assay. DNA methylation status of miR-146a promoter were performed by PCR analysis of bisulfite-modified genomic DNA.Results:We demonstrated that miR-146a expression was markedly downregulated in hepatoma cells and hepatoma tissues compared to immortalized normal liver epithelial cells and normal hepatic tissues. DNA methylation of miR-146a promoter correlated with its downexpression and with liver cancer metastasis. The restoration of miR-146a dramatically suppressed HCC cell invasion and metastasis by repressing VEGF expression through upregulating APC, which inhibits β-catenin accumulation in nucleus, and downregulating NF-κB p65 by targeting HAb18G. In human HCC, miR-146a expression was negative correlated with increased HAb18G, VEGF, NF-κB p65 and beneficial prognosis.Conclusion:This study identified a novel target of miR-146a and defined miR-146a as a crucial tumor suppressor in human HCC that acts through multiple pathways and mechanisms to suppress HCC invasion or metastasis.
