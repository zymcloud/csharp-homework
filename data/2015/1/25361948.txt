Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is strongly associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. False-negative results are common in routine serological tests and quantitative real-time PCR because of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) variation and low HBV copy number. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a next generation digital PCR, is a novel, sensitive, and specific platform that can be used to improve HBV detection.Methods:A total of 131 HCC cases with different tumor stages and clinical features were initially classified with a serological test as HBsAg positive (n = 107) or negative (n = 24) for HBV infection. Next, DNA templates were prepared from the corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues to determine HBV copy number by ddPCR.Results:HBV copy numbers, successfully determined for all clinical FFPE tissues (n = 131), ranged from 1.1 to 175.5 copies/Î¼L according to ddPCR. The copy numbers of HBV were positively correlated with tumor-nodes-metastasis (P = 0.008) and Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (P = 0.045) classification. Moreover, serum cholinesterase correlated with hepatitis B viral load (P = 0.006).Conclusions:HBV infection is a key factor that influences tumorigenesis in HCC by regulating tumor occurrence and development. ddPCR improves the analytical sensitivity and specificity of measurements in nucleic acids at a single-molecule level and is suitable for HBV detection.
