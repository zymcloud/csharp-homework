Purpose:Sorafenib is the standard of care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The peak incidence of HCC is around 70 years. We aimed to evaluate safety and efficacy of sorafenib in the elderly population.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed data from patients treated with sorafenib for HCC at our institution. We compared safety and efficacy data across different age groups.Results:Since 2005, 129 patients were treated, 78 (60.5 %) were Conclusion:Sorafenib showed similar results in terms of safety and efficacy in the elderly and younger HCC populations. Careful baseline evaluation is needed for patient's selection in the elderly population, including discussion about antiplatelet therapy discontinuation and caution in PS1 patients, as well as active management of toxicity.
