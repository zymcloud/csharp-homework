Tumor recurrence remains one major obstacle for further improving the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after curative liver resection. It has been widely reported that tumor size, positive surgical margin, macroscopic vascular invasion, tumor-node-metastasis stage and Edmondson's grade were significantly related to HCC recurrence. However, the association between HCC recurrence and important viral factors, including the HBV DNA levels, status of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e-antigen, levels of cccDNA and hepatitis B core-related antigen, viral genotypes and specific viral sequence mutations remained controversial. Meanwhile, studies on the effect of postoperative adjuvant antiviral therapy on HCC recurrence have been relatively limited and have yielded conflicting results. Identification of certain viral risk factors for HCC recurrence and stratification of patient risk are very important to perform future surveillance programs. As a HBV hyperendemic region, the majority of HBV-related HCC patients develop in East Asia. In this article, we thus systematically reviewed the risk of important viral factors involved in recurrent carcinogenesis and the role of adjuvant antiviral therapy in preventing tumor recurrence in this area.
