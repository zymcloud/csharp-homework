Adenovirus dodecahedron (Dd), a nanoparticulate proteinaceous biodegradable virus-like particle (VLP), was used as a vector for delivery of an oncogene inhibitor to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rat orthotopic model. Initiation factor eIF4E is an oncogene with elevated expression in human cancers. Cell-impermeant eIF4E inhibitor, cap structure analog (cap) and anti-cancer antibiotic doxorubicin (Dox) were delivered as Dd conjugates. Dd-cap and Dd-dox inhibited cancer cell culture proliferation up to 50 and 84%, respectively, while with free Dox similar results could be obtained only at a 5 times higher concentration. In animal HCC model the combination treatment of Dd-cap/Dd-dox caused 40% inhibition of tumor growth. Importantly, the level of two pro-oncogenes, eIF4E and c-myc, was significantly diminished in tumor sections of treated rats. Attachment to Dd, a virus-like particle, permitted the first demonstration of cap analog intracellular delivery and resulted in improved doxorubicin delivery leading to statistically significant inhibition of HCC tumor growth.
