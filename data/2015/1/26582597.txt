Introduction:The aim of this study was to compare survival outcomes in patients enlisted for liver transplantation following liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma before or at recurrence.Methods:All patients enlisted for liver transplantation following liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma from 1996 to 2013 were included and compared according to their status at the time of enlistment: before (de principe) or at (salvage) recurrence. Primary end-point was survival since resection.Results:One hundred and twenty-one patients were enlisted for liver transplantation following liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. Ten patients enlisted for cirrhosis decompensation were excluded from the analysis. Sixty-three patients were enlisted de principe, and 48 for a salvage transplantation. Eleven patients dropped-out. According to per-protocol analysis, the mean diameter of the largest tumor was the only different pathological characteristic of initial resection between groups (31.6 mm in the de principe group versus 48.3 in the salvage, p = 0.017). The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly increased in the de principe group compared to salvage (84.6 versus 74.8%, p = 0.017). In a multivariate analysis, the salvage strategy was the only independent prognostic factor for death (p = 0.040; OR = 2.5 [1.1-5.8]).Conclusion:De principe enlistment for liver transplantation following liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with greater survival.
