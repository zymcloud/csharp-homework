Background and aim:Renal insufficiency (RI) is commonly seen in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the impact of RI on the long-term survival of HCC patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and to determine the optimal staging strategy for these patients.Methods:RI was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate Results:HCC patients with RI undergoing RFA were older (P Conclusions:The long-term survival of HCC patients undergoing RFA is not affected by RI. The TIS staging system may provide a better prognostic prediction for HCC patients with RI undergoing RFA.
