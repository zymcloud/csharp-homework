The purpose of this study was to examine JMJD2B expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and elucidate relationships between various expression patterns and clinicopathological parameters of HCC patients. Immunohistochemical techniques were performed to detect JMJD2B expression in a tissue microarray from patients with breast, cerebrum, colon, esophagus, kidney, liver, lung, prostate, stomach, and uterus cancers. We performed immunohistochemical staining of a multiple tissue array to examine the expression profile of JMJD2B. Our results demonstrate that JMJD2B protein levels were upregulated in malignant human tumors, including breast, colon, liver, and lung. Immunohistochemistry staining examination of liver tumor tissue microarray revealed that the expression of JMJD2B is significant according to the histological grade and TNM stage of liver tumor. Moreover, JMJD2B was also correlated with Ki-67 expression in HCC samples. These results reveal that JMJD2B is dramatically upregulated in HCC, making it a potential diagnostic marker for the further development of HCC treatment therapies.
