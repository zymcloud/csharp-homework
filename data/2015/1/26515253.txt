Primary human hepatocytes are considered to be the “gold standard” in studies of lipid metabolism despite a number of disadvantages like large inter-donor differences and inability to proliferate. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells retain many hepatocyte-specific functions but do also exhibit disadvantages like secretion of lipoproteins and bile acids that do not emulate human hepatocytes in vivo. The aim of this study was to investigate whether supplementation of the culturing media with human serum could improve the functionality of HepG2 cells and thereby make them more apposite in studies of lipid metabolism. The cells were cultured with human sera (2%) from three healthy individuals or with fetal bovine serum (10%). Lipoprotein, apolipoprotein, bile acid, albumin, and proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9) concentrations in the cell media, as well as gene and protein expressions were then measured. We found apoB-containing LDL-sized but also apoA1-containing HDL-sized particles, increased bile acid and Pcsk9 concentrations in the cell media, as well as increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and differentiation in HepG2 cells cultured with human sera. Thus, supplementation of the culturing media with human serum improves the functionality of HepG2 cells and makes them more apposite in studies of lipid metabolism.
