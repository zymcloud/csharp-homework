Background/aims:Second-look endoscopy is performed to check for the possibility of post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) bleeding and to perform prophylactic hemostasis in most hospitals; however, there is little evidence about the efficacy of second-look endoscopy. We investigated whether second-look endoscopy after ESD is useful in the prevention of post-ESD bleeding.Methods:A total of 550 lesions with gastric epithelial neoplasms in 502 patients (372 men and 130 women) were treated with ESD between August 18, 2009 and August 18, 2010. After the exclusion of three lesions of post-ESD bleeding within 24 hours, 547 lesions (335 early gastric cancers and 212 gastric adenomas) were included for the final analysis.Results:The occurrence rate of delayed post-ESD bleeding was not significantly differ-ent between the second-look group and the no second-look group (1% vs 2.5%, p>0.05). The only predictor of delayed bleeding was tumor size, regardless of second-look endoscopy after ESD (22.8±9.87 vs 15.1±10.47, p<0.05). There was no difference between the prophylactic hemostasis and nonprophylactic hemostasis groups, including the occurrence rate of delayed bleeding. In the second-look group with prophylactic hemostasis, the hospital stay was more prolonged than in the second-look group without prophylactic hemostasis, but there was no significant difference (p=0.08).Conclusions:Second-look endoscopy to prevent delayed bleeding after ESD provides no significant medical benefits.
