GATA5 is a transcription factor that is capable of suppressing the development of various types of human cancer. The present study investigated the expression of GATA5 and GATA4, and examined their roles in the proliferation and colony formation ability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cells. The GATA4 and GATA5 expression levels and gene promoter methylation of HCC tissue samples from 38 patients and HCC cell lines were analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), respectively. The effects of GATA4 and GATA5 overexpression on the proliferation and colony forming ability of HCC cells were also assessed using cell viability and colony formation assays. A luciferase reporter assay was utilized to investigate the transcriptional interaction of GATA4 and GATA5 with canonical Wnt signaling. The results indicated that the expression levels of GATA4 and GATA5 were lost or reduced following methylation of gene promoters in HCC tissues and cell lines. Treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), restored GATA4 and GATA5 expression in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, methylation of the GATA5 promoter was observed to be associated with the age of patients exhibiting HCC. Restoration of GATA4 and GATA5 expression inhibited colony formation and induced apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro. The present study concluded that the expression levels of GATA4 and GATA5 were reduced in HCC tissues and cell lines. Treatment with 5-AZA restored GATA4 and GATA5 expression in HCC cell lines, suppressing tumor cell growth and colony formation, as well as inducing apoptosis.
