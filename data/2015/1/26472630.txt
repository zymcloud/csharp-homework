Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is widely accepted as a first-line interventional oncology approach for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has the advantages of high treatment efficacy and low complication risk. Local control rates equivalent to hepatic resection can be reached by RFA alone when treating small HCCs (3 cm). To address this clinical problem, recent efforts have focused on multimodel management of HCC by combining RFA with different techniques, including percutaneous ethanol injection, transarterial chemo-embolization, targeted molecular therapy, nanoparticle-mediated therapy, and immunotherapy. The combination strategy indeed leads to better outcomes in comparison to RFA alone. In this article, we review the current status of RFA-combined multimodal therapies in the management of HCC.
