Aim:Prevalence of patients with unresectable recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after previous resection is rising. The purpose of this study was to determine survival of patients undergoing computed tomography-guided brachytherapy (CT-HDRBT).Patients and methods:Altogether 19 patients with unresectable HCC recurrence were treated with CT-HDRBT at our Institution. Patients underwent single-fraction high-dose irradiation by an iridium-192 source after CT fluoroscopy-guided catheter placement. The median tumor-enclosing target dose was 20 Gy.Results:The median follow-up was 33 months. According to the Kaplan-Meier method, median overall survival after CT-HDRBT was 50 months, and median survival after first hepatic resection was 87 months. The median duration of local tumor control was 32 months and time to disease progression was 20 months. There were no serious complications after CT-HDRBT and no treatment-related deaths.Conclusion:CT-HDRBT is a safe, potentially life prolonging technique in patients with recurrence of HCC who have few therapeutic options.
