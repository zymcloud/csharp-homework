Background:In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), des-r-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) more accurately reflects the malignant potential than alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Next-generation DCP (NX-DCP) was created to overcome some of the limitations of conventional DCP. This study assessed the predictive value of NX-DCP for vascular invasion in HCC.Methods:We prospectively studied 82 consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo resection for HCC. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of pathological vascular invasion. The predictive powers of AFP, conventional DCP, and NX-DCP for vascular invasion were compared by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and correlations with tumour markers and the presence of vascular invasion were assessed.Results:Vascular invasion was pathologically confirmed in 21 patients (positive group) and absent in 61 patients (negative group). The NX-DCP level was significantly higher in the positive group than in the negative group (510.0 mAU ml(-1) (10-98 450) vs 34.0 mAU ml(-1) (12-541), PConclusions:The NX-DCP level can be used to predict the presence of vascular invasion in HCC.
