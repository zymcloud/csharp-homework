Background:Perioperative red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) remains common after liver resection and carries risk of increased morbidity and worse oncologic outcomes. We sought to assess the factors associated with perioperative RBCT after hepatectomy with a focus on intraoperative hemodynamics.Methods:We performed a retrospective review of our prospective hepatectomy database, supplemented by a review of anesthetic records of all patients undergoing hepatectomy with hemodynamic monitoring (arterial and central venous pressures [CVP]) from 2003-2012. Primary outcome was perioperative RBCT (during and within 30 d after surgery). After descriptive and univariate comparisons, multivariate analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with RBCT.Results:Of 851 hepatectomies, 530 had complete hemodynamic data and 30.2% (161 of 530) received RBCT. Among transfused patients, female gender (P = 0.01), preoperative anemia (P < 0.001), and major liver resection (P = 0.02) were more common. Mean estimated blood loss was 1.1 L higher (2.0 versus 0.9 L; P < 0.001) and operating time was 1.1 h longer (5.8 versus 4.7 h; P < 0.001) in transfused patients. Trends in intraoperative CVP differed significantly based on transfusion status (P = 0.007). Independent factors associated with RBCT included female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.27; P = 0.01), preoperative anemia (OR, 2.38; P = 0.03), longer operative time (OR, 1.19 per hour; P = 0.03), and higher intraoperative CVP at 1 h during surgery (OR, 1.10 per mm Hg; P = 0.005).Conclusions:Likelihood of RBCT is independently associated with female gender, preoperative anemia, longer operative time, and higher intraoperative CVP. Focus on management of preoperative anemia, operative efficiency, and low intraoperative CVP is needed to minimize the need for RBCTs.
