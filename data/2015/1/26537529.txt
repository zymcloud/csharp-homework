The dual SRC/ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor bosutinib is indicated for adults with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) resistant/intolerant to prior therapy. This analysis of an ongoing phase 1/2 study (NCT00261846) assessed effects of baseline patient characteristics on long-term efficacy and safety of bosutinib 500 mg/day in adults with imatinib (IM)-resistant (IM-R; n = 196)/IM-intolerant (IM-I; n = 90) chronic phase (CP) CML. Median treatment duration was 24·8 months (median follow-up, 43·6 months). Cumulative major cytogenetic response (MCyR) rate [95% confidence interval (CI)], was 59% (53-65%); Kaplan-Meier (KM) probability of maintaining MCyR at 4 years was 75% (66-81%). Cumulative incidence of on-treatment progression/death at 4 years was 19% (95% CI, 15-24%); KM 2-year overall survival was 91% (87-94%). Significant baseline predictors of both MCyR and complete cytogenetic response (newly attained/maintained from baseline) at 3 and 6 months included prior IM cytogenetic response, baseline MCyR, prior interferon therapy and <6 months duration from diagnosis to IM treatment initiation and no interferon treatment before IM. The most common adverse event (AE) was diarrhoea (86%). Baseline bosutinib-sensitive BCR-ABL1 mutation was the only significant predictor of grade 3/4 diarrhoea; no significant predictors were identified for liver-related AEs. Bosutinib demonstrates durable efficacy and manageable toxicity in IM-R/IM-I CP-CML patients.
