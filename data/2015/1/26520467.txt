Conjugates of anthracyclines are a new possibility for anticancer agent delivery, which seems to be a very promising alternative to the currently used cancer treatment strategies. In our study, we investigated the ability of a doxorubicin-transferrin (DOX-TRF) conjugate to induce cell death in two solid tumor cell lines: non-small cell lung cancer (A549) and hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2). The observed effects of the DOX-TRF conjugate on these cell cultures were compared with those of free doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used antineoplastic therapeutic agent. Our results provided direct evidence that the investigated conjugate is considerably more cytotoxic to the examined human cancer cell lines than is DOX alone. Moreover, we confirmed that the antitumor efficacy of DOX-TRF conjugate is related to its apoptosis-inducing ability, which was shown during measurements of typical features of programmed cell death. In solid tumor cell lines, the DOX-TRF conjugate induced changes in cellular morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential and caspases-3 and -9 activities. Furthermore, all of the analyzed hallmarks of apoptosis were confirmed by the oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation assay and by a real-time PCR quantitative study, which displayed the superiority of the conjugate-induced programmed cell death over free drug-triggered cell death.
