Type I interferon (IFN) is one of most important cytokines for antiviral responses in fish innate immunity, after the induction pathway following pattern recognition. In this study, 2 types of type I IFN mRNA from a medaka (Japanese rice fish; Oryzias latipes) were identified and classified (phylogenetic analysis) into subgroup-a and -d by (designated olIFNa and olIFNd, respectively). Both olIFNa and olIFNd (encoding 197 and 187 amino acid residues, respectively) contained 2 cysteines. Gene expression pattern of olIFNa, olIFNd and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was assessed (quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, qRT-PCR) in various organs (i.e., whole kidney, liver and spleen) of medaka stimulated by polyI:C or infected with nervous necrosis virus (NNV). Expression of olIFNa, olIFNd and ISGs, especially the ISG15 gene, were significantly upregulated after NNV-infection. Furthermore, olIFNa, olIFNd and ISGs mRNAs were sufficiently induced in DIT cells (i.e., medaka hepatoma cell line) transfected with polyI:C or infected with NNV. In addition, in vitro biological activities of recombinant olIFNa and olIFNd (rolIFNa and rolIFNd) produced by mammalian cell line HEK293T were also characterized. Expression of GIG1a and ISG15 genes in kidney cells of adult medaka were induced by rolIFNa or rolIFNd. The olIFNs-overexpressing DIT cells had reduced viral titers following NNV infection. Therefore, we inferred that 2 type I IFNs were involved in innate immunity (antiviral response) in medaka fish.
