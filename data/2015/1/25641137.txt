Objective:To explore the clinical and survival significance of CD20 positive adult patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).Methods:The clinical features and survival of 168 adult patients with B-ALL diagnosed and treated in our department from May 2007 to July 2011 were analyzed retrospectively, 58 expressed CD20 and 110 not.Results:The sex, distribution of age, anemia, thrombocytopenia, infiltration of liver, spleen and lymph nodes, the expression of myeloid lineage marker, incidence of Ph chromosome, complete remission within 4 weeks showed no significant differences in CD20 positive and negative groups (P>0.05); median white blood cell count at diagnosis and the rate of patients with high white blood cell count in CD20 positive group were 19.2×10⁹/L and 37.9% respectively, which were significantly higher than those of 6.93 × 10⁹/L and 20.9% in CD20 negative group (P<0.05); cumulative incidence of relapse between two groups showed significant difference (P<0.05); multivariable analysis for overall survival and progress-free survival identified CD20 positivity as independent predictor.Conclusion:The expression of CD20 in adult patients with B-ALL appeared to be associated with high white blood cell count and poor prognosis.
