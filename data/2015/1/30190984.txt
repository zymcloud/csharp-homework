Liver transplantation is one of the most effective treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the Milan criteria have been widely used to identify suitable candidates for liver transplant with a good prognosis, many transplant centers have developed and actually used more expanded criteria. Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) is at the center of expansion of criteria because it is based on the personal relationship between a recipient and a donor. Asian LDLT centers have developed various expanded criteria for LDLT using tumor biologic markers as well as the size and number of the tumors. However, there is no consensus on the limit of the expansion of criteria. Here, we present our experience and opinion on LDLT for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
