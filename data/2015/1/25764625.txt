Orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for various liver diseases including early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After the first successful LT in Thailand at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) in 1987, the number of LT has gradually been increasing in parallel with the improvement in patient survival. The recent outcomes of LT are reported herein. From January 1, 2002 to June 30, 2013, 120 cases of adult LT and 24 cases of pediatric LT were performed. The most common indication for LT was HCC in the adult whereas biliary atresia was the most common indication for LT in pediatric patients. As for the severity of liver disease, the average model of end stage liver disease (MELD) and pediatric end stage liver disease (PELD) scores were 19 in adult LT and 21.5 in pediatric LT respectively. The most common perioperative complication in adult LT was acute renal failure (25%). One-, five-year patient survival in adult LT and pediatric LT were 85%, 69% and 96%, 91%, respectively. In conclusion, the outcomes of LT at KCMH have gradually been improving close to the world standard, especially the patient survival.
