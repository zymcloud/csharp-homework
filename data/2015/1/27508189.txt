Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide as well as in Egypt with hepatitis C and B, alcohol and aflatoxins being the commonest risk factors.Aim:The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic factors affecting overall survival (OS) of untreated HCC in Egypt.Methods:This retrospective study was conducted at Tanta Cancer Center, Egypt where 288 HCC cases who received no specific therapy and were followed-up until death were identified. The impact of possible prognostic factors on OS was assessed using the log-rank test (univariate analyses) and Cox regression method (multivariate analysis).Results:The median OS of untreated HCC was 2.3 months (95% confidence interval: 1.9-2.6). The 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months OS rates were 84%, 42%, 21%, 9%, and 3%, respectively. All cases had died by 46 months. Male sex, advanced Child-Pugh class, the clinical presentation of ascites, cough, fatigue, and the presence of metastases were associated with poor survival (PConclusion:OS in untreated HCC in Egypt is very short. Many factors interact to produce this dismal survival.
