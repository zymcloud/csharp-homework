Reactions of hydrazonoyl halides and each of methyl 2-(1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazine-1-carbodithioate and 2-(1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide afforded 2-(1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazono)-3-phenyl-5-substituted-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-thiadiazoles and 5-(4-substituted)diazenyl)-2-(2-(1-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinyl)-4-arylthiazoles, respectively. Analogously, the reactions of hydrazonoyl halides with 7-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-5-phenyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(1H)-one gave 3-(4-substituted)-8-(5-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-6-phenyl-1-arylpyrido[2,3-d]-[1,2,4]-triazolo-[4,3-a]pyrimidin- 5(1H)-ones in a good yield. The structures of the newly synthesized were elucidated via elemental analysis, spectral data and alternative synthesis routes whenever possible. Twelve of the newly synthesized compounds have been evaluated for their antitumor activity against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. Their structure activity relationships (SAR) were also studied. The 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivative 9b (IC50 = 2.94 µM) has promising antitumor activity against the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and the thiazole derivative 12a has promising inhibitory activity against both the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and the breast carcinoma cell line (IC50 = 1.19, and 3.4 µM, respectively).
