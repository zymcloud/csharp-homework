Background & aims:Human hepatocarcinogenesis in cirrhosis is thought to be multistep and characterized by a spectrum of nodular lesions, ranging from low to high grade dysplastic nodules (LGDN and HGDN) to early and progressed hepatocellular carcinoma (eHCC and pHCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the morphophenotypical changes of this sequence and their potential translational significance.Methods:We scored the vascular profile, ductular reaction/stromal invasion and overexpression of five biomarkers (GPC3, HSP70, GS, CHC, and EZH2), in a series of 100 resected nodules (13 LGDN, 16 HGDN, 42 eHCC and 29 small pHCC).Results:The score separated the four groups of nodules as individual entities (pConclusions:This study supports the multistep nature of human hepatocarcinogenesis, and suggests that eHCC is more heterogeneous than previously thought. This provides further information of the potential translational significance into clinical practice.
