In addition to surgical procedures, radiofrequency ablation is commonly used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) of limited size and number. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), using iodized poppy seed oil, Lipiodol and anticancer drugs, has been actively performed for the treatment of unresectable HCC, particularly in Asian countries. Recently, Sorafenib become available for advanced HCCs when the liver is still sufficiently functional. Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects. However, the effect of sorafenib seems to be inadequate to control the progression of HCC. Radiation therapy (RT) for HCC has a potential role across all stages of HCC. However, RT is generally not considered an option in HCC consensus documents or national guidelines, primarily because of insufficient supporting evidence. However, the method of RT has much improved because of advances in technology. Moreover, combined treatment of RT plus other treatments (TACE, sorafenib and chemotherapy etc.) has become one of the alternative therapies for HCC. Therefore, we should understand the various kinds of RT available for HCC. In this review, we focus on various kinds of external beam radiation therapy.
