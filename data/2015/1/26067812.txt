Background and aims:Current guidelines favor the use of chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) in first line therapy of symptomatic Wilson disease patients. Development of chelator induced immunological adverse events are a concern especially under d-penicillamine therapy. This study assessed the prevalence of co-existing or therapy-related immune-mediated diseases in Wilson disease patients, and evaluated the role of antinuclear antibodies in therapy monitoring.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 235 Wilson disease patients. Medical regimens were classified and analyzed in relation to adverse events and antinuclear antibody courses.Results:Coexisting immune-mediated diseases were evident in 19/235 (8.1%) patients, of which 13/235 (5.5%) had pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Six patients (2.6%) developed an autoimmune disease under therapy, all of them under long-term d-penicillamine treatment. Data relating to antinuclear antibody courses during treatment and adverse events were available for patients treated with d-penicillamine (n = 91), trientine (n = 58), and zinc salts (n = 58). No significant increase in antinuclear antibody titers in patients treated with d-penicillamine (16/91; 17.6%), trientine (12/58; 20.7%), and zinc (7/58; 12.1%) were found.Conclusion:Under long-term d-penicillamine therapy a minority of patients developed immune-mediated disease. Elevations in antinuclear antibodies were found frequently, but no correlations were evident between increases in antinuclear antibodies and the development of immune-mediated diseases or medical regimes. Thus, the value of antinuclear antibodies for monitoring adverse events under chelator therapy seems to be limited.
