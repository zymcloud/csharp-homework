MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs, which have demonstrated to important gene regulators, and have critical roles in diverse biological processes including cancer cell proliferation. Previous studies suggested microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p) was down-regulated and play tumor suppressor roles in gastric cancer, colorectal carcinoma and lung cancer. However, the role of miR-338-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-338-3p in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. We find that miR-338-3p was downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Then functional studies demonstrate ectopic miR-338-3p expression significantly suppressed the in vitro proliferation and colony formation of HCC cells and cause to cell cycle arrest. Using bio-informatic method and report assay we identified a novel miR-338-3p target, FOXP4 in HCC cells. Furthermore, knockdown of FOXP4 have the similar effects in HCC corrected with miR-338-3p. These findings suggest that miR-338-3p regulates survival of HCC cells partially through the downregulation of FOXP4. Therefore, targeting with the miR-338-3p/FOXP4 axis might serve as a novel therapeutic application to treat HCC patients.
