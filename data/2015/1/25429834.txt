Interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F are inflammatory cytokines, which play a critical function in inflammation. Genetic variations in the IL-17A and IL-17F genes may be associated with a risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a typical inflammation-related cancer. However, their relationship with HBV-related HCC has not been thoroughly investigated. We conducted a case-control study including 155 patients with HBV-related HCC and 171 healthy controls to assess the association between IL-17A rs4711998, IL-17A rs2275913, and IL-17F rs763780 polymorphisms and risk of HCC. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and DNA sequencing. There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-17A rs4711998, IL-17A rs2275913, and IL-17F rs763780 polymorphisms between the HBV-related HCC patients and healthy controls. However, our results revealed a statistically significant association between the ACA haplotype and increased HCC risk [odds ratio (OR) 1.820, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.181-2.624, P = 0.013]. In contrast, the GCG haplotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HBV-related HCC (OR 0.454, 95 % CI 0.112-0.898, P = 0.035). Our results suggest that IL-17A rs4711998, IL-17A rs2275913, and IL-17F rs763780 polymorphisms do not contribute to HBV-related HCC susceptibility independently. However, the ACA and GCG haplotypes in the IL-17 gene might be a risk factor and a protective marker, respectively, for HBV-related HCC in a Chinese population.
