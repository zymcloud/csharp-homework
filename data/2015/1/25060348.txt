Background:Fucosylation is one of the most important glycosylation events involved in cancer and inflammation. We previously developed a lectin antibody ELISA kit to measure fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt), which we identified as a novel cancer biomarker. In this study, we investigated Fuc-Hpt as a biomarker in chronic liver diseases, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We measured serum Fuc-Hpt levels using our ELISA kit in 318 patients with chronic liver diseases, including 145 chronic hepatitis (CH) patients, 81 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and 92 HCC patients. During a long-term follow-up period of 7 years (1996-2003), Fuc-Hpt levels were measured at three different time points in 19 HCC patients. Serum Fuc-Hpt levels were also examined with a short-term follow-up period of 3 years (2009-2012) in 13 HCC patients.Results:Fuc-Hpt levels increased with liver disease progression. Patients with LC and HCC showed significantly increased Fuc-Hpt levels in comparison to CH patients or healthy volunteers. Fuc-Hpt levels tended to be higher in HCC patients than in LC patients. Fuc-Hpt was better than Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3 for predicting HCC [diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound] in LC patients with long-term follow-up. More than 80% of LC patients with long-term follow-up showed increased Fuc-Hpt during hepatocarcinogenesis, and 38% of early-stage HCC patients with short-term follow-up showed a gradual increase in Fuc-Hpt before imaging diagnosis.Conclusions:These results suggest that Fuc-Hpt is a novel and potentially useful biomarker for predicting liver disease progression and HCC development.
