Background:VEGF signaling pathway inhibitor (anti-VEGF) therapy is associated with hypertension, but little is known about predisposing clinical characteristics. This study describes the real-world association between baseline clinical characteristics, blood pressure (BP) response, and survival in patients prescribed anti-VEGF therapies.Methods:Clinical data from Partners HealthCare in Massachusetts was obtained from adults treated with anti-VEGF therapies (2002-2013). Treatment-induced hypertensive response was defined as worsening of preexisting hypertension or new diagnosis of hypertension (if no prior hypertension history).Results:Data from 1120 patients with renal cell carcinoma (32.2%), hepatocellular carcinoma (11.6%), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (12.5%), and other sarcomas (15.3%) were analyzed. Most patients received sunitinib (52%), sorafenib (25.9%), or pazopanib (18%). A treatment-induced hypertensive response was identified in 49.7% of treated patients. Preexisting hypertension, present in 65.4%, was an independent risk factor for BP elevation (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.92); other risk factors included age ≥60 years (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06-1.52), and body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m(2) (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.53). Race, sex, anti-VEGF therapy prescribed, and baseline antihypertensive class were not significant risk factors. The absolute observed mean increase in BP was 21 mm Hg (systolic)/15 mm Hg (diastolic), both in patients with and without preexisting hypertension. The development of hypertension predicted improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89).Conclusions:Preexisting hypertension, age, and BMI identify patients at risk for significant anti-VEGF therapy-induced BP elevation. Hypertension appears to be a clinical biomarker of efficacy of anti-VEGF therapies in a broad range of malignancies.
