Sorafenib is an orally active, small-molecule multikinase inhibitor that blocks tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Studies have shown that it is a highly potent, selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor-Î², RAF, FLT-3, and c-Kit. This drug was recently approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a case of a patient treated with sorafenib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma who developed scrotal eczema.
