Objective:To date, sorafenib is the only approved systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pancreatic atrophy has recently been reported in 2 patients as a novel side effect after long-term sorafenib treatment.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed clinical and radiological data of patients with advanced HCC with long-term treatment of sorafenib (median 279 days, range 153-826 days). Pancreata were semi-manually segmented section by section to calculate the pancreas volumes before and under sorafenib treatment.Results:Sorafenib reduced pancreatic volume in 18/19 (95%) HCC patients with a mean pancreatic volume loss of 25% (p = 0.002). Pancreatic volume loss depended on the dose (r = 0.36) and exposure time of sorafenib (r = 0.35) and was detectable as early as after 3 months of sorafenib treatment and already after a cumulative sorafenib dose of Conclusion:We could confirm pancreatic atrophy as a novel adverse event of sorafenib therapy in HCC patients, correlating with sorafenib dose and exposure time.
