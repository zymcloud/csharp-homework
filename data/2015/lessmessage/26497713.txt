Basal cell adenocarcinomas (BCACs) of salivary glands are rare malignant neoplasms that mostly affect the major salivary glands. They are generally considered low-grade carcinomas that are locally destruc.tive and tend to recur, but only occasionally metastasize. Currently there are only a few reported cases of distant metastases from BCAC, and metastasis to the liver is not previously described. We report the first case of BCAC with histologically confirmed liver metastases. A 40-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of a painless swelling in the left buccal region. The lesion was completely resected, and the patient underwent postoperative radiotherapy. Permanent histology and immunohistochemical studies revealed a BCAC of the buccal minor salivary gland. After 14 months, two hepatic metastatic nodules were detected. The patient underwent a partial hepatectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy. No evidence of progressive disease or further recurrence was observed for 20 months after the hepatic metastasectomy. BCACs grow indolently and long-term survival can be expected. Surgery should be considered in selected patients as a therapeutic option in metastatic disease.
