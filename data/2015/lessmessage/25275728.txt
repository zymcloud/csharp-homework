Increasing evidence suggests that levels of angiogenic proteins within blood platelets change at the earliest stages of cancer development and may thus provide a promising diagnostic and prognostic tool. Patients with cirrhosis have increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to study whether development of HCC in hepatitis-related cirrhosis results in changes in platelet levels of angiogenic proteins. We studied the intraplatelet levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), endostatin, platelet factor 4 (PF4) and thrombospondin type 1 (TSP-1) in 38 consecutive patients with hepatitis B- or C-related liver cirrhosis with or without HCC in addition to plasma levels of the same proteins. Twenty healthy volunteers were included to establish reference values for the various tests. Intraplatelet levels of VEGF, bFGF, HGF and endostatin were significantly higher in patients compared to controls. Intraplatelet levels of PDGF, PF4 and TSP-1 were comparable between patients and controls. Plasma levels of VEGF, bFGF and endostatin were comparable between patients and controls. Plasma levels of PDGF, PF4 and TSP-1 were decreased in patients, but this difference disappeared when levels were corrected for platelet count. Intraplatelet and plasma levels of all proteins assessed were comparable between patients with and without HCC. In conclusion, the intraplatelet levels of some angiogenic proteins are elevated in cirrhosis, but do not discriminate between patients with and without HCC. Thus, intraplatelet levels of angiogenic proteins do not seem useful as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of HCC in cirrhotic patients.
