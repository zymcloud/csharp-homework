Background:The aim of our present study was to compare quality of life (QoL) between intermediate-stage (BCLC-B) HCC patients who had undergone either liver resection or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:A total of 102 intermediate-stage HCC patients participated in our study, including 58 who had undergone liver resection and 44 who had undergone TACE. Baseline demographic characteristics, tumor characteristics, and long-term outcomes, such as tumor recurrence, were compared and analyzed. QoL was assessed using the Short Form (SF)-36 health survey questionnaire with the mental and physical component scales (SF-36 MCS and PCS). This questionnaire was filled out at HCC diagnosis and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 months after surgery.Results:For the preoperative QoL evaluation, the 8 domains related to QoL were comparable between the two groups. The PCS and MCS scores were significantly decreased in both the TACE and resection groups at1 month after surgery, and this decrease was greater in the resection group. These scores were significantly lower in the resection group compared with the TACE group (PConclusions:Due to its effects on reducing HCC recurrence and improving long-term QoL, liver resection should be the first choice for the treatment of patients with intermediate-stage HCC.
