Background:About 10% of pancreatic cancer patients are aged ≤50 at diagnosis and defined as Early Onset Pancreatic Cancer (EOPC). There is limited information regarding risk factors for EOPC occurrence and their outcome.Aim:To investigate risk factors, presentation features and outcome of EOPC patients.Methods:Consecutive, histologically confirmed, pancreatic cancer patients enrolled. Data regarding environmental and genetic risk factors, clinical and pathological information, treatment and survival were recorded. EOPC patients (aged ≤50 at diagnosis) were compared to older subjects.Results:Twenty-five of 293 patients (8.5%) had EOPC. There was no difference regarding sex distribution, medical conditions and alcohol intake between EOPC and older subjects. EOPC patients were more frequently current smokers (56% vs 28% p = 0.001) and started smoking at a significantly lower mean age (19.8 years, 95%CI 16.7-22.9) as compared to older patients (26.1, 95%CI 24.2-28) (p = 0.001). Current smoking (OR 7.5; 95%CI 1.8-30; p = 0.004) and age at smoking initiation (OR 0.8 for every increasing year; 95%CI 0.7-0.9; p = 0.01) were significant and independent risk factors for diagnosis of EOPC. There were no differences regarding genetic syndromes and pancreatic cancer family history. EOCP presented less frequently with jaundice (16% vs 44%, p = 0.006) and had a higher rate of unresectable disease, albeit not significantly (84% vs 68%, p = 0.1). EOPC patients were more frequently fit for surgery or chemotherapy than their counterpart, resulting in similar stage-specific survival probability.Conclusion:EOPC seems related to active and early smoking but not to familial syndromes. Young patients display aggressive disease but not worse outcome.
