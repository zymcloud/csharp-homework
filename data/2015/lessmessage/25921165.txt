Objective:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in stage Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-A were grouped based on whether they were accompanied with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or not so as to explore the clinical characteristics and prognostic conditions of HCC patients with non-HBV/hepatitis C virus (HCV).Materials and methods:Clinical data of 64 stage BCLC-A HCC patients with non-HBV/HCV infection (observation group) who received radical hepatectomy in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from January, 2006 to November, 2014 were retrospectively analyzed and compared with those of 409 stage BCLC-A HCC patients with HBV infection (control group) in corresponding period.Results:The postoperative 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrent rates of the observation group were 25%, 38.6% and 48.8%, with postoperative mean and median disease-free survival time being 49.1 months and 62.0 months, respectively. Additionally, the postoperative 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of observation group were 90.1%, 72.7% and 62.0%, with the mean and median survival times being 54.4 months and 70.0 months, respectively.Conclusions:The 1-year recurrent rate is the highest in HCC patients with non-HBV/HCV, and almost half of the patients have recurrence within 1 year, after which the recurrent rate decreases along with the time.
