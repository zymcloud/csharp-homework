We investigated the clinical observations and the results of a comprehensive survey of 70 patients with ovarian cancer stage III-IV aged 30 to 70 years with the presence of endotoxemia. Integral assessment of prognosis and severity of the condition was performed according to SAPS II and SOFA. Infusion program included a preliminary correction of hypovolemia prior to surgery on the operating table in equal parts, HES and balanced crystalloid solutions, with in- creased infusion of 15% of blood volume based on the method of anesthesia. In the early postoperative period, infusion programs were complemented by various embodiments of metabolic correction. Patients of group-1 (n = 35) received remaxol in a dose of 800 mI/day. Patients of group-2 (n = 35) received ademethionine (heptral) 800 mg/day. Analysis of the results revealed that premorbid background in patients with ovarian cancer stage III-IV was characterized by hypovolemia, phenomena hepatopathy, and endotoxemia, and mixed forms of hypoxia of varying severity. Differentiated approach to the choice of pathogenesis-based perioperative infusion according to premorbid condition, anesthesia and blood loss contributed to the elimination of hypovolemia, favored efficient oxygen delivery and consumption, the ade- quacy of tissue oxygenation. Remaxol inclusion in the perioperative infusion programs in patients with ovarian cancer enhanced their clinical efficiency, reduced cytolytic and cholestatic syndromes, recovered of protein and synthetic liver function, reduced the appearance of mixedforms of hypoxia and endogenous intoxication.
