Chronic inflammation plays important role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, no antiinflammatory approach has shown its efficacy in preventing HCC occurrence in humans. Because tetra- and hexahydro isoalpha acids (THIAA and HHIAA) from hops elicit antiinflammatory properties, we evaluated these compounds for antitumor effects in vitro in human HCC cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7) and in vivo in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced animal model of HCC. In human HCC cell lines, THIAA and HHIAA reduced cell proliferation and viability which was associated with the inhibition of the NF-κB-DNA binding and tumor necrosis factor α mRNA expression. Both compounds also inhibited phosphorylation of the mTOR effector p70S6 kinase without affecting ERK, AKT, JNK, and GSK3β phosphorylation or activator protein-1 activation. In DEN-treated rats, administration of THIAA and HHIAA in food reduced the tumor numbers and the expression of the cellular transformation marker glutathione-S-transferase in the liver. In conclusion, THIAA and HHIAA show antitumor properties in vitro in human HCC cell lines as well as in vivo in a chemically induced animal model of HCC.
