AEG-1 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in all cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma. AEG-1 plays a seminal role in promoting cancer development and progression by augmenting proliferation, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and chemoresistance, all hallmarks of aggressive cancer. AEG-1 mediates its oncogenic function predominantly by interacting with various protein complexes. AEG-1 acts as a scaffold protein, activating multiple protumorigenic signal transduction pathways, such as MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin while regulating gene expression at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational levels. Our recent studies document that AEG-1 is fundamentally required for activation of inflammation. A comprehensive and convincing body of data currently points to AEG-1 as an essential component critical to the onset and progression of cancer. The present review describes the current knowledge gleaned from patient and experimental studies as well as transgenic and knockout mouse models, on the impact of AEG-1 on hepatocarcinogenesis.
