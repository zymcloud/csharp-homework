Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death, with a rising global incidence. The vast majority of HCC cases occur in the setting of liver cirrhosis, mainly due to chronic hepatitis C (HCV) or hepatitis B (HBV) viral infections, alcohol consumption, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The new approval of curative therapy with two NS5A inhibitors, ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, for the treatment of HCV will no doubt affect HCC incidence and outcome. No studies have evaluated the use of the new antivirals in patients with HCC. Staging and scoring remain an integral part of the management of patients with advanced HCC. Curative therapies for the treatment of HCC are evolving. Improvements in surgical techniques and risk stratification for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have expanded access and improved the outlook for patients suffering from HCC. Interventional locoregional treatments continue to play a key role in the management of HCC. Transarterial chemoembolization is considered the standard of care for patients with noninvasive multinodular tumors at the intermediate stage. Bland embolization appears to have similar virtues in some studies. Y90 radioembolization represents a promising treatment option for patients unfit or refractory to transarterial chemoembolization. The advent of sorafenib as a standard of care with an improvement in survival sadly remain the only major breakthrough in the treatment of advanced HCC, with mounting negative data from multiple clinical trials. Advances in immunotherapy and customized therapy may hopefully help reverse this tide.
