Intrahepatic bile duct adenoma (BDA) is a rare type of benign hepatic lesions. In this study, 4 cases of BDA diagnosed from surgical resection pathology were examined. Their clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were retrospectively analyzed. The 4 cases (1 men and 3 women) were aged 21 to 55 years without obvious clinical symptoms. Three were identified through routine examination. Three had a history of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Two cases were accompanied by hepatocellular carcinoma, and one had a higher level of Î±-fetoprotein. The MRI images of BDA all manifested as peripheral hepatic nodules with abnormal signals. The diameters of the lesions in the 4 cases were 7.7 to 17.0 mm. The MRI images showed slight hypointensity on T1WI and slight hyperintensity on T2WI in all cases, and they showed slight hyperintensity in 2 cases and hyperintensity in 2 cases on diffusion-weighted imaging. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans show hyperintensity in the arterial phase and slight hyperintensity in the late stage in 3 cases. The other case shows hyperintensity in the arterial and portal phases and isointensity at the delayed phase. During follow-up, 3 cases were recurrence-free. The other case was complicated by the reoccurrence of HCC. In general, BDA shows specific MRI characteristics, and peripheral hepatic nodules show slight hypointensity on T1WI and slight hyperintensity on T2WI. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans showed obvious enhancement in the arterial phase and continuous enhancement at the late stage.
