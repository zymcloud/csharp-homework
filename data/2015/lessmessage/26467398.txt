Purpose:We analyzed overall survival (OS) following radioembolization according to macroscopic growth pattern (nodular vs infiltrative) and vascular invasion in intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between September 2005 and November 2013, 104 patients (50.0% portal vein thrombosis [PVT], 29.8% infiltrative morphology) were treated.Results:Median OS differed significantly between patients with segmental and lobar or main PVT (p = 0.031), but was 17 months in both those with patent vessels and segmental PVT. Median OS did not differ for infiltrative and nodular HCC. Median OS was prolonged in patients with a treatment response at 3 months (p = 0.023). Prior TACE was also a significant predictor of improved OS.Conclusion:A further indication for radioembolization might be infiltrative HCC, since OS was similar to nodular types.
