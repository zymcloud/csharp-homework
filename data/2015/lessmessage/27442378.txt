Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the major etiologic agent of "non-A, non-B hepatitis" was discovered 26 years ago. Even before its discovery, interferon-Î± (IFN) was already being used for treatment of this infection. The next two decades saw a series of incremental improvements of the IFN therapies by extending the duration of therapy, using IFN in combination with oral ribavirin, using pegylated IFN with ribavirin, and most recently adding oral compounds that inhibit the HCV replication (directly acting antivirals - DAAs) to that regimen. DAAs target multiple steps in the HCV life cycle and are now used in combination to treat HCV infection without the need of IFN. These IFN-free, oral DAAs regimens are highly efficacious, have minimal toxicity and are given for short duration. Approved DAAs can cure more then 90% of persons with chronic HCV infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, these drugs are very expensive, and currently their exorbitant cost significantly restricts the access to this therapy for many HCV infected patients.
