Aims:This study was conducted in order to investigate the indications for hepatecomy for multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma (MNHCC) in single institution.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the medical records from 55 MNHCC patients, mainly with Child-Pugh A liver function, who underwent hepatectomy from January 2006 to December 2008. Both short- and long-term outcomes were analyzed. In addition, the prognostic significance of clinicopathological factors on overall survival (OS) was investigated by univariate analysis using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used in a subsequent multivariate analysis.Results:The perioperative morbidity rate (grade II or higher) was 18.2% (n = 10), and the in-hospital mortality rate was 3.6%. The median OS was 23.9 months (range, 2.5-84 months), whereas the median disease-free survival was 8.75 months (range, 1-65 months). Independent prognostic risk factors of 5-year OS included the number of tumors >2 (p = 0.032) and gross morphology indicating multiple tumor nodules scattered throughout the liver (p = 0.009).Conclusions:The postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were acceptable. The number of tumors >2 and gross morphology indicating multiple tumor nodules scattered throughout the liver were independent prognostic risk factors for patients with MNHCC after hepatectomy. Patients with both of these features had a very poor prognosis and were not considered suitable for surgery.
