Background/aims:For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within a single subsegment, the superiority of anatomical subsegmentectomy over non-anatomical partial resection is still controversial. In this study, we assessed the potential benefit of subsegmentectomy.Methodology:We selected 44 patients with a single HCC lesion within one subsegment who had undergone anatomical subsegmentectomy or non-anatomical partial resection from among 173 patients who underwent hepatectomy in our hospital from August 2003 to May 2013. We compared the results following anatomical subsegmentectomy (Group A; n = 16) and non-anatomical partial resection (Group N; n = 28).Results:One- and two-year survival rates were 92.5% and 89.3%, respectively; 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 88.9% and 69.1%, respectively. There was no significant difference in overall survival or RFS between the groups. However, among HBV-positive patients, RFS was significantly better for Group A than Group N (p = 0.008).Conclusions:For HBV-positive HCC within a single subsegment, we recommend subsegmentectomy.
