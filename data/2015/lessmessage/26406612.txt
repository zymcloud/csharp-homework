Objective:To evaluate balloon-occluded arterial stump pressure (BOASP), which is responsible for effective balloon-occluded transarterial chemoembolization (B-TACE), at each hepatic arterial level before B-TACE using a 1.8-French tip microballoon catheter for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:The BOASP at various embolization portions was retrospectively investigated. "Selective" and "non-targeted" BOASP was defined as the BOASP at the subsegmental or segmental artery and the lobar artery, respectively.Results:The measurement of the BOASP was carried out in 87 arteries in 47 patients. BOASP > 64 mmHg was revealed in the caudate lobe artery (A1) and the left medial segmental (A4), right anterior superior segmental (A8), anterior segmental, right and left hepatic arteries. Significant difference was noted in the incidence of BOASP above 64 mmHg between "non-targeted" and "selective" BOASP (p = 0.01). "Non-targeted" BOASP was significantly greater than "selective" BOASP (p = 0.0147). In addition, the BOASP in A1, 4, 8 and the anterior segmental arteries were significantly greater than in the other subsegmental and segmental arteries (p = 0.0007).Conclusion:"Non-targeted" B-TACE should be avoided to perform effective B-TACE and "selective" B-TACE at A1, 4, 8 and the anterior segmental arteries may become less effective than at the other segmental or subsegmental arteries.
