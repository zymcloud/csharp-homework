Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most common cancers in the world with a low survival rate. Our previous study showed Short chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1) could bind to HBsAg (HBs) and that ECHS1's localization in mitochondria induced HepG2 cell apoptosis. However, the role of the ECHS1 in energy metabolism and autophagy during hepatocellular carcinoma development remains undefined. We aimed to determine what ECHS1 does to energy metabolism and its effects on HCC progression. We performed CCK-8, EdU assays in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and HuH7) with stable ECHS1 knock-down. ATP and NADP+/NADPH levels were measured using an colorimetric assay. Our data demonstrated that ECHS1 silencing inhibited cell proliferation and induced autophagy. ECHS1 knockdown did not increase fatty acid synthesis, but decreased cellular ATP. This resulted in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and induced HCC cell autophagy. Our results showed that silencing ECHS1 to attenuate proliferation and induce autophagy may make it a novel cancer therapy target.
