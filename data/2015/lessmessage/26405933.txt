Liver cirrhosis is a predominant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the exact mechanism of the progression from cirrhosis to cancer remains unclear. The uptake of 2-[(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) is widely used as a marker of increased glucose metabolism to monitor the progression of cancer with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). Here we investigated the feasibility of using (18)F-FDG PET/CT in the diethylnitrosamine (DEN) mediated experimental hepatocellular carcinoma model. Rats received weekly intraperitoneal injections of DEN for 16 weeks for induction of HCC. We recorded starting from 0 days or 0 weeks after the last DEN injection. The weight and survival rate of rats were then measured. Also, an (18)F-FDG PET scan and serum analysis were performed at minus 2, 0, plus 2, and plus 4 weeks after the last DEN injection. The body weight of rats was maintained between 350 g and 370 g during 14 and 20 weeks, and the rats were euthanized at 35 days after the last DEN injection. The serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphate (ALP) were significantly higher at zero weeks after the last DEN injection. The (18)F-FDG uptake for the quantitative evaluation of HCC was done by measuring the region of interest (ROI). At minus two weeks after the last DEN injection, the ROI of rats had significantly increased compared to the normal group, in a time-dependent manner. These results suggest that FDG uptake serves as a good screening test to evaluate the feasibility of DEN-induced HCC.
