Objective:To characterize a chronic hepatitis B cohort based on initial and follow-up clinical evaluations.Methods:A retrospective and descriptive analysis of clinical and laboratory data from chronic HBsAg adult carriers, without HIV, unexposed to treatment, with at least two outpatient visits, between February 2006 and November 2012. Fisher´s exact test, χ², Wilcoxon, Spearman, multiple comparisons and Kappa tests were applied, the level of significance adopted was 5%, with a 95% confidence interval.Results:175 patients with mean age of 42.95±12.53 years were included: 93 (53.1%) were men, 152 (86.9%) were negative for hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), 3 (1.7%) had hepatitis C coinfection, 15 (8.6%) had cirrhosis, and 2 (1.1%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Genotype A predominated. Sixty-six patients (37.7%) had active hepatitis, 6 (3.4%) presented immune tolerance, and 38 (21.7%) were inactive carriers. Exacerbations and/or viral breakthrough were detected in 16 patients (9.1%). In 32 patients (18.3%), hepatitis B virus DNA remained persistently elevated and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal, whereas in 17 (9.7%), there was low hepatitis B virus DNA and alterated alanine aminotransferase. If only initial alanine aminotransferase and hepatitis B virus DNA values were considered, 15 cases of active hepatitis would not have been detected. Advanced fibrosis was more common in HBeAg-positive patients, and it was significantly associated with transaminases, hepatitis B virus DNA, and age.Conclusion:Many patients had active hepatitis, but almost 25%, who were HBeAg non-reactive, were only identified because of combined analyses of the hepatitis B virus DNA and transaminases levels, sometimes associated with histological data, after clinical follow-up.
