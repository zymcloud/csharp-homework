Objective:This study aims to explore the clinical effectiveness of a combination therapy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) abutting the diaphragm.Material and methods:Six cases with HCC were treated with TACE followed by PMCT one month later with the aid of artificial pneumothorax.Results:CT/MRI revealed complete necrosis in the tumor lesions and the treated tumor margins (â‰¥ 5 mm). Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels markedly declined in patients who originally had higher serum AFP levels. Postoperative complications such as fever, mild hepatic dysfunction and pleural effusion were alleviated within a short period of time. All patients were closely monitored through follow-up; all patients survived, except for one patient who received a liver transplantation.Conclusions:As lesions are either invisible or poorly visible in sonography, determining an effective treatment for HCC abutting the diaphragm remains a particular challenge. TACE and PMCT combined therapy with the aid of artificial pneumothorax proved to be an available treatment option.
