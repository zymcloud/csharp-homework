A purpose of this research is the study of spontaneous cytotoxic activity of effector cells (EC) of the innate immunity of animals against target cells (TC) of cultured hepatoma. There are established differences in the cytotoxic potential of freshly non-activated mouse and rat splenocytes: TC exhibit resistance to splenocytes of mice C3HA and are exposed to active dose-dependent killing under the influence of splenocytes outbred rats. There were revealed two mechanisms of killing of clip-target by splenocytes of rats--secretory variant (Zajdel hepatoma) and the path of classical apoptosis (hepatomas HTC, MH-22a and BWTG3). Single intraperitoneal administration of anticancer drugs cyclophosphamide (CP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to animals inhibits secretory pathway, whereas the activity of the apoptotic mechanism is enhanced after administration of CF to animals and is unchanged under the action of 5-FU.
