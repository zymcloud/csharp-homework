Background:Primary sarcoma of the prostate is extremely rare and accounts for 0.1% of all prostate cancers. This type of cancer is associated with poor prognosis due to aggressive biological behavior. The World Health Organization histologically classified prostate sarcomas as stromal tumor of unknown malignant potential (STUMP) and stromal sarcoma.Patients and methods:A 39-year-old patient presented with lower urinary tract symptoms over the last few months. On digital rectal examination, the right lobe of the prostate was diffusely hard on palpation. Prostate-specific antigen was 0.5 ng/ml. A biopsy specimen was obtained with the guidance of transrectal ultrasonography. Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive staining for vimentin, actin, and desmin.Results:(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography/computed tomography scans obtained for staging purposes with the diagnosis of primary spindle cell carcinoma of the prostate revealed widespread lung and liver metastases. A doxorubicin-based systemic chemotherapy (CTx) was initiated.Conclusion:Spindle sarcomas of the prostate have quite aggressive nature and they have high potential to metastase. Average life expectancy is <1 year and the prognosis is poor. CTx and radiation therapy can't yield curative effects due to poor differentiation.
