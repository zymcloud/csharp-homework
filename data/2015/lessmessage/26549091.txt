Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) of the liver is uncommon, only 20 cases have been reported in the English-language literature so far, and the majority has been identified as cholangiocarcinomas, only four cases were hepatocellular LELC. Here we described a rare case of lymphoepithelioma-like hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A 42-year-old Chinese female who was incidentally found to have a liver-occupying lesion during a routine medical examination. Ultrasonography revealed a 47 mm × 33 mm × 36 mm hypoechoic mass in the left lobe. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging displayed a nodular lesions in the left liver lobe. The patient underwent a left-side hepatectomy. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed an undifferentiated carcinoma with a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, predominantly composed of CD3(+) T cells, morphologically similar to nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CK, EMA, Glypican-3 and hepatocyte, but negative for alpha-fetoprotein, CK19, CK7 and CK20. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in situ hybridization was negative. The final histopathological diagnosis was lymphoepithelioma-like HCC without EBV infection.
