Background:Sweden's western region has successively introduced the use of validated non-invasive diagnostic algorithms and treatment allocation for hepatocellular cancer (HCC). The aim was to analyse whether between 2000 and 2011 these changes in strategy had an impact on survival.Methods:Data concerning diagnosis, survival and treatment for 687 individuals with HCC were retrieved from the regional cancer centre's register and hospital charts. The 12-year period was divided into three four-year cohorts (A-B-C).Results:There was an increase in the crude incidence rate of HCC from 2.7 to 4.2 per 100 000 inhabitants (p Discussion:Overall survival improved when more patients had APT, mainly trans arterial chemoembolisation (TACE).
