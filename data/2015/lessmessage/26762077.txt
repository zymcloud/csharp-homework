Aim:To estimate treatment of patients with hepatocellular cancer after transarterial chemoembolization as independent curative method, "bridge" to liver transplantation and in the context of combined therapy.Material and methods:We presented an experience of transarterial chemoembolization in treatment of 29 patients with hepatocellular cancer. Curative procedures were performed in the context of independent therapy, "bridge" to liver transplantation and combined treatment. It was performed 48 procedures in all. 44.9% of patients underwent one and two procedures, 10.2%--three performances. Mean interval between procedures was 76.2±116.2 days (range 8-139 days).Results:Post-embolization syndrome including fervescence, nausea and pain was observed in 24.1% after 1st stage, in 50% and 33.3% after 2nd and 3rd stages respectively. Mean time of expectation of liver transplantation in bridge therapy group was 8.5±6.8 months (range 1-20 months). Median survival after transarterial chemoembolization in monotherapy group was 9 months.
