The objective of this study was to establish modified cutoff values of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) according to hepatitis status. While AFP is used as a serum marker in the diagnosis or monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its use as a screening method to the general population is controversial. We evaluated its screening performance in a hepatitis prevalent East Asian population, and suggest different cutoff values according to the individual's hepatitis status. We evaluated the performance of AFP as a screening test in 48,123 consecutive Koreans during the period from March, 2012 to August, 2013 who underwent routine health checks at a single institution. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated with fixed cutoff and with modified cutoffs according the individual's hepatitis status. A total of 24 out of 48,123 subject (0.05%) were newly diagnosed with HCC after screening. Among the 1,874 subject with positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), 17 (0.91%) developed HCC, compared with two out of 393 (0.51%) individuals with hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV). Five out of 45,855 (0.01%) subject with neither HBsAg nor anti-HCV developed HCC. Compared to the performance of a fixed cutoff, specificity, PPV, and NPV improved without sacrificing sensitivity when applying modified cutoff. In conclusion, our findings suggest that AFP with modified cutoffs according to the individual's hepatitis status might be a useful screening marker for HCC in hepatitis prevalent areas.
