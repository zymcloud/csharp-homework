Background:Recent studies have demonstrated that MALAT1 is involved in cancer metastasis and recurrence and it is up-regulated in cervical cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer. However, the role of MALAT1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still unclear.Methods:The expression of MALAT1 was evaluated in cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal tissue samples from 77 middle thoracic ESCC patients who received radical surgical resection using QRT-PCR. The correlations between the expression levels of MALAT1 and clinical-pathological features and Patients' survival were also analysed.Results:MALAT1 expression was increased in ESCC tissue than in adjacent normal tissue samples (PConclusions:Our results showed that MALAT1 expression may serve as a predictive marker for middle thoracic ESCC patients who have been received radical resection.
