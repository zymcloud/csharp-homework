To clarify the association between microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene (EPHX1) Tyr113His polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, a meta-analysis was performed. Overall, EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism was associated with increased risk of HCC. Subgroup analyses by status of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls further confirmed this association. Through a literature search, 119 relevant records were identified, and 17 individual case-control studies from 13 publications were finally included, involving a total of 1,480 HCC cases and 2,564 controls. In subgroup analyses, increased associations were found in Asians, Caucasians, hepatitis B virus (HBV)- dominant areas, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-dominant areas, high-rate areas of HCC, and medium-rate areas of HCC, but not in Africans and low-rate areas of HCC, respectively. This meta-analysis suggests that EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism contributes to HCC risk.
