Background:Hepatitis C, caused by a single-stranded RNA virus, has become a global health problem. Infecting millions of individuals in the United States alone, chronic HCV infection can lead to devastating medical problems including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These problems create millions of dollars in health-care costs for treatment and management. This study determines the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment with the new generation of oral protease inhibitors.Methods:A Markov model was constructed to simulate the progression of genotype-1 chronic hepatitis C disease in a cohort of 50-year-old patients. A decision tree, along with the Markov model, was then used to determine duration of disease, treatment success, progression of disease and mortality. At the end of each stage in the model, the cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were summed for each individual. These were then used to calculate the overall cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) using QALY as the unit of effectiveness. Four treatment options were modelled: sofosbuvir with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (SOF/PEG-IFN+RBV), sofosbuvir with ribavirin (SOF/RBV), simeprevir with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin (SMV/PEG-IFN+RBV) and simeprevir with sofosbuvir (SMV/SOF).Results:SOF/PEG-IFN+RBV yielded a CER ratio of $6,796.22/QALY, SMV/PEG-IFN+RBV of $7,642.60/QALY and SMV/SOF of $8,959.11/QALY. SOF/RBV had a higher CER of $16,295.30/QALY. It is important to note however that SMV/SOF had the highest QALY at 19.08.Conclusions:After consideration of quality of life, treatment regimens and treatment side effects, the SMV/SOF regimen yields acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios with high QALY.
