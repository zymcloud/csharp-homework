Objective:To evaluate the effect on image quality and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from choice of either free-breathing (FB) or navigator-triggered (NT) diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging.Methods:Thirty patients with 37 small HCCs underwent IVIM DW imaging using 12 b values (0-800 s/mm) with 2 sequences: NT, FB. A biexponential analysis with the Bayesian method yielded true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) in small HCCs and liver parenchyma. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was also calculated. The acquisition time and image quality scores were assessed for 2 sequences. Independent sample t test was used to compare image quality, signal intensity ratio, IVIM parameters, and ADC values between the 2 sequences; reproducibility of IVIM parameters, and ADC values between 2 sequences was assessed with the Bland-Altman method (BA-LA).Results:Image quality with NT sequence was superior to that with FB acquisition (P = 0.02). The mean acquisition time for FB scheme was shorter than that of NT sequence (6 minutes 14 seconds vs 10 minutes 21 seconds Â± 10 seconds P Conclusions:The NT DW imaging technique offers no advantage in IVIM parameters measurements of small HCC except better image quality, whereas FB technique offers greater confidence in fitted diffusion parameters for matched acquisition periods.
