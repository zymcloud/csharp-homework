Background/aims:The characteristics of multiple nudules in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) after curative liver resection remain obscure. We compare the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses between patients with hepatic lesions with multicentric occurrence (MO) and intrahepatic metastasis (IM) at the time of surgical resection.Methodology:The histopathologic features of multiple tumors from 198 patients of HCC were analyzed and divided into MO group (n = 51, 25.8%) for multicentric HCCs and an IM group (n = 147, 74.2%) in cases with intrahepatic metastases. Overall survival rate, disease-free survival and clinicopathologic differences were compared between the two groups.Results:Microvascular invasion and increased tumor size were the most important factors discriminating the IM group from the MO group (P Conclusions:Among HCCs, the prognosis of patients with MO is significantly better than that of patients with IM.
