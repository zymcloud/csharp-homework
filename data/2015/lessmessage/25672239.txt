Background/aim:Galectins affect diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes such as development, inflammation, and tumor growth. We aimed to compare serum galectin-3 levels in three patient groups with chronic hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV), cirrhosis secondary to HBV or HCV, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to HBV or HCV and evaluate the role of galectin-3 during HCC progression.Patients and methods:Nineteen patients with hepatocellular cancer, 22 patients with cirrhosis, and 24 patients with chronic hepatitis B and C were included in this study. Serum galectin-3 levels in different liver diseases were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:The mean galectin-3 levels were 4.61 ng/mL (±2.32) in HCC patients, 5.68 ng/mL (±2,2) in cirrhotic patients, 1.98 ng/mL (±1.50) in chronic viral hepatitis group. There were no statistical differences between HCC and cirrhotic patients (P = 0.5), but lower in chronic hepatitis group statistically compared with cirrhosis and HCC (P Conclusion:Serum galectin-3 levels in patients with chronic HBV or HCV may guide us about progression to cirrhosis or HCC and prognosis of the disease. Especially, galectin-3 levels may be more pronounced in case of HCV.
