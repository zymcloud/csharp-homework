Background:Epidermal growth factor-like domain multiple 7 (EGFL7), recently identified as a secreted protein regulated by oxygen exposure, plays a critical role in promoting metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is widely used for treatment of HCC, resulting in hypoxia in tumors and surrounding liver tissues. Accordingly, we proposed the hypothesis that there could be a relationship between expression of EGFL7 and response to TAE.Materials and methods:We established a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model using percutaneous puncture technique guided by computed tomography. TAE and sham embolization were performed and the results were confirmed by MRI 3 weeks after inoculation. We investigated the EGFL7 expression of the two groups at 6h and 3 days after intervention by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.Results:Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the levels of EGFL7 protein significantly increased in the TAE-treated tumors compared with the control group at 6 hours (P=0.031) and 3 days (P=0.020) after intervention. Meanwhile, the relative EGFL7 protein detected in TAE group also up-regulated compared with the control group at 6 hours (P=0.020) and 3 days (P=0.024) after intervention.Conclusions:This study reveals an increase of EGFL7 expression in rabbit VX2 liver tumors after TAE. The role of EGFL7 in HCC, especially its biological behavior after TAE, needs further investigation.
