Objective:Our aim was to identify potential correlations between activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and immune system's cells in patients with viral C hepatocellular carcinoma, by quantifying the percentage of activated HSCs, T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells and B-lymphocytes, in three distinct regions: tumor, transition area and the vicinity tissue (2-5 mm).Patients and methods:We prospectively included 20 samples prelevated at necropsy from patients with HCC and C viral infection. We assessed the percentage of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), CD45RO, NK1 and CD20 expression using immunohistochemistry and a semi-quantitative scoring method.Results:We found an inverse correlation between the number of α-SMA-positive HSCs and the number of NK1-positive cells in tumor (p=0.0007), in the transition area/tumor capsule (p=0.024) and in the vicinity tissue (p=0.038). Regarding T-lymphocytes, we have also identified an inverse correlation with the number of α-SMA-positive HSCs in tumor (p=0.0036), in the transition area/tumor capsule (p=0.034) and in the vicinity tissue (p=0.047). We found no correlation between the number of activated HSCs and the number of CD20-positive cells in all three examined areas.Conclusions:The analysis of HSCs activity within specified areas of tumoral liver tissue may lead to new perspectives in early diagnosis of relapses and in the development of future neoadjuvant therapies.
