Purpose:This study investigated correlations between polymorphisms in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and the risk of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC).Methods:Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DNA MMR genes MLH3 (rs175080), PMS1 (rs5742933), PMS2 (rs1059060), MSH3 (rs26279), MSH5 (rs1150793, rs2075789) and MSH6 (rs1042821) were detected using the SNaPshot method in 250 PHC cases and in 308 patients without PHC in the Han population in northern China.Results:The AA genotype in MLH3 (rs175080) increased the risk of PHC (odds ratio [OR] = 3.424; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.097-10.689). The AG and GG genotypes in MSH3 (rs26279) increased the risk of PHC (OR: 1.644 and 3.300; 95% CI: 1.112-2.428 and 1.765-6.168, respectively). The AA genotype in MSH5 (rs2075789) increased the risk of PHC (OR: 9.229; 95% CI: 1.174-72.535). The CT genotype in MSH6 (rs1042821) reduced the risk of PHC (OR: 0.629; 95% CI: 0.428-0.924).Conclusions:Our study suggests that polymorphisms in MLH3 (rs175080), MSH3 (rs26279), MSH5 (rs2075789) and MSH6 (rs1042821) may be independent risk factors for PHC.
