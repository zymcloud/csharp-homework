Background:This analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Trans-arterial Chemo- Embolization (TACE) in treating Elderly patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (EHPC).Methods:Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of TACE on response and safety for patients with EHPC were identified by using a predefined search strategy. Pooled response rate of treatment were calculated.Results:In TACE based regimen, clinical studies which including patients with EHPC were considered eligible for the evaluation of response. And, in these TACE based treatments, pooled analysis suggested that, in all 288 patients whose response could be assessed, the pooled reponse rate was 29.5%(85/288) in TACE based treatment. The most commonly encountered TACE-related morbidity was liver function impairment. No grade III or IV renal or liver toxicity were observed. No treatment related death occurred in EHPC patients with TACE based treatments.Conclusion:This evidence based analysis suggests that TACE based treatments are associated with mild response rate and accepted toxicities for treating patients with EHPC.
