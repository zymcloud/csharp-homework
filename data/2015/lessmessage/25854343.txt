CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in regulation of immnue response and maintenance of self-tolerance. Studies have found Tregs could suppress tumor-specific T cell-mediated immune response and promote cancer progression. Depletion of Tregs can enhance antitumor immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells and capable of activating antigen-specific immune responses, which make them ideal candidate for cancer immunotherapy. Now various DC vaccines are considered as effective treatment for cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate variation of Tregs in BALB/C mice with hepatocellular carcinoma and investigate the interaction between tumor-derived Tregs, effector T cells (Teff) and splenic DCs. We found the percentages of Tregs/CD4+ in the peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice were higher than in normal mice. Tumor-derived Tregs diminished the up-regulation of costimulatory molecule expression on splenic DCs, even in the presence of Teff cells and simultaneously inhibited IL-12 and TNF-Î± secretion by DCs.
