Background:Chemotherapy-induced toxic liver injury is a relevant issue in the clinical management of patients affected with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This retrospective study evaluated patterns of liver toxicity in patients treated with FOLinic acid, Fluorouracil, IRInotecan (FOLFIRI)-based regimens.Methods:One hundred and fifty-six mCRC patients treated at the University Campus Bio-Medico between January 2003 and January 2013 were included in this retrospective analysis. All patients received a FOLFIRI backbone-based chemotherapy. Basal liver enzymes levels were assessed before starting the treatment and before every therapy course. R ratio and the aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio were calculated.Results:Ninety-one patients were male versus 55 female, and the median age of the population was 62 years (range: 38-83). Most patients had liver involvement at the beginning of first-line regimen (101 patients, 64.74%) and 59 patients had received a previous 5-FU based therapy in the adjuvant setting (37.82%). Aspartate aminotransferase level (167.87 vs 41.05 U/l; p < 0.001), Alanine aminotransferase level (94.48 vs 39.80 U/l; p = 0.004) and alkaline phosphatase (289.0 vs 172.44 U/l; p = 0.02) were significantly increased during the first 3 months of treatment. In the entire population, the calculated R ratio was 3.96 (95% CI: 3.25-4.51). In all three regimens, the calculated R ratio was between 2 and 5, without any statistical differences.Conclusions:FOLFIRI-based hepatotoxicity has been indirectly defined as a mixed pattern injury in all three regimens evaluated.
