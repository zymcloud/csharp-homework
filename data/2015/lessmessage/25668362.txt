Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major pathological type of primary liver cancer. Sorafenib has demonstrated definite efficacy in targeted therapy for HCC. However, when treatment with sorafenib fails, suitable drugs must be found for further treatment. This article reports a case of an HCC patient who was treated with angiogenesis inhibitor axitinib and c-Met inhibitor cabozantinib following treatment with sorafenib. The report focuses on clinical treatment and toxicity. Rational application of targeted therapy is also explored.
