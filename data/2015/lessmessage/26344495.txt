Background/aims:The prognostic value of circulating tumor cells (CTC) detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is currently under debate. We conducted a meta-analysis of available studies to assess its prognostic value for patients diagnosed with HCC.Methods:Medline, Ovid Database, Embase, The Science Citation Index, and Cochrane library, search was conducted on all studies reporting the outcomes of interest. The studies were set up according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Using a random-effects model, meta-analysis was performed using hazard ratio (HR), risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) as effect measures. Heterogeneity of the studies was tested for each pooled analysis. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.Results:twenty-three published studies that matched the selection criteria were included in this meta-analysis. CTC positivity was significantly associated with Relapse free survival (RFS) (HR 3.03, 95% CI: [1.89-4.86]; pConclusion:CTC positivity indicates poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and associated with poor clinicopathologic parameters.
