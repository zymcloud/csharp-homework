Background:Mannose-binding lectin2 (MBL2) is implicated in the host immune response, but there are limited data about MBL2 polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the MBL2 rs7096206 polymorphism and HCC risk in a Chinese Han population.Methods:A population-based case-control study of 220 HCC patients and 220 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects from a Chinese Han population was conducted. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples, and the presence of the MBL2 polymorphism rs7096206 was assessed using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Conditional logistic regression was performed to assess the risk of HCC by determining odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:The odds of HCC among carriers of CG and GG genotypes were 7.33 (95% CI, 2.53-21.29) and 12.48 (95% CI, 2.08-74.90), respectively. In the dominant genetic model, GG+CG carriers had an approximately 8-fold increased risk (95% CI, 2.83-22.62) compared with those with the CC genotype. The G allele was significantly associated with elevated HCC risk, with an odds ratio of 6.83 (95% CI, 2.90-16.10).Conclusions:Our findings suggest that the MBL2 polymorphism rs7096206 is associated with HCC susceptibility and has the potential to serve as a biomarker to detect populations at increased HCC risk.
