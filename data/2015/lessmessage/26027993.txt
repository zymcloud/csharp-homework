Lung metastasis showing radiographic findings of air-space consolidation is considered to be rare. This report describes the case of a man with progressive left lower lobe air-space consolidation with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma. The pulmonary lesion was initially suspected to be infection and later clinically diagnosed as primary adenocarcinoma of the lung. Although the patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy, the disease progressed very rapidly. A postmortem examination revealed that the alveolar spaces were filled with neoplastic cells subsequently proven to be metastases of combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma.
