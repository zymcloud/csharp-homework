Alcohol is a well-established risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, and the mechanisms by which alcohol liver cancer is complex. It has been suggested that ethanol (EtOH) metabolism may enhance tumor progression by increasing hepatocyte proliferation. To test this hypothesis, ethanol (EtOH) feeding of male mice began 7 weeks post-injection of the chemical carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and continued for 16 weeks, with a final EtOH concentration of 28% of total calories. As expected, EtOH increased the total number of cancerous foci and liver tumors identified in situ fixed livers from the EtOH+DEN group compared to corresponding pair-fed (PF)+DEN and chow+DEN control groups. In the EtOH+DEN group, tumor multiplicity corresponded to a 3- to 4-fold increase in proliferation and immunohistochemical staining of Î²-catenin in non-tumorigenic hepatocytes when compared to the PF+DEN and chow+DEN groups, p
