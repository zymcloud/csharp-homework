The reaction of sodium 2-cyano-ethylene-1-thiolate salts with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-D-gluco- and D-galactopyranosyl bromides and with 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-D-xylo-. and L-arabinopyranosyl bromides, respectively, afforded new thioglycosides. Heating of the resultout glycosides with hydrazine produced pyrazole derivatives. The cytotoxicities toward the hepatoma cell line (HEPG2) of some synthesized compounds were tested. Some compounds showed high cytotoxic activity against (HEPG2) cell line. The OH moieties in the free glycosides were vital for potency. The synthesis procedures, spectroscopic data and antitumor activities for the prepared compounds are reported herein.
Acyclic thioglycosides; HEPG2; antitumor activity; sodium 2-cyano-ethylene-1-thiolates.
