Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest primary malignant cancer of the liver in the world. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels reflect hepatic function and are inversely correlated with the severity of background chronic liver disease.Objective:This study evaluated whether basal serum IGF-1 levels can predict prognosis of HCC patients according to different risks of disease progression.Materials and methods:A total of 89 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were recruited in 3 groups: Group I, 30 HCC patients receiving sorafinib; Group II, 30 HCC patients with best supportive care; and Group III include 29 patients undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). All patients were investigated for serum levels of AST, ALP, Bb, Cr, BUN, AFP and IGF-I.Results:Patients with disease control had significantly higher baseline IGF-1 levels 210 (185-232.5) ng/mL (p valueConclusions:The levels of serum IGF-1, expressed as continuous values, may be helpful for accurately assessing hepatic function and the prognostic stratification of patients with HCC.
