The aim of this work was the retrospective study of the frequency of infections in surgically treated oncologic patients.Material and methods:Our research included 753 oncologic patients treated at the Second Surgical Clinic of the Regional Institute of Oncology, Ia≈üi, between January 2013 and December 2014, with the selection of cases which had infectious complications.Results:The lot of patients was structured in 7 age groups and the most frequent oncologic patients had ages between 60-79 years. The most frequent malignancies were large bowel, breast, rectal, esophageal cancers, malignant hemopathies, gastric and liver malignant tumors. In our lot of 753 oncologic patients we depicted 113 (15.01%) infections.Conclusions:Our study proved that the anatomic location of the cancer, the hospitalization duration and the number of the hospitalizations has an important role in appearance of the infectious complications. The gastrointestinal malignant tumors were the most frequent malignancies associated with postoperative infections. The patients with gastrointestinal cancers from urban area, with ages between 50 and 79 years had the highest risk of infectious complications. For main causative organism was proved a high sensitivity for colistin. Clinical, paraclinical and epidemiological exams did not emphasize any decisive factors; we took into account the risks of infection during multiple pre-, intra- and postoperative procedures; all these have been associated with increased receptivity of immunosuppressed oncologic patients.
