Purpose:To evaluate efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:During January 2009 to March 2012, 80 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent TACE, with or without RFA. Alfa- fetoprotein (AFP) was checked before and after procedure. CT scans were obtained one month after TACE or RFA for all patients to evaluate tumor changes. Complete response+partial response+stable disease (CR+PR+SD)/n were used to assess the disease control rate (DCR). Survival at 3, 6 and 12 months was compared in both groups.Results:AFP levels in TACE + RFA group dropped rapidly, becoming obviously lower than that of the TACE group. In the TACE + RFA group DCR was 93.8%, while only 76.8% in the TACE group. The treatment effect between the two groups was statistically significant (PConclusions:TACE and RFA as combined therapy method for patients with middle and terminal stage HCC gives full play to synergy between the two and improves the therapeutic effect.
