Objectives:Intrahepatic recurrence is the major cause of death among patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)- related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative surgical resection. Several approaches have been reported to decrease the recurrence rate. The objective of our study was to compare the clinical effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with interferon-alpha (IFN-α) therapy on recurrence after hepatic resection in patients with HBV-related HCC with that of TACE chemotherapy alone.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the data from 228 patients who were diagnosed with HBV-related HCC and underwent curative resection between January 2001 to December 2008. The patients were divided into TACE (n = 126) and TACE-IFN-α (n = 102) groups for postoperative chemotherapy. The TACE regimen consisted of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (DDP) , and the emulsion mixed with mitomycin C (MMC) and lipiodol. The recurrence rates, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and risk of recurrence were evaluated.Results:The clinicopathological parameters and adverse effects were similar between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The median OS for the TACE- IFN-α group (36.3 months) was significantly longer than that of the TACE group (24.5 months, P Conclusions:The use of the TACE and IFN-α combination chemotherapy after curative hepatic resection safely and effectively improves OS and decreases recurrence in patients with HBV-related HCC who are at high risk. Our findings can serve as a guide for the selection of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with HBV-related HCC who are at high risk of recurrence.
