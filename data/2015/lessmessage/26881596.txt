The combination of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare, and the prognosis for patients with these two cancers is poor. In the past decade, molecular targeted therapy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have emerged and these treatments are now playing an increasingly important role in the management of patients with advanced primary RCC and HCC. In this case report, a 72-year-old male patient diagnosed as having RCC invading the renal vein and grade I-II HCC was treated with RFA and sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). After 3 months of this combination treatment, an evaluation of his target lesions showed stable disease (SD), and progression-free survival (PFS) times were 28 months weeks for RCC and 16 months weeks for HCC. Overall survival (OS) was 40 weeks.
