Background:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem in the Asia-Pacific region including Thailand. Several factors have been proposed as contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis. This study was aimed to investigate the impact of CYP2C19 genotypic polymorphism in HCC related to chronic HBV infection in Thailand.Materials and methods:A cross-sectional study was performed between April 2014 and January 2015. Chronic HBV patients with HCC (n=50) and without HCC (n=50) were included. Clinical information and blood samples of all patients were collected. The CYP2C19 genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method, and was classified as rapid metabolizer (RM), intermediate metabolizer (IM) or poor metabolizer (PM).Results:The CYP2C19 genotype frequencies of RM, IM and PM in HBV patients were found to be 19/50 (38%), 25/50 (50%) and 6/50 (12%), respectively. The CYP2C19 genotype frequencies of RM, IM and PM in HBV with HCC patients were 21/50 (42%), 25/50 (50%) and 4/50 (8%), respectively. The distribution of CYP2C19 genotype was not different between patients with and without HCC. Interestingly, among HBV with HCC patients, the RM genotype of CYP2C19 tended to increase risk of aggressive manifestation (OR=2.89, 95%CI=0.76-11.25, P-value = 0.07), compared with non RM genotype carriers.Conclusions:CYP2C19 genotype IM was the most common genotype in Thai patients with chronic HBV infection. In addition, genotype RM could be an associated factor for aggressive presentation in HCC related to chronic HBV infection.
