A 66-year-old man was admitted to undergo treatment for the sudden onset of hypogastric pain radiating to the left flank. Based on the clinical presentation and radiological findings, left adrenal hemorrhage secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed. Although the patient was hemodynamically stable, anemia progressed over the first four days after admission and a blood transfusion was subsequently initiated, which was effective. According to the results of interval imaging with computed tomography, elective transcatheter embolization (TAE) was performed nine days after admission to treat the bleeding from the adrenal tumor. After TAE, the patient's abdominal pain resolved, with no further progression of anemia.
