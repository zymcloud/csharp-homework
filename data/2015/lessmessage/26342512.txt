Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance for the evaluation of hepatic lesions is increasingly being used in clinical practice, especially in patients with suspicious focal lesions, whether benign or malignant. In regard to hepatocellular carcinoma, the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance through the «conventional» protocols and multi-detector computerized tomography consisting of multiphase evaluation with intravenous contrast, largely depends on the size of the lesion. They are more reliable in lesions>2cm. However, in lesions measuring 1-2cm, establishing the definitive diagnosis is a real challenge, with sensitivity values of 45-65%, but generally with excellent specificity (>95%). Furthermore, if the lesion has a diameter
