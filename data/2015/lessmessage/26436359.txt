Background and rationale for the study. Continuing search for suitable tumor-markers is of clinical value in managing patients with various malignancies. These markers may be presented as intracellular substances in tissues or may be released into the circulation and appear in serum. Therefore, this work is concerned with identification and quantitative determination of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and fibronectin and estimating their performances as surrogate markers for identifying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:A total of 627 individuals constituted this study [fibrosis (F1-F3) = 217; cirrhosis = 191; HCC = 219]. Western-blot was used for identifying EMA and fibronectin in sera. As a result, a single immunoreactive band was shown at 130-kDa and 90-kDa corresponding to EMA and fibronectin, respectively. They were quantified using ELISA providing values in HCC higher than fibrosis or cirrhosis with a significant difference (P Conclusions:A four-marker index may improve the early detection of HCC with a high degree of accuracy.
