Background:For the determination of creatine kinase (CK)-MB, the immunoinhibition method is utilized most commonly. However, the estimated CK-MB activity may be influenced by the presence of CK isoenzymes in some conditions like cancer. Thus, a CK-MB-to-total-CK ratio more than 1.0 could be found in such a situation. The study aimed to explore the relationship of cancer to high CK-MB-to-total-CK ratio.Materials and methods:From January 2011 to December 2014, laboratory data on all CK-MB and total CK test requests were extracted at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (88,415 requests). Patients with a CK-MB-to-total-CK ratio more than 1.0 were registered in this study. Clinical data including tumor location, tumor TNM stage and metastatic status were also collected.Results:A total of 846 patients were identified with a CK-MB-to-total-CK ratio more than 1.0. Of these, 339 (40.1%) were diagnosed with malignancies. The mean CK-MB-to-total-CK ratio was significantly higher in malignancy than in non-malignancy (1.35±0.28 vs 1.25±0.23, pConclusions:The CK-MB-to-total-CK ratio is an easily available indicator and could be clinically utilized as a primary screening tool for cancer. Higher ratio of CK-MB-to-total-CK was specifically associated with certain malignancies, like colorectal cancer, lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as some cancer-associated status factors such as advanced stage and liver metastasis.
