Purpose:We report the efficacy of percutaneous ultrasound (US) examination using a novel real-time virtual sonography (RVS) method that collates multiple Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data sources and displays reference images in color.Materials and methods:A total of 7 patients with 9 hepatocellular carcinomas were evaluated. Using the SYNAPSE VINCENT volume analyzer, DICOM data of the portal vein, hepatic vein, tumor, and hepatic segment were isolated from contrast-enhanced computed tomography DICOM data. Each portion of DICOM data was uploaded into an US scanner (HI VISION Ascendus, Hitachi Aloka Medical Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and unified on a US platform to create a single reference image. Each uploaded portion of DICOM data was assigned a different color. Further, conventional RVS was performed using this information.Results:The maximal tumoral diameter ranged from 6.4 to 15 mm (mean ± SD, 11.0 ± 2.8). DICOM data could be isolated, enabling the display of color RVS in all patients. Color RVS facilitated superior visibility compared with conventional grayscale RVS and facilitated the comprehension of spatial positioning.Conclusion:RVS with color display demonstrates utility in increasing operator comprehension of spatial and positional relationships during percutaneous US examination.
