The metastasis of cervical cancer to the brain is usually associated with systemic involvement such as lungs, liver and bones, and isolated brain metastasis is very rare because the primary mechanism of spread is by hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells. Although a few cases of isolated brain metastasis from cervical cancer have been reported, isolated brain metastasis from neuroendocrine cell carcinoma, which is characterized with aggressive and early metastatic features, has never been reported. A 44-year-old woman with cervical cancer composed of large neuroendocrine cell carcinoma was diagnosed with isolated brain metastasis at eight months after the definitive treatment with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Careful evaluation would be needed during follow-up for the patients with cervical cancer with aggressive histologic type.
