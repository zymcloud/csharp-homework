Objective:To identify predictors of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in cirrhotic patients scanned by gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.Methods:Fifty cirrhotic patients with 120 nodules, including 10 mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and two combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinomas, were scanned by Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MR imaging.Results:T1 hypointensity [odds ratio (OR), 20.12], peripheral hyperintense rim at hepatic arterial phase (OR, 13.5), and iso-hyperintensity at hepatobiliary phase (OR 21.32) were found to be independent predictors of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.Conclusions:T1 hypointensity, peripheral hyperintense rim at hepatic arterial phase, and iso-hyperintensity at hepatobiliary phase are independent predictors of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis in patients with liver cirrhosis.
