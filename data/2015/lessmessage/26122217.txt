Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer. An important approach to control HCC is chemoprevention. This study aims at investigating the antitumor effect of Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP). Rats were injected with N-Nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) to establish HCC. Tumor development was observed. Liver function was evaluated. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest-related makers and signaling cascades were determined by Western blot, RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis. The administration of TMP could significantly inhibit tumor development in DEN-induced HCC rats, shown by reduced incidence of tumor, decreased number of tumor nodules and reduced maximal size of tumor. DEN-induced increase of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activities were significantly inhibited by TMP. TMP exhibited inhibitory effect on HCC through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in rats. TMP induced apoptosis through increasing Bax, decreasing Bcl-2, increasing the release of cytochrome c, and activating caspase, which consisted of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. TMP induced G2/M cell cycle arrest through down-regulation of cyclin B1/cdc2. In addition, inhibition of Akt and ERK signaling and the antioxidant activities of TMP may also contribute to its antitumor effect. These data provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of TMP.
