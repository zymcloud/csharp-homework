A safe and efficient liver targeted PEGylated liposome (PEG-Lip) based on N-terminal myristoylated preS1/21-47 (preS1/21-47(myr)) of hepatitis B virus was successfully developed. The study aimed to elucidate the cellular uptake mechanism of preS1/21-47(myr) modified PEG-Lip (preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip) in hepatogenic cells and the distribution behavior of preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip in Vr:CD1 (ICR) mice. The cellular uptake results showed that preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip was effectively taken up by hepatogenic cells (including primary hepatocytes and liver tumor cells) through a receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway compared with non-hepatogenic cells. After systemic administration to H22 hepatoma-bearing mice, preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip showed significant liver-specific delivery and an increase in the distribution of preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip in hepatic tumor. Furthermore, the antitumor effect of preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) was remarkably stronger than that of PTX injection and PTX loaded liposomes (including common liposomes and PEG-Lip). In safety evaluation, no acute systemic toxicity and immunotoxicity were observed after intravenous injection of preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip. No liver toxicity was observed despite the dramatic increase of preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip in liver. Taken together, preS1/21-47(myr)-PEG-Lip represents a promising carrier system for targeted liver disease therapy and imaging.
