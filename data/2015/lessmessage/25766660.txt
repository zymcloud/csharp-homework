Objective:To report the outcomes of surgical resection of borderline resectable (BL) and locally advanced (LA) 'unresectable' pancreatic cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Methods:A review of a prospectively maintained database for pancreatic resections was undertaken to identify patients undergoing resection for BL and LA pancreatic cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy between January 2007 and December 2012. Clinicopathological, surgical and survival outcomes were analyzed.Results:A total of 45 patients with LA (n = 34) or BL cancer (n = 11) underwent surgery after a mean (± SD) of 7 ± 4 preoperative chemotherapy cycles. Ninety-day mortality was 6.7%, and overall morbidity was 33.3%. An R0 resection was achieved in 34 patients, and 4 patients showed a complete pathological response. Overall median postoperative survival was 17 months (21 after the start of neoadjuvant treatment). Overall and disease-free survival was 74.9 and 43.6% at 1 year and 21.2 and 10.3% at 3 years, respectively. In BL cancer patients, the 3-year survival was significantly higher compared to that of LA cancer patients (p = 0.02).Conclusions:Curative intent resection in BL and LA cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be achieved with reasonable mortality and morbidity and an encouraging 3-year survival. After neoadjuvant therapy, resection provides a better overall survival for BL compared to LA cancer patients.
