Choriocarcinoma is a malignant trophoblastic cancer, the incidence of primary choriocarcinoma (PCC) of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) being extremely rare, with only 14 cases being reported in worldwide literature. Here we present an extremely rare case of PCCof the appendix in a 32-year-old male who presented with acute pain abdomen. Histopathological examination revealed PCC of the appendix. Examination of the testis was unremarkable. Further investigations revealed a very high serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) titer with a normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Radiological imaging showed multiple areas of liver metastasis. Chemotherapy-based treatment with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) regime was advised, however the patient failed to follow-up for further management.
