Background:Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) have a high risk of skin cancer, and excessive sun exposure is a major contributing factor.Objective:To document the prevalence of sun protection and associated factors in OTRs in Queensland, Australia.Methods:Cross-sectional study of the frequency of wearing hats, long sleeves and using sunscreens among OTRs and factors associated with regular use. Adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson regression models.Results:Among 446 OTRs, 66, 49 and 39% wore a hat, sunscreen and long sleeves, respectively, mostly when outdoors. 52% regularly practiced multiple sun protection measures while 19% did not. Sunburn-prone skin (PR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.06-1.93) and frequent whole-body skin examinations (PR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.19-1.84) were independently associated with regular use of multiple sun protection measures.Conclusion:Findings are consistent with sun-conscious OTRs also having more regular skin screening and that having frequent skin examinations promotes sun-protective habits.
