Liver-related biomarkers have been developed and validated mainly in patients with chronic hepatitis C for the prediction of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, which is a final pathway of chronic liver injury. They are noninvasive, traceable, and easy-to-use. Biomarkers provide implications related to screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of chronic hepatitis. For the improvement of performance and coverage, biomarker panels, imaging biomarkers, and even genetic biomarkers have been developed. With the advancement of genomics and proteomics, earlier and more precise prediction is expected in the near future. In this review, multiple biomarker panels for the estimation of the degree of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C, biomarkers for the screening and diagnosis of hepatitis C, biomarkers for the treatment of hepatitis C, biomarkers for the prediction of complications related to the chronic hepatitis C, and future perspectives will be summarized.
