Objective:This study investigated the comparative effectiveness of everolimus-based therapy (EVE) versus endocrine monotherapy (ET) and chemotherapy (CT) in the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive human-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor-2-negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients with liver metastasis.Methods:Medical charts of patients treated by community oncologists were examined. Eligible patients included postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC with liver metastasis who received EVE, ET or CT between 1 July 2012 and 15 April 2013 after non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor use. Time on treatment (TOT) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between EVE and ET or CT using Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models.Results:Among the 202 patients in the study, 82 received EVE, 49 ET, and 71 CT. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, EVE was associated with significantly longer TOT than ET (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.28 - 0.86) or CT (HR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.22 - 0.55), and significantly longer PFS than ET (HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.27 - 0.87). PFS was not significantly different with EVE versus CT (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.44 - 1.32).Conclusions:EVE had significantly longer TOT and PFS than ET and longer TOT than CT among postmenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC patients with liver metastasis.
