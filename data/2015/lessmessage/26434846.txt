Background:The purpose of this retrospectively study was to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of a radiotherapy technique for the palliation of symptomatic liver metastases.Materials and methods:Twenty-seven patients with liver metastases were enrolled and received targeted whole liver irradiation consisting of mean 1, 8 Gy in five to twelve fractions to a total mean dose 17 Gy. Symptoms at baseline were hepatic pain (26 patients), lost of weight (6), lack of appetite (2), and night sweats (1). Seventeen patients (63%) had failed previous treatment with chemotherapy and/or high-dose steroids.Results:Individual symptom response rates were 100% at 4 weeks. Partial or complete global symptomatic responses were noted in 11 patients (40%) after 2 months. After 3 months, 8 patients (28%) reported loss of pain. The treatment was well tolerated with one patient (3%) experiencing grade 3 toxicity (one vomiting and one diarrhoea). Overall the median survival time was 4.9 months (range 1-14 months). One year survival was 39%.Conclusions:This is simple and well-tolerated treatment but to achieve good palliation effects we should carefully selected patients whose conventional treatment does not bring good analgesic control.
