Background:The role of surgical resection for patients with single large (≥5 cm) and/or multinodular (≥2) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial. This systematic review was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of resection for patients with single large and/or multinodular HCC.Materials and methods:Databases (the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases) were systematically searched to identify relevant studies exploring the safety and efficacy of resection for single large and/or multinodular HCC, published between January 2000 and December 2014. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, overall survival, and disease-free survival of the resection group were calculated. In addition, these outcome variables were also calculated for the control group in the included studies.Results:One randomized controlled trial and 42 non- randomized studies involving 9,580 patients were eligible for analysis. Eight (1,594 patients) of the 43 studies also reported the outcomes of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Although 51.4% of patients featured cirrhosis, 90.7% of them demonstrated Child-Pugh A liver function in the resection group. The median rates of morbidity (24.5%) and mortality (2.5%) after resection were significantly higher than that of TACE (11.0%, PConclusions:Although tumor recurrence after resection for patients with single large and/ or multinodular HCC continues to be a major problem, resection should be considered as a strategy to achieve long-term survival.
