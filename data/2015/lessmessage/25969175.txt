Background/aims:miR-448 has been reported to exhibit abnormal expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, the essential role of miR-448 in HCC progression is still unclear.Methods:real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of miRNAs and candidate genes in HCC samples (n=117). miR-448 mimics and inhibitor were tansfected in human HCC cells. The transwell assay was used to examine the cell invasive ability. The regulation mechanism was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. The markers of EMT were detected by using Western blot.Results:miR-448 was decreased in HCC samples and associated with HCC development. Inhibition of miR-448 significantly promoted cell invasion, while the effect of miR-448 up-regulation was reverse. miR-448 could regulate ROCK2 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Knockdown of ROCK2 expression partially reversed the effect of miR-448 inhibitor. Abnormal expression of miR-448 could regulate the markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Conclusions:miR-448 may contribute to the progression of HCC via regulating ROCK2 expression.
