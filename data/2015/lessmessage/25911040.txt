Echinococcus granulosus infection affects worldwide population, including countries of South and Central America, Middle East, sub-Saharan region, Russia and China. In cystic echinococcosis diagnosis is related to the presence of single or multiple well-delineated spherical primary cyst, commonly seen involving liver followed by lungs. Renal hydatid cyst is rare, comprising of about 2-3% of all locations, isolated renal involvement is even rarer. We present a case of hydatid disease in a 45 year male patient who presented with the history of vague flank pain, mild fever and hematuria. IVU showed a filling defect while USG and CT scan displayed multiloculated cyst in the upper pole of right kidney, correlating the clinical and radiological findings a differential diagnosis of cystic renal cell carcinoma and cystic nephroma was derived. Total nephrectomy was done but the histopathological examination of the lesion revealed hydatid cysts and final diagnosis of renal cystic echinococcosis was made.
