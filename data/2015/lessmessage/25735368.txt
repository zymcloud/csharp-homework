Background:Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma using serological markers with better sensitivity and specificity than alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is needed.Aims:The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum sICAM-1, β-catenin, IL-8, proteasome and sTNFR-II in early detection of HCC.Materials and methods:Serum levels of IL-8, sICAM-1, sTNFR-II, proteasome and β-catenin were measured by ELISA assay in 479 serum samples from 192 patients with HCC, 96 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 96 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and 95 healthy controls.Results:Serum levels of proteasome, sICAM-1, β-catenin and αFP were significantly elevated in HCC group compared to other groups (P-valueConclusions:Our data supported the role of proteasome, sICAM-1, sTNFR-II and β-catenin in early detection of HCC. Also, using this panel of serological markers in combination with αFP may offer improved diagnostic performance over αFP alone in the early detection of HCC.
