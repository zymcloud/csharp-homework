Angiosarcomas are rare malignancies with poor prognosis and could affect any organ in the body. Breast angiosarcomas mostly affect adolescent and young adult females. Here, we present the case of a 19-year-old female with low grade primary breast angiosarcoma associated with international normalized ratio (INR) abnormalities, thrombocytopenia and anemia. Patient experienced severe bleeding on biopsy. INR and count of blood cells turned to normal levels after mastectomy. Patient refused chemotherapy. Three months later, computed tomography showed liver metastasis.
