Objective:To determine the impact of phlebotomy on the laboratory values and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C.Methods:Study patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated with glycyrrhizin injection and oral ursodeoxycholic acid and either with (n=52) or without (n=50) phlebotomy during the period of 2005-2012. Six phlebotomized patients had previously received interferon therapy and were subsequently excluded from the data analysis. The serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, iron and albumin, as well as the hemoglobin concentration, platelet count and prothrombin time, were determined. We compared the long-term outcomes based on the incidence of HCC and laboratory values, including the baseline serum ferritin levels, in patients treated with versus without phlebotomy.Results:In the phlebotomy group, the mean AST and ALT levels decreased significantly at each one-year interval over five years (pConclusion:The incidence of HCC can be reduced by phlebotomy treatment, which should be performed in patients with chronic hepatitis C not receiving or not responding to antiviral therapy.
