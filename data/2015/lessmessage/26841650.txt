Autopsy study of an 80-year-old man has identified his renal tumor metastasizing to the heart, lung, and liver as urothelial car- cinoma; at the same time some cells in the main tumor and all cells in the metastases had a signet-ring phenotype, but neither mucicarcimine nor alcian blue stained the cell cytoplasm. The paper provides the histological and immunohistochemical pattern of the tumor and emphasizes its exclusive rarity. Attention is drawn to the possibility of signet-ring cell transformation in the cells of different tumors, including nonepithelial ones.
