The epidermal growth factor (EGF) may play a pathological role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the conclusions of published reports on the relationship between the EGF 61*A/G polymorphism and HCC risk remain controversial. To derive a more precise estimation we performed a meta-analysis based on 14 studies that together included 2,506 cases and 4,386 controls. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were used to retrieve articles up to August 1, 2014. The crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to evaluate the association. Meta-analysis results showed a significant association between the EGF 61*A/G polymorphism and HCC risk in all four genetic models (allele model: OR=1.25, 95%CI=1.12-1.40; dominant model: OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.14-1.54; recessive model: OR=1.33, 95%CI=1.12-1.58; homozygous model: OR=1.59, 95%CI=1.33- 1.90). Moreover, significant associations were observed when stratified by ethnicity, source of controls, etiology and genotype methods. Thus, this meta-analysis suggests that the G-allele of the EGF 61*A/G polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of HCC, especially in Asians and Caucasians, without influence from the source of controls or etiological diversity. Further studies with larger population sizes are needed to confirm these results.
