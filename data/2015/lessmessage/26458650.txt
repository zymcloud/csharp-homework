Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer world-wide with a higher incidence in Asia. Clear cell variant of HCC (CCHCC) has a frequency ranging from 0.4% to 37%. The presence of 90-100% clear cells is rare. In the present case, a 35-year-old female patient presented with fever and a large abdominal mass in the right hypochondrium. Histology of the tumor revealed >95% clear cells and after taking multiple sections from different areas of tumor only few scattered cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm were found. Immunohistochemistry with Hep Par 1, Glypican 3 and polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen were negative as were all other markers for metastatic clear cell tumors. Histological diagnosis was based on routine H and E sections showing a histological pattern of architecture with thickened trabeculae. We describe a rare case of CCHCC with >95% clear cells and no immunoreactivity in tumor cells in a non-cirrhotic liver.
