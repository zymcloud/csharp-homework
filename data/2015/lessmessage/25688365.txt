Background:In our previous study, we conducted a systematic screening of miRNA to identify potential serum biomarkers for predicting venous metastasis and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-224 was one of the differentially expressed miRNAs. This study aimed to confirm whether serum miR-224 level is associated with the presence of venous metastasis and survival.Methods:TaqMan miRNA probe was used to perform qRT-PCR assays to evaluate the expression of serum miR-224 in a cohort of 182 HCC patients.Results:Patients with high miR-224 serum level showed poor survival compared to that with low miR-224 serum level (HR 1.985; 95% CI, 1.08, 3.65, P=0.027). The serum miR-224 levels were significantly higher in the BCLC stage C patients compared with the stage B patients (P=0.005). In further analysis, significant difference of serum miR-224 expression level was observed when patients grouped by the status of PVTT but not the status of extra-liver metastasis (P=0.013 and P=0.091). Serum levels of miR-224 showed significant relation with parameters of liver damage and serum AFP.Conclusion:Serum miR-224 might be BCLC stage dependent. It can reflect the status of tumor and liver damage. It was an independent predictor for the survival of HCC patients.
