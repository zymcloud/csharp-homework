Introduction:Our study aims to evaluate the use of targeted therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma Methods: This is a prospective study done over three years from December 2010 to December, 2013.Out of Forty seven patients of metastatic renal cell carcinoma 8(neo-adjuvant cases) were excluded and 39 were included in this study. All patients received Tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib therapy (50 mg OD, 4/2 scheme). All 39 patients underwent radical nephrectomy prior to sunitinib therapy. Patients were followed up every cycle for their clinical symptoms following sunitinib therapy and every 3 months with chest X-ray, ultra-sonography and bone scan. CT scan was done if needed. A RECIST criterion was used to evaluate the complete, partial and no tumor response.Results:The median survival was 28.5 months (CI 9.253-47.7) and progression free survival (PFS) was 9.16 months(CI 6.08-12.23).According to RECIST, stable disease was found in 6 patients till date and a complete response in two patients. Clear cell histology was found in 30(76.9%) patients, papillary variety in 6(15.39%) patients, chromophobe type was seen in one patient and rest had mixed sarcomatoid papillary and rhabdoid clear cell variety. Twenty four patients (61.5%) had multiple metastases. Most frequent metastasis was seen in lungs in 14 patients (36%) and bone in 12 patients (31%).Metastases were also seen in draining lymph nodes, adrenals, omentum,skin, liver, and brain.Conclusions:In our cohort, use of sunitinib showed similar outcome to previously published articles. Our study supports the use of sunitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
