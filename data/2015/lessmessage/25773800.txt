Purpose:This analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of irinotecan based regimens as second-line chemotherapy in treating patients with small cell lung cancer.Methods:Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of irinotecan based regimens as second-line chemotherapy for patients with small cell lung cancer were identified using a predefined search strategy. Pooled response rates (RRs) of treatment were calculated.Results:In irinotecan based regimens as second-line chemotherapy, 4 clinical studies which including 155 patients with small cell lung cancer were considered eligible for inclusion. In all chemotherapy consisted of irinotecan with or without nedaplatin. Pooled analysis suggested that, in all patients, the pooled RR was 27.1% (42/155) in irinotecan based regimens. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and myelosuppression were the main side effects. No grade III or IV renal or liver toxicity was observed. No treatment related death occurred with the irinotecan based treatments.Conclusion:This systemic analysis suggests that irinotecan based regimens as second-line chemotherapy are associated with mild response rate and acceptable toxicity for patients with small cell lung cancer.
