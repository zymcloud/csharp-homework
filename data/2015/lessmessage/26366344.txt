A resected case of hepatocellular carcinoma which extended into the right atrium after treatment with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is described. An 81-year-old man presented with right hypochondralgia. CT demonstrated a hypervascular tumor 11.5 cm in diameter extending into the right atrium through the right hepatic vein. The patient underwent HAIC with 100 mg of cisplatin (CDDP IA-callÂ®) particles three times every month. The tumor showed a marked shrinkage and an involution of the venous thrombus around the orifice of the right hepatic vein. Right hemihepatectomy with tumor thrombectomy was performed as a salvage surgery using a total hepatic vascular exclusion technique. Histologically, the tumor turned into diffuse necrosis and fibrosis, so viable tumor cells were encountered neither in the main tumor nor venous thrombus. The therapeutic effect of HAIC was pathological complete remission. The patient has been doing well for 6 years after the surgery without evidence of tumor recurrence. The salvage operation was safely achievable for the initially unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma extending into the right atrium.
