A series of linoleic acid-modified glycol chitosan (LAGC) conjugates were synthesized and characterized by FTIR and (1)H NMR. The effect of the amount of linoleic acid (LA) on the physicochemical properties of LAGC conjugates was investigated. The mean diameters of three LAGC nanoparticles determined by dynamic light scattering ranged from 204 to 289 nm. The critical aggregation concentration values of LAGC conjugates in aqueous solution were 0.0148, 0.0348, and 0.0807 mg/ml, respectively. Paclitaxel (PTX) was physically loaded into the LAGC nanoparticles by a dialysis method. The drug loading content and encapsulation efficiency of PTX-loaded LAGC (PTX-LAGC) nanoparticles increased with an increasing ratio of the hydrophobic LA to hydrophilic glycol chitosan in the conjugates. PTX-LAGC nanoparticles were almost spherical in shape observed by transmission electron microscopy. In vitro release revealed that PTX release from the nanoparticles was reduced as the LA substitution degree of LAGC conjugates increased. Compared with the commercial formulation Taxol, PTX-LAGC-1 nanoparticles exhibited comparable cellular uptake and cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells in vitro. Importantly, PTX-LAGC-1 nanoparticles demonstrated the stronger antitumor efficacy against hepatic H22 tumor-bearing mice than Taxol (p
