Chronic hepatitis C is one of the most important causes of liver disease, leading to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently some important advances in therapy have been achieved with the introduction of first wave, first generation direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) such as boceprevir (BOC), in combination with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). The superior rate of sustained virological response with this treatment is accompanied by an elevated frequency of anaemia. Several studies have evidenced the importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) and solute carrier family 29, member 1 (SLC29A1) genes in the development of this adverse event. Here, we investigated haemoglobin levels and the best-known functional SNPs in ITPA and SLC29A1 genes in 22 patients treated with triple therapy with BOC/Peg-IFN/RBV. The identification of ITPA protective and SLC29A1 risk genotypes still appears to be a current methodology in RBV dosing during hepatitis C virus therapy with DAAs.
