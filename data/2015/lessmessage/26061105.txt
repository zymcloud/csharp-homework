Background:Cancer chemoprevention involves the carcinogenic process prevention, delay or reverse by the administration of chemopreventive agents, which are able to suppress or block the carcinogen metabolic activation/formation. The increased activity of phase II detoxification enzymes such as quinone-reductase (QR) and glutation-S-transferase (GST) correlates with the protection against chemically-induced carcinogenesis. It has been shown that synthetic chalcones and 3H-[1,2]-dithiole-3-thiones promote expression of genes involved in chemoprevention.Materials & methods:Herein, the induction of phase II enzymes by designed Michael acceptor-dithiolethione hybrids was studied.Results & discussion:Hybrids 5 and 7 displayed the induction of quinone-reductase and glutation-S-transferase in vitro in the same order on the wild-type mouse-hepatoma Hepa 1c1c7 and on the aryl-hydrocarbon-nuclear-translocator (Arnt)-defective mutant BPrc1 cells indicating that 7 displays the best chemopreventive potential.
