Objectives:The efficacy of the all-oral administration of daclatasvir and asunaprevir for 24 weeks was compared with that of telaprevir for 12 weeks plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) for 24 weeks, and that of simeprevir for 12 weeks plus PEG-IFN/RBV for 24 weeks, with a focus on the prevention of occurrence and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) as suppressive markers of HCC were also measured.Methods:Patients received daclatasvir and asunaprevir (n = 17), simeprevir plus PEG-IFN/RBV (n = 15) and telaprevir plus PEG-IFN/RBV (n = 25). Sustained virological response (SVR) and the mean change in the level of serum ALT, AFP and platelet (PLT) count were compared among the three groups.Results:No difference in SVR was observed in patients given daclatasvir with asunaprevir (SVR4), telaprevir plus PEG-IFN/RBV or simeprevir plus PEG-IFN/RBV (SVR24). Also, no significant difference was observed in the mean change of serum ALT, AFP or PLT count among the three groups.Conclusion:The preventive effect of the IFN-free, all-oral regimen of daclatasvir and asunaprevir was observed with a focus on the occurrence and recurrence of HCC, as was IFN-based treatment with telaprevir or simeprevir plus PEG-IFN/RBV.
