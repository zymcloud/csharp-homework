Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common, malignant tumor of liver. Most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma are associated with either viral hepatitis or cirrhosis. But major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in developing countries is mainly chronic hepatitis B. Sorafenib is one of the first-line drug which has been extensively used in metastatic and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a rare case of spontaneous deep venous thrombosis of bilateral lower limbs as an important unrecognized side effect of sorafenib.
