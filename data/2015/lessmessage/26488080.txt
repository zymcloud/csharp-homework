Objective:We report a case of perioperative management of a single-ventricle patient with Fontan-associated liver disease undergoing hepatectomy.Case report:A 12-year-old boy with Fontan circulation was scheduled for partial hepatectomy to remove a liver mass in segment 6. He received stent implantation to relieve conduit stenosis 6 months before the operation. The operation was performed under general anesthesia and with a bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (PVB). A continuous paravertebral infusion of levobupivacaine was administered via right and left catheters postoperatively. He was hemodynamically stable throughout the perioperative period, extubated soon after surgery, and had an uncomplicated postoperative course.Conclusions:An analgesic regimen including thoracic PVB resulted in a rapid recovery without opioid-related side effects and early reinitiation of anticoagulation therapy. Our case illustrates the effective application of thoracic PVB in congenital heart disease patients for non-cardiac-related surgery.
