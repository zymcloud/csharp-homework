Background:The relationship between microRNA-1 (miR-1) expression and prognosis has not been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to explore the clinicopathological significance and the prognostic role of miR-1 in HCC.Methods:The expression levels of miR-1 were quantified using real-time quantitative PCR (q-PCR) in 40 surgically resected HCC samples and matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues.Results:MiR-1 expression was significantly downregulated in HCC compared with matched non-cancerous tissues. Aberrant miR-1 expression was significantly correlated with gender, expression of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), tumor differentiation, vein invasion, and TNM stage. Patients with low expression of miR-1 had significantly reduced overall survival compared with patients with high expression of miR-1 (p = 0.04).The multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-1 expression (HR = 2.79; p = 0.005), gender (HR = 0.087; p = 0.005), vein invasion (HR = 0.172; p = 0.007), and TNM stage (HR = 3.421; p = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival.Conclusions:Low miR-1 expression is associated with shortened survival time. MiR-1 may act as a potential prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.
