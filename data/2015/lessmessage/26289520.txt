Background:An important goal in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis by suppressing HBV replication. Tenofovir and entecavir are effective viral suppression compounds. However, comparative data is scant, especially in Korea. This study compared tenofovir and entecavir concerning efficiencies and side effects.Materials and methods:We retrospectively reviewed data of nucleos (t) ide-na√Øve patients with chronic HBV infection. Independent variables reflecting virological response were evaluated, and the decline in serum HBV DNA levels, and side effects between tenofovir-and entecavir-treated patients were compared at treatment week 12, 24, and 48.Results:At the end of 48 weeks, there was no statistical difference in the induction of undetectable levels of HBV DNA between the entecavir (82.5%) and tenofovir (69.2%) groups. Entecavir was more effective in reducing serum HBV DNA levels at 24 weeks of treatment (serum HBV DNA decline of 5.53 and 4.95 log10 units for entecavir and tenofovir, respectively; P=0.044), but the rate of decline was similar at other weeks. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of side effects and discontinuance of treatment due to side effects.Conclusions:Tenofovir is not significantly different from entecavir in virologic response and tolerability in the treatment of chronic HBV.
