Introduction:On account of the asymptomatic course, no possibility to prevent by vaccination and the serious consequences of long-term infection (liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma), hepatitis C (HCV infection) is a serious public health problem.Objective:This article aims are evaluating the epidemiological situation of HCV infections in Poland in 2015 in reference to the data from previous years.Material and methods:Analysis of epidemiological situation of hepatitis C in Poland was carried out on a basis of aggregated data from routine surveillance system published in annual bulletin “Infectious Diseases and Poisonings in Poland”. Data on hepatitis C mortality from the Demographic Surveys and Labour Market Department of the Central Statistical Office were also included. In 2015, mandatory reporting included: 1) HCV infections diagnosed by physicians and 2) positive laboratory test results for HCV.Results:In 2015, a total of 4,285 cases were reported (diagnosis rate 11.14 per 100,000). The diagnosis rate increased by 21% compared to 2014 (2014: 3 551 cases, 9.23 per 100,000) and doubled with respect to the median value in 2009-2013 (2,189 cases, 5.68 per 100,000). For the first time the diagnosis rates in men and women were comparable (11.10 per 100,000 vs. 11.19 per 100,000). The percentage of people hospitalized due to HCV infection at HCV diagnosis decreased (in 2015 - 39.0%, in 2014 - 48.4%). In 2015, 239 deaths due to hepatitis C were registered.Conclusions:The increased diagnosis rate of hepatitis C in 2015 may be a consequence of improved reporting, legislative changes (introduction of mandatory reporting of positive laboratory results) as well as enhanced publicity and other HCV control activities, including increased availability of HCV laboratory screening.
