Background:Despite the routine use of mechanical bowel preparation (MBP), the real impact of MBP for liver resection remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative outcomes of MBP after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing liver resection for patients with HCC between from April 2008 to March 2015. MBP was defined as a preoperative medication of polyethylene glycol lavage. We compared perioperative outcomes in patients who did or did not receive MBP before liver resection. Open and laparoscopic hepatectomy were analyzed separately.Results:A total of 227 patients underwent potentially curative liver resection for HCC during the study period. One hundred twenty-eight patients received MBP while 99 did not. In the open hepatectomy group, overall and major (Clavien-Dindo â‰¥3) complications were equivalent between the groups (31.9 vs. 25.8%, p = 0.840; 12.1 vs. 8.7%, p = 0.475). There were no meaningful differences in the incidence of liver failure (MBP: 22.4%, non-MBP: 13.0%, p = 0.116). Surgical-site infections occurred in 20 (17.2%) vs. 10 (14.5%) with no significant difference (p = 0.624). Similar results were obtained from the laparoscopic hepatectomy group.Conclusion:The use of MBP does not appear to impact the short outcomes after liver resection for patients with HCC. MBP might be omitted in liver surgery.
