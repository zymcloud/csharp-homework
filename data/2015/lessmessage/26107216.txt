Background:Previous studies suggested that the H63D and C282Y polymorphisms in the HFE genes were susceptible to many cancer types, nevertheless, the present results were inconclusive. Thus, the present study was aimed to evaluate the association between the HFE polymorphisms (H63D and C282Y) and cancer risk via meta-analysis.Materials and methods:We retrieved PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase and Web of Science databases for all eligible studies up to April 1, 2015. All the statistical analysis was conducted by STATA 12.0.Results:Finally, a total of 20 publications including 24 case-control studies, comprising 6,524 cases and 31,080 controls for HFE-C282Y polymorphism and 19 publications including 21 case control studies, comprising 5,648 cases and 14,257 controls for HFE-H63D polymorphism were enrolled in our analysis. An increased risk for overall cancer risk was identified in HFE-H63D polymorphism under allele contrast (D vs H: OR=1.153; 95%CI=1.031- 1.289, Pheterogeneity=0.002), homozygotes vs wide type (DD vs HH: OR=1.449; 95%CI=1.182-1.777, Pheterogeneity=0.391), dominant model (DD+HD vs HH: OR=1.145; 95%CI=1.007-1.301, Pheterogeneity=0.002) and recessive model (DD vs HD+HH: OR=1.416 ; 95%CI=1.156-1.735, Pheterogeneity=0.549), as well as HFE- C282Y under homozygotes vs wide type (YY vs CC: OR=1.428, 95%CI=1.017-2.006, Pheterogeneity=0.220). In addition, in the stratified analysis by cancer type, an increased risk was identified in hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer in C282Y polymorphism, as well as pancreatic cancer in H63D polymorphism, whereas a decreased risk of colorectal cancer was identified in C282Y polymorphism.Conclusions:Present study suggested that H63D and C282Y polymorphisms associated with an increased risk of overall cancer. Nevertheless, well- designed study with large sample size will be continued on this issue of interest.
