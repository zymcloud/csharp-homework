Background:DACT genes regulates Wnt as well TGF-β pathway, and were already associated with hepatocellular and lung cancer. Alterations on Wnt/β-catenin were associated with head and neck cancer through β-catenin cytoplasmatic accumulation.Objective:The aim of the study was to evaluate DACT1 and DACT2 expression and methylation on oral squamous cell cancer (OSCC).Methods:47 samples of salivary rinse and tissue were collected from 29 OSCC and 18 control patients. qMSP and RT-PCR reactions were performed in order to detect hypermethylation and expression of DACT1 and DACT2 genes. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate these genes as possible biomarkers for OSCC.Results:As expected man over 60 years old with tobacco and alcohol consumption history were associated with OSCC. There was no statistical difference between groups concerning DACT1 and DACT2 either in promoter hypermethylation or transcript levels. Age was associated with DACT2 promoter hypermethylation, especially over 56 years old.Conclusion:Patients older than 56 years old were about 5 times more likely to have DACT2 promoter hypermethylation. These findings could partially explain why older subjects are more prone to carcinogenesis. Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays an important role in carcinogenesis, and the study of their regulators may help understand malignant transformation.
