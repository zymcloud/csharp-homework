Background:Activation of Notch and NF-κB signaling has been frequently observed in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and contributes to the chemo-resistance and treatment failure. However, the relationship between these signaling pathways and CRC has not been clearly described.Objective:To investigate the expression of Notch1, Jagged1, NF-κB and MMP-9 in CRC patients and analyze their correlation with clinicopathological factors.Methods:Expression of Notch1, Jagged1, NF-κB and MMP-9 was visualized by immune-histology in the tumor tissue, adjacent and distant normal tissues from 47 CRC patients without receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy.Results:Notch1 (80.8%), Jagged1 (80.8%), NF-κB (70.2%) and MMP-9 (76.6%) were overexpressed in cancer tissues compared normal tissues (P< 0.05). The intensity of Notch1, Jagged1 and NF-κB expression was associated with histological grading, depth of invasion, TNM staging and lymph node metastasis of CRC. MMP-9 was intimately correlated with depth of invasion, TNM staging and lymph node metastasis. NF-κB, MMP-9 and Notch1 expression was positively correlated (P< 0.05), and the same positive correlation was found among NF-κB, MMP-9 and Jagged1 expression (P< 0.05).Conclusion:Notch1, Jagged1, NF-κB and MMP-9 probably play a pivotal role during the CRC development, serving as biomarkers for early detection of the recurrence and metastasis and prognosis of CRC.
