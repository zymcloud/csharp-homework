Purpose:To find parameters that can increase alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) sensitivity and so help in accurate diagnosis and rapid management of hepatocullular carcinoma (HCC), as AFP has limited utility of distinguishing HCC from benign hepatic disorders for its high false-positive and false negative rates.Materials and methods:Serum levels of AFP, 5'-nucleotidase enzyme activity (5-NU) and leucine aminopeptidase enzyme (LAP) activity were measured in 40 individuals.Results:LAP and 5'NU were elevated in HCC at pConclusions:LAP and 5-FU can be determined in HCC patients in combination with AFP to improve its sensitivity and decrease false negative results.
