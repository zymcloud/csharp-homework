Background/aims:Coagulopathy can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation and posthepatectomy liver failure. Posthepatectomy liver failure predicts a poor prognosis after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Although antithrombin III reduces hypercoagulation, the impact of postoperative antithrombin III administration remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether postoperative antithrombin III administration protects against the development of coagulation disorders.Methods:Data from 164 patients who received antithrombin III and 169 who did following curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma were retrospectively collected and analyzed. To overcome bias due to different distributions of covariates for the two groups, a one-to-one match was created using propensity score analysis. After matching, patient outcomes were analyzed.Results:A multivariate analysis of the whole group revealed that antithrombin III activity of Conclusions:Antithrombin III may attenuate posthepatectomy liver failure in hepatocellular carcinoma, possibly by suppressing coagulopathy.
