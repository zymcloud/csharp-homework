Context:Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease. Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C infection is the leading indication for liver transplantation worldwide. However, patients who are given transplants because of viral liver diseases often present clinical coinfections, including hepatitis B together with hepatitis D. Currently, different strategies exist for patient management before and after liver transplantation, and these are based on different protocols developed by the specialized transplantation centers.Case report:We present a rare case of a 58-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B, C and D coinfection. The patient developed cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. His treatment comprised antiviral therapy for the three viruses and OLT. The patient's outcome was satisfactory.Conclusion:OLT, in association with antiviral therapy using entecavir, which was administered before and after transplantation, was effective for sustained clearance of the hepatitis B and D viruses. A recurrence of hepatitis C infection after transplantation responded successfully to standard treatment comprising peginterferon alfa-2A and ribavirin.
