Background:The most practical serum biomarker AFP is negative in 80% patients with small tumor in the early stage of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC).Objective:To investigate significance of combined tests of serum golgi glycoprotein 73 (GP73), lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3), glypican 3 (GPC3), des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), CA199, ferritin (FER) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in diagnosis of small PHC with negative AFP.Methods:A total of 50 cases of small PHC, 60 cases of non-PHC digestive system disorders and 40 cases of healthy controls were collected. Serum GP73, GPC3 and DCP were analyzed by enzyme-1inked immunosorbent assay. AFP-L3 was separated by microspincolumn; the levels of CA199, FER, CEA, AFP-L3 and total AFP were quantified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays; percentage of AFP-L3 to total AFP was calculated.Results:Levels of those biomarkers except FER were all significantly different among three groups (P Conclusions:GP73 and AFP-L3 are superior biomarkers to aid the diagnosis of small PHC with negative AFP. The combined detection of biomarkers improved the diagnostic accuracy.
