Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of liver disease characterized by excess of fat in liver which ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption.Materials and methods:The study was carried out in 216 with serologically defined fatty liver. They underwent detailed history evaluation, clinical examination and anthropometric measurements, biochemical and serological tests. The cut-off values for central obesity were waist hip ratio (WHR) > 0.85 in women and > 0.9 in men.Results:The prevalence of NAFLD was highest in the age group of 31 to 60 years. It was more common in males than females. Twenty cases (11.7%) had discomfort at right upper abdomen. Hepatomegaly was found in 27 patients (13.2%), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in 29 (14.21%) and diabetes mellitus in 38 (18.63%) patients. Overweight or obesity was found in 110 (53.92%) cases and central obesity was seen in 129 (63.23%) patients. Hence, metabolic syndrome (according to International Diabetes Federation Criteria) was present in 62.25% cases of NAFLD. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than upper limit of normal was found in 36.76% cases.Conclusion:Risk factors for NAFLD in Bangladesh are similar to reported from the rest of the world. Age more than 30 years, male sex, WHR > 0.9 in men and more than 0.85 in female, BMI more than 25, glucose intolerance are predictive factors for NAFLD.How to cite this article:Shil BC, Saha M, Ahmed F, Dhar SC.
