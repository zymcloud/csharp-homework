Background:Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a common adverse consequence of treatment of high-grade hematologic malignancies that has been known to occur rarely in some solid tumors, including small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.Case report:We present a case of TLS in a patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with one small dose of gemcitabine. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has only been described once prior in the medical literature and never with a reduced dose of chemotherapy.Conclusion:This case reveals the need for heightened awareness of TLS in patients with solid tumors, especially in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
