Purpose:This analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotinib based regimens in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods:Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of icotinib-based regimens with regard to response and safety for patients with NSCLC were identified using a predefined search strategy. Pooled response rates of treatment were calculated.Results:With icotinib-based regimens, 7 clinical studies which including 5,985 Chinese patients with NSCLC were considered eligible for inclusion. The pooled analysis suggested that, in all patients, the positive reponse rate was 30.1% (1,803/5,985) with icotinib-based regimens. Mild skin itching, rashes and diarrhea were the main side effects. No grade III or IV renal or liver toxicity was observed. No treatment-related death occurred in patients treated with icotinib-based regimens.Conclusions:This evidence based analysis suggests that icotinib based regimens are associated with mild response rate and acceptable toxicity for treating Chinese patients with NSCLC.
