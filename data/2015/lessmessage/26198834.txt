Crizotinib is a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor and it represents the standard of care in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocated non-small-cell lung cancer. Crizotinib is generally well tolerated and the most frequent adverse events include gastrointestinal effects, visual disorders, edema, fatigue and liver enzyme abnormalities. However, due to the increasing clinical experience with crizotinib, other toxicities are emerging, such as Q-wave T-wave interval prolongation and bradycardia. In the current review we will focus on the management of crizotinib-related cardiotoxicity.
