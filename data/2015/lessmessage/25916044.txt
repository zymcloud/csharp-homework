Background/aims:To investigate the effectiveness and safety of sorafenib after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:44 intermediate or advanced HCC patients received sorafenib treatment after debulking with RFA therapy. Time to progression (TTP), response rate (RR), duration of sorafenib treatment and adverse effects were evaluated. An explorative comparison was performed with patients treated with sorafenib only.Results:At 12 months, TTP was 10.3 months (range: 1-32). RR was 61% with 2 complete responses, and duration of sorafenib therapy was 10.9 months (1-32). No new safety concerns were report-ed. With sorafenib only, TTP was 7.2 months (range: 0-38) and RR was 40%, with one complete response; duration of therapy was 7.3 months (0-38).Conclusions:The sequence of RFA and sorafenib appears effective and safe in HCC patients. These findings could support the use of a sequential treatment with RFA and sorafenib in HCC patients.
