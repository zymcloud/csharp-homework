Background/aims:8-Methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), a formerly considered photosensitizing agent, induces apoptosis when used alone. On this basis, the present study was designed to explore the effects and mechanisms of 8-MOP-induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, independent of its photoactivation.Methods:We analyzed the cell viability with MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to examine the apoptosis rate, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation after specific staining. The expression and location of apoptosis-associated protein as well as the activation status of cell signaling pathway were determined by Western blot analysis.Results:8-MOP significantly decreased cell viability and induced cell apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as demonstrated by increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, collapsed MMP, and induced cytochrome c release (Cyt c) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) transposition. ROS generation was significantly increased by 8-MOP and the eradication of ROS significantly abolished 8-MOP-induced apoptosis. In addition, the activation of ERK1/2 was drastically decreased by 8-MOP as ERK inhibitor PD98059, indicating a role of ERK1/2 signaling pathway in 8-MOP-induced cell apoptosis.Conclusion:8-MOP induces intrinsic apoptosis by increasing ROS generation and inhibiting ERK1/2 pathway in HepG2 cells. The findings are important in substantiating the anti-tumor role of 8-MOP in cancer therapy.
