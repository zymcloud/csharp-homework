Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate any association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) (rs738409, C>G) and the development and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Two hundred heathy controls and 388 HCC cases were included: 211 with HBV, 98 patients with HCV, 29 with alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and 52 with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The SNP was determined by real-time PCR based on TaqMan assays.Results:The prevalence of rs738409 genotypes CC, CG and GG in controls was 91 (45.5%), 88 (44.0%), and 21 (10.5%), respectively, while the corresponding genotypes in all patients with HCC was 158 (40.7%), 178 (45.9%), and 52 (13.4%). The GG genotype had significantly higher distribution in patients with ASH/NASH-related HCC compared with controls (OR=2.34, 95% CI=1.16-4.71, P=0.018), and viral-related HCC cases (OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.13-4.08, P=0.020). However, the frequency of the GG genotype was similar between controls and patients with viral-related HCC. At initial diagnosis, HBV-related HCC were larger and at more advanced BCLC stage than the other HCC groups. There were no significant differences between the GG and non-GG groups regarding clinical characteristics, tumor stage and overall survival.Conclusions:These data suggest an influence of the PNPLA3 polymorphism on the occurrence of HCC in patients with ASH/NASH but not among those with chronic viral hepatitis. However, the polymorphism was not associated with the prognosis of HCC.
