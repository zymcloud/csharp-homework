Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with the characteristics of syndrome differentiation, plays an important role in the comprehensive treatment of HCC. This study aims to develop a nonnegative matrix factorization- (NMF-) based feature selection approach (NMFBFS) to identify potential clinical symptoms for HCC patient stratification.Methods:The NMFBFS approach consisted of three major steps. Firstly, statistics-based preliminary feature screening was designed to detect and remove irrelevant symptoms. Secondly, NMF was employed to infer redundant symptoms. Based on NMF-derived basis matrix, we defined a novel similarity measurement of intersymptoms. Finally, we converted each group of redundant symptoms to a new single feature so that the dimension was further reduced.Results:Based on a clinical dataset consisting of 407 patient samples of HCC with 57 symptoms, NMFBFS approach detected 8 irrelevant symptoms and then identified 16 redundant symptoms within 6 groups. Finally, an optimal feature subset with 39 clinical features was generated after compressing the redundant symptoms by groups. The validation of classification performance shows that these 39 features obviously improve the prediction accuracy of HCC patients.Conclusions:Compared with other methods, NMFBFS has obvious advantages in identifying important clinical features of HCC.
