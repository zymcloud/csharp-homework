Background:Aberrant histone deacetylase expression may cause imbalance between acetylation and deacetylation of histone and play roles in tumor transformation. We found that histone 3 was modulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma. We determined if histone 3 modulation is related to the aberrant expression of histone deacetylase.Materials and methods:We analyzed human liver and hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and fibroblast and fibrosarcoma cell lines for the expression of histone 3, histone deacetylase 1 and acetylated histone 3 using immunohistochemistry, western blot and immunofluorescence.Results:Histone deacetylase 1 and histone 3 were more strongly detected in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue and fibrosarcoma cells than in liver tissues and fibroblast cells, respectively. However, acetylated histone 3 was more strongly expressed in normal liver and fibroblast cells and less expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and fibrosarcoma cells.Conclusion:Histone deacetylase 1 overexpression and hypoacetylation of histone 3 might play critical roles in the modulation of histone 3 in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
