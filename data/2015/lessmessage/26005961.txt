Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO).Materials and methods:We searched the Cochrane Library, PUBMED, EMBASE, Chinese Bio-medicine database, China Journal Full-text Database, VIP database, Wanfang database for randomized controlled trials (from inception to September 2012). Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological and evidence quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Table and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) respectively. Data analysis was performed by RevMan 5.1 and descriptive analysis was employed if necessary.Results:Eight studies were selected (n=1879 participants). OnabotulinumtoxinA was more related to urinary tract infection (UTI) (200 U: OR 1.72, CI: 1.18-2.52; 300 U: OR 1.88, CI: 1.31-2.69) versus placebo. Also, OnabotulinumtoxinA was superior to placebo in improving maximum cystometric capacity (MCC) (200 U: OR 138.80, CI: 112.45-165.15; 300 U: OR 152.09, CI: 125.25-178.93) and decreasing maximum detrusor pressure (MDP) (200 U: MD -29.61, CI: -36.52--22.69; 300 U: MD-28.92, CI: -39.59--18.25). However, there were no statistical differences between 200 U and 300 U onabotulinumtoxinA in UTI (OR 0.84, CI: 0.58-1.22), MCC (OR-12.72, CI: -43.36-17.92) and MDP (MD 2.21, CI: -6.80-11.22).Conclusions:OnabotulinumtoxinA may provide superior clinical and urodynamic benefit for populations with NDO. High-quality studies are required for evaluating the optimal dose, long-term application and when to perform repeated injections.
