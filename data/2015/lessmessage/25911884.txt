Background/aims:To analyses the feasibility and efficacy of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment in patients with inoperable liver cancer.Methodology:187 patients were treated with HIFU, of all these patients 116 cases were Primary Liver Cancer (PLC) and 71 cases were Metastatic Liver Cancer (MLC). According to some parameters, such as clinical symptoms, the basis of main organs functional tests, imaging examinations, and progression-free survival (PFS) time to assess the safety and efficacy of HIFU in the treatment of liver cancer.Results:55 patients (29.4%) achieved CR and 73 patients (39.0%) achieved PR, 32 patients (17.1%) had responses of SD, and 27 patients (14.4%) were PD, respectively. Response rates were 90.5% (32 CR + 6 PR/42) in left lobe cancer and 64.1% (22 CR + 62 PR/131) in right lobe cancer. The median PFS for those CR case was 7 months, of PLC was 8 months, of MLC was 5 months.Conclusions:HIFU is effective and feasible in the treatment of liver cancer. It offer a significant noninvasive therapy for local treatment of liver cancer. For those right lobe liver cancers or with poor ultrasonic window, increasing treatment time or repeated treatment may improve the efficiency of HIFU ablation.
