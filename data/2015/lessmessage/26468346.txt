Aim:In this study, to clarify the SMAD4 blocking impact on fibrosis process, we investigated its down-regulation by shRNA on activated human LX-2 cell, in vitro.Background:Liver fibrosis is a critical consequence of chronic damage to the liver that can progress toward advanced diseases, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Different SMAD proteins play as major mediators in the fibrogenesis activity of hepatic stellate cells through TGF-β pathways, but the extent of SMAD4 as a co-SMAD protein remained less clear.Patients and methods:vector expressing verified shRNA targeting human SMAD4 gene was transfected into LX-2 cells. The GFP expressing plasmid was transfected in the same manner as a control group while leptin treated cells were employed as positive controls. Subsequently, total RNA was extracted and real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA levels of SMAD4, COL-1A1, α-SMA, TGF-β and TIMP-1. Furthermore, trypan blue exclusion was performed to test the effect of plasmid transfection and SMAD4 shutting-down on cellular viability.Results:The results indicated that the expression of SMAD4was down-regulated following shRNA transfection intoLX-2 cells (PConclusion:The results of this study suggested that knockdown of SMAD4 expression in stellate cell can control the progression of fibrogenesis through TGF-β pathway blocking.
