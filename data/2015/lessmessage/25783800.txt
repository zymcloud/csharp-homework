Objective:To determine the differences in enhancement of hepatocellular carcinoma during the first 5 minutes of postcontrast phases with gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) vs gadobenate dimeglumine.Methods:Ninety-five cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were examined on a 1.5-T scanner: 74 patients with Gd-BOPTA and 21 patients with Gd-EOB-DTPA. Same magnetic resonance imaging parameters were used for both groups. Gadoxetate isodium was administered at a dose of 0.025 mmol/kg; and Gd-BOPTA, at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg.Results:Mean contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were similar in arterial (P = 0.3), portal venous (P = 0.1), and 5-minute delayed phases (P = 0.73). The CNRs of lesions in the Gd-EOB-DTPA group were lower in arterial phase, although this did not reach statistical significance. The CNRs of Gd-EOB-DTPA during the equilibrium phase was higher (P = 0.006).Conclusions:Gadoxetate isodium resulted in lower CNR during the arterial phase and higher CNR during the portal venous, equilibrium, and 5-minute delayed phases compared with gadobenate dimeglumine using the Food and Drug Administration-approved doses; however, overall, there was no statistical significance (P = 0.077).
