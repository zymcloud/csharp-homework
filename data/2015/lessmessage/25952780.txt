Unresectable liver cancer presents a major problem in the treatment of solid tumors. Transarterial radioembolization is a modern approach toward primary and secondary liver malignancies. The mechanism of action is independent from other therapies that are based on ischemia or chemotoxicity. (90)Y-resin and (90)Y-glass microspheres are commercially available for transarterial radioembolization. Available data on the use of (90)Y-glass microspheres in hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic disease indicate that this treatment is safe and effective. In hepatocellular carcinoma the results compare well with chemoembolization and might be considered more often. Current data in metastatic disease are promising, but there is a strong need for prospective randomized trials to identify the role of transarterial radioembolization with (90)Y-glass microspheres in metastatic liver disease.
