Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been reported to be associated with inferior prognosis in hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinoma cases, but has not been studied with respect to non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of HBV infection in advanced NSCLC patients.Materials and methods:A retrospective cohort of 445 advanced NSCLC patients was recruited at our hospital from January 1, 2003 until August 30, 2014. Serum HBV markers were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. COX proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate associations of HBV infection with overall survival (OS).Results:Of 445 patients who were qualified for the study, 68 patients were positive for HBsAg, also considered as HBV infection. Patients in HBsAg negative group were found to have better OS (12.6 months [12.2-12.9]) than those in HBsAg positive group (11.30 months [10.8-11.9]; p=0.001). Furthermore, COX multivariate analysis identified HBV infection as an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 0.740 [0.560, 0.978], p=0.034).Conclusions:Our study found that HBsAg-positive status was an independent prognostic factor for OS in patients with advanced NSCLC. Future prospective studies are required to confirm our findings.
