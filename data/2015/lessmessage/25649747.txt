α-Phellandrene (α-PA) is a cyclic monoterpene. To investigate the induction of autophagy by α-PA and its mechanism, human liver tumor cells (J5) were incubated with α-PA and analyzed for cell viability and the molecular regulation of pre-autophagosome origination and autophagosome formation. According to the results, PI3K-I, mTOR, and Akt protein levels were decreased after α-PA treatment compared to those of the control group (p
