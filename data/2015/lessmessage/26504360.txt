Gout is a common inflammatory disease characterized by acute arthritis and hyperuricemia. A number of epidemiological studies have suggested the critical role of gout in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between gout and cancer risk by meta-analysis of all relevant studies published to date. A comprehensive literature search in PubMed and Embase databases from their inception up to July 1, 2014, was performed to identify eligible studies. The strength for relationship between gout and the risk of different cancers was evaluated by calculating pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). All analyses were carried out by STATA 12.0 software. Gout patients were at an increased risk of cancer, particularly urological cancers, digestive system cancers, and lung cancer. No such significant association between gout and the risk of breast or brain cancers was observed. Sensitivity analysis did not materially alter the pooled results. Gout is a risk factor of cancer, particularly that of urological cancers, digestive system cancers, and lung cancer. The pooled data further support the hypothesis of a link between gout and carcinogenesis.
