Purpose:As chemotherapy has improved, the survival of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma has reached up to 2.5 years. Many of these patients experience pulmonary metastases; however, the prognosis after pulmonary metastasectomy is not satisfying. In this study, we analyzed the prognostic factors for survival in patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy.Methods:Eighty-seven patients with colorectal carcinoma received pulmonary metastasectomy. The pathological status of the primary tumor, outcome of the pulmonary metastasectomy, disease-free interval, perioperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and history of liver metastases were assessed.Results:The five-year survival was 42.5% after pulmonary metastasectomy. A univariate analyses revealed that the CEA level (p = 0.043) and the number of pulmonary metastases (p = 0.047) were prognostic factors for survival. The CEA level was an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis (relative risk = 2.01, p = 0.037). Among cases with elevated preoperative CEA levels, those whose CEA level normalized after metastasectomy had a better prognosis compared with those whose CEA level decreased but was still high, or whose level increased after metastasectomy (median survival time of 41.8 months compared with 28.1 or 15.7 months, respectively p = 0.021).Conclusion:The CEA level can be a predictive marker for the prognosis in patients with pulmonary metastases from colorectal carcinoma.
