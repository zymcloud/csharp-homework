Goals and backgrounds:Best supportive care is suggested as the standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with performance status (PS) 3-4 by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system. To investigate the rationale of treatment allocation.Study:A total of 2660 HCC patients were reviewed. One-to-one matched pairs between PS 3 and 4 patients receiving supportive care and anti-HCC treatments were generated by using the propensity score with matching model. The survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The hazard ratio was calculated with the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Among 328 patients with PS 3-4, 38% of patients received active anti-HCC treatments against the BCLC system. Compared with patients undergoing supportive care, patients receiving anti-HCC treatments more often had milder cirrhosis, smaller tumor burden, and lower serum Î±-fetoprotein levels (all P0.05) at baseline. In the matching model, patients with PS 3-4 undergoing supportive care had significantly shortened survival with an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.711 (confidence interval: 3.041-7.297, PConclusions:Over one-third of patients with PS 3-4 receive active anti-HCC treatments against the BCLC allocation algorithm in this study. Active anticancer therapies rather than best supportive care should be performed if there is no apparent contraindication.
