Introduction:Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are uncommon, potentially malignant tumors, that arise in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. Up to 50% can develop metastasis, mainly in the liver, but the occurrence of synchronous primary liver tumors is a rare event in these patients.Presentation of case:The authors report a case of the association of gastric GIST and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a non-cirrhotic liver in a 76 year-old patient.Discussion:The appearance of an hepatic lesion in a GIST patient does not necessarily imply its secondary nature.Conclusion:In diagnosed GIST patients, all efforts should be pursued to characterize synchronous hepatic lesions, in order to plan a correct and tailored treatment of the patients.
