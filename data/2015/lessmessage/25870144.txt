Chloroform is an organic solvent used as an intermediate in the synthesis of various fluorocarbons. Despite its widespread use in industry and agriculture, exposure to chloroform can cause illnesses such as cancer, especially in the liver and kidneys. The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of chloroform on redox imbalance and pulmonary inflammatory response in adult C57BL/6 mice. Forty animals were divided into 4 groups (N = 10): female (FCG) and male (MCG) controls, and females (FEG) and males (MEG) exposed to chloroform (7.0 ppm) 3 times/d for 20 minutes for 5 days. Total and differential cell counts, oxidative damage analysis, and protein carbonyl and antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT) activity measurements were performed. Morphometric analyses included alveolar area (Aa) and volume density of alveolar septa (Vv) measurements. Compared to FCG and MCG, inflammatory cell influx, oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, and CAT activity were higher in FEG and MEG, respectively. Oxidative damage and enzyme CAT activity were higher in FEG than in FCG. The Aa was higher in FEG and MEG than in FCG and MCG, respectively. The Vv was lower in FEG and MEG than in FCG and MCG, respectively. This study highlights the risks of occupational chloroform exposure at low concentrations and the intensity of oxidative damage related to gender. The results validate a model of acute exposure that provides cellular and biochemical data through short-term exposure to chloroform.
