Aim:This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located in the caudate lobe of the liver.Patients and methods:Between 2012 April and 2014 February, 142 patients with HCC meeting the Milan criteria were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, nine patients had HCC located in the caudate lobe (caudate group). Six of the nine cases were located in the Spiegel lobe, two cases were located in the paracaval portion and one case was located in the caudate process. We evaluated the local recurrence rate and RFA-related complications in the caudate group and non-caudate group.Results:The local recurrence rate in the caudate group was 12.5% at 1 year and 12.5% at 2 years, while the local recurrence rate in the non-caudate group was 14.9% at 1 year and 29.0% at 2 years; there were no significant differences between the groups. No complications were observed in the caudate group, and minor complications were observed in six patients (4.5%) in the non-caudate group. No major complications or mortalities were observed in either group, and the complication rates were not significantly different between the groups (P = 1).Conclusions:RFA for HCC in the caudate lobe and the non-caudate lobe has equivalent effectiveness and safety. RFA is a promising treatment option for HCC arising in the caudate lobe.
