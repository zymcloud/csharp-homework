Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gT (RORγT) is the orphan nuclear receptor that regulates the development of Th17 cells and the expression of IL-17. The differentiation of Th17 cells is associated with the upregulation of RORγT mRNA, and the mechanisms regulating that process in human cells are not well understood. RORγt as transcription factor was selectively expressed in Th17 cells and is regulated by STAT3. The relationship between Th17 cells and tumor immunopathology has been controversial. Aim of the study is to evaluate Th17 cells and RORγt transcriptional factor in cirrhotic, early and advanced HCC patients. Ninety patients were studied (30 cirrhotic, 30 early stage and 30 advanced stage HCC patients). They were recruited from the National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, and subjected to full clinical examination, investigations to detect liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis and tumor staging. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with cytosim, ionomycin and monensin, and surface (CD4-PE)as well as intracellular staining for Th17 (IL-17 FITC) was performed. Analysis of cells was carried out using FACS Calibur. RORγt mRNA expression in PBMCs was measured by real time RT- PCR. Cirrhotic patients showed increased Th17% cells, without significant change in RORγt mRNA as compared to early stage HCC. Advanced stage HCC patients showed significant increase of Th17 cells% and RORγt mRNA compared to studied patients group. Positive correlation of Th17 and RORγtmRNA was found with aminotransferases and bilirubin levels while, negative with serum albumin in advanced stage patients group (P
