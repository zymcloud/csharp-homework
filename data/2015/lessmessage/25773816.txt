Objective:To explore effects of paclitaxel-loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) particles on the viability of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells.Materials and methods:The viability of HepG2 cells was assessed using MTT under different concentrations of prepared paclitaxel-loaded particles and paclitaxel (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L), and apoptosis was analyzed using Hochest33342/Annexin V-FITC/PI combined with an IN Cell Analyzer 2000.Results:Paxlitaxel-loaded nanoparticles were characterized by narrow particle size distribution (158.6 nm average particle size). The survival rate of HepG2 cells exposed to paclitaxel-loaded PLGA particles decreased with the increase of concentration and time period (PConclusions:Paclitaxel-loaded PLGA particles can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of HCC HepG2 cells. This new-type of paclitaxel carrier body is easily made and has low cost, good nanoparticle characterization and sustained release. Hence, paclitaxel- loaded PLGA particles deserve to be widely popularized in the clinic.
