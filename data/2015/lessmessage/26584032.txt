Objectives:Radiofrequency ablation plays a key role in the treatment of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. However, it is not recommended for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. The objective of this study was to clarify the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for treating intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We examined the outcome of 65 consecutive patients who were treated with radiofrequency ablation with or without transarterial chemoembolization for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:With a median follow-up of 37 months, overall survival rates of 65 cases at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 90, 70, 51, and 36%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of clinical parameters revealed that the multicentric occurrence (MC)/intrahepatic metastasis (IM) was the only significant prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence intervals, 2.1-11.4). Tumor size and tumor number were not significant factors for survival. The overall survival rates of patients with MC (n = 33) at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years were 97, 90, 80, and 59%, respectively; those for patients with IM (n = 32) were 86, 55, 14, and 8%, respectively (p Conclusion:Radiofrequency ablation is safe and effective for the treatment of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, especially for patients with MC.
