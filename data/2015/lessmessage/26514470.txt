Background:Real life management of hepatocellular carcinoma occasionally deviates from guidelines for recommended therapy.Aims:To evaluate how frequent this deviation happens in our center and assess its impact on outcome.Materials and methods:The treatment of 770 patients (87% males, mean age 57.8 years) was analyzed and the effect of deviation on outcome over 36 months was examined.Results:Of Barcelona Clinic liver cancer stages 0 and A patients, 65.8% received resection, ablation, liver transplantation or transarterial chemoembolisation for unresectable tumors more than 5 cm in diameter, and 34.2% received treatment recommended for later stages. Of stage B patients, 62.2% received recommended therapy, 34.3% of patients received supportive therapy or sorafenib and 3.5% received upward treatment stage migration. Among stage C patients, 7.6% received sorafenib, and most (79.2%) were given supportive care. Deviation from recommended therapy occurred in 34.2%, 37.7%, and 92.4% in stages 0-A, B and C. Survival of stage 0-A patients who received downwards treatment stage migration was lower than those who received recommended treatment (p Conclusions:Deviation from recommended therapy had a negative impact on survival in Barcelona Clinic liver cancer stage A patients.
