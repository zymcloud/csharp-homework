Background and aims:Treatment and management of patients with end-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a formidable challenge to contemporary branches of medical sciences. The study presented here was conducted to assess the utility of nutrient supplement, if any, for management of patients with end-stage HCC.Materials and methods:A total of 19 patients with end-stage HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] staging D) were provided with ONCOXIN® for 3 months. Another 10 patients with end-stage HCC (BCLC stage D) with similar clinical conditions received conservative management, but they did not give consent for taking ONCOXIN® (non-ONCOXIN® group). All patients of both groups were followed on regular basis until their death.Statistical analysis:The results were expressed as mean and standard deviation. Comparison between groups was performed using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. For categorical data, Chi-square or Fisher exact test was applied.Results:All patients of the control group (non-ONCOXIN® group) (10 of 10 patients) died within 2 months after study commencement. On the other hand, 10 of 19 patients receiving ONCOXIN® died within 2 months (less than 53% patients) after the start of taking ONCOXIN® (P Conclusions:Although this is a preliminary report, it inspires considerable optimism about safety and efficacy of a food supplement for management of patients with end-stage HCC.
