Hepatocellular carcinoma rarely invades the biliary tree. Clots or tumor embolus passing though the bile duct can cause pancreatitis by a mechanism similar to gallstone pancreatitis. We present the case of a patient with recurrent acute pancreatitis, initially suspicious of biliary origin. Despite cholecystectomy he had new episodes of acute pancreatitis. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed after the third episode. ERCP findings suggested the presence of a fistula connecting the tumor and the biliary tree. The patient was operated and the hepatocellular carcinoma was resected. Its pathological analysis confirmed the communication between the tumor and the biliary duct.
