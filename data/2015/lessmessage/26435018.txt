The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Europe and throughout the world is currently increasing. This is caused by an increase in the number of patients with alcoholic liver damage, metabolic syndrome, and by increasing incidence of hepatitis B and C.From January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013, resection or radiofrequency ablation of the liver was done in 360 patients with benign lesions or malignant tumors of the liver. In 28 patients HCC was diagnosed and histologically confirmed (7.8 %). Seven patients had HCC associated with liver cirrhosis (25 %), and 21 patients were without histologically confirmed cirrhosis (75 %). R0 resection was done in 18 (64 %) patients.Surgical complications occurred in 6 (21 %) patients and reoperation due to tumor relapse or progression was done eight times in 6 (21 %) patients. One-year and five-year patients' survivals were 64 % and 10 %, repectively, and did not statistically differ from the survival of the whole set of patients with tumor diseases in the given time period. In the future it will be possible to improve the long-term survival of patients with HCC by using screening methods for presymptomatic diagnosis of HCC, precise preoperative diagnosis and efforts for R0 resection (Tab. 1, Fig. 4, Ref. 11).
