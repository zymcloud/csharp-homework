Aim:To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of combination chemotherapy of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) regimen in patients with high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).Materials and methods:The authors analyzed the clinical response, toxicity, and the occurrence of secondary tumors of 45 patients with high-risk GTN under BEP.Results:The total complete remission (CR) rate of BEP regimen was 88.89% (40/45). Five patients developed drug-resistance after average 4.8 courses of BEP, and the regimen converted to etoposide, methotrexate, and dactinomycin (EMA)/cyclophosphamide and vincristine sulfate (CO). Ultimately, four cases achieved CR and one case died of cancer. There were no severe anaphylaxis and obvious impairment of cardiac, liver, pulmonary and kidney function, except one patient who developed grade IV bone marrow suppression and worsened pulmonary fibrosis after chemotherapy. None of survival patients developed secondary tumor during the follow-up.Conclusion:For young high-risk GTN patients, BEP may represent a safe and effective regimen.
