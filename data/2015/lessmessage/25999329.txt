Objectives:HIV-infected patients have higher mortality when coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). With potent highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the use of tenofovir (TDF), outcomes may improve. Our objective was to determine the clinical and virological outcomes of a HIV/HBV-Coinfected cohort at our center since TDF became available.Methods:We retrospectively studied all HIV/HBV-Coinfected adults followed between 2002 and 2012 for â‰¥3 months. Outcome measurements included HBV DNA suppression, HBV e-antigen (HBeAg) and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance, cirrhosis diagnosis, development of liver complications, and overall and liver-related mortality. Predicting factors were assessed with log-rank test and logistic regression.Results:Median time to follow-up of the 99 patients included was 5 years. Undetectable HBV DNA and HBsAg loss were achieved by 65% and 18%, respectively. Overall and liver-related mortality rates were 4.58 and 0.91 per 100 person-years, respectively. Most patients died of causes unrelated to the liver. Four patients died from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and one, hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected, from liver failure. Higher CD4 counts at last follow-up were associated with HBV suppression (odds ratio [OR] 1.004, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.001-1.006, P=.007), HBeAg loss (OR 1.003, 95% CI 1-1.005, P=.02), HBsAg loss (CD4 count>700 cells/mm3, OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.06-13.58, P=.04), and survival (OR .994, 95% CI 0.990-0.997, PConclusion:Mortality was high and most often unrelated to liver disease in this HIV/HBV-Coinfected cohort treated predominantly with TDF-containing HAART. Optimal CD4 counts predicted survival and the achievement of HBV virological end points. Tenofovir prevented liver decompensation but not HCC, which was the predominant cause of liver death.
