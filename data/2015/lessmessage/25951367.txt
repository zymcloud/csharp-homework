Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor involved in various biological processes. This nuclear receptor has critical functions in embryonic development as well as in adult homeostasis. Although the physiological functions of LRH-1 in normal breast, pancreas, and intestine have been widely investigated, the dysregulation that occurs during pathological conditions is not well understood. LRH-1 has been implicated in pancreatic, breast, and gastrointestinal cancer, where it exerts its effect of initiation and progression by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. In addition to mechanistic studies, LRH-1 agonists and antagonists are being explored. Identification and development of endogenous and synthetic ligands has been pursued using computational-based structural analysis. Through ligand identification and a thorough understanding of the pathological roles of LRH-1, new therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment based upon LRH-1 may be a desirable focus for further research.
