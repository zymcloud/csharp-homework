Background:Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), having demonstrated survival benefits, is the treatmentof choice in intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, although there is great heterogeneity in its clinical application.Material and methods:A survey was sent to the Madrid Regional hospitals to assess applicability, indications and treatment protocols. The assessment was made overall and according to the type of hospital (groups A vs. B and C).Results:Seventeen out of 22 hospitals responded (8/8 group A, 9/ 14 group B-C). All do/indicate transarterial chemoembolisation, 13/17 at their own facilities. Eight of the 17 hospitals have multidisciplinary groups (5/8 A, 3/9 B-C). Nine hospitals perform > 20 procedures/year (7 group A), and 6 from group B-C request/perform Conclusion:Uniformity among the Madrid Regional hospitals was found in the indication and treatment regimen. The use of DEB-TACE has become the preferred form of TACE in clinical practice. The differentiating factors for the more specialised hospitals are a larger volume of procedures, decision-making by multidisciplinary committees and assessment of radiological response more likely to be standardised.
