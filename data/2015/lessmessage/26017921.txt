Plasmacytoma of liver is a rare hepatic tumor more often seen at autopsy than described in the literature; it is also more likely diagnosed in the setting of multiple myeloma than as isolated extramedullary plasmacytoma. However, when found in the setting of multiple myeloma, it is associated with worse clinical outcome. The authors describe a case of an elderly man presenting with nonspecific chronic abdominal pain and a new 4-cm hepatic mass. At multiphasic computed tomography, the mass demonstrated an enhancement pattern identical to that expected of hepatocellular carcinoma; however, thorough history failed to uncover necessary risk factors for hepatic cirrhosis. Ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the mass, as well as additional clinical and radiologic assessment, subsequently confirmed a diagnosis of multiple myeloma.
