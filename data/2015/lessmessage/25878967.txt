Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor commonly used for the treatment of advanced renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma. The commonly reported dermatological adverse effects of Sorafenib include hand-foot syndrome (HFS), alopecia, pruritus, facial and scalp erythema, splinter hemorrhages, keratoacanthomas, squamous cell carcinomas and eruptive melanocytic naevi. We report a case of asymptomatic hyperpigmentation of the palms and soles in a patient receiving Sorafenib therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma, in the absence of features of classic HFS, which has not been previously reported in the literature.
