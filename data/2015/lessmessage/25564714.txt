High mortality among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients reflects both late diagnosis and low curability, due to pharmacoresistance. Taxol (TAX) is toxic for many human HCC-derived cell lines, yet its clinical efficacy on HCCs is poor. Combining TAX with other drugs appears a promising possibility to overcome such refractoriness. We analyzed whether combining tumor necrosis factor (TNF) with TAX would improve their toxicity. Human HCC-derived cell lines were treated with TAX or TNF, alone or combined. Apoptosis was assessed by morphology and flow-cytometry. Several pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules were evaluated by western blotting and/or enzymatic assay. After a 24 hour treatment, TNF was ineffective and TAX modestly cytotoxic, whereas HCC cells were conditionally sensitized to TNF by TAX. Indeed some relevant parameters were shifted to a prodeath setting: TNF-receptor 1 was increased, SOCS3, c-FLIP and pSTAT3 were markedly downregulated. These observations provide a significant clue to critically improve the drug susceptibility of HCC cells by combining 2 agents, TAX and TNF. The sequential application of TAX at a low dosage followed by TNF for only a short time triggered a strong apoptotic response. Of interest, prior TAX administration could also sensitize to TNF-induced apoptosis in the Yoshida AH-130 hepatoma transplanted in mice. Therefore, scrutinizing the possibility to develop similar combination drug regimens in suitable preclinical models seems highly advisable.
