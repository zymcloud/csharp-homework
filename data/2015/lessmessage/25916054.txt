Background/aims:This multicenter and single arm phase II clinical trial was performed to examine the safety and efficacy of modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) as adjuvant treatment after resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer.Methodology:Patients who had undergone R0-1 resection of liver metastases were assigned to 12 cycles of mFOLFOX6. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).Results:We enrolled 49 cases and analyzed adverse events in 48 cases, since in one patient cancer recurred before starting treatment. As to the relative dose intensity, 5-FU was 78.8%, and oxaliplatin was 75.9%. Adverse events of Grade 3 and above includ- ed 18 cases of neutropenia (37.5%), 4 cases of sensory neuropathy (8.3%), 4 cases of thrombocytopenia (8.3%) and 4 cases of allergy (8.3%), and there were no cases of fatality caused by adverse events. The most difference of adverse event compared with MOSAIC trial (Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5FU-LV in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer) was thrombocytopenia. The 2-year DFS was 59.2% (95% CI: 36.7-78.4) in the 49 enrolled cases.Conclusion:mFOLFOX6 after hepatectomy was tolerable. And mFOLFOX6 also seemed to improve DFS. mFOLFOX is one of the options for such patients and appears promising as an adjuvant treatment.
