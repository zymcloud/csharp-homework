Iron oxide nanoparticles are magnetic nanoparticles which have widespread application in MRI and heat therapy of cancer as contrast elements. They are also used effectively for drug and gene delivery because of effective penetrating to the cells and tissues. However, these features cause Fe2O3 nanoparticles have toxic effects that are not completely understood yet. In this study, effects of iron oxide nanoparticles on lung tissue in adult male Wistar rats were studied. We used pulmonary inhalation method for nanoparticle administration and used ether as a helper. Our results showed administered nanoparticles penetrated to the circulation and rapidly reached to liver and created serious inflammation in lung and liver tissues. This study used two different nanoparticle doses (20 and 40 mg/kg) and two exposing numbers (7 and 14 times). Results showed significant enhancement of free radicals and reduction of the GSH in lung tissue. Histological studies showed nanoparticle treatment of rats caused pulmonary emphysema, interstitial hyperemia and inflammation in lungs. By increasing the administrated dose lung tissue showed all of the mentioned symptoms with increased intensity. Nanoparticle exposition causes presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils in the lung tissue that confirmed there is a serious pathologic condition. Hepatic cells injuries cause penetration of the hepatic enzymes in to the blood serum (Tab. 2, Fig. 4, Ref. 32). Text in PDF www.elis.sk.
