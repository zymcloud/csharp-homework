Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer related death overall. The role of insulin resistance in the development of HCC associated with chronic HCV infection has not been established. Resistin is a polypeptide hormone belonging to the adipokine family which could contribute to tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Our aim was to study serum resistin and insulin resistance as risk factors for HCC in HCV cirrhotic patients.Materials and methods:This prospective case controlled study included 100 patients with HCV related liver cirrhosis and HCC, 100 patients with HCV related liver cirrhosis without HCC and 50 apparently healthy participants as controls. For all subjects, liver profile, serologic markers for viral hepatitis, lipid profile, alpha-fetoprotein level (AFP), homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) were examined along with resistin.Results:HCC patients had higher mean values of HOMA-IR and resistin than cirrhotic patients and the control subjects (p 12 ng/ml and HOMA >4 being 1.6 times more likely to have HCC.Conclusions:HOMA and serum resistin allow for early identification of patients with cirrhosis who are at substantially increased risk of HCC.Recommendation:HOMA and serum resistin could represent novel markers to identify HCV cirrhotic patients at greater risk of development of HCC.
