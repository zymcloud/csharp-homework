Background:Nowadays complete primary cytoreduction can be achieved in a large number of patients suffering from advanced ovarian cancer. However, there is a group of patients in whom complete tumor resection remains impossible. The authors analyzed the intraoperative limiting factors in patients with residual tumor after primary surgery treated in the present institution.Materials and methods:Patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (FIGO Stage IIIB-IV), who underwent primary incomplete surgery in the present institution between 2006 and 2008 were included in this study. Patients' records were evaluated regarding to intraoperative findings and final surgical results.Results:The authors identified 39 eligible patients in their registry. Twenty-six (66.7%) patients underwent surgery with residual tumor < 1 cm and 13 (33.3%) ≥ 1 cm. The most frequent location of residual tumor limiting complete surgery was disseminated bowel carcinomatosis in 34 (87.2%) patients. Moreover significant differences in tumor residuals locations and operative time between patients with residuals < 1 cm and ≥ 1 cm were reported (p < 0.05).Conclusions:The most frequent reason for incomplete primary cytoreduction remains disseminated carcinomatosis. However, in patients with residuals under one cm, its frequency is significantly higher. The complication rate is comparable in patients independently of residual tumor < 1 cm and ≥ 1 cm. Therefore the cytoreductive efforts should be made even in primarily not completely operated patients in order to achieve residuals under one cm.
