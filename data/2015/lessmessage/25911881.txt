Background/aims:To explore the effect of prophylactic hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) on survival probability after curative resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:85 patients with HCC were randomly assigned to HAIC group (42 cases) and control group (43 patients), all the database of two groups had no significant difference. Patients in HAIC groups underwent hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on day 1, Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 on day 1 and Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on day 1 and 8) starting 3 weeks after operation with intervals of 4 weeks. All patients were followed up for 3 years and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival, disease-free survival rate and overall survival rate were recorded.Results:Intrahepatic recurrence rate of HAIC group and the control group was respectively 19.05% and 39.53%, P Conclusion:HAIC effectively and safely prevents intrahepatic recurrence and improves the prognosis of patients with HCC after curative resection.
