Introduction:Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B, an intermediate stage, includes various conditions of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This heterogeneity of the patients with intermediate-stage HCC makes it difficult to predict their survival rates. In the present study, we examined the validity of the modified Bolondi classification (Kinki criteria) as a subclassification of patients with BCLC stage B HCC.Methods:Of 906 patients who underwent conventional transarterial chemoembolization at Kinki University Hospital, 753, who met the inclusion criteria, were examined. Of these 753 patients, 425 (56.4%) with BCLC stage B were subclassified using the Kinki criteria to examine the survival rate.Results:According to the Kinki criteria, 158 (37.2%) were subclassified into subclass B1, 236 (55.5%) into B2, and 31 (7.3%) into B3. The comparison of the survival rates showed that the median overall survival was 3.9 years (95% CI, 3.2-4.6) in the BCLC subclass B1 group, 2.5 years (95% CI, 2.2-3.1) in the B2 group, and 1.1 years (95% CI, 0.6-1.5) in the B3 group (p Conclusion:When the BCLC stage B patients were subclassified according to the Kinki criteria, survival curves were stratified with significant differences, suggesting that the Kinki criteria were suitable for the subclassification of the intermediate-stage HCC patients.
