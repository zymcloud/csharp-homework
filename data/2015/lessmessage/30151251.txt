We present the case of a patient with chronic viral hepatitis B and cirrhosis referred to the Gastroenterology Department for evaluation. The contrast-enhanced ultrasound and elastography revealed a nodule in the right liver lobe suggesting the diagnosis of dysplastic nodule. The patient performed contrast enhanced multi-detector computer-tomography, showing a subcapsular nodule with enhanced centre and lack of enhancement in the perifery, highly suspicious for HCC. The HCC final diagnosis was assessed by using 3T magnetic resonance imaging system along with hepatocyt specific contrast agents and diffusion sequences, pointing to the importance of state-of-the-art imaging techniques in the liver nodules assessment.
