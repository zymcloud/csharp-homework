Background:Many factors, including molecular ones, were demonstrated to be associated with long-term prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus far, the expression and clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of the carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) in B-type hepatitis virus (HBV)- related HCC remain unknown.Materials and methods:CHIP expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining of surgical samples from 79 patients with HCC with HBsAg positivity. In addition, correlations with clinicopathologic parameters and patient survival were evaluated.Results:It was found that positive CHIP staining was observed in tumor, but not non-tumor, tissues. High expression of CHIP was significantly related to larger tumor size, with marginally significant associations noted for presence of portal vein invasion and higher serum a-fetoprotein level. In addition, univariate analysis showed that high CHIP expression was a powerful predictor for dismal overall and disease-free survival. However, independent prognostic implications of CHIP were not proven in multivariate Cox regression test.Conclusions:CHIP is overexpressed in HBV-related HCC and is associated with unfavorable biological behavior as well as poor prognosis. However, its prognostic role needs to be further validated.
