Aim:Effectiveness of Glypican-3 (GPC3)-targeted photoimmunotherapy (PIT) combined with the nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) for hepatocellular carcinoma was evaluated.Materials & methods:GPC3 expressing A431/G1 cells were incubated with a phthalocyanine-derivative, IRDye700DX (IR700), conjugated to an anti-GPC3 antibody, IR700-YP7 and exposed to near-infrared light. Therapeutic experiments combining GPC3-targeted PIT with nab-paclitaxel were performed in A431/G1 tumor-bearing mice.Results:IR700-YP7 bound to A431/G1 cells and induced rapid target-specific necrotic cell death by near-infrared light exposure in vitro. IR700-YP7 accumulated in A431/G1 tumors. Tumor growth was inhibited by PIT compared with nontreated control. Additionally, PIT dramatically increased nab-paclitaxel delivery and enhanced the therapeutic effect.Conclusion:PIT targeting GPC3 combined with nab-paclitaxel is a promising method for treating hepatocellular carcinoma.
