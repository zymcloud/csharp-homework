Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic tissue located in various parts of the body: lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, adenoids, tonsils, and bone marrow. The disease occurs mainly in adults, with a higher incidence within the age range of 45 to 60 years. We present a clinical case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in a patient with chronic viral hepatitis B and D. The particularity of this case consists in the diagnosis of primitive spleen lymphoma, described in less than 1% of the cases, and also the difficult antiviral therapy recommendation for the liver disease, given the associated co-morbidity.Abbreviations:NHL = Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, HDV = Hepatitis delta virus, HCV = Hepatitis C virus, HBV = Hepatitis B virus, CT = Computerized tomography, CEUS = Contrast enhanced ultrasonography, CHOP = cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, R-CHOP = cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone and rituximab.
