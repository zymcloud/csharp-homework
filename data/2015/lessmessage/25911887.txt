Background/aims:To explore the clinical application and significance of the technique of orthotopic liver resection.Methodology:From January 2004 to December 2011, five patients with huge hepatocellular carcinoma with invasion or severe adhesion of diaphragm were undergone right semi-liver resection using the technique of orthotopic liver resection. The right hemi-liver was isolated from the first liver portal, second liver portal and third liver portal, then isolated from the normal liver, finally the tumor and the invaded diaphragm were resected or removed from the severe adhesion. The approach to hepatic resection involved routine use of Peng's multifunctional operative dissector, selective control of in and out-flow of liver, control of inferior vena cava (IVC) and liver hanging maneuver, anterior approach, etc.Results:The operations were successfully performed in 5 patients. Operative time was 120, 180, 150, 150 and 160 min, respectively. The amount of blood loss were 350, 350, 400, 450, 600 ml, respectively. Postoperative complications were pleural effusion in 3 cases, and other 2 cases recovered without complications.Conclusions:Although the technique of orthotopic liver resection has a high technical requirement for surgeons, it provides a surgical method and operative opportunity for the patients whose tumor has invaded diaphragm or has been severe adhesion with diaphragm and conventional liver resection cannot be performed.
