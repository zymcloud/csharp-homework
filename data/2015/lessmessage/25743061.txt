It has been well established that structural changes in glycans attached to proteins and lipids are associated with malignant transformation of cells. We focused on galactose residues among the sugars since they are involved in the galectin-mediated biology, and many carbohydrate antigens are frequently expressed on this sugar. We found changes in the expression of the β4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) 2 and 5 genes in cancer cells: decreased expression of the β4GalT2 gene and increased expression of the β4GalT5 gene. The growth of mouse melanoma cells showing enhanced expression of the β4GalT2 gene or reduced expression of the β4GalT5 gene is inhibited remarkably in syngeneic mice. Tumor growth inhibition is probably caused by the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, and/or reduced MAPK signals. Direct transduction of human β4GalT2 cDNA together with the adenovirus vector into human hepatocellular carcinoma cells grown in SCID mice results in marked growth retardation of the tumors. β4GalT gene-transfer appears to be a potential tool for cancer therapy.
