Presented herein is a case report concerning tumorous thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and right atrium, which is rather an uncommon but severe complication of primary hepatic cancer. The purpose of the article is to demonstrate successful surgical management of locally disseminated hepatic carcinoma complicated by tumorous thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and portal vein, as well as thrombosis of the right atrium. The patient was subjected to dextral hemihepatectomy with thrombectomy from the right portal vein, resection of the right cupola of the diaphragm, marginal resection of the lower lobe of the right lung, thrombectomy from the inferior vena cava and right atrium. The outcome of our case report, as well as literature data suggest that in case of resectability of hepatic tumour complicated by thrombosis of major vessels and even the heart, surgical intervention is justified if there is a possibility to completely remove thrombotic masses along with the primary tumour.
