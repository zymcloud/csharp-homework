Aims:To determine predictors of failed enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in patients after elective colorectal surgery.Methods:A cohort of 55 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery was monitored prospectively. Perioperative care was based on a previously established protocol for ERAS. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative parameters were analyzed to elicit predictors of ERAS failure. ERAS failure was defined as prolonged hospital stay (> 7 days). The risk calculator CR-POSSUM was evaluated for its clinical utility.Results:Body mass index (BMI) or the American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA) was not associated with ERAS failure on univariate analysis, but patients that failed ERAS were significantly older (64 y vs 54 y ; p = 0.023). Prolonged length of stay (> 7 days) was also associated with an open approach (p = 0.009), intraoperative nasogastric tube placement (p = 0.005), blood loss > 500 ml (p = 0.008), stoma formation (p = 0.006) and insertion of more than one intraabdominal drain during surgery (p = 0.005). Postoperative continuation of intravenous fluids (p = 0.027), reinsertion of urinary catheter (p = 0.045) and postoperative ileus (p = 0.020) were also strongly associated with delayed discharge on univariate analysis. After multivariate analysis the preoperative parameters CR-POSSUM score (p = 0.022), increasing BMI (p = 0.014) and preoperative albumin level (p = 0.031) were all independently associated with failure of ERAS.Conclusions:A variety of perioperative factors contribute to failure of ERAS in routine practice. CR-POSSUM can help to identify patients at risk for possible failure of ERAS. This may help to optimize avoidable factors, or accommodate those patients likely to require a longer post-operative stay.
