Purpose:To compare diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and nodules at high risk of HCC transformation.Materials and methods:We evaluated nodules' size, vascular pattern, and signal intensity on hepatobiliary phase images and on DWI of 105 nodules (41 cirrhotic patients).Results:A total of 35/66 HCCs identified on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI showed hyperintensity on DWI. A total of 25/39 nodules (hypovascular and hypointense nodule on hepatobiliary phase images) progressed to HCC (higher risk for nodules â‰¥10mm in size and hyperintense on DWI, PConclusion:Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI demonstrated a significant role in the identification of nodule at higher risk of HCC transformation, and hyperintensity on DWI was associated with progression to HCC.
