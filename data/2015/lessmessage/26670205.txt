Pancreatic tumors comprise benign lesion and malignant lesion, most importantly pancreatic adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma or metastasis. Surgical resection provides the only chance for cure for malignant pancreatic tumors. In some cases, surgical resection is performed because a malignant lesion is suspected, however, histopathological examinations eventually reveal a benign lesion. Here, we report the case of a 49-year-old woman, who was initially diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas with metastasis to the liver. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy and atypical liver resection. Surprisingly, however, histopathological examination revealed an intrapancreatic accessory spleen (IPAS) of the pancreatic tail as well as liver hemangioma. This unique case report highlights the impact of extensive preoperative examinations to differentiate benign and malignant pancreatic lesions and, possibly, prevent patients from unnecessary surgery.
