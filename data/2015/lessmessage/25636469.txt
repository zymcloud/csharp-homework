Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, and the third leading cause of cancer mortality. The great majority of patients are not eligible for curative therapies, and therapeutic approaches for advanced disease show only limited efficacy. Difficulties to treat HCC are due to the heterogenous genetic alterations of HCC, profound alterations in the hepatic microenvironment, and incomplete understanding of HCC biology. Mouse models of HCC will be helpful to improve our understanding of HCC biology, the contributions of the specific pathways and genetic alterations to carcinogenesis. In addition, mouse models of HCC may contribute to elucidate the role of the tumor microenvironment, and serve as models for preclinical studies. As no single mouse model is appropriate to study all of the above, we discuss key features and limitations of commonly used models. Furthermore, we provide detailed protocols for select models, in which HCC is induced genetically, chemically or by transplantation of tumor cells.
