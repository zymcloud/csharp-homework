Ten biscembranoids (1-10), including the two new compounds sarcophytolides M and N (1 and 2), were isolated from the methanol extract of the Vietnamese soft coral Sarcophyton pauciplicatum. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including one dimensional (1D)- and 2D-NMR, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), and circular dichroism (CD). The in vitro cytotoxic activity of all isolated compounds against a panel of eight human cancer cell lines including HepG2 (hepatoma cancer), HL-60 (acute leukemia), KB (epidermoid carcinoma), LNCaP (prostate cancer), LU-1 (lung cancer), MCF7 (breast cancer), SK-Mel2 (melanoma), and SW480 (colon adenocarcinoma) was evaluated using the sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay. Among the isolated biscembranoids, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10 exhibited significant cytotoxic effects and may be selected for further studies of their anticancer activity.
