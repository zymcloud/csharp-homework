Background:After liver transplant (LT), the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence is partially dependent on the degree of immunosuppression. We aimed to determine whether assessing net state of CD4(+) T-cell function after LT could determine those at risk for HCC recurrence.Methods:One hundred thirty-seven patients with cirrhosis who underwent LT for HCC were followed for recurrence of HCC. All patients had serial CD4(+) assay performed prospectively. Cox regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with HCC recurrence. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to assess the association between CD4(+) ATP values and hazard of HCC recurrence.Results:The mean follow-up time was 3.1 Â± 1.5 years, during which 14 patients (10%) had HCC recurrence. Patients with combined post-LT CD4(+) T-cell function area under curve (AUC) Conclusion:Lower cumulative CD4(+) T-cell function post-LT predicted a higher risk of HCC recurrence. These findings may have implications toward management of HCC patients after LT.
