Magnetic nano-Fe3O4 particles (MNPs), static magnetic field (SMF) and extremely low-frequency altering electric magnetic field (ELFF) were utilized to treat nude mice loading hepatoma Bel-7402 cell lines to investigate the therapeutic values of MNPs combined with ELFF in vivo. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) figures showed that about 98.9% MNPs injected into mice body through tail vein were gathered in tumor focal by SMF directing exposure. Single ELFF and MNPs treatments did not influence mice physiological function obviously. However, gathered MNPs combined with ELFF treatment prolonged mice survival time and inhibited loading tumor cells proliferation significantly compared to other mice groups (p
