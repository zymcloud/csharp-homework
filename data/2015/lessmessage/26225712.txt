Background:A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to compare the post-recurrence survival with hepatic re-resection versus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after initial resection.Materials and methods:All relevant papers were searched via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis was performed according to country. Sensitivity analysis was performed in studies which clearly reported the recurrent regions, in moderate/high-quality studies, in studies published in full-text form, and in studies published after 2005.Results:In total, twelve papers were included in our study. Five and seven of them were of moderate- and poor-quality, respectively. The overall meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significantly higher post-recurrence survival in the hepatic re-resection group than in those undergoing TACE (HR=0.64, 95%CI=0.52-0.79, PConclusions:Hepatic re-resection might provide a better post-recurrence survival than TACE for recurrent HCC after initial resection. However, considering the low quality of published studies and the potential bias of treatment selection, further randomized trials should be warranted to confirm these findings.
