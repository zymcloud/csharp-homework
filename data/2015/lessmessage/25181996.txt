The process of angiogenesis involves the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature by the over expression of certain factors leading to the growth and development of all solid tumor types. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor abbreviated as c-Met and vascular endothelial growth factor abbreviated as VEGF are some of the factors responsible for the induction in tumor growth and development. Recently a number of analogues associated with these receptors are under study. US FDA on November 29, 2012 approved a drug named cabozantinib formerly known as XL184 which is being marketed under the trade name of Cometriq for the treatment of Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC). Designing of the drug has been done in such a fashion that it can inhibit both VEGFR2 and c-Met simultaneously without over expressing any of the factors leading to the inhibition of angiogenesis. The drug is still under study for the evaluation of its efficacy in cases of many other solid tumor types including breast cancer, castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer, melanoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma. This review article consists of preclinical and clinical data of cabozantinib and its efficacy and safety towards various types of solid tumors.
