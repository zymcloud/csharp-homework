Objective:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended as a first-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients ineligible for curative therapy and without portal invasion. The Assessment for Retreatment with TACE (ART) scoring system was recently proposed for identifying patients who would not show sufficient survival benefit from repeated TACE. We reevaluated the performance of ART in HCC patients treated in Japan, where selective TACE is commonly used.Methods:Between 2000 and 2013, 988 patients with HCC underwent TACE at Kinki University Hospital, and 627 received ≥2 sessions of TACE. Seventy-six patients who underwent ≥2 TACE sessions within 90 days were investigated for their performance of the ART score in the context of overall survival (OS).Results:Only 12% (76/627) of patients underwent ≥2 TACE sessions within 90 days. Of those, 52 patients showed a low ART score (0-1.5), and 24 had a high ART score (≥2.5); the median OS was 20.2 and 37.6 months, respectively (p = 0.8207).Conclusion:The ART scoring system did not demonstrate a sufficiently predictive impact on OS among the patients who underwent ≥2 TACE sessions within 90 days. Application of the ART score should be carefully considered because differences in TACE procedures and post-TACE treatment can affect the results while evaluating OS.
