Background/aims:Anoikis resistance is a prerequisite for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis. The role of Caveolin-1 (CAV1) in anoikis resistance of HCC remains unclear.Methods:The oncogenic effect of CAV1 on anchor-independent growth and anoikis resistance was investigated by overexpression and knockdown of CAV1 in hepatoma cells. IGF-1 pathway and its downstream signals were detected by immunoblot analysis. Caveolae invagination and IGF-1R internalization was studied by electron microscopy and (125)I-IGF1 internalization assay, respectively. The role of IGF-1R and tyrosine-14 residue (Y-14) of CAV1 was explored by deletion experiment and mutation experiment, respectively. The correlation of CAV1 and IGF-1R was further examined by immunochemical analysis in 120 HCC specimens.Results:CAV1 could promote anchor-independent growth and anoikis resistance in hepatoma cells. CAV1-overexpression increased the expression of IGF-1R and subsequently activated PI3K/Akt and RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, while CAV1 knockdown showed the opposite effect. The mechanism study revealed that CAV1 facilitated caveolae invagination and (125)I-IGF1 internalization. IGF-1R deletion or Y-14 mutation reversed CAV1 mediated anchor-independent growth and anoikis resistance. In addition, CAV1 expression was positively related to IGF-1R expression in human HCC tissues.Conclusion:CAV1 confers resistance of hepatoma cells to anoikis by activating IGF-1 pathway, providing a potential therapeutic target for HCC metastasis.
