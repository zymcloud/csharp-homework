Tumor cell vasculogenic mimicry refers to the formation of tumor cell-lined vessels that contribute to tumor neovascularization and nutrient and oxygen supply. These tumor cells express many endothelial and stem cell markers, resulting in them having a unique phenotype. This phenomenon is observed in a variety of neoplasms, such as glioblastomas and sarcomas, as well as breast, ovarian, liver and lung carcinomas. It is also evident in melanocytic lesions, regardless of their benign or malignant nature. The biochemical and molecular events that regulate vasculogenic mimicry provide opportunities for development of novel forms of tumor-targeted treatments. Furthermore, the presence of this process in a tumor might have prognostic implications.
