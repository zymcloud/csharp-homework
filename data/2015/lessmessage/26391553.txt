Purpose:The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical significance of preoperative Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (RHCC) patients after thermal ablation.Materials and methods:We retrospectively reviewed 414 patients with RHCC treated with ultrasound-guided thermal ablation percutaneously between January 2010 and March 2014. The correlation of recurrence-free survival (RFS) with 15 clinical parameters was analysed by Cox multivariate proportional hazard model analysis. The best cut-off value of preoperative PLR was determined with time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The value of PLR in predicting recurrence was analysed by Kaplan-Meier.Results:Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that tumour differentiation, prothrombin time (PT), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and PLR were risk factors for recurrence in RHCC patients. PLR â‰¥ 87.87 was considered for evaluation (AUROC = 0.667; P
