BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronic infection may follow a benign course with low risk of cirrhosis or liver cancer. As differentiation of inactive status from HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B is often challenging, monitoring of inactive HBV carriers is important to detect viral relapse or formerly undetected activity. The incidence of hepatitis activity in HBeAg-negative carriers with normal aminotransferases was examined by retrospective analysis of a cohort of carriers who had been followed-up at a hospital in Central Brazil. All patients had remained free of evidence of liver disease and maintained normal aminotransferase levels throughout the first year of follow-up. The incidence density of chronic HBV activity was determined and an incidence curve was constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression models were developed to identify for surrogate markers of activity.Results:Among the 224 patients who comprised the cohort, chronic HBV activity was detected in 30 during followup. The incidence density of activity was 11.8 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval: 8.3-16.9). The results of Cox regression analysis indicated that chronic HBV activity was associated with entrance in the latter years of the period examined (p = 0.001) and initial normal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels close to the upper-normal value (p = 0.022).Conclusion:Normal AST levels near the upper-normal value may be an indicator of relapse or previously undetected activity, and should thus be monitored closely in HBeAg-negative HBV carriers, in whom risk of relapse should remain an important managing consideration.
