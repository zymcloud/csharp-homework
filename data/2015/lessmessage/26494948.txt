Since it remains elusive whether and how the imaging surveillance affects the survival in patients with non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC), we conducted this retrospective study which investigated the association between the semiannual surveillance prior to HCC diagnosis and the survival in patients with the initial diagnosis of HCC induced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (N = 141) and non-B, non-C etiology (N = 30). It was demonstrated that surveillance was less frequently performed in the NBNC-HCC patients compared to that in HCC patients with HBV and/or HCV infections (B/C-HCC patients), and the survival was unfavorable in NBNC-HCC patients. On the other hand, the survival of NBNC-HCC patients with semiannual surveillance was significantly favorable than those patients without semiannual surveillance, and the survival was similar between B/C-HCCs and NBNC-HCCs with semiannual surveillance. In conclusion, though NBNC-HCC patients compared to B/C-HCC patients had poorer prognosis overall, these NBNC-HCC patients with semiannual surveillance had a better survival almost equivalent to the survival of B/C-HCC patients with semiannual surveillance, demonstrating the clinical utility of the semiannual imaging surveillance program for NBNC-HCCs.
