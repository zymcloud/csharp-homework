Objective:Significance of portal hemodynamics for non-invasive marker of cirrhosis remains unclear. The aim was to determine the value of portal hemodynamics on Doppler ultrasound for predicting decompensation and prognosis in cirrhosis.Methods:This retrospective study comprised 236 cirrhotic patients (132 males, 104 females; age 63.7 Â± 11.3 years; 110 compensated, 126 decompensated). Clinical data, including Doppler findings, were analyzed with respect to decompensation and prognosis. The median follow-up period was 33.2 months (0.1-95.4).Results:Fifty-three patients developed clinical decompensation, 13 patients received liver transplantation, and 71 died. Higher model for end-stage liver disease score (p 31 IU/L, albumin Conclusion:Portal hemodynamics offer a non-invasive marker for decompensation and prognosis of cirrhosis, suggesting a future direction for practical management.
