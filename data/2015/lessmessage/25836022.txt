Purpose:To determine the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(min)) values of benign and malignant hepatic lesions based on diffusion-weighted imaging and to compare the diagnostic performance of ADC(min) and mean ADC (ADC(mean)) values for differentiating between benign and malignant tumors of the liver.Materials and methods:We retrospectively subjected 240 patients with 195 malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], n = 137; metastases, n = 44; cholangiocellular carcinoma [CCC], n = 14) and 45 benign tumors (hemangiomas, n = 37; focal nodular hyperplasia [FNH], n = 8). Both ADC(mean) and ADC(min) were evaluated independently by 2 readers, the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of malignancy were calculated, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. To determine interobserver agreement, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient.Results:Mean ADC (Ã—10 mm/s) was 1.19 for malignant (HCC, 1.15; metastasis, 1.23; CCC, 1.51) and 2.01 for benign tumors (hemangioma, 2.09; FNH, 1.52; P Conclusions:Mean ADC and ADC(min) were valuable for differentiating between malignant and benign hepatic lesions. The area under the ROC curve of ADC(min) was significant higher than that of ADC(mean).
