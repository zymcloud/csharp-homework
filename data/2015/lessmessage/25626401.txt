Objective:This study aimed to assess the effects of sampling interval (SI) of computed tomographic (CT) perfusion acquisitions on CT perfusion values in normal liver and liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors.Methods:Computed tomographic perfusion in 16 patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases was analyzed using distributed-parameter modeling to yield tissue blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time, permeability, and hepatic arterial fraction for tumor and normal liver. Computed tomographic perfusion values for the reference SI of 0.5 s (SI0.5) were compared with those of SI data sets of 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, and 4 seconds using mixed-effects model analyses.Results:Increases in SI beyond 1 second were associated with significant and increasing departures of CT perfusion parameters from the reference values at SI0.5 (P â‰¤ 0.0009). Computed tomographic perfusion values deviated from the reference with increasing uncertainty with increasing SIs. Findings for normal liver were concordant.Conclusions:Increasing SIs beyond 1 second yield significantly different CT perfusion parameter values compared with the reference values at SI0.5.
