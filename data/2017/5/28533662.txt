Aim:To investigate the role of CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)-7 and CXCL12 in lymph node and liver metastasis of gastric carcinoma.Methods:In 160 cases of gastric cancer, the expression of CXCR7 and CXCL12 in tumor and matched tumor-adjacent non-cancer tissues, in the lymph nodes around the stomach and in the liver was detected using immunohistochemistry to analyze the relationship between CXCR7/CXCL12 expression and clinicopathological features and to determine whether CXCR7 and CXCL12 constitute a biological axis to promote lymph node and liver metastasis of gastric cancer. Furthermore, the CXCR7 gene was silenced and overexpressed in human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells, and cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness were measured by the MTT, wound healing and Transwell assays, respectively.Results:CXCR7 expression was up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues (P = 0.011). CXCR7/CXCL12 expression was significantly related to high tumor stage and lymph node (r = 0.338, P = 0.000) and liver metastasis (r = 0.629, P = 0.000). The expression of CXCL12 in lymph node and liver metastasis was higher than that in primary gastric cancer tissues (χ2 = 6.669, P = 0.010; χ2 = 25379, P = 0.000), and the expression of CXCL12 in lymph node and liver metastasis of gastric cancer was consistent with the positive expression of CXCR7 in primary gastric cancer (r = 0.338, P = 0.000; r = 0.629, P = 0.000). Overexpression of the CXCR7 gene promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Silencing of the CXCR7 gene suppressed SGC-7901 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Human gastric cancer cell lines expressed CXCR7 and showed vigorous proliferation and migratory responses to CXCL12.Conclusion:The CXCR7/CXCL12 axis is involved in lymph node and liver metastasis of gastric cancer. CXCR7 is considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer.
