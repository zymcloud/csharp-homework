Recently, two conflicting articles about recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after direct acting antivirals (DAA) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) were published. We investigated the relationship between DAA and HCC recurrence. Eligible patients were (1) history of HCC and treated curatively with interventions, and (2) interferon-free DAA therapy was initiated after eradication of HCC. We analyzed contributing factor for HCC recurrence. Ten out of 23 participants (43%) encountered recurrence of HCC. Age, sex, diabetes mellitus, fibrosis score, chemistry, and alpha-fetoprotein did not differ between patients with recurrence and patients without recurrence. The patients with recurrence had significantly higher values of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) than the patients without recurrence, 6.06±3.75 vs. 0.91±2.43 (p=0.0019). The relative risk of HCC recurrence comparing anti-HBc positive to negative was 5.2 (95% confidence interval 1.40 to 19.32). Odds ratio was 22.0 (95% confidence interval 2.5 to 191.1). We conclude that anti-HBc positivity was a strong contributing factor for HCC recurrence after DAA therapy.
