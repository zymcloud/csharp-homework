RAS protein activator like 2 (RASAL2) has been reported to be dysregulated in various types of cancer. It has previously been demonstrated that RASAL2 is hypomethylated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the expression pattern of RASAL2 and its potential role in HCC remain to be elucidated. The present study demonstrated that the expression of RASAL2 was upregulated in HCC tissues, compared with in normal liver tissues, by using immunohistochemistry. In addition, Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and invasion assay revealed that knockdown of RASAL2 inhibited the growth and invasion of HCC cells. Western blotting results indicated that the inhibition of RASAL2 reduced the levels of phosphorylated-AKT. Notably, RASAL2 was observed to be a direct target of miR-203 in HCC in luciferase activity assays. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-203 exhibited a similar effect to RASAL2 knockdown in HCC cells. These results indicated that RASAL2 serves a tumor oncogenic role in HCC and may be considered a potential target in HCC.
