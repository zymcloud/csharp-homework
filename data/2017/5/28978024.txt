In this study, we explored the actions of miR-199a/b-5p during hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and its potential target genes. Through heatmap miRNA expression analysis of 15 matched HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues from the TCGA database, we detected 19 mRNAs that were upregulated and 13 that were downregulated specifically in HCC. Among these, miR-199 family members were downregulated in HCC tumors and cell lines, as compared to controls. Low miR-199a/b-5p expression was also associated with poor overall survival of HCC patients. miR-199a/b-5p overexpression in HCC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, miR199-a/b-5p post-transcriptionally suppressed Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 1 (ROCK1). This in turn led to inhibition of ROCK1/MLC and PI3K/Akt signaling, which is necessary for HCC proliferation and metastasis. These results indicate that miR-199a/b acts as tumor suppressors in HCC and represent promising therapeutic targets.
