Purpose:To investigate the feasibility of perfusion-CT (p-CT) measurements in quantitative assessment of hemodynamic changes related to sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Twenty-two patients with advanced HCC underwent p-CT study (256-MDCT scanner) before and 2 months after sorafenib administration. Dedicated perfusion software generated a quantitative map of arterial and portal perfusion and calculated the following perfusion parameters in target liver lesion: hepatic perfusion (HP), time-to-peak (TTP), blood volume (BV), arterial perfusion (AP), and hepatic perfusion index (HPI). After the follow-up scan, patients were categorized as responders and non-responders, according to mRECIST. Perfusion values were analyzed and compared in HCC lesions and in the cirrhotic parenchyma (n=22), such as between baseline and follow-up in progressors and non-progressors.Results:Before treatment, all mean perfusion values were significantly higher in HCC lesions than in the cirrhotic parenchyma (HP 47.8±17.2 vs 13.3±6.3mL/s per 100g; AP 47.9±18.1 vs 12.9±10.7mL/s; pConclusions:p-CT technique can be used for HCC quantitative assessment of changes related to anti-angiogenic therapy. Identification of response predictors might help clinicians in selection of patients who may benefit from targeted-therapy allowing for optimization of individualized treatment.
