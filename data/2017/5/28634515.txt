Aim:To assess the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a new generation of 40 μm drug eluting beads in patients not eligible for curative treatment.Methods:Drug eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE) using a new generation of microspheres (embozene tandem, 40 μm) preloaded with 100 mg of doxorubicin was performed on 48 early or intermediate HCC patients with compensated cirrhosis. Response to therapy was assessed with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST (mRECIST) guidelines applied to computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eleven out of the 48 treated patients treated progressed on to receive liver orthotopic transplantation (OLT). This allowed for histological analysis on the treated explanted nodules.Results:DEB-TACE with 40 μm showed a good safety profile without major complications or 30-d mortality. The objective response rate of treated tumors was 72.6% and 26.7% according to mRECIST and RECIST respectively. Histological examination in 11 patients assigned to OLT showed a necrosis degree > 90% in 78.6% of cases. The overall time to progression was 13 mo (11-21).Conclusion:DEB-TACE with 40 μm particles is an effective treatment for the treatment of HCC in early-intermediate patients (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A/B) with a good safety profile and good results in term of objective response rate and necrosis.
