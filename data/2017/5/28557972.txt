BACKGROUND Previous research has demonstrated that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway is commonly activated in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. However, the prognostic value of activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in newly diagnosed patients with MM has not been reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS Expression levels of p-ERK1/2 protein in bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from 60 newly diagnosed patients with MM were analyzed using immunohistochemistry, and classified into 3 groups: high p-ERK1/2 expression, low p-ERK1/2 expression, and negative group. Correlations between clinicopathological characteristics, including expression levels of p-ERK1/2 protein, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS Phosphorylated-ERK1/2 protein was positive in 47 bone marrow specimens, including 19 specimens with high p-ERK1/2 expression and 28 specimens with low p-ERK1/2 expression. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that in newly diagnosed patients with MM, high p-ERK1/2 expression, high ISS staging, serum creatinine (Scr) ≥177 μmol/l, serum β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) ≥5.5 μmol/l, and serum calcium (Ca) ≥2.75 mmol/l were significantly associated with shorter OS and PFS. Additionally, high ECOG scores (score 2-4) were associated with shorter PFS in newly diagnosed patients with MM. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that in newly diagnosed patients with MM, high p-ERK1/2 expression was significantly associated with shorter OS and PFS. Additionally, in newly diagnosed patients with MM, serum Ca ≥2.75 mmol/l was significantly associated with shorter PFS, and serum β2-MG ≥5.5 μmol/l was significantly associated with shorter OS. CONCLUSIONS High p-ERK1/2 expression is an independent factor for poor prognosis in newly diagnosed patients with MM.
