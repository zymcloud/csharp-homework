Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE2), which is the most abundant prostaglandin produced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), may be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, the amount of PGE2 was significantly increased in HCC tissue and adjacent noncancerous tissues relative to normal liver tissue (P<.001). In addition, the expression of EP2 receptor was considerably upregulated in HCC tissue compared with the expression of EP1 (P<.05), EP3 (P<.01), and EP4 (P<.01) receptor. The expression of EP2 receptor was positively correlated with the level of PGE2 in HCC tissue (P<.001). Furthermore, PGE2 significantly increased proliferation and invasion potential of human HCC cells. However, antagonism of EP2 signaling suppressed PGE2-induced growth and invasion in human HCC cells. Taken together, upregulation of PGE2 level was associated with proliferation and invasion potential of HCC, and EP2 receptor predominately mediated the function of PGE2 in the transformation and progression of HCC.
