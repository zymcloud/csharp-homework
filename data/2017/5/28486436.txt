BACKGROUND This study was conducted to compare the clinical effects of two techniques used for inflow occlusion during hepatectomy (selective hemihepatic vascular occlusion vs. Pringle maneuver) for the treatment of primary liver cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 63 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatectomy during June 2006 and June 2011 were included in this retrospective study. A total of 26 patients in group A accepted selective hemihepatic vascular occlusion, and 37 patients in group B underwent the Pringle maneuver during hepatectomy. The intraoperative conditions, postoperative liver function recovery, and complication rates were compared between these two groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, occlusion time, and postoperative complication rates between group A and group B (P>0.05). However, postoperative serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), and albumin (ALB) in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (P
