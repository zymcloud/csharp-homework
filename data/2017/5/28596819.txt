The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification is the most widely - used hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) staging system because it is simple, precise and linked to a treatment algorithm based on randomized studies. But each group includes a broad spectrum of tumors, with limited therapeutic options, particularly for intermediate and advanced stages. Consequently, different additional scoring systems have been proposed to refine the prognosis and/or to improve the management. But until now, there is no consensus. Liu et al proposes a new scoring system, based on a large HCC cohort, with patients at different stages, treated using diverse modalities. This score includes six parameters used in current practice. It is simple to calculate, reliable, with an ability to predict survival superior to other systems, which also works with our European HCC cohort. The MESH score may be especially useful to differentiate subgroups with different prognosis for each treatment modality.
