Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) is a key mediator of Jun N-terminal kinase signaling and influences malignant metastasis. Here, we used immunohistochemistry to assess phosphorylated MMK4 (pMKK4) levels and examine their association with the clinicopathological features of a pilot set of patient samples consisting of normal colonic mucosa (NCM), colorectal adenoma (CA), and colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. pMKK4 levels were also assessed in a validation set of CRC cases with accompanying follow-up data to confirm their clinicopathological and prognostic significance. pMKK4 levels, which were high in 79.17% of NCM samples, were downregulated in 33.33% of CA and 63.54% of CRC samples. pMKK4 downregulation was associated with metastasis, especially to the liver. In the validation set, pMKK4 downregulation was associated with increases in invasive depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and TNM stage. Univariate analysis indicated that pMKK4 score, tumor differentiation, and TNM stage were correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that decreased pMKK4 expression was an independent risk factor for disease-free survival in CRC patients. These results suggest that CRC patients with low pMKK4 immunochemistry scores should be monitored carefully for early detection of possible recurrences, especially liver metastasis.
