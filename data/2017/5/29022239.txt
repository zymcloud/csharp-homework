Purpose:Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) has been widely used in treating non-curative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it is noticed that TAE may cause invasion of some cancer cells into circulation, resulting in distal metastasis and poor therapeutic outcome. Here, we aimed to reduce the side effects of TAE using the inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).Methods:Transient hepatic artery ligation (HAL) was used as a mouse model for TAE. EGFR inhibitors were applied. Tumor size, presence of tumor cells in circulation, distal tumor formation, and activation of genes associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis were analyzed.Results:Inhibitors for EGFR significantly reduced the size of primary tumor, presence of tumor cells in circulation, and distal tumor formation after HAL. Further studies showed that EGFR inhibition suppressed several genes associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A, stromal cell-derived factor 1, and Slug.Conclusion:EGFR inhibitor application may reduce circulating cancer cells during TAE and thus improve the therapy for advanced HCC.
