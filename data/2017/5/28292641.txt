Introduction:Patients with metastatic or locally advanced, non-resectable, grade 1 or 2 well-differentiated duodeno-pancreatic (WDDP) NETs are treated following European guidelines. Patients (Pts) with aggressive disease, i.e. progressive and/or symptomatic metastases and/or with significant hepatic invasion (>30-50%), and/or bone metastases, anti-tumour therapy should receive systemic combination of chemotherapy once disease control is obtained.Aim(s):The aim is to stop chemotherapy until progression. REMINET is an academic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II/III study designed to evaluate lanreotide (LAN) as maintenance treatment after L1 chemotherapy in G1-G2 WDDP NET.Materials and methods:Main eligibility criteria: adults pts with a metastatic (synchronous or metachronous) or locally advanced, non-resectable, grade 1 or 2 WDDP NETs and documented control disease after L1 therapy at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.Results:222 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 120mg LAN or placebo, every 28 days, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The aim of the phase II part is to demonstrate a 6-months PFS >45% in LAN arm. Secondary endpoints are PFS according to central review, overall survival, safety and quality of life. A bio-bank of frozen blood will be constituted.Conclusion:The study is currently open in France, Germany, Belgium, United Kingdom and Ireland. A total of 25 patients are randomized (NCT02288377).
