The acidic (leucine-rich) nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member B (ANP32B), a highly conserved member of the acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 (ANP32) family, is critical for the development of normal tissue. However, its role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial. In this study, we elucidated the role of ANP32B in HCC cell lines and tissues. ANP32B expression in HCC cell lines was modulated using siRNA and ANP32B expression plasmids and lentiviruses. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The expression of ANP32B in tissues from patients with HCC was investigated using real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. ANP32B knockdown by siRNA altered the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in HCC cell lines and reduced the expression of cleaved forms of caspase 3 and caspase 9, but not that of caspase 8, in HCC cells cultured with the pro-apoptotic agent staurosporine. Phosphorylated Bad was upregulated, whereas Bak was downregulated. Moreover, ABT-737, which binds to and inhibits anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, rendered HCC cells resistant to apoptosis induced by ANP32B silencing. Conversely, ANP32B overexpression decreased Bad phosphorylation and upregulated Bak, but did not induce apoptosis because Bax expression was downregulated. In tissues from patients with HCC, a low tumor/non-tumor ratio of ANP32B mRNA expression was related to advanced UICC stage (p = 0.032). TUNEL-positive cells were observed in parallel with ANP32B expression in HCC tissues. ANP32B modulates Bad phosphorylation as well as Bak and Bax expression, resulting in regulation of apoptosis in HCC. These findings indicate the potential value of ANP32B as a therapeutic target for HCC.
