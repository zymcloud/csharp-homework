We aimed to investigate the potential role and mechanism of microRNA-30c (miR-30c) in the pathological development of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The serum levels of miR-30c in hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier Xinjiang Uygur patients with inactive, low-replicative, high-replicative and HBe antigen-positive CHB were investigated. HepG2 cells were co-transfected with pHBV1.3 and miR-30c mimic or inhibitor or scramble RNA. The effects of miR-30c dysregulation on HBV replication and gene expression, cell proliferation and cell cycle were then investigated. miR-30c was down-regulated in Xinjiang Uygur patients with CHB compared to healthy controls and its expression level discriminated HBV carrier patients with inactive, low-replicative, high-replicative and HBe antigen-positive risk for disease progression. Overexpression of miR-30c significantly inhibited HBV replication and the expressions of HBV pgRNA, capsid-associated virus DNA and Hbx in hepatoma cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR-30c significantly inhibited cell proliferation and delayed G1/S phase transition in hepatoma cells. Opposite effects were obtained after suppression of miR-30c. Our results indicate that miR-30c was down-regulated in Xinjiang Uygur patients with CHB, and miR-30c levels could serve as a marker for risk stratification of HBV infection. Down-regulation of miR-30c may result in the progression of CHB via promoting HBV replication and cell proliferation.
