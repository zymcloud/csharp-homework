MDR3 is a hepatocyte canalicular membrane protein encoded by the ABCB4 gene located on chromosome 7. MDR3 mediates the translocation of phosphatidylcholine into bile. Severe MDR 3 deficiency typically presents during early childhood with chronic cholestasis evolving to cirrhosis and portal hypertension, requiring liver transplantation. Herein, we report a case of severe MDR3 deficiency in a male child diagnosed with negative MDR3 immunostaining in hepatic canaliculi who underwent LDLT at our centre. We also describe single incidentally detected early well-differentiated HCC in the explant liver. The patient is on regular follow-up and is doing well. Our report shows that MDR3 deficiency may be a risk factor for the development of HCC.
