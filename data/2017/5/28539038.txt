Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a common treatment modality to locally manage hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver abscess and bile duct injury are common complications of TACE. However, hepatobronchial fistula is a rare complication. Herein, we report a case of lung abscess due to hepatobronchial fistula after TACE. A 67-year-old man, who had underwent TACE 6 months ago, presented cough and bile-colored sputum. He was diagnosed with lung abscess and hepatobronchial fistula. We performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; however, there was no improvement in his symptoms. Thereafter, partial hepatectomy and repair of fistula were successively conducted.
