Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Recent evidences have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as key regulators of tumor development and progression including HCC. In the study, we showed that the expression level of HNF1A-AS1 was up-regulated in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, CCK-8 cell proliferation assays and cell cycle analysis showed that HNF1A-AS1 over-expression facilitated HCC cell proliferation by promoting the cell proliferation and S-phase progression, whereas HNF1A-AS1 knockdown had the opposite effect. Western-blotting analysis revealed that knockdown of HNF1A-AS1 inhibited the cycle-relative protein cyclin-D1 and PCNA expression in HCC cells. Mechanism, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that by interacting with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), HNF1A-AS1 promoted HCC cell proliferation by repressing the NKD1 and p21 expression. These results suggested that HNF1A-AS1 may contribute to HCC progression, which may be an effective therapeutic target for patients.
