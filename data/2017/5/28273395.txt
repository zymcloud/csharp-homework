Background:Surgical resection can be an option for the treatment of metastatic liver tumors originating from gastric cancer; however, its prognostic impact is controversial. The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors in patients with surgical resection of liver metastasis from gastric cancer.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features of 38 consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for metastatic tumors from gastric cancer in our institution between 1990 and 2014.Results:The median overall survival of the patients was 28 months. The 5-year survival rate was 33.9%. Primary tumors of a mixed histological type, and residual tumors during the course of treatment were identified as significant independent poor prognostic factors.Conclusions:Histological evaluation of primary tumors may aid to identify patients suitable for undergoing surgical resection of liver metastasis from gastric cancer.
