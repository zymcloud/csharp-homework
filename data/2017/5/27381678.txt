Aim:Aberrant expression of Snail, a mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is crucial for cancer invasiveness and metastasis. Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis, the relationship between HCV core and Snail expression has not been clarified.Methods:HepG2 and Huh7 stable cell lines were established by transfection with pcDNA-HCVc. HepG2-HCVc and Huh7-HCVc cells were co-administered with AG490. Cell migration and invasiveness were tested. STAT3 and Snail expression was analyzed by Real-time PCR and Western blot.Results:We found that HCV core is capable of increasing Snail expression and inducing EMT in hepatoma cells. HCV core-induced Snail expression was accompanied by activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), inhibition of STAT3 abrogated HCV core-induced Snail expression and EMT. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that phosphorylated STAT3 directly binds to the Snail promoter.Conclusion:Collectively, these results suggest that HCV core would play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma invasiveness and metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway, increasing Snail expression and subsequently triggering EMT. These findings would advance the understanding of HCV-mediated invasiveness and metastasis, and might provide a new potential therapeutic target for HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
