Case report presents the successful treatment of solitary liver metastasis in a patient with resected colon cancer. A 39-year-old male underwent left hemicolectomy with colostomy formation followed by chemotherapy for a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon. Two years later, a liver metastatic lesion was detected. Patient received chemotherapy; the mass remained stable in size, measuring up to 3 cm in diameter. Low-invasive percutaneous curative treatment by Radiofrequency ablation was conducted using hydrodissection by dielectric fluid intraperitoneal introduction for hydrodissection. The follow-up imaging showed the complete response to treatment. The ablation technique including peritoneal hydrodissection, described in paper avoids capsular breach and appears safe and technically effective in subcapsular lesions treatment.
