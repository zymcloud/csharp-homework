Persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with progressive hepatic fibrosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. The interleukin-28B (IL28B) rs12979860 polymorphism is associated with fibrosis progression in chronic HCV infection. IL28B encodes interferon-Î», which has both antiviral and anti-proliferative properties. This study aimed to determine whether IL28B rs12979860 polymorphism is also associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma both in chronic HCV infection and in non-viral-related cirrhosis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and melting curve analyses were used to genotype 311 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCV cirrhosis (n = 202) or alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 109). HCV patients were older (p = 0.012) and less likely males (p
