Athyrium multidentatum (Doll.) Ching (AMC), a unique and nutritious potherb widely distributed in china, has been extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine. Previous studies indicated that AMC extract exhibited antioxidant and antitumor properties. However, the chemical composition of AMC and molecular mechanism of AMC toxicity to HepG2 cells have not yet been elucidated. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the chemical compositions and the underlying mechanisms of the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of AMC on HepG2. HPLC-MS analysis showed that AMC contain five compounds with chlorogenic acid accounting for 43 percent. Also, AMC strongly inhibited the cell growth and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells by significantly upregulating the protein expressions of Fas, Fas-L, Bax/Bcl-2, cyto-c, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP in a dose-dependent manner, which indicates AMC induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Moreover, AMC provoked the production of ROS, H2O2, and NO, modulating the PI3K/Akt, MAPK, NFÎºB and Nrf2 pathways and their downstream transcriptional cascades, ultimately evoked oxidative stress and apoptosis in HpeG2 cells. Further in vivo experiments demonstrated that AMC significantly suppressed the tumor growth, suggesting that AMC may be a novel promising agent for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
