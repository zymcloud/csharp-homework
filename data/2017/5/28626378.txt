Duplicated inferior vena cava (IVC) is a rare congenital anomaly. We describe the utility of a new graft from the left IVC in a patient with duplicated IVC for reconstructing the middle hepatic vein (MHV) after partial hepatectomy with MHV resection. A 67-year-old woman with hepatitis C was found to have a liver tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that the tumor, which was attached to the MHV, was hepatocellular carcinoma. Central bisectionectomy (S4, S5, and S8 resection) could not be tolerated because of poor liver function and a low future liver remnant volume. Therefore, partial hepatectomy with MHV resection was performed. The left IVC was harvested as a venous graft and was substituted for the resected MHV. She recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of using the left IVC as a venous graft. The left IVC is a good candidate graft for the MHV or for portal vein reconstruction because of its length, diameter, and easy harvesting (it did not require an extra incision) in a patient with duplicated IVC.
