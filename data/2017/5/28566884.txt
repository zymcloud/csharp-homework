Aim:To determine the role of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), HBx in regulating hepatic progenitor cell (HPC)-like features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying molecular mechanisms.Methods:We used a retrovirus vector to introduce wild type HBx or empty vector into HepG2 cells. We then used these cells to analyze cell proliferation, senescence, transformation, and stem-like features. Gene expression profiling was carried out on Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133A2.0 ver.2 arrays according to the manufacturer's protocol. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis and Class Comparison analysis were performed by BRB-Array Tools software Version 4.2.2. A total of 238 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients' array data were used for analyzing clinical features.Results:The histone demethylase KDM5B was significantly highly expressed in HBV-related HCC cases (P < 0.01). In HBV proteins, only HBx up-regulated KDM5B by activating c-myc. Hepatic stem cell (HpSC) markers (EpCAM, AFP, PROM1, and NANOG) were significantly highly expressed in KDM5B-high HCC cases (P < 0.01). KDM5B played an important role in maintaining HpSC-like features and was associated with a poor prognosis. Moreover, inhibition of KDM5B suppressed spheroid formation and cell invasion in vitro.Conclusion:HBx activates the histone demethylase KDM5B and induces HPC-like features in HCC. Histone demethylases KDM5B may be an important therapeutic target against HBV-related HCC cases.
