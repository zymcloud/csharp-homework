Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver tumor that affects the world population. Liver cancer inevitably causes great harms and its treatment is extremely difficult. Its development is related to the existence of chronic liver injury, such as in cirrhosis. Cancer is a disease related to the process of inflammation so, research with anti-inflammatory agents has been performed for the development of anti-tumor drugs. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), a metabolite of the glycolytic route, has shown anti-inflammatory actions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of FBP on HepG2 cells growth and inflammatory parameters. Results showed that FBP decreased the proliferation of HepG2 cells through trypan blue assay, without causing necrosis, shown by the intracellular release of LDH. By flow cytometry, we observed a significant IL-8 decrease which is closely related to the tumoral progression and chemotherapeutic resistance, especially in HCC. Then, we found, by RT-PCR, a high expression level of pro-apoptotic protein, such as Bax and p53, and decreased the expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins, like Bcl-2 suggesting apoptosis. Finally, our results showed that FBP can be a potential therapeutic agent to slow the progress of HCC.
