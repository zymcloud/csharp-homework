Introduction:We aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-platelet score (NPS) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) as proinflammatory markers in metastatic pancreas cancer (MPC).Material and methods:A total of 146 MPC patients followed up at our center were evaluated retrospectively for clinicopathological characteristics and hematological ratios (NLR, PLR, NPS and PNI). PNI was calculated as (10 × serum albumin [g/dL]) + (0.005 × peripheral lymphocyte count [per mm³]). Log rank and Cox regression analysis were used.Results:Median age was 53 years (range: 22-78) with male predominance (73.3%). Liver (94.7%) was the most common site for metastasis. Half (53.4%) of the patients had ECOG-PS <2; 18% had cholestasis. Palliative chemotherapy predominantly gemcitabine was given to 86.3% of the patients. Clinical benefit rate was 58.2% and objective response rate (ORR) was 23%. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.2-7.8) and 4.9 months (95% CI: 3.6-6.1). Age (p = .003), ECOG-PS (p = .0001), palliative chemotherapy (p = .002), cholestasis (p = .001) and NLR (p = .001) were statistically significant but PLR (p = .062), NPS (p = .86) and PNI (p = .51) were not significant in univariate analysis. Age (HR 1.026, 95% CI: 1.007-1.045, p = .007), ECOG-PS (HR 0.299, 95% CI: 0.202-0.443, p = .0001), cholestasis (HR 0.541, 95% CI: 0.325-0.901, p = .01) and NLR (HR 1.076, 95% CI: 1.025-1.130, p = .003) were significant prognostic factors in multivariate analysis.Conclusions:Basal high NLR (>3), advanced age (>60 years), poor ECOG-PS (>2) and cholestasis were independent poor prognostic factors in MPC. However, PNI, NPS and PLR had no prognostic significance (p = .51, p = .86 and p = .062, respectively).
