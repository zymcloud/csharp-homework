We describe a case of bladder cancer presenting with atraumatic chylous ascites, which remains an extremely rare presentation of this condition. A previously well, elderly ex-smoker with no prior history of abdominal surgery was referred for investigation of progressive dyspnoea, increasing peripheral oedema and new-onset ascites, on a background of long-standing alcohol consumption (four standard drinks daily). Liver biochemistry and coagulation profile were normal apart from marked hypoalbuminaemia. Doppler ultrasound of the liver demonstrated normal echotexture and patent vasculature. Abdominal paracentesis yielded 8 L of milk-coloured, triglyceride-rich fluid with abundant malignant cells. Urine cytology demonstrated malignant transitional cells, with radiological evidence of a large enhancing bladder mass, with evidence of adjacent lymphadenopathy and omental involvement. A diagnosis of metastatic stage IV transitional cell bladder cancer was made. The patient declined palliative chemotherapy and passed away 2 months after their initial presentation.
