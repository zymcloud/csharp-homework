Imaging is essential for the successful management of patients with or at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). If ultrasound remains the key screening modality, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can play a major role in the characterization and noninvasive diagnosis of nodules in patients at risk of developing HCC. Each technique has succeeded in adapting to the wide histological spectrum of focal liver lesions. In this review, we discuss recent advancements in imaging techniques and evaluation - notably diffusion-weighted imaging, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and liver-specific MRI contrast agents - as well as their addition to international guidelines and reporting systems such as the Liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS).
