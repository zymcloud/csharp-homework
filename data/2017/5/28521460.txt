N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is a multifunctional protein associated with carcinogenesis and tumor progression. The function of NDRG1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remains controversial. The present study investigated the role of NDRG1 in HCC as well as its molecular mechanism using a range of techniques, including western blot analysis, cellular proliferation test, wound healing assay and Transwell assay. In HCC, the levels of NDRG1 expression were highest in the cytoplasm, followed by the membrane, and were lowest in the nucleus. NDRG1 was revealed to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of BEL7402 cells, which facilitated the hypothesis that NDRG1 expression levels may be lower in cell line with a high metastatic potential compared with those in cell lines with a low metastatic potential. However, the present study identified that NDRG1 expression was higher in detached BEL7402 cells and MHCC-97H cells compared with that in attached BEL7402 cells and MHCC-97L cells. Thus, this finding was contrary to what was expected, suggesting that NDRG1 overexpression in the HCC with a high metastatic potential may be the compensatory mechanism. The human HCC BEL7402 cell line demonstrated a significant increase in the capability of motility, invasion and cellular proliferation following NDRG1-short hairpin RNA transfection. Integrin Î²3 (ITGB3) protein expression was increased in NDRG1-downregulated BEL7402 cells and SMMC7721 cells compared with that in the control cells. The present study suggested that NDRG1 may be a potential anti-tumor target for the treatment of patients with HCC. A potential mechanism for these roles of NDRG1 is by regulating ITGB3 expression; however, this requires additional investigation.
