Aim:Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is a potent therapeutic option for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are few known predictive factors of treatment response to HAIC. We clarified the most accurate predictive factors early on in treatment.Methods:Study subjects were 70 patients with advanced HCC who had been treated with HAIC. We assessed the relationships between patient characteristics, change ratios of early tumor markers, tumor response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival.Results:After two courses of HAIC, 1 (1.4%), 16 (22.9%), 30 (42.8%), and 23 (32.9%) of the 70 patients showed complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. Overall survival was related to Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, extrahepatic metastasis, and the des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) response. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and DCP response as significant determinants of treatment response and PFS. Progression-free survival with a low NLR (Conclusion:Baseline NLR and early DCP response were significant predictors of treatment response and PFS after HAIC for patients with advanced HCC. The combination of baseline NLR and early DCP response could be accurate and useful predictive factors of response to HAIC and could help optimize treatments for patients with advanced HCC.
