Background:This study aimed to highlight the type of tumor thrombus and identify the prognostic factors influencing the long-term survival outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) having a tumor thrombus. A tumor thrombus in HCC is associated with poor prognosis.Methods:Eighty patients diagnosed with HCC having a tumor thrombus between May 2006 and April 2014 were enrolled in this study. Age, gender, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, Child-Pugh classification, performance status (ECOG), types of tumor thrombi, radiotherapy method, biologically effective dose (BED), and primary treatment method were analyzed to identify the prognostic factors associated with the overall survival (OS) rates. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0.Results:The median follow-up duration was 24 months (range 6-90). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of the patients were 77.6%, 37.6%, and 18.8%, respectively. On univariate analysis, gender, radiotherapy method, BED, types of tumor thrombi, Child-Pugh classification, ECOG, and total bilirubin were associated with OS (P Conclusions:Gender, BED, performance status (ECOG), Child-Pugh classification, and types of tumor thrombi seemed to affect OS, and a stepwise decrease in survival was observed with the types of tumor thrombi ranging from I to IV. High-BED palliative radiotherapy might improve the long-term outcomes for patients with HCC having a tumor thrombus.
