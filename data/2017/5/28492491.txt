Amylose is a promising nanocarrier for gene delivery in terms of its good biocompatibility and high transfection efficiency. Small interfering RNA against survivin (survivin-siRNA) can cause tumor apoptosis by silencing a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific gene at the messenger RNA level. In this study, we developed a new class of folate-functionalized, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-loaded cationic amylose nanoparticles to deliver survivin-siRNA to HCC cells. The cellular uptake of nanocomplexes, cytotoxicity, cell apoptosis, and gene suppression mediated by siRNA-complexed nanoparticles were tested. The results demonstrated that folate-functionalized, SPIO-loaded cationic amylose nanoparticles can mediate a specific and safe cellular uptake of survivin-siRNA with high transfection efficiency, resulting in a robust survivin gene downregulation in HCC cells. The biocompatible complex of cationic amylose could be used as an efficient, rapid, and safe gene delivery vector. Upon SPIO loading, it holds a great promise as a theranostic carrier for gene therapy of HCC.
