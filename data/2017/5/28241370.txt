Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis have an increased risk for postoperative complications including liver failure. However, there is some evidence that the use of laparoscopy markedly decreases this risk. Patients Between 2010 - 2015, a total of 21 laparoscopic liver resections were performed for HCC in Child-A cirrhosis at our center. Mean MELD score was 9 (6 - 12), and the mean LiMAx was 261 Âµg/h/kg (101 - 489). All resections were performed by conventional laparoscopy using 4 - 6 trocars. Liver parenchyma was transected using ultrasonic shears. Hilar occlusion was used on demand. In the earlier years, laparoscopic resections were performed occasionally and mainly if tumors were easily accessible. With increasing experience, currently most HCC in cirrhosis are resected laparoscopically. Likewise, 12 out of the 21 resections were performed within the last 12 months, including 2 anatomic left hemihepatectomies. Results Conversion rate, postoperative mortality, and operative revision rate were all 0 %. Four patients (19 %) developed mild complications Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2 (ascites, transfusion, pneumonia, renal impairment). One patient (4.8 %) developed a grade 3 event (bile leak, percutaneous drainage). All but 1 early patient underwent R0 resection (95 %). The mean duration of hospital stay was 10.5 days (5 - 21), and the mean duration of ICU stay was 1.8 days (1 - 7). No case of decompensation of liver cirrhosis was observed. In 1 case, a prolonged production of ascites evolved. Conclusion Even in patients with severely impaired liver function, no severe complications and especially no decompensation of cirrhosis was observed. Therefore, in accordance with other single center experiences, liver resection for HCC in cirrhosis should be performed preferentially by laparoscopy.
