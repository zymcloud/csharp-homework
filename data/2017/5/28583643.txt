Purpose:To determine the utility of fat-suppressed T1-weighted gradient recalled echo (FS-T1W-GRE) MRI to predict visibility of focal liver lesions (FLL) on abdominal ultrasound (US).Materials and methods:With IRB approval, between 2010 and 2013, 109 patients (28.4% females, age 66.9Â±10.9years) with 177 FLL (hepatocellular carcinoma=132, metastases=44, other=1) underwent MRI and prospective, radiologist-performed treatment-planning US (to determine eligibility for US-guided ablation). MRI examinations were reviewed by a blinded radiologist who assessed: a) size and location of FLL, b) presence of hepatic steatosis on dual-echo T1W-GRE, and c) quantitative signal intensity of FLL relative to liver on FS-T1W-GRE. Associations between MR imaging findings and visibility on US were assessed using independent t-tests and the chi-squares test.Results:69.5% (123/177) FLL were identified with US and 30.5% (54/177) were not visible. Size of FLL on MRI was associated with visibility on US (pConclusion:FLL size and isointensity of FLL to liver parenchyma on FS-T1W-GRE MRI are associated with non-visibility on US, particularly in non-steatotic livers. These results have implications when planning US-guided percutaneous interventions of FLL detected with MRI.
