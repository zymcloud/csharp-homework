High mobility group A2 (HMGA2) plays a crucial role in the development of cancer. However, the mechanism by which HMGA2 promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we explore the hypothesis that HMGA2 may enhance the growth of hepatoma cells through a fragment based on the secondary structure of HMGA2 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). Bioinformatics analysis showed that HMGA2 mRNA displayed a hairpin structure within its 3'UTR, termed HMGA2-sh. Mechanistically, RNA immunoprecipitation assays showed that the microprocessor Drosha or DGCR8 interacted with HMGA2 mRNA in hepatoma cells. Then, Dicer contributes to the generation of the fragment HMGA2-sh-3p20 from the HMGA2-sh. HMGA2-sh-3p20 was screened by PCR analysis. Interestingly, HMGA2-sh-3p20 increased the expression of HMGA2 through antagonizing the tristetraprolin (TTP)-mediated degradation of HMGA2. HMGA2-sh-3p20 inhibited the expression of PTEN by targeting the 3'UTR of PTEN mRNA. In addition, the overexpression of PTEN could downregulate HMGA2 expression. Significantly, we documented the ability of HMGA2-sh-3p20 to promote the growth of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we conclude that the fragment HMGA2-sh-3p20 from HMGA2 mRNA 3'UTR promotes the growth of hepatoma cells by upregulating HMGA2. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanism by which HMGA2 enhances hepatocarcinogenesis.
