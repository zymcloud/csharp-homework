Clear-cell cholangiocarcinoma is a very uncommon variant of cholangiocarcinoma with a largely unknown natural history and prognosis. We report a case of a 51-year-old previously healthy woman presenting with a large liver nodule found on routine imaging. Needle biopsy of the lesion suggested a non-hepatocellular carcinoma. After extensive workup for other primary neoplasms, the patient underwent a partial hepatectomy. Histopathology was compatible with a moderately differentiated clear-cell cholangiocarcinoma. There was no evidence of liver disease in the remaining tissue. The patient underwent chemotherapy and remains in clinical remission after two years.
