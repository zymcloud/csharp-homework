Although the metabolic syndrome is a commonplace topic, its potential threats to public health is a problem that cannot be neglected. As the living conditions improved significantly over the past few years, the morbidity of metabolic syndrome has also steadily risen, and the onset age is becoming younger. The hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is one of the most prevalent life-threatening human cancers worldwide, incidence of which is also on the rise, gradually occupied the top of the list associated with metabolic syndrome related complication. Despite the advanced improvement of HCC management, the lifestyle, environmental factors, obesity, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have been recognized as risk factors for the development of liver cancer. In recent years, genetic studies, especially the genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were widely performed, a new era of the human genome research was created, which has significantly promoted the study of complex disease genetics. These progresses have contributed to the discovery of abundant number of genomic loci convincingly linked with complex metabolic feature and HCC. In this review, we briefly summarize the association between metabolic syndrome and HCC, focusing on the genetic factors contributed to metabolic syndrome and HCC.
