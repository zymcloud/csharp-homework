A polyethylene glycol-poly(Îµ-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine) (PEG-SS-PLL) block copolymer based on a disulfide-linked, novel biodegradable catiomer bearing a PEG-sheddable shell was developed to avoid "PEG dilemma" in nanoparticle intracellular tracking of PEG-PLL where PEG was nondegradable. However, PEG-SS-PLL catiomers have not been used to deliver small interfering VEGF RNA (siVEGF) in antiangiogenesis gene therapy. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether this novel biodegradable catiomer can deliver siVEGF into cancer cells and at the same time have an antitumor effect in a xenograft mouse model. It was found that PEG-SS-PLL efficiently delivered siVEGF with negligible cytotoxicity, and significantly decreased the expression of VEGF at both the messenger-RNA and protein levels both in vitro and in vivo, and thus tumor growth was inhibited. Our findings demonstrated that PEG-SS-PLL/siVEGF could potentially be applied to antiangiogenesis gene therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
