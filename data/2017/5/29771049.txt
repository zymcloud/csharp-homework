A 55-year old middle-aged male presented swelling lymph nodes in neck and mass in left tongue for three mouths. Physical examination shows a size 5 cm√ó5 cm mass in tongue and went over the midline. The mandibular lymph nodes were touched with moderate tenderness and little mobility in bilateral. The laboratory results, function of the kidney and heart liver, nasopharyngeal fiber area were basically normal. The result of CT and MRI shows the mass reached the lingual muscle layer and several suspected metastatic lymph nodes in neck. Pathological examination shows much atypical squamous cell reached muscle layer, diagnosed as highly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. We determined to treat the patient with removal of primary lesion and bilateral neck dissection. We performed tracheotomy after the operation. During the surgeon's blunt dissection of the trachea surrounding tissue, the hemorrhage occurred. After staunching the blood, we transferred sternocleidomastoid muscle flap to fill the soft gas space and finished the surgery.
hemorrhage of innominate artery; radical surgery of tongue cancer; tracheotomy.
