Background/aims:Genetic variants of MHC class I polypeptide-related chain A (MICA) at rs2596542 have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The linkage between serum MICA (sMICA) and liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C is elusive.Results:Linear regression analysis revealed that sMICA were independently correlated to α-fetoprotein (β: 0.149; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.001, 0.003; P = 0.007)and MICA rs2596542 GG genotype (β: 0.209; 95% CI: 0.153, 0.483; P 50 pg/mL provided a positive predictive value of 72 % in predicting advanced liver fibrosis (F3-4) and of 90% in significant fibrosis (> F2) in MICA rs2596542 A allele carriers.Materials and methods:Serum level and single nucleotide polymorphism at rs2596542 of MICA were tested for the association with liver fibrosis in 319 biopsy proven chronic hepatitis C patients.Conclusions:Levels of sMICA were highly correlated to liver disease severity in chronic hepatitis C patients who carried the MICA rs738409 A allele. Patients possessing the genetic predisposition had a higher likelihood of progressed liver fibrosis if they expressed higher sMICA levels.
