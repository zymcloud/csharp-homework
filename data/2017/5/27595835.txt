Objectives:To explore the correlations between DCE-MRI quantitative parameters and synchronous distant metastasis and the clinicopathological factors in rectal cancers.Methods:Sixty-three patients with rectal cancer (synchronous distant metastasis, n = 31; non-metastasis, n = 32) were enrolled in this study. Student's t test and ANOVA were used to compare DCE-MRI parameters (K trans , K ep and V e ). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to find the reasonable threshold of DCE-MRI parameters to differentiate lesions with synchronous distant metastasis from those without metastasis.Results:The K trans , K ep , and V e value were significantly higher in the lesions with distant metastasis than in the lesions without distant metastasis (0.536 ± 0.242 vs. 0.299 ± 0.118 min-1, p < 0.001; 1.598 ± 0.477 vs. 1.341 ± 0.390 min-1, p = 0.022; and 0.324 ± 0.173 vs. 0.249 ± 0.091, p = 0.034; respectively). The K trans showed the highest AUCs of 0.788 (p < 0.001), with sensitivity of 61.29 % and specificity of 87.5 %, respectively.Conclusions:DCE-MRI parameters may represent a prognostic indicator for synchronous distant metastases in patients with rectal cancer.Key points:• The K trans , K ep and V e values correlated with synchronous distant metastasis. • Higher K trans , K ep and V e values were noted among patients with metastasis. • DCE-MRI parameters might represent a prognostic indicator for synchronous distant metastases.
