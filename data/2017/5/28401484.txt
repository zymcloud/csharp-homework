Recurrence of HCC reduces survival rates in patients treated with surgery, and one of the most relevant risk factors for tumour recurrence is microvascular invasion (mVI). The identification of mVI on preoperative examinations could improve surgical planning's and techniques so as to reduce the risk of tumour recurrence. During our study, we have revised 101 CT examinations of the liver performed on patients diagnosed with solitary HCC who had surgical treatment and pathological analysis of the specimens for mVI in order to detect CT signs which could be reliable in mVI prediction. On CT examinations, the tumours were evaluated for margins, capsule, size, contrast enhancement, halo sign and Thad. From our statistical analysis, we found out that irregularity in tumour margins and defects in peritumoural capsule are the most significant characteristics predicting mVI in HCC. Every report on CT examinations performed on surgical candidate patients should include suggestions about mVI probability in order to tailor procedures, reduce tumour recurrence risk and improve survival rates.
