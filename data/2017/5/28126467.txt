Background & aims:Mixed hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCA) is a rare and poorly understood type of primary liver cancer. We aimed to perform a comprehensive molecular characterization of this malignancy.Methods:Gene expression profiling, DNA copy number detection, and exome sequencing using formalin-fixed samples from 18 patients with mixed HCC-CCA were performed, encompassing the whole histological spectrum of the disease. Comparative genomic analysis was carried out, using independent datasets of HCC (n=164) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) (n=149).Results:Integrative genomic analysis of HCC-CCAs revealed that cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CLC) represents a distinct biliary-derived entity compared with the stem-cell and classical types. CLC tumors were neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) positive (6/6 vs. 1/12, pConclusions:Mixed HCC-CCA represents a heterogeneous group of tumors, with the stem-cell type characterized by features of poor prognosis, and the classical type with common lineage for HCC and iCCA components. CLC stands alone as a distinct biliary-derived entity associated with chromosomal stability and active TGF-β signaling.Lay summary:Molecular analysis of mixed hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCA) showed that cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CLC) is distinct and biliary in origin. It has none of the traits of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, within mixed HCC-CCA, stem-cell type tumors shared an aggressive nature and poor outcome, whereas the classic type showed a common cell lineage for both the HCC and the intrahepatic CCA component. The pathological classification of mixed HCC-CCA should be redefined because of the new molecular data provided.
Liver cancer; Molecular subclass; Progenitor-like origin; TGF-β signaling.
