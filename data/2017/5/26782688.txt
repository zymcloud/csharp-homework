Background:Aberrant promoter methylation of tumor suppressor gene can inhibit corresponding protein expression and promote carcinogenesis. Many studies have demonstrated that human mutL homolog 1(hMLH1) promoter methylation is correlated with occurrence and progression of multiple types of tumors. However, its correlation with esophageal carcinoma drug resistance is still unknown.Aims:To confirm methylation status of hMLH1 promoter in drug-resistance cell line of esophageal carcinoma, further confirm whether hMLH1 promoter methylation is responsible for drug resistance.Methods:Two stable esophageal carcinoma drug-resistance cell lines were successfully established by Cisplatin (DDP) concentration increment method; methylation status of hMLH1 promoter, mRNA and protein expression of hMLH1 were detected by methylation-specific PCR (MSP), RT-PCR and western blot, respectively; Drug-resistance ability assay was used to detect drug-resistance ability.Results:Stronger methylation status of hMLH1 promoter, lower hMLH1 mRNA and protein expression were found in both drug-resistance cell lines; after removing methylated bands using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine(5-Aza-CdR) in drug-resistance cell lines, hMLH1 mRNA and protein expression were restored and drug-resistance abilities declined nearly by half.Conclusion:hMLH1 promoter hypermethylation plays important roles in esophageal carcinoma drug-resistance and show us the prospect that combination of demethylation treatment with conventional chemotherapy drugs may bring better therapy effect.
