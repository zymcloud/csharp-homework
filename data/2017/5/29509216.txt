Introduction:The prognosis of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancers is constantly being improved at the cost of multidisciplinary care, allowing each patient to have an adapted strategy. The prognostic factors make it possible to recognize patients needing further treatment after resection and closer monitoring.Objective:The aim of our study was to conduct a prognostic study to identify factors influencing survival at 5 years for patients operated of colorectal liver metastases.Methods:This is a retrospective study conducted over a period of 10 years (2005-2015). All patients operated for liver metastasis of colorectal cancers were included. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were recurrence-free survival and operative morbidity and mortality. The proportions were compared by the Chi 2 test. The survival curves were established according to the Kaplan-Meier method and the comparison of the curves according to the Logrank test. A univariate and then multivariate Cox model was used to determine prognostic factors. The significance level was set at 0.05.Results:Overall survival of our patients at 3 and 5 years was 49% and 32% respectively. Recurrence-free survival was 21% at 3 years and 15% at 5 years. In multivariate analysis, the hepatic resection margin <1 mm and the number of hepatic metastases â‰¥3 were independent factors correlated with survival.Conclusions:colorectal liver metastases surgery improves patient survival. Some factors need to be sought to adapt care strategies.
