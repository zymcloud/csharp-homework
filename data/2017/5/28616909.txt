Objectives:To investigate the expression of migration-inducing gene 7 (MIG7) in different HCC lines and its relationship with vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation and metastatic potentiality.Methods:Employing immunostaining to detect MIG7 protein expression and VM formation in 40 matched pairs of primary and metastatic HCC specimens from 40 patients, and investigating the correlation of VM formation with MIG7 protein expression. Detecting VM formation in HCC lines with different metastatic ability (MHCC-97H, MHCC-97L, Huh-7) and human normal hepatocyte line (L-02) through three-dimensional culture, and detecting MIG7 mRNA expression with RT-PCR, investigating the correlation of MIG7 protein expression with VM formation and HCC metastatic potentiality with Western blot assay; screening the HCC cell line with high MIG7 expression.Results:In 40 matched pairs of HCC tissue, there was a significant positive correlation between MIG7 protein expression and VM formation ( rs=0.595, P<0.01). The capability of VM formation of MHCC-97H with high metastatic potentiality was stronger than that of MHCC-97L with low metastatic potentiality and Huh-7 with non-metastatic potentiality, and there was no VM formation in L-02. The result of RT-PCR and Western blot assay indicated the same.Conclusions:MIG7 expression in HCC tissue is high and correlated positively with VM formation. MIG7 expression in different HCC cell lines is coincident with theirs VM formation, invasion and metastasis. MIG7 is a potential target for inhibiting the invasion and metastasis of HCC.
