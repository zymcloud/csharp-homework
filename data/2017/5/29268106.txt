Increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in parallel with the obesity epidemic has been a major public health concern. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States, ranging from fatty liver to steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis in the liver. In response to chronic liver injury, fibrogenesis in the liver occurs as a protective response; however, prolonged and dysregulated fibrogenesis can lead to liver fibrosis, which can further progress to cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Interplay of hepatocytes, macrophages and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the hepatic inflammatory and oxidative milieu is critical for the development of NAFLD. In particular, HSCs play a major role in the production of extracellular matrix proteins. Studies have demonstrated that bioactive food components and natural products, including astaxanthin, curcumin, blueberry, silymarin, coffee, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, resveratrol, quercetin and epigallocatechin-3-gallate, have antifibrotic effects in the liver. This review summarizes current knowledge of the mechanistic insight into the antifibrotic actions of the aforementioned bioactive food components.
