Background:Based on promising results from a Phase I study of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy using a combination of miriplatin and cisplatin powder (DDP-H) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (UMIN-CTR000003541), a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy versus miriplatin monotherapy.Methods:Nineteen patients, five and fourteen Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer staging classification A and B cases, respectively, were randomly assigned to receive either miriplatin monotherapy (n = 9) or miriplatin/DDP-H combination therapy (n = 10). DDP-H and/or miriplatin were administered through the hepatic arteries supplying the lobes of the liver containing tumors, and progression free survival was analyzed as a primary end point in addition to other secondary endpoints. The corresponding therapy was repeated unless disease progression or severe adverse events were recorded.Results:The monotherapy or combination therapy was performed for 15 or 36 sessions in total, respectively. Although there were no significant differences between the two groups for treatment intervals (p = 0.96) or the dose of miriplatin used in each session (p = 0.99), the progression free survival and overall disease control rate were significantly better in the combination therapy group (91 vs 423 days, p = 0.025; 40.0 vs 77.8%, p = 0.0025, respectively). Consistent with these observations, a trend of a significantly slower increase in des-Î³-carboxyprothrombin was observed, and the number of treatment sessions was nearly significantly larger in the combination therapy group (p Conclusions:The higher disease control effects with the combination of miriplatin and DDP-H indicate that it is a promising alternative treatment for cases with multiple HCCs, especially for those that can tolerate the treatment without experiencing a reduction in hepatic reserve.Trial registration:This study was registered on 1 January 2012 with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry ( http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm , UMIN000004691).
