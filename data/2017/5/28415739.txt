Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) promotes the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We evaluated the associations between TGF-β1 expression and clinicopathological parameters in HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), as well as the prognostic power of TGF-β1 expression. Eligible studies were retrieved from several databases, and effects (hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were pooled to assess the prognostic ability of TGF-β1 expression in HCC patients. Twelve qualified articles and our TCGA data comprising 2,021 HCC patients were incorporated. In the TCGA analysis, HCC patients with higher TGF-β1 expression presented a shorter OS than those with lower TGF-β1 expression (HR = 1.42, p
