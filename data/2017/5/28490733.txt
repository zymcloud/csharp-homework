Owing to its narrow therapeutic range and high pharmacokinetic variability, optimal dosing for busulfan is important to minimise overexposure-related systemic toxicity and underexposure-related graft failure. Using global metabolomics, we investigated biomarkers for predicting busulfan exposure. We analysed urine samples obtained before busulfan administration from 59 paediatric patients divided into 3 groups classified by area under the busulfan concentration-time curve (AUC), i.e., low-, medium-, and high-AUC groups. In the high-AUC group, deferoxamine metabolites were detected. Phenylacetylglutamine and two acylcarnitines were significantly lower in the high-AUC group than in the low-AUC group. Deferoxamine, an iron-chelating agent that lowers serum ferritin levels, was detected in the high-AUC group, indicating that those patients had high ferritin levels. Therefore, in a retrospective study of 130 paediatric patients, we confirmed our hypothesis that busulfan clearance (dose/AUC) and serum ferritin level has a negative correlation (r = -0.205, P = 0.019). Ferritin, acylcarnitine, and phenylacetylglutamine are associated with liver damage, including free radical formation, deregulation of hepatic mitochondrial Î²-oxidation, and hyperammonaemia. Our findings reveal potential biomarkers predictive of busulfan exposure and suggest that liver function may affect busulfan exposure.
