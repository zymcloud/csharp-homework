The essential oil isolated from the bark of Cinnamomum glanduliferum (Wall) Meissn grown in Egypt was screened for its composition as well as its biological activity for the first time. The chemical composition was analyzed by GC and GC/MS. The antimicrobial activity of the oil was assessed using agar-well diffusion method toward representatives for each of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. The cytotoxic activity was checked using three human cancer cell lines. Twenty seven compounds were identified, representing 99.07% of the total detected components. The major constituents were eucalyptol (65.87%), terpinen-4-ol (7.57%), α-terpineol (7.39%). The essential oil possessed strong antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, with an activity index of one and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) equaling to 0.49 μg/ml. The essential oil possessed good antimicrobial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Geotrichum candidum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Helicobacter pylori, Aspergillus fumigatus (MIC: 7.81, 1.95, 7.81, 0.98, 31.25, and 32.5 μg/ml, respectively). A considerable activity was reported against S. aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC; 32.5 and 31.25 μg/ml, respectively). The extracted oil was cytotoxic to colon (HCT-116), liver (HepG2), and breast (MCF-7) carcinoma cell lines with IC50 of 9.1, 42.4, and 57.3 μg/ml, respectively. These results revealed that Egyptian Cinnamomum glanduliferum bark oil exerts antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities mainly due to eucalyptol and other major compounds.
