Although the diagnostic rate of early-stage liver cancer is low, only these patients have a chance of radical treatment, and thus related treatment modalities deserve attention. Surgical resection is the preferred choice for the treatment of early-stage liver cancer. For patients with high selectivity, local treatment including radiofrequency ablation can achieve satisfactory outcomes. Liver transplantation is the preferred choice for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Early-stage liver cancer has a high postoperative recurrence rate, and the research and development of postoperative adjuvant therapy should be taken seriously.
