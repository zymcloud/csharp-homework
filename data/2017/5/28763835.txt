The monitoring of malignant transformation of hepatocytes or early diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) remains a challenge in the medical world. Routine examinations including serum alpha-fetoprotein level and ultrasound examination have a limited value in the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma; however, the effective treatment of PHC depends on its early diagnosis. In recent years, molecular markers including important signaling molecules in PHC-related pathways, carcinoembryonic proteins, and non-coding RNA help with the monitoring of malignant transformation of hepatocytes or early diagnosis of liver cancer. This article reviews the valuable molecular markers in the monitoring of malignant transformation of hepatocytes or early diagnosis of liver cancer.
