Background & aims:Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-viral causes of HCC, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), are becoming increasingly prevalent. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics and survival of cryptogenic and viral HCC.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving 3878 consecutive HCC patients seen at two tertiary centres in the United States and one in Taiwan from 2004 to 2014. We compared the clinical characteristics, treatment and survival of patients by underlying aetiology: cryptogenic (n = 696), HBV (n = 1304) or HCV (n = 1878).Results:Cirrhosis was present in 66.8% of the cryptogenic HCC patients, compared with 74.7% of HBV-related HCC (HBV-HCC) (P = .001) and 85.9% of HCV-HCC (P Conclusions:Compared with viral HCC patients, those with cryptogenic HCC had lower prevalence of cirrhosis, were diagnosed with larger tumours at more advanced stages of disease, and had poorer overall survival. Additional efforts are needed to identify patients at risk of cryptogenic HCC and to identify cryptogenic HCC at earlier stages of disease.
