Patients after a Fontan operation exhibit some degree of fibrosis which are primarily located in a sinusoidal or centrilobular pattern. Cirrhosis may develop years later and the incidence of cancer is up to 5%. That is why some authors recommend that patients who are >10 years out from their Fontan operation should undergo cardiac assessment as well as the determination of alpha-fetoprotein level, the realization of liver imaging tests or even liver biopsy to stay ahead of neoplastic transformation.
