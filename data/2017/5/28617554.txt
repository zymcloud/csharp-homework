Objective:This study is to observe the immunosuppression of CD137L transfected umbilical blood Dcs (Dendritic cell) vaccine to tumor development of SCID/ Beige nude mice.Materials and methods:Samples of umbilical blood in the childbirth pregnant women were collected by density gradient centrifugation. Umbilical cord blood dendritic cells (Dcs) were transfected by specific CD137L via LipofectamineTM method and cells were harvested. Meanwhile, the peripheral blood of volunteers was collected to isolate Dcs, the Dcs were cultured for 5 days and hatched with SW-1116 cells antigen. The mature Dcs were harvested. The male SCID/Beige nude mice were subcutaneously injected with human SW-1116 cells in axillary to build colorectal carcinoma model as blank control (Blank). The naked peripheral blood Dc vaccine group (cPBMCs), the SW-1116 antigen-specific peripheral blood Dc vaccine group (pDcs) and the CD137L specific umbilical blood Dc vaccine group (tuDcs) were injected 24 h before tumor cells injection, respectively to recur the humanized immune reconstruction. The general life, living habits changes, tumor growing time and tumor size were observed. The nude mice were sacrificed 18 days after tumor formation. The tumor size, mice weight, in vitro tumor weight, liver weight and spleen weight of mice were recorded to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of the specific immune cells.Results:The nude mice in pDcs group showed better general living condition, slower tumor growth, smaller tumor volume and no ulceration, necrosis, and death in nude mice. The tumor formation time in different groups was 4.71 ± 0.18 ds (blank), 7.71 ± 0.29 ds (cPBMCs), 7.86 ± 0.26 ds (pDcs) and 8.14 ± 0.69 ds (tuDcs) respectively. There were significant differences between blank and other three groups (F = 40.96, p < 0.01). Compared to mice in blank group, the tumor volume of cPBMCs group was significantly smaller (201.43 ± 69.84 mm³ vs. 436.04 ± 54.50 mm³, p < 0.01) and the tumor weight were significantly smaller (1.25 ± 0.12 g vs. 2.83 ± 0.24 g, p < 0.01). The tumor volume of tuDcs mice was significantly smaller than that of blank (92.11 ± 11.55 mm³ vs. 436.04 ± 54.50 mm³, p < 0.01) and cPBMCs mice (92.11 ± 11.55 mm³ vs. 201.43 ± 69.84 mm³, p < 0.01). Similarly, the tumor weight of tuDcs mice was significantly smaller than that of blank (0.66 ± 0.07 g vs. 2.83 ± 0.24 g, p < 0.01) and cPBMCs mice (0.66 ± 0.07 g vs. 1.25 ± 0.12 g, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in tumor volume (92.11 ± 11.55 mm³ vs. 85.61 ± 11.59 mm³, p = 0.69) and tumor weight (0.66 ± 0.07 g vs. 0.63 ± 0.09 g, p = 0.75) between tuDcs group and pDcs group.Conclusions:The specific CD137L transfected umbilical blood Dc vaccine had significant anti-tumor effect against human colon cancer in nude mice via increasing the number of immune effector cell in tumor microenvironment.
