Purpose:To investigate the performance of texture analysis in characterizing malignancy of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Materials and methods:Gd-DTPA contrast-enhanced MRI data of 46 consecutive subjects with resected HCC were retrieved. The mean intensity and gray-level run-length nonuniformity (GLN) were quantified as the discriminative features based on the arterial phase images and compared between groups with different histological grading using independent Student's t-test or Welch-Satterthwaite approximate t-test for data following a normal distribution and Mann-Whitney U-test for data violating the normal distribution. The performance of texture features in differentiating the biological aggressiveness of HCC was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. P Results:Low-grade HCCs had increased mean intensity and decreased GLN in four directions, as compared with high-grade HCCs (P Conclusion:Texture features indexed by mean and GLN based on the arterial phase images reflect biologic aggressiveness, and may have potential applications in predicting the histological grading of HCC preoperatively.
