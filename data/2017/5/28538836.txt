This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of the establishment of a human cancer xenograft model using samples from computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous biopsy. Fresh tumor tissues obtained from 10 cancer patients by CT-guided percutaneous biopsy were subcutaneously inoculated into NOD-Prkdcem26Il2rgem26Nju (NCG) mice to establish human patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) models. The formation of first and second generation xenografts was observed, and tumor volume was recorded over time. Tumor tissue consistency between the PDTX model and primary tumors in patients was compared using H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. Pharmacodynamic tests of clinically used chemotherapeutic drugs were conducted on second generation xenografts, and their effects on tumor growth and body weight were observed. CT-guided percutaneous biopsy samples were successfully collected from 10 patients with advanced cancers. The PDTX model was established in mice using tumor samples obtained from 4 cancer patients, including one small cell carcinoma sample, two adenocarcinoma samples, and one squamous cell carcinoma sample. The success rate was 40%. The obtained PDTX model maintained a degree of differentiation, and morphological and structural characteristics were similar to primary tumors. The pharmacodynamic test of chemotherapeutic drugs in the PDTX model revealed a therapeutic effect on tumor growth, as expected. CT-guided percutaneous biopsy samples can be effectively used to establish a PDTX model, and test these chemotherapy regimens.
