Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver, and in the process of HCC development, early identification and timely treatment can significantly improve patient survival rate. Imaging techniques play an important role in the monitoring of chronic liver diseases, evolution of cirrhotic nodules, and early diagnosis of HCC. Multi-phase or dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reflect the changes in blood supply during the evolution of liver cirrhotic nodules. Functional MRI can reflect the structure and function of living organisms at the molecular level. The application of liver-specific contrast agents can improve the detection rate and identification of early-stage HCC. With the development of MRI techniques and the accumulation of clinical experience in functional imaging will further improve the diagnostic rate of early-stage HCC.
