Background:Increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression of GABPA is associated with tumor development and progression. However, the function and clinicopathological significance of GABPA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain obscure.Methods:The mRNA and protein expression of GABPA in HCC clinical specimens and cell lines was examined by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Follow-up data were used to uncover the relationship between GABPA expression and the prognosis of HCC patients. HCC cell lines stably overexpressing or silencing GABPA were established to explore the function of GABPA in HCC cell migration and invasion by Transwell and wound healing assays in vitro and in a xenograft model in vivo. Restoration of function analysis was used to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms.Results:GABPA was downregulated at the protein and mRNA levels in HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Decreased GABPA expression was correlated with alpha-fetoprotein levels (P = 0.001), tumor grade (P = 0.017), and distant metastasis (P = 0.021). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with lower GABPA expression had significantly shorter survival times than those with higher GABPA (P = 0.031). In vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that GABPA negatively regulated HCC cell migration and invasion, and the effect of GABPA on HCC cell migration was mediated at least partly by the regulation of E-cadherin.Conclusions:Collectively, our data indicate that GABPA inhibits HCC cell migration by modulating E-cadherin and could serve as a novel biomarker for HCC prognosis. GABPA may act as a tumor suppressor during HCC progression and metastasis, and is a potential therapeutic target in HCC.
