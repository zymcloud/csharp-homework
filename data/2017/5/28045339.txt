Purpose:Liver cancer is the second most common cause of death worldwide. This study was to investigate the SPECT/CT, ultrasound, biodistribution and therapeutic evaluation of 188Re-human serum albumin microspheres (188Re-HSAM) in the GP7TB orthotopic hepatoma rat model.Materials and methods:HSAM was labeled with 188Re by using a home-made kit and microwave system. The 188Re-HSAM was administered via intraarterial route. The in vivo distribution of 188Re-HSAM was determined by biodistribution analysis and nanoSPECT/CT system. In efficacy, tumor volumes were tracked longitudinally by three-dimensional ultrasound.Results:The biodistribution and nanoSPECT/CT imaging showed that 188Re-HSAM could accumulate in liver and tumor. The correlation coefficient of tumor volumes done by three-dimensional ultrasound and at autopsy was 0.997. In efficacy, tumor volume in the normal saline-treated group was 1803.2 mm3 at 54 days after tumor inoculation. Tumor volumes in the 103.6 MBq and 240.5 MBq of 188Re-HSAM treated groups were 381 and 267.4 mm3 (p = 0.001 and 0.004), respectively.Conclusions:These results show that three-dimensional ultrasound with a high spatial resolution and contrast in soft tissue can become imaging modality in assessing tumor burden and tumor progression in an orthotopic rat model. The longitudinally therapeutic evaluation of 188Re-HSAM demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition with increased dose in the GP7TB orthotopic hepatoma rat model.
