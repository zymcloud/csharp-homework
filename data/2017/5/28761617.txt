Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common of all liver cancers and is a major worldwide public health problem. The aim of this study was to provide an updated overview on clinicopathological features, treatment and outcome of HCC. In our retrospective study, we reviewed 64 cases of HCC that were diagnosed at the pathology department of Mongi Slim hospital over a fifteen-year period (2000- 2014). Relevant clinical information and microscopic slides were retrospectively reviewed. Our study group included 38 men and 26 women (sex ratio M/F = 1,26) aged between 8 and 83 years (mean = 56,64 years). The presenting clinical symptoms were dominated by abdominal pain (n=34), followed by altered general health (n=25) and jaundice (n=4). Fifty-five patients underwent surgical treatment. Liver transplantation was performed in two cases and transarterial chemoembolization was achieved in seven cases. Histopathological examination of the surgical or biopsy specimen established the diagnosis of conventional HCC in 55 cases, fibrolamellar carcinoma in 6 cases and clear cell HCC in 3 cases. Seven patients with HCC died postoperatively. Local recurrence of the tumour occurred in three cases and two patients had distant metastases postoperatively. The other patients are still being followed-up. Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with a high rate of mortality because of early invasion, widespread metastasis and lack of effective therapeutic modalities. Accurate diagnosis and staging of these tumours is critical for optimal treatment planning and for determining prognosis.
