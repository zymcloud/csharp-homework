Abnormal sialylation due to overexpression of sialyltransferases has been associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Although ST6Gal-I influences cancer persistence and progression by affecting various receptors, the underlying mechanisms and mediators remain largely obscure, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that ST6Gal-I expression was markedly upregulated in HCC tissues and cells, high levels being associated with aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. Furthermore, we examined the roles and mechanisms of ST6Gal-I in HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. ST6Gal-I overexpression promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of Huh-7 cells, whereas its knockdown restricted these abilities in MHCC97-H cells. Additionally, in a mouse xenograft model, ST6Gal-I-knockdown MHCC97-H cells formed significantly smaller tumors, implying that ST6Gal-I overexpression can induce HCC cell malignant transformation. Importantly, enhanced HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis by ST6Gal-I may be associated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotion, including β-catenin nuclear transition and upregulation of downstream molecules. Together, our results suggest a role for ST6Gal-I in promoting the growth and invasion of HCC cells through the modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling molecules, and that ST6Gal-I might be a promising marker for prognosis and therapy of HCC.
