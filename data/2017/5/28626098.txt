To investigate associations between glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in population who underwent periodic heath examination. Methods: A total of 912 subjects were selected from the health examination adults in University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Hospital from June to November 2013, and they were assigned into a NAFLD group, an else hepatic disease group, and a control group. The physical examination results of these subjects were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The prevalence of NAFLD was 29.7%. The related factors such as age, body mass index, and the levels of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c and alanine aminotransferase in the NAFLD group were higher than those in the else hepatic disease group and the control group (P<0.05). Aspartate aminotransferase levels in the NAFLD group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the NAFLD group were lower than those in the else hepatic disease group and the control group (P<0.05). According to the quartile of HbA1c level, these subjects were divided into 4 groups, Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, and the prevalence of NAFLD in the Q1,Q2, Q3, and Q4 were 17.5%, 21.5%, 31%, and 59.4%, respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD increased along with the increase in the level of HbA1c (Ï‡2=100.092, P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factor for NAFLD was increased in the subjects of Q4 as compared with the subjects of Q1 after adjusting for the related factors including age, gender, body mass index, etc. Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between the prevalence of NAFLD and HbA1c level, and the risk of NAFLD increases with the elevating level of HbA1c. High HbA1c level is an independent risk factor for NAFLD. Thus it should be listed as a routine medical test in the health examination.
