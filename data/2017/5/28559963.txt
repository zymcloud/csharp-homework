Background:MiR-101-3p has been reported to suppress invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the relevant mechanisms are still unclear. The research seeks to determine systematic value of miR-101-3p in HCC, and comprehensively summarize the predicted target genes as well as their potential function, pathways and networks in HCC.Methods:The miR-101-1 profiles in 353 HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate relationship of miR-101 (including precursor and mature miR-101) with clinical features and prognosis in HCC. Further, the promising targets of miR-101-3p were predicted and followed with Gene Ontology (GO), pathway and network analysis. In addition, the functional impact of miR-101-3p was confirmed with in vitro experiments in HCC cells.Results:In TCGA data, low-expression of miR-101-1 might be a diagnostic (AUC: 0.924, 95% CI: 0.894-0.953) and prognostic (HR=1.55) marker for HCC. Down-regulated miR-101-1 also correlated with poor differentiation, advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and high AFP level of HCC. Meta-analysis revealed that miR-101 down-regulation were associated with poor prognosis, high AFP level and advanced TNM stage of HCC. Moreover, 343 hub genes were filtered and miR-101-3p may be involved in intracellular signaling cascade, transcription, metabolism and cell proliferation. Focal adhesion and pathways in cancer were also significantly enriched. In vitro experiments demonstrated that miR-101-3p inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in HCC cells.Conclusions:MiR-101-1 may be a prospective biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. Potential targets of miR-101-3p could regulate genesis and development of HCC. The data offers insights into biological significances and promising targets of miR-101-3p for further investigation and potential therapies in HCC.
