5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the chemotherapeutic agent of first choice for the treatment ofcolorectal cancer, however, treatment-related liver toxicity remains a major concern. Thereby, it is desirable to search for novel therapeutic approaches that can effectively enhance curative effects and reduce the toxic side effects of 5-FU. Carboxymethyl Pachyman (CMP) exhibits strong antitumor properties, but the antitumor and hepatoprotective effects of CMP and the molecular mechanisms behind these activities, are however poorly explored. Thereby, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of CMP in 5-FU-treated CT26-bearing mice, and further explore the underlying mechanism(s) of action. Initially, a CT26 colon carcinoma xenograft mice model was established. The immune organ indexes, blood indicators, liver tissue injury, and indicators associated with inflammation, antioxidant and apoptosis were then measured. Our results showed that CMP administration increased the tumor inhibitory rates of 5-FU and, meanwhile, it reversed reduction of peripheral white blood cells (WBC) and bone marrow nucleated cells (BMNC), increase of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), GSH-Px and glutathione(GSH) induced by 5-FU. Moreover, CMP in combination with 5-FU alleviated severe liver injury induced by 5-FU via reducing the levels of ROS, IL-1β, and IL-6, decreasing expression of p-IκB-α, NF-κB, p-NF-κB, pp38 and Bax, and elevating levels of Nrf2, GCL, HO-1 and Bcl-2. Collectively, these outcomes suggested that CMP effectively enhanced the curative effects of 5-FU and simultaneously reduced the liver injuries induced by 5-FU in CT26-bearing mice, and the mechanism may be associated with regulation of NF-κB, Nrf2-ARE and MAPK/P38/JNK pathways.
