Hepatoid carcinomas are undifferentiated epithelial carcinomas that are pathologically similar to hepatocellular carcinoma, but occur in a variety of organs. Hepatoid carcinomas, as strictly defined, typically produce α-fetoprotein. In addition, a standard effective chemotherapy regimen for hepatoid carcinoma has yet to be established. We present a case of advanced primary ovarian cancer that was pathologically similar to hepatoid carcinoma without staining for α-fetoprotein or hepatocyte paraffin 1. The primary ovarian, metastatic, and recurrent tumors shared similar pathological characteristics. Fourth-line chemotherapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab was effective in treating the recurrent tumor, even though this disease had recurred three times.
