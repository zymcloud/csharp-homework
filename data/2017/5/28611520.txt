Aim:To investigate the role of nuclear division cycle (NDC)80 in human hepatocellular carcinogenesis.Methods:NDC80 gene expression was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 47 paired hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent tissues. The HCC cell line SMMC-7721 was transfected with lentivirus to silence endogenous NDC80 gene expression, which was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The effects of NDC80 silencing on SMMC-7721 cell proliferation were evaluated by Cellomics ArrayScan VTI imaging. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry. Colony formation was assessed by fluorescence microscopy.Results:NDC80 expression levels in HCC tissues were significantly higher than those in the adjacent tissues. Functional studies demonstrated that NDC80 silencing significantly reduced SMMC-7721 cell proliferation and colony formation. Knockdown of NDC80 resulted in increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at S-phase. NDC80 contributed to HCC progression by reducing apoptosis and overcoming cell cycle arrest.Conclusion:Elevated expression of NDC80 may play a role in promoting the development of HCC.
