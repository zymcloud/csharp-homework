The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most devastating cancers worldwide, is due to frequent recurrence and metastasis. Among the metastatic factors in the tumor microenvironment, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been well known to play critical roles in tumor progression, including HCC. Therefore, c-Met is now regarded as the most promising therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. However, there are still concerns about resistance and the side effects of using conventional inhibitors of c-Met, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Recently, many alternative strategies of c-Met targeting have been emerging. These include targeting the downstream effectors of c-Met, such as hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5), to block the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated signaling for HCC progression. Also, inhibition of endosomal regulators, such as PKCÎµ and GGA3, may perturb the c-Met endosomal signaling for HCC cell migration. On the other hand, many herbal antagonists of c-Met-dependent signaling, such as saponin, resveratrol, and LZ-8, were identified. Taken together, it can be anticipated that more effective and safer c-Met targeting strategies for preventing HCC progression can be established in the future.
