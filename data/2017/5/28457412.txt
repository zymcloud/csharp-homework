Background:Liver transplantation (LT) is a curative treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); recurrent HCC after liver transplantation (HCC-R) is diagnosed in 9%-16%. The objective of this study was to evaluate which factors are associated with R-HCC after liver transplantation.Methods:This retrospective real-life study analyzed 278 LTs from 3 reference centers (2,093 LTs) in Brazil from 1988 to 2015. HCC-R with histologic confirmation was seen in 40 patients (14.4%).Results:Most of them were male with cirrhosis secondary to viral hepatitis. Only 37.5% underwent chemoembolization, and 50% had cold ischemia time >8 hours. From the explant analysis, most of the patients were outside Milan criteria and 37.5% had microvascular invasion. The donors were mostly male, and the median intensive care unit time was >3 days. The Kaplan-Meier survival was lower according to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >200 ng/dL (P = .02), and older donors and more blood transfusions were risk factors for HCC-R death.Conclusion:AFP >200 ng/mL was associated with lower survival, and older donors and more blood transfusions were risk factors for death after HCC-R. A trend to lower survival was observed in patients who did not have chemoembolization and had cold ischemia times >8 hours.
