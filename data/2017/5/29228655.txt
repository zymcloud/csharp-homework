Numerous studies indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and might serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of HCC. Therefore, it is interesting to globally identify the lncRNAs altered in HCC. In our study, we used microarray to profile the levels of lncRNAs and mRNAs in three pairs of HCC and their adjacent noncancerous samples. We found lncRNA-SVUGP2, which is a splice variant of the UGP2 gene, was down-regulated in HCC samples and correlates with a better prognosis in patients with HCC. Overexpression of lncRNA-SVUGP2 in HepG2 and Hep3B liver cancer cells suppresses cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, lncRNA-SVUGP2 suppresses the invasion ability of liver cancer cell lines and downregulates the mRNA and protein levels of MMP2 and 9. Additionally, lncRNA-SVUGP2 positively or negatively correlates with many mRNAs in liver cancer tissues, indicating it is multifunctional in regulating carcinogenesis.
