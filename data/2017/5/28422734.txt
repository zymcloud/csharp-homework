Karyopherin Î±2 (KPNA2), involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, has been reported to be upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and considered as a biomarker for poor prognosis. However, comprehensive studies of KPNA2 functions in hepatocellular carcinogenesis are still lacking. Our study examine the roles and related molecular mechanisms of KPNA2 in hepatocellular carcinoma development. Results show that KPNA2 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. KPNA2 knockdown also inhibited colony formation ability, induced cell cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis in two hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, HepG2 and SMMC-7721. Furthermore, gene expression microarray analysis in HepG2 cells with KPNA2 knockdown revealed that critical signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival were deregulated. In conclusion, this study provided systematic evidence that KPNA2 was an essential factor promoting hepatocellular carcinoma and unraveled potential molecular pathways and networks underlying KPNA2-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
