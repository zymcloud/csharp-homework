Cancer cells can acquire resistance to a wide variety of diverse and unrelated drugs, this phenomenon is termed multidrug resistance (MDR). Multidrug resistance has been an obstacle to the success of cancer chemotherapy. The present study investigated the reversal effect of Y6, a new compound obtained by chemically modifying the structure of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) extracted from green tea. Y6 was proven to be effective in inhibiting cell proliferation and reversing drug resistance in doxorubicin (DOX) resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (BEL-7404/DOX). BEL-7404/DOX cells were treated with either doxorubicin combination regimen (doxorubicin plus Y6 or epigallocatechin-3-gallate or verapamil separately) or doxorubicin alone. The results showed that cell proliferation was inhibited and late cell apoptosis increased in the combination treatment group, especially in the group treated with doxorubicin plus Y6. Further analysis revealed that the expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and multidrug resistance 1/P-glycoprotein decreased at both messenger RNA and protein levels by treatments with combined drugs compared to doxorubicin alone. Our results indicated that Y6, as a drug resistance reversal agent, increased the sensitivity of drug resistant cells to doxorubicin. The mechanisms of actions of Y6 in reversal effect were associated with the decreased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and multidrug resistance 1/P-glycoprotein.
