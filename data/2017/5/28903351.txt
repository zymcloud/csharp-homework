In this study, we aim to investigate oxidative stress in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues in patients receiving preoperative transcatheter arterial chemotherapy (TAC) and its association with prognosis. A total of 89 HCC patients enrolled in this study, 39 received preoperative TAC 1 week before surgery (pTAC group) and 50 did not (non-pTAC group). All patients underwent hepatectomy and postoperative TAC and were followed up to 400 weeks. Samples of liver tissue without HCC and hepatitis (n = 15) served as normal controls. Cellular levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), TP53, and p21waf1/cip1 were measured in both cancer and surrounding tissues using an immunohistochemistry assay. Taken together, our data suggested that preoperative TAC might postpone postoperative HCC relapse within 1 year via suppression of tumor cells by induction of high levels of oxidative stress.
