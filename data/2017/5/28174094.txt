Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also called malignant hepatoma, is one of the deadliest cancers due to its complexities, reoccurrence after surgical resection, metastasis and heterogeneity. Incidence and mortality of HCC are increasing in Western countries and are expected to rise as a consequence of the obesity epidemic. Multiple factors trigger the initiation and progression of HCC including chronic alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis B and C infection, metabolic disorders and age. Although Sorafenib is the only FDA approved drug for the treatment of HCC, numerous treatment modalities such as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization/transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiotherapy, locoregional therapy and chemotherapy have been tested in the clinics. Polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles carrying small molecules, proteins, peptides and nucleic acids have attracted great attention for the treatment of various cancers including HCC. Herein, we discuss the pathogenesis of HCC in relation to its various recent treatment methodologies using nanodelivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), small molecules, miRNAs and peptides. Synopsis of recent clinical trials of mAbs and peptide drugs has been presented with a broad overview of the pathogenesis of the disease and treatment efficacy.
