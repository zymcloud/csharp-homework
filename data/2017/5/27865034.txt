Background & aims:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) re-infection following liver transplant (LT) is associated with reduced graft and patient survival. Before transplant, Sofosbuvir/Ribavirin (SOF/R) treatment prevents recurrent HCV in 96% of those patients achieving viral suppression for at least 4 weeks before transplant. We evaluated whether a bridging SOF-regimen from pre- to post-transplant is safe and effective to prevent HCV recurrence in those patients with less than 4 weeks of HCV-RNA undetectability at the time of transplant.Methods:From July 2014 SOF/R was given in 233 waitlisted HCV cirrhotics with/without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within an Italian Compassionate Program. One hundred patients were transplanted and 31 patients (31%) treated with SOF/R bridging therapy were studied.Results:Liver transplant indication in bridge subgroup was HCC in 22 and decompensated cirrhosis in 9. HCV-genotype was 1/4 in 18 patients. SOF 400 mg/day and R (median dosage 800 mg/day) were given for a median of 35 days before LT. At transplant time, 19 patients were still HCV-RNA positive (median HCV-RNA 58 IU/mL). One recipient had a virological breakthrough at week 4 post-transplant; one died, on treatment, 1-month post-transplant for sepsis and 29/31 achieved a 12-week sustained virological response (94%). Acute cellular rejection occurred in three recipients. On September 2016, 30 recipients (97%) were alive with a median follow-up of 18 months (range 13-25).Conclusions:In patients with suboptimal virological response at LT, a bridging SOF/R regimen helps avoiding post-transplant graft reinfection.
