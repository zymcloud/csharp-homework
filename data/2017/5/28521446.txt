The present study aimed to explore the mechanisms behind the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and identify information regarding HCC-related microRNAs (miRNAs) or marker genes for the gene therapy of HCC. Gene expression profile of GSE67882, generated from 4 hepatitis B virus infected HCC tissue samples (HCC group) and 8 chronic hepatitis B tissue samples with no fibrosis (control group) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed miRNAs functional enrichment and pathway analyses of HCC were revealed, followed by transcription factor-miRNA interaction network construction and analyses. A total of 14 upregulated miRNAs and 16 downregulated miRNAs between HCC and control samples were obtained. Differentially expressed miRNAs were mainly involved in biological processes like the regulation of histone H3-K9 methylation, and the KEGG pathways in cancer map05200 demonstrates their involvement in cancer. A total of 3 outstanding regulatory networks of miRNAs: hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-125b and hsa-miR-122 were revealed. A total of 11 differentially expressed miRNAs including hsa-miR-146p-5b that regulated the marker genes of HCC were explored. miRNAs such as hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-122 and hsa-miR-146b-5p may be new biomarkers for the gene therapy of HCC. Furthermore, histone H3-K9 methylation and other pathways in cancer observed in the KEGG map05200 may be closely related with the development of HCC.
