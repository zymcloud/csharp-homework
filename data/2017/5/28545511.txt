Background:Gastric hepatoid adenocarcinoma (GHAC) is an atypical form of gastric cancer (GC) that has similar tissue morphology to hepatocellular carcinoma and frequently produces alpha-fetoprotein. We present an exceedingly rare case of GHAC resulting in a spontaneous gastric perforation.Case presentation:A 61-year-old man presented at our institution complaining of abdominal and back pain. A computed tomography scan revealed a spontaneous gastric perforation with a solitary liver tumor and lymph node swelling. Following a diagnosis of advanced-stage GC with a gastric perforation, perforative peritonitis, multiple lymph node metastases, and a solitary metastasis of the lateral segment of the liver, the patient underwent distal gastrectomy. Histopathology of the resected specimen revealed that the tumor cells were arranged in a hepatoid pattern. On immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells were positive for alpha-fetoprotein and Sal-like protein 4. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with GHAC. Hepatic resection of the solitary liver metastasis was performed. However, recurrence occurred and the patient achieved complete response following tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil-based chemotherapy.Conclusions:GHAC is a highly malignant histological subtype of GC. We reported on an extremely rare case of GHAC resulting in a spontaneous gastric perforation and reviewed the literature, including epidemiological data, treatment regimens, and the association between GHAC and alpha-fetoprotein-producing GC.
