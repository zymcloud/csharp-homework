Purpose:We aimed to compare disease-free survival after pulmonary metastasectomy to that after hepatic metastasectomy, and to identify prognostic factors after pulmonary metastasectomy.Results:Between 2005 and 2015, 129 patients underwent resection of isolated metachronous lung metastases from colorectal cancer. Three-year DFS after pulmonary metastasectomy was similar to that after hepatic metastasectomy (50.7% vs. 45.5%, respectively; p=0.58). Rectal cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-3.79; p=0.03) and â‰¥2 metastases (HR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.28-3.68; p=0.004) were independent adverse risk factors associated with disease-free survival after pulmonary metastasectomy on multivariate analysis. Three-year DFS for colon vs. rectal cancer patients was 72.5% vs. 42.6%, respectively (p=0.04). The number of lung metastases was an independent risk factor for DFS after pulmonary metastasectomy in rectal cancer patients.Patients and methods:Patients who underwent lung metastasectomy after curative resection of colorectal cancers were investigated. Disease-free survival (DFS) after pulmonary metastasectomy was compared to that after hepatic metastasectomy, which has a relatively well-known prognosis. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to identify clinical variables predictive of survival after pulmonary metastasectomy.Conclusions:Disease-free survival rates after resection of lung vs. liver metastases arising from colorectal cancers are similar. However, lung metastases specifically from rectal cancers produce poorer DFS rates. Primary tumor location must be considered for pulmonary metastasis treatment and follow-up in colorectal cancer patients.
