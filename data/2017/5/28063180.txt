Controversy exists about the association between occupational exposures to vinyl chloride and hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. Two large multicentre mortality cohort studies, one American and another European, reported higher mortality for primary cancer of liver and biliary tract. However, the American study was not able to rule out misclassification, because based on death certificates and under the heading primary liver cancers, some angiosarcomas, the typical neoplasia associated with vinyl chloride, may have been included. The American study does not report on cirrhosis mortality. The European study also reports higher mortality of primary liver cancer, but contrary to the American study in a further analysis based on 10 verified cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, an exposure-response trend with duration of employment and with cumulative exposure to vinyl chloride was detected. A smaller cohort belonging to this multicentre cohort confirmed these results. Meta-analyses based on the two large cohorts concluded for a small excess of primary liver cancer, although misclassification could not be ruled out. Excess risk of cirrhosis was reported in the European cohort, in a subcohort and in a cross-sectional study. However, a meta-analysis did not confirm this excess. Several critical appraisals of the literature reached antithetical conclusions about hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis and occupational exposures to vinyl chloride. For both hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, a study suggests an additive and multiplicative effect of vinyl chloride exposure with viral hepatitis and alcohol consumption respectively. Pathology reports seem to indicate a possible development of hepatocellular carcinoma but not of cirrhosis after high exposures to vinyl chloride.
