Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which epithelial cells lose their own features and become mesenchymal cells, and more and more studies have shown that EMT plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This article reviews the signaling pathways involved in the progression of HCC and molecules involved in the regulation of EMT, in order to provide a new direction for the treatment of HCC.
