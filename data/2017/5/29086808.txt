Background:Pyrazoles, thiazoles and 1,3,4-thiadiazoles have been reported to possess various pharmacological activities.Results:An efficient and a novel approach for the synthesis of some novel pyrazole based-azoles are described via multi-component reaction under controlled microwave heating conditions. The structures of the synthesized compounds were assigned on the basis of elemental analysis, IR, 1H NMR and mass spectral data. All the synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro activities against two antitumor cell lines, human lung cancer and human hepatocellular carcinoma compared with the employed standard antitumor drug (cisplatin).Conclusions:All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity against human lung cancer and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using MTT assay. The results obtained exploring the high potency of six of the tested compounds compared with cisplatin. Graphical abstract Microwave-assisted one pot three-component synthesis of some novel pyrazole scaffolds as potent anticancer agents.
