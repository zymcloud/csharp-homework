Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are prominent examples of RNA and DNA viruses, respectively, that establish a persistent infection in their host. HCV affects over 185 million patients worldwide, who are at high risk for developing liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent breakthroughs in HCV therapy, using direct-acting antivirals have provided the opportunity to monitor natural killer (NK) cells after clearance of a chronic infection. There is now increasing evidence that the individual NK cell repertoire before infection is predictive for the course of disease. HCMV affects the majority of the global population. While being asymptomatic in healthy individuals, HCMV represents a severe clinical challenge in immunocompromised patients. Both viral infections, HCV and HCMV, lead to long-lasting and profound alterations within the entire NK cell compartment. This review article, will discuss the diverse range of changes in the NK cell compartment as well as potential consequences for the course of disease.
