Numerous studies have examined the associations of three promoter polymorphisms (-1082A/G, -819T/C and -592A/C) in IL-10 gene with cancer susceptibility in the Chinese population, but the results remain inconclusive. To gain a more precise estimation of this potential association, we conducted the current meta-analysis based on 53 articles, including 26 studies with 4,901 cases and 6,426 controls for the -1082A/G polymorphism, 33 studies with 6,717 cases and 8,550 controls for the -819T/C polymorphism, and 42 studies with 9,934 cases and 13,169 controls for the -592A/C polymorphism. Pooled results indicated that the three promoter polymorphisms in IL-10 gene were significantly associated with an increased overall cancer risk in the Chinese population. Stratification analysis showed that the association was more pronounced for hepatocellular carcinoma and low quality studies for the -1082A/G polymorphism, lung cancer and oral cancer for the -819T/C polymorphism. However, the -592A/C polymorphism was associated with a statistically significant increased risk for lung cancer, oral cancer, hospital-based studies and low quality studies, but a decreased risk for colorectal cancer. We further investigated the significant results using the false-positive report probability (FPRP) test. Interestingly, FPRP test results revealed that only IL-10 -1082A/G polymorphism was truly associated with an increased overall cancer risk. In the subgroup analysis, only the low quality studies, lung cancer and colorectal cancer remained significant at the prior level of 0.1. Although this association needs further confirmation by considering large studies, this meta-analysis suggested an association between IL-10 gene polymorphisms and cancer risk in the Chinese population.
