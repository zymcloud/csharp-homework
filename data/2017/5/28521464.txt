Assessment of hepatic functional reserve is important to enable the selection of appropriate treatment methods and safe hepatic resection in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, an evaluation was made of the clinical value of combining the Child-Pugh score (CPS) with the standardized future liver remnant (sFLR) measurement to predict postoperative liver dysfunction (PLD). A total of 61 HBV-related HCC patients undergoing liver volumetry prior to hepatectomy were enrolled in the study. The sFLR was calculated as the ratio of FLR volume to standardized liver volume. PLD was defined as a prothrombin time of >18 sec or a peak serum bilirubin level of >51.3 Âµmol/l for 7 days after surgery. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify risk factors associated with PLD. The correlation between PLD and the combination of sFLR and CPS was analyzed. In total, 18 out of 61 patients developed PLD (29.5%), with a significantly higher PLD incidence for a CPS of 6 than a CPS of 5 (P
