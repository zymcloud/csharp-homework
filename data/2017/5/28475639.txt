Rationale and objectives:To develop a human metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) model in a rabbit liver.Materials and methods:Immunosuppression in 4 adult New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.5 to 4.5 kg was induced with daily subcutaneous injection of 15 mg/kg Cyclosporine A (CsA). On day 3 open mini-laparotomy was performed and 0.2 ml (1.8x105 cells) suspension of HCT-116 and HT-29 human CRC cells were injected into the left and right medial lobe respectively. On day 10 the CsA dose was reduced to 10 mg/kg daily maintenance dose. Rabbits were weighed weekly, closely monitored for CsA side effects (weight loss, gingival hyperplasia and gut modification). Rabbits were sacrificed 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks after cells injection. Liver tumors were collected for histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis.Results:HT-29 Tumor growth was observed in 3 rabbits (75%). Tumors measured 3, 4 and 6 mm after 5, 6 and 8 weeks respectively. Microscopically, tumors contained hyperchromatic, pleomorphic cells that stained for monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), polyclonal CEA, cytokeratin 20, vascular markers (CD31, CD34), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by immunohistochemistry, supporting involvement by the poorly differentiated HT-29 colorectal cancer cell line. No gross tumor growth or microscopic viability was observed from HCT-116 cell injection. CsA extra-hepatic manifestations included minimal gum hyperplasia and decrease in gut motility in 3 rabbits (75%), which was treated with Azithromycin 15 mg/kg and Cisapride 0.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, respectively.Conclusion:We successfully developed a human metastatic colon cancer model in immunosuppressed rabbit liver using HT-29 cells.
