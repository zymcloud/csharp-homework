Abnormal expression levels of microRNA-204 (miR-204) have been identified in various types of human cancer. However, the expression and functions of miR-204, and the underlying molecular mechanism involved in the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), require further investigation. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR-204 is downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Notably, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) was identified as a direct target of miR-204 in HCC. In addition, miR-204 negatively regulates ZEB2 expression level in HCC cells at the post-transcriptional level. In functional studies, the overexpression of miR-204 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of ZEB2 may mimic the functions of miR-204 in HCC cells, suggesting that ZEB2 is a direct functional target of miR-204. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that miR-204 suppresses the tumor growth, migration and invasion of HCC cells by directly targeting ZEB2, and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for HCC.
