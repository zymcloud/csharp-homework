Objective: To analyze the clinicopathological features and prognosis of patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: The clinicopathological and follow-up data of 98 patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent R0 resection from January 2009 to December 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: All of the patients were followed up. Their postoperative 1-year, 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates were 99.0%, 91.7%, and 76.3%, respectively. Their postoperative median overall survival (OS) period was 52 months. The postoperative progression-free survival rates were 86.7%, 66.2% and 55.0%, respectively, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) period was 43.5 months. The univariate analysis showed that satellite nodules, liver capsule invasion and postoperative recurrence time were associated with OS (P<0.05), and long-term heavy drinking, satellite nodules and liver capsule invasion with PFS (P<0.05). The multivariate analysis indicated that long-term heavy drinking was an independent factor influencing the progression-free survival period of patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (P=0.003) and postoperative recurrence time and liver capsule invasion were independent factors affecting their overall survival period (P<0.05). Conclusions: The treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma still concentrates on the active treatment of surgery. It is beneficial to patients to minimize the resection scope of normal liver under the premise of R0 removal of tumor. Postoperative recurrence time of â‰¤2 years suggests poor prognosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma. Long-term heavy drinking can accelerate the recurrence of small hepatocellular carcinoma.
