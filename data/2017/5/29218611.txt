Objectives:To determine whether clinically relevant portal hypertension (CRPH) influences outcome and whether it may serve as a prognostic marker in patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One hundred and forty-seven patients underwent conventional TACE as a first-line treatment for a single HCC. CRPH was graded as 0, 1, or 2. The influence of CRPH, together with other factors, on local tumour progression (LTP) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression.Results:A higher CRPH grade (grade 1, p = 0.005, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.282; grade 2, p Conclusions:Portal hypertension was significantly associated with poor outcome after TACE, and non-invasive CRPH grading may be a useful prognostic marker of TACE.Key points:• Portal hypertension was significantly associated with poor outcome after TACE. • Grading portal hypertension non-invasively can help predict TACE outcome in HCC patients. • CRPH grading can aid in selecting optimal candidates for TACE.
