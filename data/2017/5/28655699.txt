The present study focuses on the evaluation of the cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activities of the organic extracts of 70 fungal strains associated with twelve Red Sea marine invertebrates. The fungal strains were obtained 10 sponges, one tunicate and one soft coral. Three different media including Sabouraud dextrose agar, malt extract agar and Czapek-Dox agar were used for the purification of the fungal isolates. The purified fungal isolates were cultured in their corresponding media (Sabouraud dextrose broth, Malt extract broth and Czapek-Dox broth) on shaker for 14 days at 26° C. After that, the cultures were lyophilized and the dried cultures were extracted with methanol. The methanolic extracts of these cultures were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activities against three human cancer cell lines including breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116). Nine extracts displayed potent and selective activity against MCF-7 with IC50 4.96-8.28μ g/mL without any significant effect on the other two cell lines. In addition, six extracts showed strong and selective activity against MCF-7 with IC50 11.37-15.53μ g/mL. On the other hand, most of the fungal extracts were inactive or weakly active against HepG2 and HCT-116.
