MicroRNAs (miRs) can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in different types of human malignancy, and may provide an effective therapy for cancer. The expression and functions of miR-592 have previously been studied in relation to cancer. However, the expression and potential functions of miR-592 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unknown. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, MTT assays, cellular migration and invasion assays, bioinformatics software, western blot analysis and dual-luciferase report assays, the present study explored the expression and roles of miR-592 in HCC. It was identified that miR-592 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. The statistical analysis revealed that low expression of miR-592 was evidently associated with tumor node metastasis stage and lymph node metastasis. Additionally, the present study provided the first evidence that miR-592 was likely to directly target the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor in vitro. The present results indicated that miR-592 could be investigated as an efficacious therapeutic target for HCC in the future.
