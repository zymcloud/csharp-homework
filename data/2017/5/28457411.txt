Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6th leading cause of cancer worldwide. Its recurrence ranges from 6% to 26%. In the literature, many factors are associated with higher risk of recurrence, without a clear definition of the best method that could predict this highly lethal event.Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoexpression of immunohistochemical markers: HSP70, glypican 3, glutamine synthetase, and beta-catenin, as well as studying their association with tumor characteristics and prognosis of patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC.Methods:We studied 90 patients who underwent liver transplantation from 1998 to 2012. Afterwards we evaluated factors related to survival, tumor recurrence, and the correlation of expression of the immunohistochemical markers.Results:Immunohistochemical marker glutamine synthetase showed a positive trend toward better survival. HSP70-positive patients had a higher prevalence of histologic grade III. Patients with positive glypican 3 showed larger lesions and a higher number with AFP >200 ng/mL. Patients with positive beta-catenin showed larger nodules and more with histologic grade III. The association between beta-catenin and glypican 3 showed positive association with larger nodules.Conclusions:Most of the markers studied had a correlation with at least one of the variables studied, confirming our hypothesis that these markers can indeed assist in assessing the prognosis of patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC.
