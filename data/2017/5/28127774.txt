Aim:The purpose of this study was to investigate which inflammation-based marker more accurately predict recurrence in patients receiving hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 1020 patients was included. The impacts of clinical variables and inflammation-based markers on disease-free survival (DFS) were measured by Kaplan-Meier method. Selected potential prognostic factors were further analyzed in multivariate model. To reduce influences of selection bias and possible confounders, clinical characteristics of patients were balanced by propensity score matching (PSM).Results:Of the 1020 patients, 881 (86.4%) were male and 323 (31.7%) received major hepatectomy. In multivariate analysis, cirrhosis (HR: 1.49), tumor size (HR: 1.32), tumor number (HR: 1.57), portal vein tumor thrombus (HR: 1.66), microvascular invasion (HR: 1.60), histological grade (HR: 1.82), operation time (HR: 1.50), alpha foetal protein (HR: 1.29), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (HR: 1.38), and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) (HR: 1.51) were independently predictive of DFS. After PSM, 258 and 213 pairs of patients were generated for LMR and NLR, respectively. LMR and NLR were still independent predictors of recurrence for HCC patients receiving hepatectomy.Conclusion:Both LMR and NLR might be preferable independent prognostic factors for DFS in HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy.
