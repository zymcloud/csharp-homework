BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to define the best curative strategy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a hepatitis B virus (HBV)-endemic region where living donation dominates the type of cadaveric donation for liver transplantation (LT). MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective cohort comprised those patients whose clinical course could potentially be traced for at least 10 years. We found 262 HCC patients who had undergone curative surgical treatment from March 1997 to August 2006. Among these patients, 156 were treated with liver resection (LR) (R group) and 106 patients underwent LT (T group, 100 patients with living donor). Tumor characteristics, overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed. RESULTS Postoperative mortality was not significantly different between the groups, whereas recurrence rate during the study period (until August 2016) was higher in the R group (56% in the R group versus 19% in the T group, p
