Increasing evidence has demonstrated an association between increased soluble B7-H3 (sB7-H3) levels and unfavorable progression in patients with malignant tumors. In the present study, we detected sB7-H3 levels in serum to investigate the value of sB7-H3 as a tool for differential diagnosis of cirrhotic patients with or without early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (ESHCC). We also assessed the diagnostic value of sB7-H3regarding the prediction of overall survival (OS) of cirrhotic patients with ESHCC. sB7-H3 expression was measured in 91 healthy volunteers, 149 cirrhotic patients with ESHCC, and 87 cirrhotic patients by ELISA, and correlations between DCP1a level and clinical characteristics were analyzed. SB7-H3 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with ESHCC than in cirrhotic patients (P
