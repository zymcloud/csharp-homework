Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reactivation is relatively rare compared with hepatitis B reactivation in patients treated with immunosuppressive or anticancer drugs. Here, we present the first case of genotype 2 HCV reactivation due to antiemetic steroid therapy during chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which was verified by not only increased viral load but also pathological exacerbation of liver injury during HCV reactivation. Further chemotherapy for HCC could be continued without steroid therapy. This present case highlights the awareness of HCV reactivation and the management of complex situation.
