Purpose:The aim of this study was to assess the potential of tumor 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity as a preoperative imaging biomarker for the prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One hundred and fifty-eight patients diagnosed with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stages 0 or A HCC (median age, 57 years; interquartile range, 50-64 years) who underwent 18F-FDG positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) before curative surgery at seven university hospitals were included. Tumor FDG avidity was measured by tumor-to-normal liver standardized uptake value ratio (TLR) of the primary tumor on FDG PET/CT imaging. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant parameters associated with MVI. The predictive performance of TLR and other clinical variables was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.Results:MVI was present in 76 of 158 patients with HCCs (48.1%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that TLR, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, and tumor size were significantly associated with the presence of MVI (P Conclusions:Tumor FDG avidity measured by TLR on FDG PET/CT is a preoperative imaging biomarker for the prediction of MVI in patients with HCC.
