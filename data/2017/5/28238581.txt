Purpose:To evaluate whether technetium-99 (99mTc)-labeled macroaggregated albumin (MAA) can predict subsequent yttrium-90 (90Y) distribution and imaging response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials:Retrospective review was performed of records of 83 patients with HCC who underwent 90Y glass microsphere radioembolization with 99mTc-MAA single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and 90Y positron emission tomography (PET)/CT between January 2013 and December 2014. Images were fused to segment the whole liver normal tissue (WLNT) and the largest tumors. Fused images were reviewed and analyzed for comparison of absorbed dose (AD) to tumors and WLNT as calculated from 99mTc-MAA SPECT and from 90Y PET/CT, subjective imaging comparison of 99mTc-MAA SPECT and 90Y PET for tumors and WLNT, and correlation of tumoral AD with response on follow-up CT.Results:Final analysis included 73 and 63 patients for WLNT and tumor 99mTc-MAA/90Y correlation, respectively, and 62 patients for AD vs response. 99mTc-MAA/90Y limit of agreement for each reviewer was viewed as clinically acceptable only for WLNT (-15 to 15 Gy). AD interreviewer variability was clinically acceptable for WLNT but was too broad for tumor. Mean tumor AD for objective response (78%) was 313 Gy vs 234 Gy for nonresponders. No threshold was found between tumor AD and response (P > .1). Catheter mismatch between 99mTc-MAA and 90Y had a direct impact on AD mismatch between the 2 image sets.Conclusions:99mTc-MAA was found to be a poor surrogate to quantitatively predict subsequent 90Y AD to hepatocellular tumors. 99mTc-MAA distribution correlated with 90Y distribution in the normal hepatic parenchyma.
