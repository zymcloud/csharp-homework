Stauffer's syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome classically associated with renal cell carcinoma. It presents as abnormal hepatic panel in the absence of hepatic disease, which improves with treatment of the cancer and worsens with recurrence. Here, we describe a case of hepatic panel abnormalities in a patient with pancreatic cancer with no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver, primary hepatobiliary etiology, or clear offending medications. We believe this to be the first reported case of Stauffer's syndrome in patients with pancreatic cancer.
