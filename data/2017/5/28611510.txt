The biosynthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes has been a focus of interest in the management of many liver diseases. Cyclooxygenases are the enzymes involved in the first step of the biosynthesis of these lipid mediators and selective inhibitors for these isoenzymes as well as pharmacological analogues of prostaglandins have been developed and are currently applied therapeutically. Here we discuss the implications of these enzymes in the onset of metabolic and lipid disorders in the liver and their potential role in the progression of the diseases towards fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
