Background:Metastatic carcinoma to the jaws and oral region are very rare, representing less than 1% of all oral tumors. Unfortunately, oral metastasis is usually manifestation of an advanced stage of primary cancer, and indicates widespread disease and poor prognosis.Material and methods:In this retrospective study, a total of 2039 patients with history of oral malignant tumor between 1980 and 2012 at Seoul National University Dental Hospital were evaluated. We analyzed the dental and medical records, and histopathological database of 2039 patients to assess the prevalence of oral metastasis of carcinoma in terms of sex and age, as well as, the most common origin of primary cancer, and prevalent site and histopathological type of metastatic carcinoma.Results:Among 2039 patients, 21 (1.03%) were finally diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma of the jaws and oral region. Among the 21 patients, only 11 had a working diagnosis as oral metastasis upon clinical evaluation before performing a biopsy. The mean age at the time of diagnosis with a metastatic carcinoma was 56.86, and there was a male preponderance. Metastatic carcinoma was more frequent in the jaws than in the soft tissue, especially in the mandible compared to the maxilla. The most frequent primary site was the lungs, followed by the liver and breasts. The predominant histopathological types were hepatocellular carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Patient outcomes indicated a poor prognosis with the time from the appearance of the metastasis to death was only 12 months.Conclusions:According to these cases, oral metastases of carcinoma were exceedingly rare in Koreans. It can allow the clinicians take into account the possible presence of metastases and lead to early diagnosis.
