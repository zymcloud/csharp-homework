Although intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC) has a relatively low incidence rate, it ranks the second in the most common primary malignant liver tumors, with hepatocellular carcinoma ranking the first. Meanwhile, its incidence and mortality rates tend to increase significantly in the past decades. On the one hand, due to a lack of characteristic clinical symptoms, specific tumor markers, and imaging findings, early diagnosis of ICC is extremely difficult; on the other hand, ICC has highly malignant biological behaviors and early extrahepatic metastasis, so patients often experience early recurrence even if surgical resection is performed, which leads to the poor prognosis of such patients. Unfortunately, since ICC has a low incidence rate and relatively few patients, it is not taken seriously in clinical practice. Since there is a lack of clinical data, specimens, and in-depth studies on ICC, its pathogenesis remains unclear. This article discusses recent advances in ICC, including risk factors, molecular mechanism, new diagnostic markers, and therapies (including molecular targeted drugs).
