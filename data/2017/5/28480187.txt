The Glissonian approach, due to its simplicity of procedure, is a technical procedure widely used in open hepatectomy. However, it is not easily applicable in the setting of the total laparoscopic approach because of movement restriction. We herein propose a new and simple method of performing hemihepatectomy by Glissonian approach called temporary inflow control of the Glissonian pedicle (TICGL) technique. Dissection of the Glisson pedicle from the liver parenchyma is done until the posterior margin of the pedicle is visualized, and is clamped with bulldog clamps. Encircling the pedicle is not necessary. Resection of the liver parenchyma is performed under inflow control of the resected side liver providing less bleeding. After sufficient resection is done so that the whole Glissonian pedicle structures are visualized, the pedicle is encircled, often very easily without the fear of bleeding from the posterior side of the pedicle, which is a common problem when encircling is done before parenchymal resection. The staplers may then be applied safely without injuring the major hepatic veins since they have been already exposed. Stapling is done while the tape is retracted toward the contralateral side. This retraction prevents injury or stricture of the contralateral Glissonian pedicle branch. The remnant liver parenchyma is resected and hepatectomy finalized. The TICGL technique provides a safe and easy way of performing major hemihepatectomies, not only by expert laparoscopic surgeons but by less experienced surgeons. It can therefore become a standard method of performing hemihepatectomy by Glissonian approach.
