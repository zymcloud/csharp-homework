Introduction:Antivirals direct acting (DAA) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) have brought a revolution in the field of transplantation. It is likely to think that in the future patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation (LT) will no longer be registered for HCV-related cirrhosis but for liver disease from other causes. On the eve of this change, we show a snapshot of the Italian waiting list for LT.Methods:From October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013, we estimated the total number of patients on the liver waiting list as intention to treat (ITT), the number of incident cases, and the delistings, particularly in the HCV positive (HCV+) population. Gender, median age, etiology and prognosis of liver disease, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), reason for delisting, mean waiting time for LT, and rate of death on waiting list were evaluated.Results:In the time period, there were 517 new patients who were HCV+ (median age, 53 years): 255 (49.3%) mono-infected with HCV, 236 (45.7%) co-infected with HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV), 11 (2.1%) co-infected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 15 (2.9%) co-infected with HCV, HBV, and HIV. The median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score at listing was 17 and HCC was present in 206 (39.8%) cases. HCV+ patients delisted were 442 (61.9%), 355 (80.3%) for LT. The mean waiting time to transplantation was 1.9 months; the percentage of death was 7.6%.Conclusions:This snapshot of the waiting list for LT in the year before the advent of DAA drugs will allow us to assess whether and how they will change the waiting list for LT when we start to look at the impact of new therapies on the waiting list.
