Aberrant expression of Abelson interactor 1 (ABI1) has been reported in multiple cancers. However, its clinical significance and potential biological roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that ABI1 was obviously upregulated in HCC tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. Moreover, high ABI1 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P=0.041), tumor number (P
