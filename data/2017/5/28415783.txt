We previously showed that BZG is a novel multitarget kinase inhibitor, which inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) to characterize BZG and its metabolites generated in vivo. The probable metabolic mechanism was further confirmed by analysis of Phase I and Phase II metabolism in liver microsomes and with recombinant enzymes. In addition, the binding affinities of BZG metabolites to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) were predicted using electronic high throughput screening (eHiTS). The results showed that BZG underwent phase I and phase II metabolism. We detected 11 BZG metabolites and identified hydroxylation, glucuronation, acetylation, sulfonation and degradation as the major metabolic processes in vivo and in vitro. Five of the eleven metabolites showed highly favorable eHiTS energy scores that were lower than sorafenib. Knowledge of the in vivo metabolic pathways of BZG and its binding affinities to VEGFR2 will be beneficial for further clinical development of BZG.
