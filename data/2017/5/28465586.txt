In Photofrin-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), cell fate can be modulated by the subcellular location of Photofrin. PDT triggers oxidative damage to target cells, including the methionine (Met) oxidation of proteins. Here, we developed a new Met-containing peptide enrichment protocol combined with SILAC-based quantitative proteomics, and used this approach to explore the global Met oxidation changes of proteins in PDT-treated epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells preloaded with Photofrin at the plasma membrane, ER/Golgi, or ubiquitously. We identified 431 Met-peptides corresponding to 302 proteins that underwent severe oxidation upon PDT and observed overrepresentation of proteins related to the cell surface, plasma membrane, ER, Golgi, and endosome under all three conditions. The most frequently oxidized Met-peptide sequence was "QAMXXMM-E/G/M-S/G-A/G/F-XG". We also identified several hundred potential Photofrin-binding proteins using affinity purification coupled with LC-MS/MS, and confirmed the bindings of EGFR and cathepsin D with Photofrin. The enzyme activities of both proteins were significantly reduced by Photofrin-PDT. Our results shed light on the global and site-specific changes in Met-peptide oxidation among cells undergoing Photofrin-PDT-mediated oxidative stress originating from distinct subcellular sites, and suggest numerous potential Photofrin-binding proteins. These findings provide new insight into the molecular targets through which Photofrin-PDT has diverse effects on target cells.
