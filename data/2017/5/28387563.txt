Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) regulates mitochondrial antioxidant (AO) defense and improves mitochondrial disorders. Curcumin protects mitochondria; however, the mechanisms need investigation. We postulated that curcumin increases AO defense under hyperglycemic conditions in HepG2 cells through SIRT3-mediated mechanisms. Cell viability was determined in HepG2 cells cultured with 5 mM glucose, 19.9 mM mannitol, vehicle control, 10 mM glucose, and 30 mM glucose in the absence or presence of curcumin for 24 h. SIRT3, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and Lon protein expressions were determined using western blot. Transcript levels of SIRT3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability, SIRT3 protein expression, transcript levels of SIRT3, PGC-1α, CREB, GPx1, and SOD2 and protein expressions of NF-κB, Lon, and Hsp70 were significantly increased in the curcumin-treated hyperglycemic groups. Since curcumin and SIRT3 both improve mitochondrial function and AO defense, SIRT3 may be involved in the protective effects of curcumin.
