Newcastle disease virus (NDV) have shown oncolytic therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies and are currently proved for clinical trials. We have previously reported, for the first time, NDV Anhinga strain has an efficient cancer therapeutic efficacy in hepatoma. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) functions as a cytokine to selectively kill various cancer cells without toxicity to most normal cells. Numerous studies have demonstrated the potential use of recombinant soluble TRAIL as a cancer therapeutic agent. In this study, we have showed administration of a recombinant NDV Anhinga strain expressing soluble TRAIL (NDV/Anh-TRAIL) results in an efficient suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma without significant toxicity. The results show that recombinant NDV Anhinga strain expressing soluble TRAIL is a promising candidate for hepatoma therapy.
