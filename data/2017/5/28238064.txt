Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases are closely associated with chronic inflammation and fibrosis which is known as hepatic inflammation-fibrosis-cancer (IFC) axis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the development characteristics of the rat HCC model based on IFC axis.Methods:The diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat HCC, which presents a stepwise histopathological progression that is similar to human HCC, was used to analyze the features of the different stages (inflammation, fibrosis, cancer). Rats were injected DEN at a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight twice a week for 11 weeks and the animals were observed until week 20. Time series sera and organ samples from the DEN animal model were collected to evaluate the dynamic changes.Results:It was found that serum biochemical indicators (AST, ALT, ALP, TP, T-BIL, IL-6, TNF-α) from DEN-treated group were higher than that from control group. Fibrosis-related index in serum and live tissue were increased, respectively, from week 4 after DEN treatment. The expression of TGF-β1 and α-SMA in DEN-treated group was higher than that in control group. JAK2/STAT3 signaling was significantly up-regulated in DEN-treated group compared to that in control group. The histological examination confirmed that the hepatocarcinogenesis model was successfully established, and 100% of the animals in the DEN-exposed group developed liver tumors at 20 weeks. According to the pathological changes, the model characterized resulted in three stages: the inflammation stage (week 2-6), the fibrosis stage (week 8-12), and the HCC stage (week 14-20).Conclusions:The results suggested that the HCC development was associated with IFC axis. The serial progression of hepatocarcinogenesis was according to the sequence of hepatic inflammation, fibrosis and then hepatic tumor.
