This study aimed both to evaluate caregivers' perspectives of EF and transition readiness among adolescent transplant recipients and to examine the indirect effects of adolescent responsibility and parent involvement across domains of EF. Fifty-seven caregivers of adolescent solid organ transplant recipients participated in this study and completed measures of adolescent EF, transition readiness, responsibility in healthcare behavior, and parent involvement. Bootstrapping procedures were used to test indirect effects. Caregiver report of adolescent EF was significantly related to transition readiness among transplant recipients. Significant indirect effects were found for adolescent responsibility but not parent involvement. No significant differences were found between metacognitive and behavioral regulation domains of EF in the association with transition readiness. Assessment of adolescent EF skills may help guide the development of individualized transition readiness guidelines to promote successful gains in self-management abilities as well as eventual transfer to adult medical services.
