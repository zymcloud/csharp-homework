Increasing evidence indicates that miR-429 is involved in tumor suppression in various human cancers. however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In the present study, we found that miR-429 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissue samples and cell lines. Upregulation of miR-429 markedly suppressed proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Moreover, we identified TRAF6 as a direct target of miR-429. Downregulation of TRAF6 partially attenuated the oncogenic effect of anti‑miR-429 on HCC cells. Ectopic expression of miR-429 in HCC cells inhibited TCF-4 activity as well as nuclear accumulation of P65 and expression of the NF-κB targets c-Myc and phosphorylation of TAK1. In a nude xenograft model, miR-429 upregulation significantly decreased HCC growth. In conclusion, by targeting TRAF6, miR-429 is downregulated in HCC and inhibits HCC cell proliferation and motility. Our data suggest that miR-429 may serve as a potential anticancer target for the treatment of HCC.
