Objective: To examine the expression of ATAD2 in different liver lesions and its clinical significance. Methods: ATAD2 expression in 60 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgical specimens (49 of which have concurrent liver cirrhosis), 43 HCC biopsy specimens, 2 high-grade liver dysplastic nodule specimens, 3 low-grade liver dysplastic nodule specimens, 50 liver cirrhosis tissue samples, and 20 normal liver tissue samples were measured using immunohistochemistry. The F-test, q-test, t-test, and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis of data. Results: ATAD2 was expressed in 56 HCC surgical specimens (93.33%), 35 HCC biopsy specimens (81.40%), and 2 high-grade liver dysplastic nodule specimens (2/2), but not in the low-grade liver dysplastic nodule, liver cirrhosis tissue, and normal liver tissue samples. The mean expression of ATAD2 was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in high-grade and low-grade liver dysplastic nodule tissues, liver cirrhosis tissue, and normal liver tissue (F = 22.96, q = 3.138, 3.972, 12.272, and 9.101, respectively, all P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the mean expression and positive expression rate of ATAD2 between HCC surgical and biopsy specimens (t = 1.40, P > 0.05; χ² = 3.47, P >0.05). Of the 35 HCC biopsy specimens that expressed ATAD2, the mean ATAD2 expression was ≥1% in 35 specimens (100%), ≥3% in 27 specimens (77.14%), and ≥5 % in 23 specimens (65.71%). In addition, among the pathological grade I-II HCC biopsy specimens, the mean ATAD2 expression was ≥1% in 28 specimens (100%), ≥3% in 22 specimens (62.86%), and ≥5% in 19 specimens (54.29%). Moreover, ATAD2 expression in HCC was associated with serum alpha-fetoprotein level, presence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and presence of concurrent liver cirrhosis (t = 2.09, 2.30, and 2.18, respectively, all P < 0.05). Conclusion: ATAD2 may play an important role in HCC tumorigenesis, and may be involved in malignant transformation of cells. ATAD2 expression can be a valuable marker for differentiating the nature of lesions in liver biopsy tissues during clinical practice.
