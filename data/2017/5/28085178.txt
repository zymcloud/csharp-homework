Aims and background:The relationship between cancer and metabolism has recently been receiving attention. We investigated the prognostic influence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with curative resection.Methods and study design:The records of 58 patients who underwent curative resection for HCC pT1-2N0M0 between 2010 and 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Fourteen patients (24.1%) had diabetes mellitus at diagnosis. Local control (LC) was defined as time to recurrence in the liver.Results:The median follow-up was 23.3 months. Relapses occurred in 20 patients (34.5%) during the follow-up period; 17 of them developed intrahepatic recurrence, which was associated with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.013) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels >500 ng/mL (p = 0.019). Overall relapses (n = 20) were related to T stage (p = 0.044), AFP level (p = 0.005), and diabetes (p = 0.044). The 3-year local control (intrahepatic control), disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 56.7%, 50.5%, and 84.3%, respectively. LC was affected by diabetes mellitus (p = 0.046), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging (pConclusions:Diabetes mellitus is correlated with intrahepatic HCC recurrence after surgery. Greater attention should be paid to managing patients with HCC and diabetes mellitus.
