Tumour heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for treatment stratification. The goals of this study were to quantify heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and to report preliminary data correlating quantitative MRI parameters with advanced histopathology and gene expression in a patient subset. Thirty-two HCC patients with 39 HCC lesions underwent mpMRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD), tissue-oxygenation-level-dependent (TOLD) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. Histogram characteristics [central tendency (mean, median) and heterogeneity (standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness) MRI parameters] in HCC and liver parenchyma were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Histogram data was correlated between MRI methods in all patients and with histopathology and gene expression in 14 patients. HCCs exhibited significantly higher intra-tissue heterogeneity vs. liver with all MRI methods (P
