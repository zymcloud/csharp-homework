Zinc finger protein X-linked (ZFX) is frequently upregulated in multiple human malignancies and also plays a critical role in the maintenance of self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. However, the role of ZFX in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains obscure. We observed that the elevated expression of both ZFX and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and indicated poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ZFX was commonly enriched in liver EpCAM+ CSCs. Knockdown of ZFX decreased the proportion of EpCAM+ CSCs in HCC cells and suppressed their expression of stemness-related genes, self-renewal capacity, chemoresistance, metastatic potential, and tumorigenicity. Conversely, upregulation of ZFX in CSCs rescued these inhibitory effects and enhanced stem-like properties. Mechanistically, depletion of ZFX reduced nuclear translocation and transactivation of β-catenin, thereby inhibiting the self-renewal capacity of EpCAM+ CSCs. Moreover, knockdown of β-catenin attenuated the self-renewal of EpCAM+ HCC cells stably expressing ZFX, further indicating that β-catenin is required for ZFX-mediated expansion and maintenance of EpCAM+ CSCs. Taken together, our findings indicate that ZFX activates and maintains EpCAM+ liver CSCs by promoting nuclear translocation and transactivation of β-catenin. Furthermore, combination of ZFX and EpCAM may serve as a significant indicator for prognosis of patients with HCC.
