Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent subtype of primary liver cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Previous studies have reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) serve key roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of HCC by regulating gene expression. The present study investigated the expression patterns, biological roles and underlying mechanisms of miRNA-708 (miR-708) in HCC. The expression levels of miR-708 in HCC tissue samples and cell lines were examined. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays were used to evaluate the effect of miR-708 on HCC cells. In addition, bioinformatic and western blotting analyses, and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed to investigate the direct gene target of miR-708. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR-708 expression was significantly decreased in HCC tissue samples and cell lines. In addition, the expression level of miR-708 was associated with increased HCC tumour stage. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-708 suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The results of the present study also indicated that miR-708 targets SMAD family member 3 directly in vitro. The results of the present study indicated that miR-708 may be a novel target for future HCC therapy.
