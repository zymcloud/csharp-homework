C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) is an important component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. We demonstrated the induction of ER stress in response to tunicamycin stimulation, as evidenced by increased expression of chaperone proteins Grp78, Grp94, and enhanced eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF2Î±) phosphorylation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress resulted in apoptosis and autophagy simultaneously. While inhibition of autophagy mediated by 3-methyladenine pretreatment or direct knockdown of LC3B promoted cell apoptosis, activation of autophagy with rapamycin decreased tunicamycin- induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Furthermore, CHOP was shown to be significantly upregulated upon treatment with tunicamycin in HCC cells. Specific knockdown of CHOP not only enhanced tunicamycin-induced autophagy, but also significantly attenuated ER stress-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Accordingly, simultaneous inhibition of autophagy in HCC cells with CHOP-knockdown could partially resensitize ER stress-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data indicate that CHOP may favor ER stress-induced apoptosis in HCC cells via inhibition of autophagy in vitro.
