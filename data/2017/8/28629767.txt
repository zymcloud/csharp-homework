Background:The proportion of the both serum hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody negative hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC HCC) patients are tended to increase recently. We investigated the characteristics and surgical outcome for those patients after liver resection.Methods:Four hundred and thirty-five NBNC patients were involved in our study. According to the results of the HBcAb in the serum, those patients were divided into HBcAb-positive subgroup (n = 328) and HBcAb-negative subgroup (n = 107). Based on the multivariate risk factors, the nomogram was constructed for predicting the possibility for over survival (OS) rate.Results:For all of the NBNC HCC patients, the median OS was 57 months with 5-year OS rate 54.0%. The positive HBcAb NBNC patients were associating with a better liver function (p = 0.026), higher AFP (p Conclusion:We established a novel prognostic nomogram to predict the OS of NBNC HCC patients after liver resection. The prognosis of NBNC HCC was mainly determined by tumor stage and liver function not by the previous etiologies.
