Aim:To assess the value of combined acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging, serological indexes and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in distinguishing between benign and malignant liver lesions.Methods:Patients with liver lesions treated at our hospital were included in this study. The lesions were divided into either a malignant tumor group or a benign tumor group according to pathological or radiological findings. ARFI quantitative detection, serological testing and CEUS quantitative detection were performed and compared. A comparative analysis of the measured indexes was performed between these groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of ARFI imaging, serological indexes and CEUS, alone or in different combinations, in identifying benign and malignant liver lesions.Results:A total of 112 liver lesions in 43 patients were included, of which 78 were malignant and 34 were benign. Shear wave velocity (SWV) value, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) content and enhancement rate were significantly higher in the malignant tumor group than in the benign tumor group (2.39 ± 1.20 m/s vs 1.50 ± 0.49 m/s, 18.02 ± 5.01 ng/mL vs 15.96 ± 4.33 ng/mL, 2.14 ± 0.21 dB/s vs 2.01 ± 0.31 dB/s; P < 0.05). The ROC curve analysis revealed that the areas under the curves (AUCs) of SWV value alone, AFP content alone, enhancement rate alone, SWV value + AFP content, SWV value + enhancement rate, AFP content + enhancement rate and SWV value + AFP content + enhancement rate were 85.1%, 72.1%, 74.5%, 88.3%, 90.4%, 82.0% and 92.3%, respectively. The AUC of SWV value + AFP content + enhancement rate was higher than those of SWV value + AFP content and SWV value + enhancement rate, and significantly higher than those of any single parameter or the combination of any two of parameters.Conclusion:The combination of SWV, AFP and enhancement rate had better diagnostic performance in distinguishing between benign and malignant liver lesions than the use of any single parameter or the combination of any two of parameters. It is expected that this would provide a tool for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant liver lesions.
