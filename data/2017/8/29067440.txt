The co-delivery of a drug and a target gene has become a primary strategy in cancer therapy. Based on our previous study, a synthesized star‑shaped co‑polymer consisting of β‑cyclodextrin (CD) and a poly(L‑lysine) dendron (PLLD) was used to co-deliver docetaxel (DOC) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP‑9) small interfering RNA, via CD‑PLLD/DOC/MMP‑9 complexes, into mice implanted with HNE‑1 human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tumor cells in vivo. Unlike the commonly used amphiphilic co‑polymer micelles, the obtained CD derivative may be used directly for a combined delivery of nucleic acid and hydrophobic DOC without a complicated micellization process. In vivo assays demonstrated that CD‑PLLD/DOC/MMP‑9 inhibited HNE‑1 tumor growth and decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression levels, indicating a potential strategy for NPC therapy. In addition, the distribution of DOC and MMP‑9 was investigated; CD‑PLLD/DOC/MMP‑9 complexes were phagocytized in reticuloendothelial systems, including the liver and spleen, which requires further study. Furthermore, the complexes did not cross the blood‑brain barrier due to their large molecular size, suggesting they may be relatively safe. Additionally, the complexes mediated increased DOC concentrations with prolonged blood circulation and EGFP expression in HNE‑1 tumors. These results suggest the future potential application of CD-PLLD/DOC/MMP-9 for NPC therapy.
