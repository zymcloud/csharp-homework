Aims:This study sought to extend the inclusion criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) liver transplantation (LT), particularly addressing the safety and effectiveness of pre-LT transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:Our study included 115 patients with HCC who underwent LT after TACE. The response measured after each TACE session was based on the mRECIST criteria: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). We defined CR and PR patients as responders (64 cases) and SD and PD patients as non-responders (51 cases).Results:The majority of responders could be identified after the first or second TACE sessions (57 cases, 89.1%). Overall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 95.3%, 89.1% and 75.0%, respectively, in the responder group, and these rates were much higher than those in the non-responder group (86.3%, 66.7% and 54.9%, P=0.016). In addition, the tumor-free survival rate in the responder group was also higher than in the non-responder group (P=0.009). In the responder group, a statistically improved long-term outcome was observed in patients whose HCC did not satisfy the Milan criteria (PConclusion:The response to TACE, particularly following the first two sessions, primarily and robustly predicted overall and tumor-free survival in HCC patients, particularly those whose HCC did not satisfy the Milan criteria.
