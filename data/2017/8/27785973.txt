Introduction:A new hypermetabolic lesion on 18FDG-PET/CT after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for distal esophageal cancer can be a hepatic metastasis and should be examined carefully before esophagectomy.Case-report:We present a case of acute and nodular radiation-induced injury of the left liver after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for distal esophageal cancer, which resembles a hepatic metastasis on 18FDG-PET/CT. Acute and nodular radiation hepatitis (RH) can be a potential cause of false-positive findings of malignancy and therefore exclude patients who could benefit from esophagectomy.Conclusion:18FDG-PET/CT images should therefore carefully be interpreted and compared with the radiation beams, dose distribution and eventually clarified by DW-MR imaging.
