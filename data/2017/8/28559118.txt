Introduction:Recently TRG, necrosis grade and the rate of viable cancer cells of colorectal liver metastases were correlated with the response to chemotherapy treatments, whereas K-RAS mutations and c-MET over-expression were correlated with the prognosis.Methods:58 resection specimens were assessed for regression grades. Patients undergone neo-adjuvant treatments were compared to patients who underwent therapy exclusively adjuvantly. We investigated the K-RAS mutational profile, the c-MET over-expression along with patients' survivals curves.Results:Patients undergone neo-adjuvant treatment presented significant higher fibrosis rates and lower rates of viable cells. 36.7% of the patients had a K-RAS mutation and the 26.7% presented c-MET over-expression, but these features did not correlate with patients' clinical/pathological data. Survival analysis documented that K-RAS WT patients presenting c-MET over-expression had worse outcomes.Conclusion:Fibrosis and the rate of viable cells significantly correlate with the response to chemotherapy treatments. c-MET is a promising marker in K-RAS WT patients.
