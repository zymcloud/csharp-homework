Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in innate and adaptive immunity, protecting the host from viral pathogens. Studies have implicated that TLR5 is associated with various diseases such as autoimmune and inflammation related diseases. However, little is known about the relationship between TLR5 and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We studied the effect of TLR5 gene polymorphisms on susceptibility to and disease progression of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection in Chinese. Blood samples were taken from 636 patients with CHB, HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 273 controls. Polymorphisms of TLR5 (1775A>G rs2072493 and 1846T>C rs5744174) were analyzed by PCR-based sequencing. No difference in genotypic and allelic frequencies of TLR5 rs2072493 and rs5744174 was observed between patients and controls. Significant difference was found in frequency of TLR5 rs5744174 TT genotype between men with CHB and LC (p = 0.035). Frequency of TT genotype of TLR5 rs5744174 in patients positive for HBeAg was increased from 53.2% in patients with CHB to 74.1% in those with HCC (p = 0.024). Our results indicate that in Chinese genetic variation of TLR5 may be not a determinant of susceptibility to HBV-related diseases but may play a role in development of HBV-related severe liver diseases.
