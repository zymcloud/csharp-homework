Background:To evaluate the course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after 90Y-radioembolization (RE) of liver malignancies and to identify prognosticators for liver-related adverse events and survival.Methods:In 34 consecutive patients with secondary or primary liver tumors scheduled for RE, the following cytokines were measured prior to and 2 h, 3 days, and 6 weeks after RE: interleukin (IL) -1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-γ. Liver function impairment was defined as an elevation of liver-related laboratory values as graded by CTCAE ≥ 2 and/or serum bilirubin ≥30 µmol/l and/or development of ascites at 6-week follow-up.Results:Significant changes over time were seen in IL-1 (increase from 0.4 pg/ml (±0.7) at baseline to 1.1 pg/ml (±1.4) 3 days after RE (p = 0.02)), and in IL-6 (increase from 16.8 pg/ml (±21.8) at baseline to 54.6 pg/ml (±78.2) 3 days after RE (p = 0.003)). Baseline values of IL-6 and IL-8 were independently associated with liver function impairment at follow-up as well as decreased survival with an optimal cutoff at 6.53 and 60.8 pg/ml, respectively.Conclusion:Expected changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after RE were shown. Furthermore, baseline values of IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with later liver dysfunction and survival. We hypothesize that these biomarkers are potential prognosticators and might help in patient selection for RE.
