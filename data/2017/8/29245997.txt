Objective:To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of combination treatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through a systematic review and network meta-analysis and to identify what is the best combination treatment with TACE.Materials and methods:A network meta-analysis was used to identify evidence from relevant randomized controlled trials. We searched databases for publications up to June 2017. The prespecified primary efficacy outcomes were treatment response and 6-month to 3-year overall survival (OS), while the secondary efficacy outcomes were 1- and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS); safety outcomes were advance effects of combination treatment. We conducted pairwise meta-analyses using a random-effects model and then performed random-effects network meta-analyses.Results:A total of 48 trials were eligible (50 analyses), involving 5627 patients and 19 treatment arms. In comparison with other types of combination therapy arms, network meta-analysis disclosed that TACE + three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, TACE + percutaneous ethanol injection, TACE + percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy, TACE + percutaneous acetic acid injection, and TACE + sorafenib were the more effective methods in treatment response, 6-month to 3-year OS, and 1-2 year DFS; the adverse effects of TACE + sorafenib were serious. The study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017071102.Conclusions:When considering the efficacy, combination therapy with TACE seemed to offer clear advantages for patients with unresectable HCC. TACE + Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, TACE + Percutaneous ethanol injection, TACE + Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy, and TACE + Percutaneous acetic acid injection are likely the best options to consider in the application of combination treatment.
