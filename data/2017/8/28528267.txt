Background:The obesity epidemic has significantly increased the incidence and severity of hepatic steatosis in liver surgery patients and liver donors, potentially impacting postoperative liver regeneration and function. Development of a non-invasive means to quantify hepatic steatosis would facilitate selection of candidates for liver resection and transplant donation.Methods:An IRB-approved protocol prospectively enrolled 28 patients with liver tumors requiring hepatic resection. In all patients, fast dual-echo gradient-echo MR images were acquired using 2-Point Dixon technique in 2D and 3D. The degree of steatosis was quantified by percent fat fraction (%FF) from in- and out-of-phase, and water-only and fat-only images. The technique-specific %FFs were compared to intraoperative and histopathological findings.Results:For patients with >30% steatosis by histology, the mean %FF was 22% (SD ± 5.2%) compared to a mean %FF of 5.0% (SD ± 2.1%, p = 0.0001) in patients with <30% steatosis. Using scaled values for the MR-calculated %FF, all patients with >30% pathologic steatosis could be identified preoperatively.Conclusions:Quantitative MRI identified patients with clinically-relevant steatosis with 100% accuracy. These findings could have significant impact on the management of liver resection patients and transplant donors.
