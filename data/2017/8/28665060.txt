Transplantation studies about the clinical differences according to the type of donors are mostly conducted in western countries with rare reports from Asians. The aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical impacts of the type of donor, and the predictors of 1-year mortality in patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT). This study was performed for liver transplant recipients between May 2010 and December 2014 at the Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital. A total of 185 recipients who underwent LT were analyzed. Of the 185 recipients, 109 (58.9%) belonged to the living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) group. The median age was 52.4 years. LDLT recipients had lower model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score compared with better liver function than deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) recipients (mean ± standard deviation [SD], 12.5 ± 8.3 vs. 24.9 ± 11.7, respectively; P
