Background Nivolumab demonstrates promising efficacy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and other malignancies. The clinical benefit of nivolumab, however, may be hampered by specific immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and little is known regarding nivolumab-related cholangitis. Methods A computerized search of our clinical database identified 3 metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with nivolumab-related cholangitis. All patients were treated with intravenous nivolumab monotherapy (3.0 mg/kg) every 2 weeks until disease progression or irAEs occurred. Clinical data regarding the duration of nivolumab treatment, symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, pathological findings of liver parenchyma biopsy specimens, and management of nivolumab-related cholangitis were analyzed. Results Our analysis revealed that nivolumab-related cholangitis was characterized by (1) localized extrahepatic bile duct dilation without obstruction; (2) diffuse hypertrophy of the extrahepatic bile duct wall; (3) a dominant increase in the biliary tract enzymes alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase relative to the hepatic enzymes aspartate and alanine aminotransferase; (4) normal or reduced levels of the serum immunological markers antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, smooth muscle antibody, and immunoglobulin G4; (5) the pathological finding of biliary tract cluster of differentiation 8-positive T cell infiltration from liver biopsy; and (6) a moderate to poor response to steroid therapy. Conclusions Nivolumab-related cholangitis is associated with distinct imaging and clinicopathological features that distinguish it from acute cholangitis of common etiologies and other immune-related cholangitis. Further studies are warranted to establish the optimal management of patients with this irAE.
