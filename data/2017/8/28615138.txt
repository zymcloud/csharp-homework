Background:The goal of this study was to compare the outcome after partial hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in which a margin less than or equal to 5 mm or greater than 5 mm was achieved.Methods:A review of our 3300-patient prospective HPB database was performed from 12/2002 to 4/2015. Patients were stratified into two groups: resection margins ≤5 ("narrow") and >5 mm ("wide") as measured on final pathologic assessment.Results:One-hundred thirty patients were included in the analysis (margin ≤5 mm, n = 41 and margin >5 mm, n = 89). At the time of analysis 54 patients had developed 56 recurrences, 15 (37%) in the narrow margin group and 41 (46%) in the wide margin group, p = 0.45. The pattern of recurrence was similar in the two groups: intrahepatic 11 (79%) versus 30 (75%), p = 1, and extra-hepatic 6 (43%) versus 17 (43%), p = 1. Median disease-free survival was similar in both groups, 18.1 versus 19.5 months (p = 0.85).Conclusions:A narrow resection margin (5 mm or less) does not detract from oncologic outcomes after partial hepatectomy for HCC. Tailoring resection margins may lead to greater preservation of hepatic parenchyma. Factors other than margin status represent the driving forces for local and systemic recurrence.
