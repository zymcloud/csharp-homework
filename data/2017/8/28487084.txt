Background:The present study is aimed at assessing the efficacy of oral contrast trans-abdominal ultrasonography (OCTU) as an initial screening tool for gastric cancer in rural areas of China.Methods:All subjects that were enrolled from Chongming County, Shanghai, China. Subjects in the symptomatic group underwent both OCTU and gastroscopic biopsy. OCTU was performed by experienced ultrasonic physicians in a blinded fashion.Results:In the symptomatic group, 643 patients were enrolled; diagnoses included low risk diseases gastritis (68.9%), polyps (4.0%) and benign ulcers (8.7%), and high risk diseases intraepithelial neoplasia (1.9%), cancer (15.9%) and other lesions (0.6%). Abnormalities were detected by OCTU in 404 subjects (62.8%). High risk diseases were significantly correlated with objective OCTU parameters, including thickness of stomach wall, loss of stratification and hypoechoic mess. With the cut-off value of thickness being set at 7mm, the sensitivity and specificity of OCTU for detecting high risk diseases were 81.3% and 68.8%, respectively. When cut-off value of risk index based on OCTU parameters was set at 3 points, the sensitivity and specificity were 94.1% and 71.4%, respectively.Conclusion:OCTU can detect high risk gastric diseases with high sensitivity and specificity providing an initial screening tool for gastric cancer.
