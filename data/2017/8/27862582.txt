Purpose:To evaluate whether whole-tumor histogram-derived parameters for an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could aid in assessing Ki-67 labeling index (LI) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:In all, 57 patients with HCC who underwent pretreatment MRI with a 3T MR scanner were included retrospectively. Histogram parameters including mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and percentiles (5th , 25th , 75th , 95th ) were derived from the ADC map and MR enhancement. Correlations between histogram parameters and Ki-67 LI were evaluated and differences between low Ki-67 (â‰¤10%) and high Ki-67 (>10%) groups were assessed.Results:Mean, median, 5th , 25th , 75th percentiles of ADC, and mean, median, 25th , 75th , 95th percentiles of enhancement of arterial phase (AP) demonstrated significant inverse correlations with Ki-67 LI (rho up to -0.48 for ADC, -0.43 for AP) and showed significant differences between low and high Ki-67 groups (P < 0.001-0.04). Areas under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve for identification of high Ki-67 were 0.78, 0.77, 0.79, 0.82, and 0.76 for mean, median, 5th , 25th , 75th percentiles of ADC, respectively, and 0.74, 0.81, 0.76, 0.82, 0.69 for mean, median, 25th , 75th , 95th percentiles of AP, respectively.Conclusion:Histogram-derived parameters of ADC and AP were potentially helpful for predicting Ki-67 LI of HCC.Level of evidence:3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J.
