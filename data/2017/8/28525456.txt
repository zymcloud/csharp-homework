We report a case of a 61-year-old man who had recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma admitted for series evaluation before Y selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT). Intra-arterial hepatic Tc macroaggregated albumin scan before Y-SIRT revealed a 2.7-cm incidental low-density thyroid nodule with hot uptake. TcO4 scan revealed corresponding hot uptake in the thyroid nodule with near background uptake of normal thyroid tissue, favored autonomous nodule. After Y-microsphere SIRT, bremstrallung imaging revealed no Y-microsphere deposition to thyroid.
