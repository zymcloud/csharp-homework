Specific RNAs can function as sinks for endogenous miRNAs, known as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Here, we confirm a miR-124 mediated ceRNA crosstalk between LAMC1 and CD151 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-124 negatively regulates LAMC1 expression through two miRNA binding sites within its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) and suppresses migration and invasion of HCC cells through regulating LAMC1. The wild type LAMC1 miRNA response elements (MREs) facilitate expression of CD151, and this regulation is miR-124 dependent. In clinical hepatic tissues, LAMC1 and CD151 mRNAs exhibit positive correlation. Importantly, LAMC1 MREs promote HCC malignancy by absorbing miR-124 and by assisting CD151 expression. We conclude that LAMC1 mRNA acts as a trans regulator to stimulate CD151 expression by competing for miR-124 binding in HCC cells. Â© 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(8):595-605, 2017.
