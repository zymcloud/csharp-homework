Background:Improved treatment options of HIV have resulted in regular physical activities of many HIV-infected patients. However, data on effects of sports in HIV-patients are scarce.Methods:21 HIV-infected persons were monitored prospectively while preparing for a marathon run. Multiple parameters with regard to immunology, quality of life and metabolism were measured at 4 time points (at baseline 1 year before the marathon run, 3 and 6 months after beginning of training, and immediately before marathon).Results:13 out of 21 participants completed the marathon (12 male, 1 female; median age 42 years [27-50]; CD4 = 620/μl [146-1268]; 11 were on ART since 3.5 years [1-7]). 8 participants ceased training early. All reasons for stopping (besides one pre-existing metatarsal fracture) were not regarded as training-related (e.g. time limitation n = 3; newly diagnosed anal cancer n = 1; personal reasons/unknown n = 3). We observed a significant increase in absolute CD4-T-cells (620/μl [146-1268] vs. 745 [207-1647]; p = 0.001) with simultaneous decrease of CD4-T-cell apoptosis (53% [47-64] vs. 32% [14-42]); p < 0.01). No effects on viral load independent of ART occurred. Systolic blood pressure and cholesterol improved significantly, although moderate and normal at baseline (cholesterol 185 mg/dl [98-250] vs. 167 [106-222], p = 0.02; RRsys 125 mmHg [100-145] vs. 120 [100-140], p = 0.01). Blood count, liver enzymes, creatinine and CK remained unchanged.Conclusions:The results of this pilot study indicated improved metabolic and immunologic parameters in HIV-infected patients undergoing moderate endurance training. Although training effects or ART cannot be ultimately separated as underlying mechanisms, we conclude that marathon training is safe for HIV-infected patients and potentially improves general health.Trial registration:DRKS00011592 (retrospectively registered on February 9th 2017).
