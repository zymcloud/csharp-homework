The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of esculetin on the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells and to determine the underlying mechanism behind this activity. An MTT assay was used to assess cell proliferation, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the relative mRNA expression levels of β-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1, and western blot analysis was utilized to determine the levels of the associated proteins. Compared with the dimethyl sulfoxide control, esculetin reduced the cell viability of SMMC-7721 and HL-7702 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment of SMMC-7721 cells with esculetin resulted in downregulation of the mRNA and protein levels of β-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1. Esculetin increased the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 and inhibited the proliferation of human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells by suppressing the Wnt signaling pathway. The results of the present study suggest that esculetin inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in SMMC-7721 cells and may have potential as an effective anti-cancer drug, acting to inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
