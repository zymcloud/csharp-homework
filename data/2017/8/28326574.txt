Aims:The scirrhous variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (S-HCC) and fibrolamellar HCC (FL-HCC) are less common subtypes of HCC that are characterized by abundant fibrous stroma. Here, we aimed to investigate differences in the tumour microenvironment and the tumour epithelial cell characteristics of S-HCC and FL-HCC.Methods and results:Whole tissue sections of 17 S-HCCs and 9 FL-HCCs were subjected to immunohistochemical stains for keratin 7 (K7), K19, EpCAM, CD56/NCAM, CD163, CD68, pSTAT3, FAP, CCN2 and Ki-67. FL-HCC patients were younger than S-HCC patients (P Conclusion:S-HCC and FL-HCC are subtypes of HCC with extensive fibrosis, and the nature of the fibrous stroma differs between them. While the stroma of FL-HCC is composed of dense lamellated collagenous bands with sparse cellular components, S-HCC demonstrates more abundant CAF and tumour-infiltrating macrophages and stemness-related marker expression, suggesting the presence of a complex tumour microenvironment that may influence the aggressive behaviour of S-HCCs.
