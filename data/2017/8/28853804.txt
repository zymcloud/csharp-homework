Benign focal liver lesions are a heterogeneous group of tumors of different cellular origin. They might develop from mesenchymal cells, hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. They are more often detected due to the increasing number of imaging investigations and the excellent performance of the new ultrasound machines. The imaging findings have to be interpreted while bearing the patient's clinical context in mind. The aim of this review is to discuss the three most frequent benign focal hepatic lesions : hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma.
