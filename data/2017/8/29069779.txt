Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) participates in multiple biological behaviors and plays an important role in regulating tumor invasion. However, the functions of MMP16 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The prognostic value of MMP16 was studied in TCGA database and validation cohort. MMP16-silencing HCC cells (HepG2 and HCCLM3) were used for evaluating cell proliferation and invasion by CCK-8 and Transwell assays. Our results showed that the MMP16 was a predictor for overall survival in patients with HCC (HR: 1.169, 95% CI: 1.034-1.321, P = 0.013) in TCGA database. In validation cohort, MMP16 expression was an independent predictor for survival in both univariate and multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). Furthermore, knockdown MMP16 weakened the cell invasive potential by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Therefore, our findings showed that MMP16 was a prognostic factor in HCC, ectopic MMP16 expression promoted invasion of HCC cells by inducing EMT process, suggesting a tumor oncogenic function in HCC and provides the potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
