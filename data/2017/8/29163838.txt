Controversies about the combination of des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosing still exist. Hence, we performed this updated meta-analysis to estimate the diagnostic value of DCP , AFP and DCP + AFP in HCC. In addition, we conducted a validation study to analyze the performance of the candidate makers. After a systematic literature review, 27 studies from 20 articles were identified from four major databases. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 69% and 89%, respectively, for DCP; for AFP, they were 65% and 88%, respectively; and they were 82% and 85%, respectively, for DCP + AFP. The values of the area under the curve (AUC) for DCP, AFP, DCP + AFP, respectively, were 0.88, 0.75, and 0.90. The validation study confirmed that the performance of DCP + AFP (sensitivity = 84%, specificity = 86%; AUC = 0.887) was higher than that of DCP (sensitivity = 76%, specificity = 92%; AUC = 0.843) or AFP (sensitivity = 73%, specificity = 92%; AUC = 0.837) alone.
