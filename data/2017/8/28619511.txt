Aquaporin 5 (AQP5), a transmembrane protein, is known for its involvement in the progress of many diseases such as chronic kidney disease and systemic disease. Recently, AQP5 has been reported to play an important role in cancer progression. However, little is known about its precise functions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the specific role of AQP5 in HCC. The results showed that AQP5 was highly expressed in HCC cell lines and its down-regulation inhibited HCC cell invasion and tumor metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, down-regulation of AQP5 suppressed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in HCC cells by modulating EMT-related molecules such as E-cadherin, α-catenin, N-cadherin and Vimentin. Further studies on corresponding mechanisms indicated that AQP5 down-regulation inhibited HCC metastasis and EMT partly via inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that AQP5 may be a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
