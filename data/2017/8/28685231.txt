TGFβ1 pathway antagonists have been considered promising therapies to attenuate TGFβ downstream signals in cancer cells. Inhibiting peptides, as P-17 in this study, are bound to either TGFβ1 or its receptors, blocking signal transduction. However, for efficient use of these TGFβ1antagonist as target therapeutic tools, improvement in their delivery is required. Here, a plasmid carrying specific shDNA (SHT-DNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the peptide (P-17) were loaded separately into folic acid (FA)-functionalized nano-carriers made of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The two building blocks of the carrier, (BSA and FA) were used because of the high affinity of albumin for liver and for the overexpression of folate receptors on the membrane of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The empty and the encapsulated carriers were thoroughly investigated to characterize their structure, to evaluate the colloidal stability and the surface functionalization. The entrapment of SHT-DNA, siRNA and P-17, respectively, was demonstrated by morphological and quantitative analysis. Finally, cellular studies were performed to assess the targeting efficiency of the hybrid carriers. These vectors were used because of the high affinity of albumin for liver and for the overexpression of folate receptors on the membrane hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The empty and the encapsulated carriers were thoroughly investigated to characterize their structure, to evaluate the colloidal stability and the surface functionalization. The entrapment of SHT-DNA, siRNA and P-17, respectively, was demonstrated by morphological and quantitative analysis. A novel fabrication of Hybrid Polymeric-Protein Nano-Carriers (HPPNC) for delivering TGF β1 inhibitors to HCC cells has been developed. SHT-DNA, siRNA and P-17 have been successfully encapsulated. TGF β1 inhibitors-loaded HPPNC were efficiently uptaken by HLF cells.
