Aim:To evaluate the incidence of adverse events and associated factors after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma within 30 days.Materials and methods:The early complications that occurred within 30 days after RFA at a single institution from January 2000 to July 2010 were reviewed in order to evaluate the morbidity, mortality, and risk factors associated with the complications. In total, 1,211 patients (845 men, 70.5%) with a mean age of 68 years (range, 27-88 years) underwent 1,843 RFA procedures.Results:The overall incidence rate of complications was 6.8% (125 cases). Major complications (n=36, 2%) included liver abscess (n=15, 0.8%), intraperitoneal bleeding (n=8, 0.4%), liver failure (n=5, 0.3%), variceal bleeding (n=3, 0.2%), haemothorax (n=2, 0.1%), cholecystitis (n=2, 0.1%), and bowel perforation (n=1, 0.1%). Among the minor complications (n=89, 4.8%), the most common was the post RFA syndrome accompanied by pain and fever (n=75, 4.1%). Other minor complications included significant pleural effusion (n=7, 0.4%), skin wound infection (n=4, 0.2%), and thermal injuries to the skin (n=3, 0.2%). Procedural infections significantly increased with tumour size (OR=1.379; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.191-1.579; pConclusions:RFA is a safe and effective local treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Careful selection of patients and appropriate RFA planning could decrease procedural mortality and morbidity.
