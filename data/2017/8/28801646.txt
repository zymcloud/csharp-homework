The nomogram of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) has accurate outcome prediction. This study aims to propose a treatment-integrated nomogram derived from BCLC for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 3,371 patients were randomly grouped into derivation (n = 2,247) and validation (n = 1,124) sets. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to generate the nomogram from tumor burden, cirrhosis, performance status (PS) and primary anti-cancer treatments. Concordance indices and calibration plots were used to evaluate the performance of nomogram. The derivation and validation sets had the same concordance index of 0.774 (95% confidence intervals: 0.717-0.826 and 0.656-0.874, respectively). In calibration plots, survival distributions predicted by the nomogram and observed by the Kaplan-Meier method were similar at 3- and 5-year for patients from derivation and validation sets. Validation group patients divided into 10 subgroups by the original and new treatment-integrated BCLC nomogram were used to evaluate the prognostic performance of integrating primary anti-cancer treatments. Compared to the nomogram of original BCLC system, the treatment-integrated nomogram of BCLC system had larger linear trend and likelihood ratio X2. In conclusion, based on the results of concordance index tests, integrating primary anti-cancer treatments into the BCLC system provides similar discriminatory ability.
