Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 3% of all adult malignancies. Usual sites of metastasis are lymph nodes, lungs, bone, liver and brain. We describe a patient who presented with complaints of holocranial headache and diplopia. MRI of the head showed a clival-based lesion with associated bony erosion. With suspicion of a metastatic lesion, an ultrasonogram of the abdomen was done which showed a left renal mass that enhanced on contrast-enhanced CT. There were no other metastatic foci. Patient underwent radiotherapy for the clival lesion. This case report emphasises on the evaluation of clival lesion with cranial neuropathies for a possibility of a renal primary tumour.
