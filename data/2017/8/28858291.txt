Objectives:Studies on the epidemiology of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in the Chinese population are lacking. We aimed to determine the epidemiology of PBC in Hong Kong (HK) with a population of 7.3 million.Methods:We retrieved data from the electronic database of the HK Hospital Authority, the only public healthcare provider in Hong Kong. PBC cases between 2000 and 2015 were identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 code. We estimated the age-/sex-adjusted incidence rate and prevalence of PBC, and analyzed the adverse outcomes (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplantation, and death).Results:One thousand and sixteen PBC patients aged â‰¥20 years were identified (female-to-male ratio 4:1; median age 60.6 years, interquartile range (IQR) 51.8-72.6 years; median follow-up 5.6 years, IQR 1.6-8.7 years). The average age/sex-adjusted annual incidence rate and prevalence were 8.4 per million person-years and 56.4 per million, respectively. Between 2000 and 2015, the age/sex-adjusted annual incidence rate increased from 6.7 to 8.1 per million person-years (Poisson P=0.002), while age/sex-adjusted prevalence increased from 31.1 to 82.3 per million (Poisson PConclusions:There is a considerable increase in the incidence and prevalence of PBC in the Chinese population over the past 16 years, with significant morbidity and mortality.
