Two novel silicon(IV) phthalocyanines bearing 1,3-bis[3(dimethylamino)phenoxy]propan-2-ol or 1,3-bis[3(diethylamino)phenoxy]propan-2-ol groups at their axial positions were synthesized. These phthalocyanines were converted into their water soluble derivatives by the quaternization reaction with methyl iodide. The quaternized phthalocyanines show excellent solubility aqueous solutions without any aggregation which makes them potential photosensitizers for use in photodynamic therapy (PDT). For this reason, the photophysical and photochemical properties such as fluorescence quantum yields, lifetimes, singlet oxygen generation and photodegradation of both non-ionic (3 and 5) and quaternized cationic silicon(IV) phthalocyanines were investigated. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of PDT was determined by colorimetric proliferation assay against to hepatocellular carcinoma (HuH-7) cancer cells. In this study, the cells were incubated with a novel water soluble silicon(IV) phthalocyanine derivatives and thereafter the cells were illuminated using broad-band incoherent light source.
