Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. However, current strategies curing HCC are far from satisfaction. The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved tumor suppressive pathway that plays crucial roles in organ size control and tissue homeostasis. Its dysregulation is commonly observed in various types of cancer including HCC. Recently, the prominent role of non-coding RNAs in the Hippo pathway during normal development and neoplastic progression is also emerging in liver. Thus, further investigation into the regulatory network between non-coding RNAs and the Hippo pathway and their connections with HCC may provide new therapeutic avenues towards developing an effective preventative or perhaps curative treatment for HCC. Herein we summarize the role of non-coding RNAs in the Hippo pathway, with an emphasis on their contribution to carcinogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of HCC.
