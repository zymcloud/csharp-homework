Background:When hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was located in segment 2 (S2), segment-oriented hepatectomy was more beneficial than left lateral sectionectomy as this type of anatomical resection preserved the volume of the nontumor-bearing segment. Herein, we presented 2 cases (1 with video) of laparoscopic anatomical S2 segmentectomy by the Glissonian approach.Methods:The first patient was a 69-year-old woman, who had an incidentally detected liver nodule on abdominal ultrasound for systemic surveillance for her breast cancer. The preoperative liver function was Child-Pugh class A. Abdominal computed tomography showed a 2 cm low attenuating lesion in S2. Contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the same lesion with features more suggestive of HCC. In view of the inconclusive imaging findings, a needle biopsy was performed and it confirmed the diagnosis of HCC. The second patient was a 57-year-old man with hepatitis B and Child-Pugh class B liver cirrhosis. He had an enlarging nonenhancing liver nodule in S2 noted on MRI. Laparoscopic anatomical S2 segmentectomy was performed for these 2 patients.Results:The operative time for the first and second patients was 240 and 185 minutes, respectively. The respective estimated intraoperative blood loss was 50 and 250 mL and no transfusion was necessary. The patients were discharged on the fourth and fifth postoperative day without any complications, respectively.Conclusion:This study showed the feasibility of performing a laparoscopic S2 segmentectomy by the Glissonian approach.
