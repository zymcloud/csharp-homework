Objective:The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and tolerability of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using polyethylene glycol (PEG) drug-elutable microspheres loaded with doxorubicin for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Subjects and methods:Forty-two patients with unresectable HCC, as determined by a tumor board, were assigned to undergo TACE and were treated with PEG drug-elutable embolics loaded with doxorubicin. Patients were prospectively enrolled and included 32 (76%) men and 10 (24%) women. Their median age was 65 years (range, 42-83 years). Patients were treated with 50 mg of doxorubicin loaded in 2 mL of PEG embolics (mean [± SD] diameter, 100 ± 25 µm) that were infused via a chemoembolization method. Data collected included previous cancer therapy, tumor size, number of lesions, history of TACE, tumor response (at 1, 3, and 6 months), type and intensity of adverse events, and quality of life (QOL) analysis.Results:One month after TACE, the overall tumor response rate was 79% (50% complete response, 29% partial response, 17% stable disease, and 5% progressive disease). At 3 months, the rates were 48% for complete response, 24% for partial response, 24% for stable disease, and 3% for progressive disease. At 6 months, the rates were 43% for complete response, 19% for partial response, 29% for stable disease, and 10% for progressive disease. TACE was well tolerated by all patients, with no evidence of procedure-related complications or systemic drug-related adverse events. Fever (33%), increase in transaminase level (17%), and pain (33%) were the most frequent adverse events, and their intensity was mostly mild (grades 1 and 2). The QOL scores were 80 at 1 month, 81 at 3 months, and 82 at 6 months after TACE.Conclusion:These data suggest that PEG embolics are efficacious and safe for the treatment of HCC, as indicated by their good tolerability, QOL scores, and high tumor response.
