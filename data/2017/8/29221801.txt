Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) severely restricts the long-term survival of patients. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been considered to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis and metastasis. Additionally, there is a study demonstrating the significant association between TLR4 gene rs1927914 polymorphism and HCC, but no study investigated the association of the TLR4 rs1927914 polymorphism with the risk of HCC recurrence following LT.Aim:The purpose of this study was to assess the potential association between the TLR4 gene rs1927914 polymorphism of donors and recipients and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after LT.Methods:Eighty-three patients with HCC undergoing LT from July 2006-June 2015 were identified for this analysis. We genotyped a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs1927914) in both donors and recipients and evaluated the association between the polymorphism and risk of tumor recurrence.Results:The donor TLR4 rs1927914 polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with HCC recurrence following LT. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, Milan criteria, microvascular invasion and donor TLR4 rs1927914 genotype were confirmed to be independent risk factors for HCC recurrence. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients carrying donors homozygous TT had a significantly lower recurrence-free survival and overall survival than CC/CT patients. Cox proportional hazards modeling indicated that TNM stage or Milan criteria, microvascular invasion, and donor TLR4 rs1927914 genotype were independent factors for the clinical outcomes of LT patients.Conclusions:Donor TLR4 rs1927914 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of HCC recurrence following LT and has a potential clinical value for the prediction of HCC recurrence after LT.
