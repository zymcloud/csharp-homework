Background:Disparities in receipt of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance contribute to disparities in overall survival outcomes.Aim:We aim to evaluate disparities in receipt of routine HCC surveillance among patients with cirrhosis in a large urban safety-net hospital.Methods:Consecutive adults (age ≥ 18) with cirrhosis from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015, were retrospectively evaluated to determine rates of receiving appropriate HCC surveillance within 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis of cirrhosis. Rates of HCC surveillance were stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and liver disease etiology. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to evaluate for predictors of receiving appropriate HCC surveillance.Results:Among 157 cirrhosis patients enrolled [hepatitis C virus (HCV): 29.9%, hepatitis B virus: 13.4%, alcoholic cirrhosis: 44.6%, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): 8.9%], mean age of cirrhosis diagnosis was 53.8 ± 9.0 years. Among these patients, 49% received (n = 77) HCC surveillance within 6 months and 78% (n = 123) were surveyed within 1 year of cirrhosis diagnosis. On multivariate analyses, patients with NASH cirrhosis were significantly less likely to receive HCC surveillance compared with chronic HCV cirrhosis patients (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19-0.99, p Conclusion:Among a diverse safety-net hospital population, sub-optimal HCC surveillance rates were observed: Only 49% of cirrhosis patients received HCC surveillance within 6 months, and 78% of cirrhosis patients received HCC surveillance within 1 year. Differences in rates of HCC screening by liver disease etiology were observed.
