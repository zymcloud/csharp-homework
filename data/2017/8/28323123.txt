Background & aims:Identifying target genetic mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for therapy is made challenging by intratumoral heterogeneity. Circulating cell-free DNAs (cfDNA) may contain a more complete mutational spectrum compared to a single tumor sample. This study aimed to identify the most efficient strategy to identify all the mutations within heterogeneous HCCs.Methods:Whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted deep sequencing (TDS) were carried out in 32 multi-regional tumor samples from five patients. Matched preoperative cfDNAs were sequenced accordingly. Intratumoral heterogeneity was measured using the average percentage of non-ubiquitous mutations (present in parts of tumor regions). Profiling efficiencies of single tumor specimen and cfDNA were compared. The strategy with the highest performance was used to screen for actionable mutations.Results:Variable levels of heterogeneity with branched and parallel evolution patterns were observed. The heterogeneity decreased at higher sequencing depth of TDS compared to measurements by WES (28.1% vs. 34.9%, pConclusions:TDS of single tumor specimen could identify actionable mutations targets for therapy in HCC. cfDNA may serve as secondary alternative in profiling HCC genome.Lay summary:Targeted deep sequencing of single tumor specimen is a more efficient method to identify mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma made from mixed subtypes compared to circulating cell-free DNA in blood. cfDNA may serve as secondary alternative in profiling HCC genome. Identifying mutations may help clinicians choose targeted therapy for better individual treatments.
