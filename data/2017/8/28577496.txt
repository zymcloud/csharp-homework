The toxic liver impairment caused by free radical injury or excessive reactive oxigen species (ROS) formation could be effectivelly attenuated by natural antioxidants. The present study aimed to explore and compare the hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of free and encapsulated quercetin in in vitro and in vivo models of hepatotoxicity. Thus, quercetin was encapsulated in chitosan/alginate nanoparticles by gelation method. Both empty and quercetin-loaded nanoparticles revealed good safety profile in vitro, determined by the lack of cytotoxicity in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The pretreatment of HepG2 cells with encapsulated quercetin (10μg/ml) significantly attenuated the decrease in cell viability in H2О2-induced oxidative stress (0.1mM H2О2), thus showing an effective in vitro protection. In vivo evaluation of the antioxidant and hepatoprotective potential of free and encapsulated quercetin was performed in a model of paracetamol - induced liver injury in male Wistar rats. The oral pretreatment with encapsulated quercetin (0.18mg/kg b.w., 7days) significantly diminished the increased levels of serum transaminases ALT and AST, attenuated the lipid peroxidation and restored the levels of gluthation (a marker of cell antioxidant defence system). The protective effects of quercetin encapsulated in chitosan-based nanoformulation were superior to those of free quercetin. The results of the study suggest that the encapsulation of quercetin in chitosan/alginate nanoformulations might represent an effective therapeutic approach against oxidative stress induced liver injury.
