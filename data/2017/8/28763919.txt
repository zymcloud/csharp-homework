Objective: To estimate the cancer incidence and mortality in Jiangsu, 2013. Methods: Up to June 2016, registration data in 2013 from 35 cancer registries in Jiangsu was collected by Jiangsu Provincial Central Cancer Registry. All data were checked and evaluated by the method and criteria of data quality control making by the National Central Cancer Registry, data from 34 registries' data were eligible and accepted as pooled data. Stratified by urban and rural, gender, age and cancer site, crude incidence/mortality rate, age-specific incidence/mortality rate, age-standardized incidence/mortality rate by Chinese standard population, age-standardized incidence/mortality rate by world standard population, composition, cumulative incidence/mortality rate (0-74 age years old) and the 10 leading cancers were calculated. Cancer incidence and mortality were estimated by using provincial population of Jiangsu in 2013. Chinese population census in 2000 and World Segi's population were used to age-standardize incidence and mortality. Results: All 34 cancer registries (10 in urban and 24 in rural areas) covered a total of 38 938 470 population (19 682 921 in males and 19 255 549 in females), accounted for 51.12% of whole provincial population in 2013. It was estimated that new cancer cases and cancer deaths were 232.6 thousands (136.7 thousands in males and 95.9 thousands in females) and 155.3 thousands (99.7 thousands in males and 55.6 thousands in females), respectively. The crude incidence rate in Jiangsu in 2013 was 305.22/100 000, age-standardized incidence rate by Chinese standard population and by world standard population were 184.04/100 000 and 181.16/100 000, respectively, with cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) of 21.38%. The crude mortality rate was 203.94/100 000, age-standardized mortality rate by Chinese standard population and by world standard population were 116.28/100 000 and 115.12/100 000, respectively, with cumulative mortality rate (0-74 age years old) of 13.11%. Cancers of lung, esophagus, stomach, liver, colorectum and female breast were the most common cancers in Jiangsu, accounting for about 71% of all new cancer cases in 2013. Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer were the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for about 74% of all cancer deaths. Conclusion: The crude incidence and mortality rate of cancer in Jiangsu Province were at a high level. For the most common cancers such as lung, esophagus, stomach, liver, colorectum and female breast cancer, effective prevention and control activities should be strengthened.
