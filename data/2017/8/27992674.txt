Background and aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and aggressive cancers in the world. However, there remains a lack of effective diagnostic and treatment markers. We aimed to explore metastasis-associated protein 3 (MTA3) expression and function in HCC and its relationship with clinicopathological factors.Methods:We investigated the expression pattern and clinicopathological significance of MTA3 in 90 patients with HCC via immunohistochemistry and explored MTA3 function via gene knockdown of MTA3.Results:MTA3 was overexpressed in HCC cell nuclei and downregulated in HCC cell cytoplasm. The former finding correlated with metastasis (P = 0.010) and poor prognosis (P = 0.018). In addition, deleting MTA3 inhibited HCC cell growth, invasion, and metastasis in vitro, as shown in the colony formation, migration, and wound-healing assays.Conclusions:These results indicate that MTA3 is an oncogene of HCC, predicts poor prognosis of HCC, and may be a future marker of HCC treatment.
