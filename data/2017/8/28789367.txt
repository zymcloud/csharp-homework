α-taxilin is a binding partner of syntaxins, which are the central coordinators of membrane traffic. Expression of α-taxilin has been implicated in the development of human glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. In the present study, the clinical significance of α-taxilin expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) was investigated. A total of 20 cases of colorectal intramucosal adenocarcinoma (IMA) with adenoma were analyzed using immunohistochemical analysis. The results demonstrated that α-taxilin expression was significantly associated with Ki-67 indices in adenoma and IMA. The patients expressed equally high levels of α-taxilin in the upper third of the intramucosal glands. These results suggest that α-taxilin expression is significantly associated with the proliferative activity of CRC, but that its overexpression alone is not a biomarker of malignancy. Next, α-taxilin expression was investigated in 57 advanced CRCs and its association with prognosis was determined. Well-differentiated and/or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas in the left-sided colon with anatomic stage II and/or III were analyzed. α-taxilin expression levels were high on the surface of nearly all tumors, but variable at the deep advancing edge. α-taxilin levels at the advancing edge were not significantly associated with local invasiveness or prognosis. In conclusion, α-taxilin is a cell proliferation marker in colorectal epithelial neoplasms but cannot be a marker of malignancy or prognosis of CRCs.
