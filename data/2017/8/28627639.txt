Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the primary and most frequently occurring type of malignant liver cancer, accounting for 70-85% of total liver cancer cases worldwide. It has previously been demonstrated that the aberrant expression of microRNAs (miR) contributes to carcinogenesis and progression of various human malignancies, including HCC. However, mechanisms underlying the differential expression and specific roles of miR‑187 in HCC remain to be elucidated, particularly regarding how the modulation of malignant phenotypes in HCC cells occurs. The present study demonstrated that miR‑187 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Restoration of miR‑187 expression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HCC. Furthermore, insulin‑like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF‑1R) was demonstrated to act as a direct target gene of miR‑187 in HCC. IGF‑1R knockdown mimicked the effects of miR‑187 overexpression in HCC, resulting in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR‑187 acted as a tumor suppressor in HCC progression via direct targeting of IGF‑1R. miR‑187 may therefore exhibit the potential to act as a novel and therapeutic target for HCC treatment in the future.
