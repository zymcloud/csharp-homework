The SASH1 gene is discovered as a tumor suppressor recently. However, the molecular mechanisms of SASH1 in hepatocarcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In present studies, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of SASH1 on cell invasion and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma in vivo and in vitro. In this study, SASH1 overexpression HCC cell lines were treated with purmorphamine (0, 0.5, 1, 2Î¼mol/l). Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to examine the related gene expression of EMT markers and the Shh-Gli1 and PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by Transwell assay. In addition, a mice SASH1 overexpression HCC orthotopic xenograft model was established and treated with purmorphamine or 740Y-P or PDGF. Tumor volume was assessed, and H&E staining was applied to histopathologic analysis. The results showed that purmorphamine exposure significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of Shh and Gli1 in a dose-dependent manner in the SASH1 overexpression HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. Besides, purmorphamine promoted the migration and invasion of SASH1 overexpression HCC cells, as well as the EMT progress. Moreover, purmorphamine significantly increased the synthesis of PI3K and pAkt in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the invasion and migration abilities were also improved by treatment with 740Y-P or PDGF in the SASH1 overexpression HCC cells. Additionally, the agonists promoted tumor growth and intrahepatic and pulmonary metastasis of the orthotopic transplantation tumors grown from SASH1 overexpression HCC cells in vivo. In conclusion, SASH1 may inhibit hepatocarcinoma cell invasion and metastasis through down-regulating the Shh-Gli1 and PI3K-AKT pathways in vivo and in vitro.
