Background:Postoperative ascites is a common complication after liver resection. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for ascites in patients after liver resection and the relationship between postoperative ascites and other complications.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed data that were obtained from 266 patients who underwent liver resection for treating hepatocellular carcinoma between 2008 and 2015. Postoperative ascites was defined as a daily ascitic fluid drainage exceeding 500 mL on postoperative day 3 or later. The participants were categorized and analyzed with respect to the presence or absence of postoperative ascites.Results:Overall, 17 (6.4%) patients developed postoperative ascites. A multivariate analysis identified that three significant factors-serum albumin, platelet count, and operation duration-were associated with the development of postoperative ascites. Sixteen (94.1%) of the 17 patients with postoperative ascites experienced other associated complications. The patients with ascites had more pleural effusion (70.6 vs. 17.7%, P Conclusions:Postoperative ascites frequently occurred in patients with decreased liver functional reserve. Moreover, the presence of ascites was associated with significantly increased pleural effusion rates, and postoperative hospital stay duration was significantly prolonged.
