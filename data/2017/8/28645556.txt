Introduction:To assess the outcomes from multidisciplinary board meetings (MDM) for patients with breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM) and identify prognostic factors for survival.Materials and methods:A retrospective review of MDM records for patients referred with BCLM to a tertiary centre between 2005 and 2016. Patient demographics, clinicopathological factors and intervention type were analysed to find predictive factors for overall survival.Results:61 patients with BCLM were referred to the MDM. Treatment pathways included surgical resection (n = 23), radiofrequency ablation (RFA, n = 11), or chemotherapy (n = 27). Surgical resection patients had an improved median overall survival compared to chemotherapy (49 v 20mo; p < 0.001). RFA showed comparable survival benefit (37 v 20mo; p = 0.011). Resection and RFA showed no significant difference in survival over one another (49 v 37mo; p = 0.854). Survival analysis identified that resection (p = 0.002) and RFA (p = 0.001) were associated with improved overall survival compared to chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis identified extrahepatic disease (HR = 14.21; p = 0.044) and R0 resection (HR = 0.068; p = 0.023) as prognostic factors.Conclusions:Surgical resection of BCLM may improve the overall survival in selected patient groups. This study identifies a cohort of patients, without extrahepatic disease and responsive to chemotherapy, who may particularly benefit from surgery.
