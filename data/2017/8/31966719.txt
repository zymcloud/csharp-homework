Background:The death after liver transplantation (LT) was most commonly caused by HCC recurrence. Golgi protein 73 (GP73), a type II Golgi membrane protein, has been proved to be a better serum marker for HCC.Objective:This study aims to clarify the relationship between serum GP73 levels and tumor recurrence as well as survival of HCC patients after LT.Methods:Between November 2003 and July 2008, serum samples from 60 liver transplantation patients and 72 healthy individuals were collected. ELISA and microparticle enzyme immunoassay were used to measure serum GP73 and AFP levels. Patient survival was analyzed using log-rank test along with Kaplan-Meier method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to analyze the diagnostic value of serum GP73 levels. Cox regression was utilized to analyze prognostic factors with multiple variables.Results:Serum GP73 concentrations in HCC patients were much higher than that in healthy controls (PConclusion:Serum GP73 levels could be used to predict tumor recurrence and survival in HCC sufferers after LT.
