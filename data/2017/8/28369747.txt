Angiogenesis marks the transformation of a benign local tumor into a life-threatening disease. Many in vitro assays are available on two-dimensional (2D) platforms, however, limited research has been conducted to investigate the behavior of tumors and endothelial cells (ECs) grown on three-dimensional (3D) platforms. This study provides a 3D co-culture spheroid of tumor cells with ECs to study the interplay between ECs and tumor cells. In a 3D co-culture with HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, ECs differentiate to form tubule networks when in co-culture. Addition of angiogenic factors or angiogenesis inhibitors to the model system enhanced or inhibited endothelial differentiation in the 3D model, enabling investigations of the cellular signaling pathways utilized in HCC development. The 3D model demonstrated similar protein expression levels as a HCC xenograft, as well as exhibited upregulation of essential signaling proteins such as Akt/mTor in the 3D model, which is not reflected in the 2D model. The effects of several anti-angiogenic agents, such as sorafenib, sunitinib, and axitinib were analyzed in the 3D co-culture model by utilizing fluorescent proteins and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based caspase-3 sensor in the ECs, which can detect apoptosis in real time. The apoptotic capability of a drug to inhibit angiogenesis in the 3D model can be easily distinguished via the FRET sensor, and dual screening of anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor drugs can be achieved in a single step via the 3D co-culture model. In summary, a 3D co-culture model is constructed, where a HCC tumor microenvironment with a hypoxic core and true gradient penetration of drugs is achieved for drug screening purposes and in vitro studies utilizing a small HCC tumor.
