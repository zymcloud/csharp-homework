Low fusion efficiency and nominal activity of fusion cells (FCs) restrict the clinical application of dendritic cell (DC)/tumor fusion cells. Collagen I (Col I) is an interstitial collagen with a closely-knit structure used to repair damaged cell membranes. This study evaluated whether Col I could improve the fusion efficiency of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induction and enhance the immunogenicity of fusion vaccine. DC/B16 melanoma and controlled DC/H22 hepatoma cell fusions were induced by PEG with or without Col I. Col I/PEG treatment increased the levels of DC surface molecules and the secretion of lactate, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in fusion cells. Col I/PEG-treated FCs enhanced T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. The Col I-prepared fusion vaccine obviously suppressed tumor growth and prolonged mice survival time. Thus Col I treatment could significantly improve the efficiency of PEG-induced DC/tumor fusion and enhance the anticancer activity of the fusion vaccine. This novel fusion strategy might promote the clinical application of DC/tumor fusion immunotherapy.
