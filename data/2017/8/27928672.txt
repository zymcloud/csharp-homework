Background:Laparoscopic hepatectomy is a common procedure that has been reported frequently [1-3]. However, laparoscopic resection of tumors located in hepatic segments 5 and/or 8 remains a technically difficult procedure as it requires two transection planes [4]. Furthermore, there are a greater number of hepatic vein and glissonian pedicle branches that require a division as compared to other hepatectomy operations. In this report, we present a pure laparoscopic right anterior sectionectomy (RAS) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Preoperative imaging showed HCC (3 cm Ã— 4 cm) in segment 5 [5]. After selective anterior segment inflow occlusion, transection lines were demarcated. Complete Pringle maneuver was performed for 15 min intervals five times during hepatic parenchymal transection. The Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator was used for the transection of the hepatic tissue. Small hepatic vein branches along the middle and right hepatic veins and small glissonian pedicles were clipped, sealed and divided with EnSEAL (TM) (Ethicon). iDrive (TM) Ultra Powered Stapling device (Medtronic) was used for the division of tertiary glissonian pedicles. Hanging maneuver was performed for transection of remaining liver parenchyma after complete division of hepatic venous branches. The specimen was removed through the lower abdominal transverse incision using the endocatch bag. Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the operative field. All work was performed with IRB approval.Results:Pure laparoscopic RAS for HCC was performed successfully without intraoperative complications or transfusions. The operation time was 300 min, and the estimated blood loss was Conclusions:Pure laparoscopic RAS is a feasible operative procedure in patients with tumors located in hepatic segments 5/8.
