An anticancer compound, triterpene glycoside, was isolated from Holothuria nobilis Selenka. Its chemical structure and configuration were determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The novel active compound was identified as nobiliside D, with the molecular formula C40H61O17SNa and chemical name 3-O-[-β-D-pyranosyl (1-2)-4'-O-sulfon-ate-β-D-xylopyranosyl]-alkoxy-9-ene-3β, 12α, 17α, 25β-4 alcohol. An antitumor test was performed using xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis. Nobiliside D exhibited inhibitory effects on human leukemic cell line K562, human leukemia cell line U937, human lung cancer cell line A-549, human cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa, human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and human liver carcinoma cell line HepG2. Nobiliside exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on K562 and MCF-7 cells with an IC50 of 0.83±0.14 and 0.82±0.11 µg/ml, respectively. When human tumor cell lines K562 and MCF-7 were treated by nobiliside D (0.5 µg/ml) for 24 h, 45.8% of K562 cells and 58.7% of MCF-7 cells were apoptotic, whereas only 0.5% of un-treated control cells were apoptotic. These data indicate the compound should offer potential as a novel drug for the treatment of a range of cancers.
