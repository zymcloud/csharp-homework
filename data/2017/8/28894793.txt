Background:Infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma with macrovascular invasion is a relatively rare presentation and usually fatal disease.Methods:Both patients exceeded Milan and University of California-San Francisco (UCSF) criteria, and per Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer group guidelines, they were enrolled in a prospective open-label radioembolization phase II trial that gave them optimized lobar doses of Yttrium-90 as solely the first-line therapy without concomitant or additional pharmacological or locoregional therapies.Results:Three months after radioembolization, the patients demonstrated no residual viable disease on surveillance imaging. The patients were then followed up with serial imaging for 2 years in 3-month intervals, without documenting recurrence or extrahepatic disease. Finally, both patients underwent transplantation and after more than 20 months of imaging surveillance, no locoregional or systemic recurrence have been observed.Conclusions:We present, to our knowledge, the first 2 reports of transplantation after successfully downstaging infiltrative disease with portal vein tumoral thrombosis, which traditionally poses as a relative contraindication for resection or transplantation.
