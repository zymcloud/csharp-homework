The present article describes a structurally novel natural product of the paulomycin family, designated as paulomycin G (1), obtained from the marine strain Micromonospora matsumotoense M-412, isolated from Cantabrian Sea sediments collected at 2000 m depth during an oceanographic expedition to the submarine Avil√©s Canyon. Paulomycin G is structurally unique since-to our knowledge-it is the first member of the paulomycin family of antibiotics lacking the paulomycose moiety. It is also the smallest bioactive paulomycin reported. Its structure was determined using HRMS and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. This novel natural product displays strong cytotoxic activities against different human tumour cell lines, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MiaPaca_2), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2). The compound did not show any significant bioactivity when tested against a panel of bacterial and fungal pathogens.
