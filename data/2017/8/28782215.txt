Many patients with chronic disease do not possess the knowledge and skills required to access and interpret appropriate health information. A pilot study in people with liver cirrhosis (n = 50) identified that only 54% of patients could recall being given written information by a clinician and 64% had self-sought information, most commonly using the Internet. Many patients reported difficulties understanding the material and the majority wanted more accessible information. A pilot chronic disease educational booklet was well received by the study participants with 85% reporting it was helpful and 78% using it in between clinic appointments.
