Spinal metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) require high-dose irradiation for durable pain and tumor control. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) enables the delivery of high-dose radiation. However, but vertebral compression fracture (VCF) can be problematic. The aim of his study is to evaluate the outcome and risk of VCF after SABR for spinal metastasis from HCC. We retrospectively reviewed 33 lesions in 42 spinal segments from 29 patients who received SABR with 1 fraction (16-20 Gy), or 3 fractions (18-45 Gy) from September 2009 to January 2015. The 1-year local control (LC) rate was 68.3%. Radiographic grade of cord compression (RGCC) was the only independent prognostic factor associated with LC (P = 0.007). The 1-year ultimate LC rate including the outcome of salvage re-irradiation was 87.2%. The pain response rate was 73.3% according to the categories of the International Bone Metastases Consensus Group. The 1-year VCF-free rate was 71.5%. Pre-existing VCF (P < 0.001) and only-lytic change (P = 0.017) were associated with a higher post-SABR VCF rate. One-third of post-SABR VCFs required interventions. SABR for spinal metastases from HCC provided efficacious LC, especially for lesions with RGCC â‰¤ II, and showed effective and durable pain relief. As VCF after SABR occurred frequently for vertebral segments with pre-existing VCF and only-lytic change, early preventive vertebroplasty is considerable for those high-risk vertebral segments.
