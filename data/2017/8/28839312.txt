Objective:To review the early outcomes of hepatic resection at our hospital.Methods:This study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 2008 to December 2015, and comprised patients who underwent hepatic resection. We analysed the pathology, magnitude of hepatic resection and short-term outcomes in the patients. Mean and standard deviations were used to describe categorical data whereas frequencies and proportions to describe quantitative data. Univariate analysis was done to look at the factors associated with morbidity, mortality and blood loss during surgery. SPSS 19 was used for data analysis.Results:Of the 75 participants, 43(57.3%) were males and 32(42.7%) were females. The overall mean age was 52Â±14 years. Besides, 37(49.3%) patients underwent hepatic resection for underlying hepatocellular carcinoma, with 30(81%) of them being cirrhotic. Major hepatectomy (>3 segments) was performed in 30(40%) patients. Postoperative complications were observed in 30(40%) patients including postoperative liver failure in 3(4%) patients. The presence of one or more co-morbid conditions had a statistically significant association with postoperative morbidity (p=0.018). Mortality rate at 30days and 90days were 3(4%) and 5(6.7%), respectively.Discussion:Morbidity, mortality and blood loss were comparatively higher in cirrhotic patients.
