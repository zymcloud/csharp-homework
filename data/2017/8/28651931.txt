A growing amount of literature has indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important factors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. However, the significance of lncRNAs in the progression and prognosis of liver cancer is largely unknown. In the present study, upregulated lncRNA LOC90784 was identified through integrative analysis of GSE58043 and GSE55191. Furthermore, associations between LOC90784 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients were analyzed with a validated cohort 1 and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort 2. We investigated the mechanisms by which this highly expressed lncRNA promotes HCC proliferation, invasion and migration via qRT-PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) staining, siRNA transfection, cell proliferation assays, Transwell and colony formation assays, flow cytometry analysis and Western blot. The results showed that LOC90784 expression levels were significantly higher in HCC cell lines and tissues and mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Knockdown of lncRNA LOC90784 expression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by promoting Bax and repressing CDK4 and Cyclin D1 protein expression; it also inhibited invasion and migration by repressing MMP2 and MMP9 expression in HCC cells. LOC90784 overexpression was associated with poor clinical features in the two cohorts and poor overall survival rates in HCC patients with clear resection margins (R0) in cohort 2. These results indicated that LOC90784 upregulation may be a critical oncogene and potential new biomarker in HCC.
