Temozolomide (TMZ) is used to treat adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported among patients using TMZ. The objective of the study was to assess the relation, if any, between exposure to TMZ and serious acute liver injury (SALI). We used the HealthCore Integrated Research Database to perform a case-control study nested within a retrospective cohort of adult patients aged 18-100 years with at least two diagnoses of brain cancer anytime between 2006 and 2014. Patients without continuous eligibility or with a SALI diagnosis within 6 months prior to the date of incident brain cancer diagnosis were excluded. Medical records were sought for potential SALI cases and reviewed by two hepatologists. Five controls were selected for each case using incidence density sampling, matched on age and calendar year of index date. The analysis included 61 confirmed SALI cases and 305 selected controls. Exposure to TMZ was classified according to dispensing date and days supply of medication dispensed. We estimated odds ratios using conditional logistic regression models. The odds ratio for any exposure to TMZ was 0.91 (95% CI 0.44-1.91), for recent exposure to TMZ was 0.62 (95% CI 0.21-1.85). There was no increased risk of SALI with increasing duration of exposure to TMZ. When patients with unconfirmed SALI were included in the analysis, results were similar (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.70-1.54). In conclusion, this study did not find an association between TMZ and SALI risk among patients with brain cancer.
