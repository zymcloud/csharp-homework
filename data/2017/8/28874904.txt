Hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) arising from a hepatic adenoma is a rare phenomenon accounting for fewer than 5% of hcc cases; it seldom recurs after resection of the primary tumour. We report a case of extrahepatic metastasis of hcc arising from a hepatic adenoma that presented as a solitary sternal metastasis without any evidence of intrahepatic recurrence. Our patient was initially treated with radiation therapy and bland embolization, without response. Subsequently, the patient developed progressive disease while taking sorafenib. He later received chemotherapy with docetaxel and gemcitabine, with the development of multiple pulmonary and splenic nodules. However, he remained free of intrahepatic recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of extrahepatic metastasis of hcc arising from a hepatic adenoma without evidence of intrahepatic recurrence.
