Purpose:To investigate the ability of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) to down-stage unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) to resectable lesions, as well as the factors associated with achieving such down-staging.Methods:The study cohort comprised 120 patients diagnosed with stage I-IVA IHCC between 2001 and 2012. Of these patients, 56 underwent surgery and 64 received CRT as their initial treatment. The rate of curative resections for patients who received CRT was assessed, and the locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of these patients were compared to those of patients who underwent CRT alone.Results:Median follow-up was 36 months. A partial response after CRT was observed in 25% of patients, whereas a biologic response (a >70% decrease of CA19-9) was observed in 35%. Eight patients (12.5%) received curative resection after CRT and showed significantly improved LRFFS and OS compared to those treated with CRT alone (3-year LRFFS: 50 vs. 15.7%, respectively, p = 0.03; 3‑year OS: 50 vs. 11.2%, respectively, p = 0.012); these rates were comparable to those of patients who received initial surgery. Factors associated with curative surgery after CRT were gemcitabine administration, higher radiotherapy dose (biological effective dose ≥55 Gy with α/β = 10), and a >70% reduction of CA19-9.Conclusion:Upfront CRT could produce favorable outcomes by converting unresectable lesions to resectable tumors in selected patients. Higher radiotherapy doses and gemcitabine-based chemotherapy yielded a significant reduction of CA19-9 after CRT; patients with these characteristics had a greater chance of curative resection and improved OS.
