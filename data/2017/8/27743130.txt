Purpose:Alcoholic liver disease or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are well-known risk factors for liver fibrosis or cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; it is a major global health concern, but there are few effective and safe management options. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of fermented garlic extracts (FGEs) on hepatic function in adults with mild hepatic dysfunction without underlying hepatic disease.Methods:In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, seventy-five adults with elevated serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels were included in a FGE-administered group (n = 36) or a placebo group (n = 39), and received either two sachets/day containing FGEs or placebo over a 12-week period. Primary endpoint was the change in serum GGT levels. Data were analysed using a generalized linear mixed effects model.Results:Significant group Ã— time interactions for serum levels of GGT (F = 3.98, P = 0.022) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT; F = 3.28, P = 0.043) were observed with an improvement in levels of GGT (P = 0.066) and ALT (P = 0.014) in the FGE group compared to that reported for the placebo group at the 12-week visits. There was no intergroup difference in the prevalence of adverse events.Conclusions:Intake of FGEs improved serum GGT and ALT levels in adults with mildly elevated serum GGT level without reported adverse side effects. FGEs might be effective and safe management options for mild hepatic dysfunction.
