Aim:To evaluate the effects of HepaSphere 50-100 Î¼m (Merit Medical) as a doxorubicin carrier and embolization agent for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:A prospective analysis of 18 patients recruited from a national cancer center was conducted. This analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of HepaSphere, as expressed by the treatment response rate (measured by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, mRECIST) and by the prevalence of treatment-related adverse events, respectively.Results:The cohort was predominantly male, with a mean age of 69 years. The objective response rate (complete + partial response) was 53.3%. The variable most likely to be associated with objective response was Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging. The most prevalent adverse events were nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.Conclusion:HepaSphere chemoembolization yielded a substantial objective response rate with an acceptable toxicity profile and should be considered an option for HCC treatment.
