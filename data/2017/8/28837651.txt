Background:The VEGF gene polymorphism rs699947 related to clinical pathology, mortality, and recurrence of HCC. Few studies mentioned an association between VEGF gene polymorphisms with illness progression in chronic liver disease. We aimed to explore differences of VEGF gene polymorphism rs699947 in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma patients in Indonesian population.Methods:A cross-sectional study with consecutive sampling and without matching was performed during a 3 years period (2011-2014) at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Blood DNA was sequenced from 123 subjects with chronic liver diseases [39 chronic hepatitis (CH), 39 liver cirrhosis (LC), and 45 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)]. 59 healthy subjects also participated. Using isolated VEGF genes for specific primers for rs699947, blood samples were examined by targeting DNA sequences with Applied Bio systems. All data were analyzed using STATA version 11.0 with significance level at PResults:The mean of age in HCC and LC subjects were older than in CH and healthy (P value 0.05). HBV was the dominant etiology in HCC, LC, and CH besides HCV and non HBV-HCV (PC vs. C>C, and genotypes distribution. Proportion of SNP -2578 A>C vs. C>C CH 1.8:1; HCC 1.4:1; healthy 1.7:1; but its proportion in LC was inversed (1:1.2). Genotype A was low in all subjects (5%-11%). Significant difference of allele distribution was found in healthy vs. LC, and HCC; CH vs. LC. Based on HWE analyses, distribution of allele C was dominant. There were not significant differences in deletion, insertion-deletion at -2547 until -2526, and haplotype (Ht) CCGACCCC (P>0.05). The OR analyses of allele and SNP showed that allele A can be a predictor of disease progression in LC to HCC (OR 2.26) and healthy to LC (OR 1.65); and SNP A>C also can be a predictor in healthy to HCC (OR 1.41) and CH (OR 1.14).Conclusion:The occurrence of allele A and SNP A>C VEGF gene (-2578) might predict illness progression from healthy to CH, LC or HCC and LC to HCC.
