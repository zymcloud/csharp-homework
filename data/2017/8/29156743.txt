All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin A, is known to induce p14 expression via promoter hypomethylation to activate the p14-MDM2-p53 pathway, which leads to activation of the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway and subsequent induction of apoptosis in human hepatoma cells. In the present study, we found that hepatitis C virus (HCV) Core derived from ectopic expression or HCV infection overcomes ATRA-induced apoptosis in p53-positive hepatoma cells. For this effect, HCV Core upregulated both protein levels and enzyme activities of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), DNMT3a, and DNMT3b and thereby repressed p14 expression via promoter hypermethylation, resulting in inactivation of the pathway leading to p53 accumulation in the presence of ATRA. As a result, HCV Core prevented ATRA from activating several apoptosis-related molecules, including Bax, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis, caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In addition, complementation of p14 in the Core-expressing cells by either ectopic expression or treatment with 5-Aza-2'dC almost completely abolished the potential of HCV Core to suppress ATRA-induced apoptosis. Based on these observations, we conclude that HCV Core executes its oncogenic potential by suppressing the p53-dependent apoptosis induced by ATRA in human hepatoma cells.
