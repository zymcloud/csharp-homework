Tumor metastasis is a main cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Thus, a number of medicinal herbs and phytochemicals have been investigated as possible candidates for the inhibition of cancer metastasis. Sorbus commixta Hedl. (SC) is a traditional medicinal plant used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, as it has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic and anti-hepatotoxic activities. In this study, we demonstrate that the water extract of SC exerts inhibitory effect on the invasion and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. The activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, which is responsible for the invasion of cancer cells, was decreased by SC treatment. The invasive and migratory potentials of the Hep3B cells were also decreased, as evidence by in vitro assay using the Boyden chamber system. In addition, the expression of the chemokine receptors, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR)4 and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CXCR6), were inhibited by SC in Hep3B cells. Furthermore, actin fiber organization was markedly suppressed by SC treatment. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that SC suppresses the invasion and migration of highly metastatic Hep3B cells.
