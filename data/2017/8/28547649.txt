Background and aims:The Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) system proposes to triage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients to more aggressive treatment and may be associated with superior survival compared with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system. We aimed to identify the influence of adherence to HKLC or BCLC treatment recommendations on survival and time to progression.Methods:We examined a prospectively enrolled cohort of 292 patients undergoing 532 treatment episodes from a single clinical center.Results:The BCLC and HKLC systems accurately predicted overall survival and time to progression after each treatment episode (BCLC: p Conclusions:These data support the use of HKLC in early- and very early stage HCC. Efforts should be made to overcome technical reasons for not performing ablation in early- and very early stage disease.
