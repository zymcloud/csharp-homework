Introduction:Although laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has developed rapidly, its usefulness for the treatment of large tumors is less clear, due to concerns about compromising oncological principles and patient safety. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and safety of LLR for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a tumor size larger than 5 cm.Patients and methods:From January 2007 to December 2014, we performed LLR in 45 patients with HCC with a tumor size â‰¥5 cm. Perioperative outcome, tumor recurrence, and overall patient survival were analyzed.Results:Median age was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 52-68) and 64.4% (29/45) were male. Seven patients (15.6%) had larger than 10 cm of HCC. No operative deaths occurred and six of the laparoscopic procedures were converted to open resection (conversion rate 13.3%). Median operation time was 365 minutes (IQR 277-443) and median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 400.0 mL (IQR 275-600). There was no R1 or R2 resection and median resection margin was 19.0 mm (IQR 8.0-33.0). Complications above Clavien-Dindo classification grade III occurred in four patients (8.9%). The median overall follow-up time was 10.7 month (range 1.1-62.1). One-year recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were 86.0% and 95.5%, and 3-year RFS and OS were 70.7% and 86.0%.Conclusion:LLR appears safe and feasible in patients with HCC with a tumor size larger than 5 cm. Expansion of indication for LLR in patients with HCC may be considered.
