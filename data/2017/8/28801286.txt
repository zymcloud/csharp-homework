Objective:To explore the clinical value of detecting serum glypican-3 in the diagnosis and therapeutic effect evaluation of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC).Methods:Using sandwich ELISA, we detected serum glypican-3 levels in 60 patients with PHC, 60 with metastatic liver cancer, 50 with liver cirrhosis, 50 with chronic viral hepatitis, 20 with hepatic cyst, 20 with fatty liver, 20 with hepatic hemangioma and 20 with drug-induced hepatitis as well as in 40 healthy subjects (control). We also analyzed the changes in serum levels of glypican-3 and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) in PHC patients after treatment.Results:PHC patients had significantly higher serum levels of glypican-3 than patients with other liver diseases and the control subjects (PConclusion:Combined detection of glypican-3 and AFP is expected to improve the early diagnosis rate of PHC. The different thresholds of serum glypican-3 may play a role in the differential diagnosis of PHC and other various liver diseases. Glypican-3 may serve as a better marker than AFP with a high specificity and sensitivity for evaluating the therapeutic effect in PHC patients.
