A new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, performed by electrospray ionization in positive mode using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of regorafenib (REGO), its two metabolites regorafenib-M2 and regorafenib-M5, sorafenib (SORA), and its N-oxide metabolite in human plasma. Separation is achieved on an Hypersil Gold® column using a gradient elution of 10mM ammonium formate containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B) at a flow rate of 0.3mL/min. After addition of two internal standards and a protein precipitation, the supernatant is diluted two-fold in a 0.1% (v/v) formic acid solution. Two selected reaction monitoring transitions are used, for each analyte, one for quantitation and the second one for confirmation. The standard curves are ranged from 50 to 5 000ng/mL for REGO and its metabolites and 80 to 5 000ng/mL for SORA and its metabolite and were fitted to a 1/x weighted linear regression model. The method also showed satisfactory results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision (intra- and inter-day CV from 2.4 to 10.2%), accuracy (from 91.0 to 111.7%), recovery as well as stability of the analytes under various conditions. The method is usually used in clinical practice in order to improve the SORA treatment for renal carcinoma, REGO treatment for colorectal cancer and both for hepatocellular carcinoma.
