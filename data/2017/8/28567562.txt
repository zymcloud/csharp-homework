Globally, there are approximately 240 million people chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Ten different HBV genotypes (A-J) have been identified with distinct geographic distributions. Novel variants generated by recombination between different HBV genotypes have been documented worldwide and represent an important element of genetic variability with possible clinical implications. Here, the complete genome sequence of an HBV genotype D/E recombinant from Ghana is reported. The full-length sequence was obtained using rolling circle amplification followed by PCR and sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A consensus sequence was extracted from the NGS data and underwent phylogenetic analysis to determine genotype, as well as the recombination pattern. Subsequently, the sequence was compared to recombinants described previously in Africa. Based on MCMC phylogenetic analysis, SimPlot recombination analyses, and intragroup genetic distance, the isolate 007N full-length genome is unique compared to other reported D/E recombinants in Africa.
