Background:Splenopancreatic fusion is a rare anomaly that is often associated with trisomy 13. Its diagnosis can be important in patients scheduled to undergo distal pancreatectomy or splenectomy, to avoid possible intraoperative or postoperative complications.Case presentation:An 82-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment for a solitary hepatocellular carcinoma based on liver cirrhosis. Triple-phase contrast-enhanced multidetector-row computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a splenopancreatic fusion as well as a solitary hepatocellular carcinoma in segment VIII of his liver.Conclusions:Fusion of the pancreatic tail and spleen is a rare and asymptomatic anomaly. Its detection can be improved by the use of multidetector computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.
