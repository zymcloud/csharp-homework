Background:The key regulator of tumor metabolome is the glycolytic isoenzyme M2-PK which favors the generation of nucleic acid via glutaminolysis as hypoxic adaptive mechanism in the tumor cells.Aim:The study aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of M2-PK, CRP, and CA 15-3 in preoperative and metastatic breast carcinomas.Patients and methods:The study included 70 females; 15 controls, 33 preoperative primary breast carcinomas clinically metastasis free, and 22 clinically diagnosed metastatic breast carcinomas. M2-PK and CA 15-3 were detected by ELISA. CRP was quantified using the CRP LATEX kit.Results:TuM2-PK significantly increased in metastatic and preoperative groups when compared to controls (p= 0.049, p= 0.001); respectively. Both CRP and CA 15-3 were significantly increased in metastatic than the preoperative group (p= 0.002). CA 15-3 was significantly increased in both groups when compared to controls (p= 0.016; p< 0.001; respectively). TuM2-PK level significantly related to tumor size in metastatic group (p= 0.006) and with menstruation status (p= 0.039), and liver metastasis (p= 0.036) in preoperative group. TuM2-PK significantly correlated with CRP (r= 0.793, p= 0.004), and CA 15-3 (r= 0.568, p= 0.006) in the metastatic group.Metastatic group with TuM2-PK ⩽ 15 U/ml had significantly higher survival rate than those with > 15 U/ml (χ2= 13.841, p< 0.001) within 3.3-4.2 but not after 10-20 years follow up period. Metastasis to bone and lymph nodes significantly increased in the metastatic than the preoperative group (p= 0.002, p= 0.013; respectively). Within 3.3-4.2 years, CA15.3 has the highest prognostic performance in metastatic group while both TuM2-PK and CRP have same specificity. On the other hand, TuM2-PK has the highest prognostic performance in preoperative group. After 20 years follow up period, there was neither significant difference in the performance of the three markers in predicting mortality in metastatic and preoperative groups nor in predicting metastasis in preoperative group.Conclusion:Current results document for the first time, a cross-talk between TuM2-PK and each of CRP and CA 15-3 in metastatic breast cancer.
