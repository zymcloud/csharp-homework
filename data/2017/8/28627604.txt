The hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein is an important factor in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The C-terminal region of HBx plays a major role in the replication of HBV. Notably, HBx promotes the expansion and tumourigenesis of hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) in mice. However, it remains unclear as to whether the C-terminal region of HBx is required for the stimulation fo the proliferation of mouse foetal HPCs (FHPCs). In our study, we used EpCAM+, CD133+ and CD49f+ FHPCs, which are bipotential clonogenic cells. These FHPCs transformed into mature hepatocytes and cholangiocytes when cultured under conditions that facilitate differentiation. Compared with the FHPCs grown as monolayers, spherical cell proliferation occurred more rapidly. Furthermore, spherically cultured FHPCs can grow in semi-solid agar and tend to maintain the morphology and characteristics of stem cells compared with growth in rat tail collagen. Notably, we also demonstrate that the C-terminus of HBx stimulates the proliferation of FHPCs, but is not required for the formation of spheroids, similar to hepatic cancer stem cells. These findings enhance our understanding of the HBx-induced tumourigenicity of FHPCs and may aid in the treatment of HCC.
