Objective: To analyze the characteristics of life expectancy and influencing factors in Chinese population in different areas and provide scientific evidence for policy-making on disease managements, medical care and risk factor intervention. Methods: Based on the national census data from National Bureau of Statistics and the death registration data from the National Health and Family Planning Commission, we used exponential model, under-report adjustment model and abbreviated life tables to estimate the life expectancy and influence on disease in Chinese population in 2013. Results: The Chinese life expectancy was 75.8 years in 2013, 1 year higher than that in 2010. The life expectancy in urban area was 77.4 years, while it was 75.1 years that in rural area with the gap between the rural area and urban area was 2.3 years. The life expectancy was 77.2 years in the eastern area, 75.8 years in middle area and 73.5 years in western area, the gap between the east and west was 3.6 years. In 2013, the first 10 leading diseases causing the life expectancy lost were cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, road injury, liver cancer, stomach cancer, hypertensive heart disease, lower respiratory infection, esophagus cancer, resulting in 7.97 years of life expectancy lost. Conclusion: The life expectancy in Chinese has already reached a relative high level, while the gap between different areas still exists. Different policies on disease management, medical care and risk factor interventions targeting different areas are needed to increase the life expectancy and improve the quality of life.
