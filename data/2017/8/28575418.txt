Context:The pathogenesis of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced thyroid hormone (TH) alterations are still a matter of debate.Objective:The objective of this study was to determine the effects of sorafenib on TH levels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to evaluate possible mechanisms.Design:We performed a prospective cohort study between 2009 and 2016.Setting:This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.Patients:This study included 57 consecutive patients with HCC who were treated with sorafenib.Main outcome measure:Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were measured every 6 weeks, and extensive thyroid function tests (TFTs) were measured before treatment (t0), after 6 weeks (t6), and at the end of therapy. The effect of sorafenib on TH transport by monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)8 or MCT10 was tested in transfected COS1 cells.Results:Four patients (7%) developed thyroiditis. Among the other patients, 30% had elevation of TSH or FT4 above the normal range. Overall, between t0 and t6, mean TSH increased from 1.28 to 1.57 mU/L (P Conclusions:These in vivo data suggest that sorafenib affects TFTs on multiple levels. Our in vitro experiments suggest a possible role of sorafenib-induced inhibition of T3 transport into the cell by MCT8 and MCT10.
