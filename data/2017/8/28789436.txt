The inflammatory microenvironment serves an important function in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Peripheral blood lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), as a novel inflammatory biomarker combining an estimate of host immune homeostasis with the tumor microenvironment, has been identified to be a predictor of clinical outcomes in a number of malignancies. The present study aimed at investigating the prognostic value of LMR in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated advanced HCC. A total of 174 patients with HBV-associated advanced HCC, without fever or signs of infections, were analyzed. Clinicopathological parameters, including LMR, were evaluated to identify predictors of overall survival time. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazards model. A threshold value was determined using a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve. Univariate and multivariate analysis identified LMR as an independent prognostic factor in overall survival (OS) time in patients with HBV-associated advanced HCC (P2.22). The OS time of the high LMR group was significantly longer compared with the low LMR group (P
