Background:Opioid receptors have become increasingly implicated in cancer progression and long-term patient outcomes. However, the expression and significance of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear.Methods:In this study, KOR mRNA expression was analysed by real-time quantitative PCR in 64 pairs of HCC tumour tissues and adjacent non-tumour tissues, and KOR protein expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry in 174 HCC patients. We investigated the correlation between KOR expression and clinicopathological parameters to illustrate the potential prognostic significance of KOR expression in HCC.Results:KOR mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated in 79.69% (51 of 64) of the HCC tumour samples, and KOR expression in tumour tissue was significantly lower than that in adjacent non-tumour tissues (P T < N) was correlated to a shorter survival rate and an increased recurrence (both P < 0.001). In univariate and multivariate survival analyses, KOR was identified as a promising independent risk factor for both overall survival (OS, both P < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, both P < 0.001).Conclusions:Down-regulation of KOR in HCC tumour tissues has a strong association with poor prognosis and KOR might be a potential tumour suppressor.
