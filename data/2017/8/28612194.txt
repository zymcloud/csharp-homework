Background and aim:Several factors involved in the development of liver fibrosis in African-American patients with chronic hepatitis C have not been well studied. We aimed to evaluate some of these risk factors.Methods:We reviewed pathology and medical records of 603 African-Americans with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at Howard University Hospital from January 2004 to December 2013. Among the clinical and pathological data collected were HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HCV genotype, hepatitis B virus (HBV), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), body mass index (BMI), and hepatic steatosis.Results:The frequency of DM, HTN, HIV, and HBV was 22, 16, 11, and 4%, respectively. Median BMI was 27.3 kg/m2. The frequency of fibrosis stages 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 2, 48, 28, 11, and 11%, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression, we found a significant association between liver fibrosis stage (3-4 vs. 0-2) and HIV infection (OR 2.4, P = 0.026), HTN (OR 3.0, P = 0.001), age (OR 2.6 for every 10 years, P < 0.001), weight (OR 1.1 for every 10 lb increase, P = 0.002), and steatosis grade (OR 1.6, P = 0.002). The frequency of liver steatosis was 73%. In an ordinal logistic regression, significant risk factors for steatosis were female gender (OR 1.5, P = 0.034) and inflammation grade (P = 0.001).Conclusion:This study shows that steatosis is independently associated with fibrosis in African-American patients with HCV infection. Female patients were at higher risk of steatosis.
