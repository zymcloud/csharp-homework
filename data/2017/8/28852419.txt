Background:To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of prothrombin induced by the absence of vitamin K or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) for early stage hepatitis virus B (HBV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Serums levels of PIVKA-II and a-Fetoprotein (AFP) was detected and compared in 113 patients with clinical confirmed Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0-A HBV-related HCC and 161 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Diagnostic efficiencies as well as cut-off values of PIVKA-II, AFP and combination of the two markers were calculated using receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis.Results:The mean level of PIVKA-II among HCC patients were 79.64 ± 149.88, significantly higher than control group (P < 0.001). ROC results showed that among those AFP-negative HCC patients, the area under ROC curve (AUROC) of PIVKA-II was 0.73 (95%CI 0.640-0.815, P < 0.001). Among HCC patients diagnosed with small HCC (tumor size ≤2 cm), the AUROC of PIVKA- II was 0.692 (95%CI 0.597-0.788, P < 0.001). To evaluate the diagnostic value of PIVKA-II in HCC patient, all CHB cases were pooled together as control for analysis. The AUROC of PIVKA-II was 0.756 (95%CI 0.698-0.814, P < 0.001), and the optimal cutoff value of PIVKA-II was 32.09 mAU/ml with sensitivity of 52.21% and specificity of 81.49%. When serum levels of PIVKA-II and AFP were combined to obtain a new marker for HCC diagnosis, PIVKA-II + AFP further increased diagnostic efficiency, with AUROC of 0.868 (95%CI 0.822-0.913), higher than that of AFP (P < 0.01) or PIVKA-II (P < 0.001) alone. In addition, we found that HCC patients in poorly differentiated- undifferentiated group and in microvascular invasion group had higher levels of PIVKA-II. Multivariate analysis showed that high serum PIVKA-II level (OR = 1.003, 95%CI 1.001-1.007, P = 0.047) was an independent risk factor for microvascular invasion in HCC patients.Conclusion:Serum PIVKA-II level is a potential marker for early diagnosis of HCC and microvascular invasion. The use of PIVKA-II may improve assessment of tumor prognosis and guide development of therapeutic strategy.
