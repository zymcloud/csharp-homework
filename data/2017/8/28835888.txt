Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are aggressive neoplasms which may involve the liver. The imaging manifestations of hepatic lymphoma are highly variable and show overlapping appearances of numerous other hepatic diseases. As the management and prognosis of lymphoma differ markedly from those of other malignant diseases, prompt diagnosis and early effective treatment are very important. Here, we report an atypical case of primary PTCL not otherwise specified involving the liver that exhibited a solitary hepatic mass mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on CT. Liver biopsy is not commonly recommended in highly suspicious cases of HCC. However, in a patient without risk factors for HCC, consideration of other diagnostic possibilities is required and needle biopsy may be a more rational choice. An imaging approach, based on a careful review of clinical and laboratory findings is essential to prevent false-positive diagnosis of HCC and subsequent invasive treatment.
