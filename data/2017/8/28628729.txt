Purpose:To investigate pre- and post-operative levels of HBsAg influence prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection.Methods:Medical records were retrospectively analyzed for 881 patients with HBV-related HCC treated by curative resection. Patients were classified as having high or low serum HBsAg levels (≥200 or Results:OS and RFS were better for patients with low pre-operative serum levels of HBsAg than for those with high levels. Similarly, OS was better among patients with low post-operative serum levels of HBsAg than among those with high levels. RFS, in contrast, was similar between these two groups. After generating propensity score-matched pairs of patients, OS was higher in patients with falling post-operative HBsAg levels than in those with rising levels. In contrast, RFS was similar between these two groups. Antiviral nucleoside analog therapy prolonged OS in patients with high pre-operative HBsAg levels.Conclusions:Low pre- and post-operative levels of HBsAg may be associated with better long-term survival in patients with HBV-related HCC. Pre-operative serum levels of HBsAg ≥200 ng/mL may identify patients more likely to benefit from antiviral treatment.
