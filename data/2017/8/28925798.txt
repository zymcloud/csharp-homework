Purpose:To investigate the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic simultaneous resections of colorectal cancer and synchronous colorectal liver metastases (SCRLM), relative to open surgery.Methods:Between 1 January 2009 and 20 April 2014, 20 of 25 patients who underwent laparoscopic simultaneous colorectal cancer and SCRLM resections were matched with 20 of 29 patients who underwent an open approach, based on prognostic propensity scores. Perioperative results and survival outcomes were compared.Results:The laparoscopic and open groups were comparable in demographics, cancer characteristics, surgery characteristics, and chemotherapy treatment. No postoperative mortality occurred in either group. The estimated blood loss and postoperative stay were significantly greater in the open group than in the laparoscopic group (all, p < .05). All other perioperative results and postoperative complications were similar between the two groups, as well as three-year overall and disease-free survival rates.Conclusions:The postoperative complications and survival rates of patients given laparoscopic simultaneous colorectal cancer and SCRLM resections were similar to those treated with an open approach, but with greater short-term benefits. Laparoscopy in this setting by an experienced surgical team appears safe and effective, and is a feasible alternative to an open approach for selected patients.
