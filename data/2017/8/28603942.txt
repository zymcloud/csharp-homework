We present a case of primary hepatic choriocarcinoma in an 83-year-old Japanese woman with gastric wall and lymph node metastases and a splenic vein tumor thrombus. Multiple irregular hepatic tumors with massive necrosis and hemorrhage were observed during autopsy. Syncytiotrophoblast-like and mononucleated cytotrophoblast-like cell morphology with focal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-like trabecular structures was observed. In immunohistochemical analyses, the tumor cells expressed human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CK7, CK19) but were negative for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), glypican-3, and vimentin. Immunohistochemical findings did not reveal evidence of HCC or angiosarcoma. We concluded the liver tumor was primary hepatic choriocarcinoma.
