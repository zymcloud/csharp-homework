Metastasis-associated recurrence is the main cause for the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying HCC metastasis remain elusive. Though some data indicated the oncogenic role of Sorcin in tumors, the prognostic value and biological role of Sorcin in HCC is still unknown. In this study, it demonstrated that Sorcin expression levels were significantly upregulated in HCC tumor tissues compared with matched adjacent nontumorous liver tissues and normal liver tissues, and such expression level correlated with HCC metastasis. High Sorcin expression was significantly correlated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics such as multiple tumor nodules, high Edmondson-Steiner grade, microvascular invasion, advanced TNM stage and advanced BCLC stage (all P
