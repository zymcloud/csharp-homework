Background:Intraoperative blood loss during hepatectomy worsens prognosis, and various tools have been used to improve perioperative safety and feasibility. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the feasibility and safety of the BiClamp® device for open liver resection.Methods:We included 84 patients undergoing liver resection from a single centre, with all patients operated by the same surgical group. All hepatectomies were performed using BiClamp® (Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH, Tubingen, Germany), an electrosurgical device that simultaneously transects liver parenchyma and seals vessels <7 mm in diameter. We collected data on intraoperative blood loss, resection time, and perioperative complications, comparing cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients.Results:The 84 patients enrolled in this study included 56 cirrhotic and 28 non-cirrhotic patients. All patients underwent hepatectomy (30 major and 54 minor hepatectomies) using the BiClamp®, exclusively, and 54 patients required inflow occlusion (Pringle manoeuvre). Overall intraoperative blood loss (mean ± standard deviation) was 523.5 ± 558.6 ml, liver parenchymal transection time was 36.3 ± 16.5 min (range, 13-80 min), and the mean parenchymal transection speed was 3.0 ± 1.9 cm2/min. Twelve patients received perioperative blood transfusion. The cost of BiClamp® for each patient was 800 RMB (approximately 109€). There were no deaths, and the morbidity rate was 25%. The mean (standard deviation) hospital stay was 9.3 (2.3) days. Comparisons between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients revealed no difference in blood loss (491.0 ± 535.7 ml vs 588.8 ± 617.5 ml, P = 0.598), liver parenchymal transection time (34.1 ± 14.8 min vs 40.9 ± 19.2 min, P = 0.208), mean parenchymal transection speed (3.3 ± 2.1 cm2/min vs 2.5 ± 1.3 cm2/min, P = 0.217), and operative morbidity (28.6% vs 14.3%, P = 0.147).Conclusions:The reusable BiClamp® vessel-sealing device allows for safe and feasible major and minor hepatectomy, even in patients with cirrhotic liver.Trial registration:This trial was retrospectively registered and the detail information was as followed.
