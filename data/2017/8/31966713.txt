DCAF16 is a DDB1-CUL4 associated factor. The expression pattern of DCAF16 in human carcinomas is largely unknown. Here, we investigated DCAF16 expression in a series of human normal epithelial tissues and carcinomas using immunohistochemistry. DCAF16 expression was detected mainly in the cytoplasm in epithelial tissues including thyroid follicles (3/3), epithelium of the prostate glands (2/8), epithelium of the gastric glands (1/2), bronchial epithelium (1/1), epithelium of the intestine (1/1), and hepatocellular epithelium (3/5). There were only 2 cases showing strong immunostaining. Nuclear expression of DCAF16 was detected in a few human carcinomas (0.8%, 9/83). Cytoplasmic DCAF16 expression was detected in human carcinomas including adenocarcinoma (80.0%, 52/65), squamous cell carcinoma (30.8%, 4/13), and urothelial carcinoma (100%, 5/5). The total positive rate of DCAF16 expression was 73.5% (61/83), higher than that in normal tissues (45.8%, 11/24) (P
