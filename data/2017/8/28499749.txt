Background:The aim of this study was to determine the effect of anatomic resection (AR) versus non-anatomic resection (NAR) on recurrence rates in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Eligible patients were randomized to AR or NAR from January 2006 to July 2007 at a single center. The primary outcome was the 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications, time to first recurrence, 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS, and overall survival (OS).Results:Fifty-three (51%) and 52 (50%) patients underwent NAR and AR, respectively. A larger proportion of patients achieved margins â‰¥20 mm in the AR group (52% vs. 30%; P = 0.023). Complications (blood loss, transfusion requirement, and hospital stay) were similar between the two groups. Median follow-up was 33 (range, 2-77) months. Incidence of local recurrence at 2 years was 30% and 59% in the AR and NAR groups, respectively. Median time to first local recurrence in the AR group was significantly longer than in the NAR group (53 vs. 10 months, P = 0.010). There was no difference in overall RFS between the two groups (P = 0.290).Discussion:AR decreased the 2-year local recurrence rate and increased the time to first local recurrence compared to NAR in patients with HCC.
