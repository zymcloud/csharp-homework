Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare aggressive cutaneous tumor that commonly occurs in sun-exposed sites. It has a tendency for rapid growth, local recurrence, lymph node invasion, and distant metastases. Risk factors include immunosuppression, advanced age, exposure to UV radiation, and infection with the Merkel cell polyomavirus. We report a case of a 67-year-old woman with rapidly aggressive MCC 6 years after liver transplantation.
