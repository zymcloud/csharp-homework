Background:There is paucity of information concerning whether AFP change is a predictor of prognosis for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (RHCC) patients after trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A total of 177 RHCC patients who received TACE as first-line therapy were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were classified into three groups according to their pre-TACE and post-TACE AFP levels (group A: AFP decreased, group B: AFP consistent normal, and group C: AFP increased). The recurrence to death survival (RTDS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by the log-rank test. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for OS and RTDS.Results:There was no significant difference among the three groups concerning the baseline characteristics. The median overall survival (OS) was 74.5 months in group A (95% confidence interval (CI): 63.5, 85.6), 64.0 months in group B (95% CI: 52.3, 75.7) and 29.0 months in group C (95% CI: 24.1, 33.9; PConclusions:AFP change could predict the prognoses of patients with RHCC who received trans-arterial chemoembolization, which may help clinicians make subsequent treatment decision.
