Cell death pathway plays an important role in apoptosis, and corruption of this signaling pathway has been shown to participate in carcinogenesis. We aimed at determining whether genetic variants in CASP8, CASP10 and CFLAR influence the development and clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A hospital-based case-control study, including 600 HCC cases and 600 HBsAg positive controls without HCC, was conducted to assess the relationship between 11 tagging SNPs in CASP8, CASP10 and CFLAR and HBV-related HCC risk and prognosis in a Chinese Han population. Among the 11 polymorphisms, only CASP8 rs3834129 (-652 6N ins/del) modified HCC risk. Compared with CASP8 -652 insins genotype, the deldel (adjusted OR 0.717, 95% CI 0.553-0.930) and insdel (adjusted OR 0.731, 95% CI 0.554-0.964) genotypes had a significantly decreased HCC risk. Furthermore, this polymorphism was significantly associated with decreased portal vein tumor thrombosis (adjusted OR 0.554; P = 0.044) and reduced postoperative recurrence (adjusted OR 0.356; P
