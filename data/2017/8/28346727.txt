Sulforaphene (SFE), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables, has attracted increasing attention for its anti-cancer effect in many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the precise role of SFE in the radiosensitivity of HCC is still unclear. Here, cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The activity of NF-κB was further evaluated by ELISA. We also observed the effect of SFE and/or radiation on tumor growth. The results showed that SFE inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Radiation increased NF-kB activity, while PDTC, a NF-kB inhibitor, enhanced radiation-induced cell death. SFE inhibited NF-kB activity and the downstream gene expressions of the NF-kB pathway in HCC cells. Moreover, SFE enhanced the inhibitory effect of radiation on tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. This study indicated that SFE sensitized the radiosensitivity of HCC by blocking the NF-kB pathway.
