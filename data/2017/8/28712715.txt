Purpose:In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using split-arcs in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), tailored for expiratory breath-hold in stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for liver tumors. We compare it with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and continuous-VMAT, for ten randomly selected hepatocellular carcinoma cases.Methods:Four coplanar and four non-coplanar beams were used for the 3D-CRT plans. A pair of partial arcs, chosen using a back-and-forth rotating motion, were used for the continuous-VMAT plans. Split-VMAT plans were created using the same arc range as the continuous-VMAT plans, but were split into smaller arcs (Results:The mean dose of the liver-GTV was lower in the split-VMAT compared with that of 3D-CRT. Split-VMAT was more conformal compared with 3D-CRT. The total treatment time for split-VMAT was shorter than that of 3D-CRT. Similar dosimetric indices were observed for split-VMAT and continuous-VMAT. All VMAT plans passed the gamma acceptance test.Conclusions:Split-VMAT designed to accommodate an expiratory breath-hold period of 15s is a feasible and efficient use of liver SBRT, because it does not compromise the quality of the plan, when compared with 3D-CRT or continuous-VMAT.
