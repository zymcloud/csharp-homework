Purpose:Response to preoperative transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been recommended as a biological selection criterion for liver transplantation (LT). The aim of our study was to identify optimal timing of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) after TACE based on the TACE response.Methods:We performed a retrospective study to assess recurrence in 128 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who underwent LDLT following sequential TACE from January 2002 to March 2015 at a single institute. Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were utilized to estimate HCC recurrence and find optimal timing for LDLT.Results:Seventy-three and 61 patients were divided as the responder and nonresponder, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed independent pre-liver transplantation (pre-LT) predictors of recurrence were larger sized tumor (>3 cm, P = 0.024), nonresponse to TACE (P = 0.031), vascular invasion (P = 0.002), and extrahepatic nodal involvement (P = 0.001). In the 3-month time difference between last pre-LT TACE and LDLT subgroup, TACE responders showed significantly higher adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of recurrence free survival (aHR, 6.284; P = 0.007), cancer specific survival (aHR, 7.033; P = 0.016), and overall survival (aHR, 7.055; P = 0.005). Moreover, for overall patients and responder groups, the significant time difference between last pre-LT TACE and LDLT was 2 months in the minimum P-value approach.Conclusion:In selected patients who showed good response to pre-LT TACE, a shorter time interval between TACE and LDLT may be associated with higher recurrence free survival, cancer specific survival, and overall survival.
