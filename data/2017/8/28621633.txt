Objectives:To date, fatigue is still poorly understood in recipients of orthotopic liver transplant and simultaneous/sequential liver and kidney transplant procedures. The present study examined the appearance of fatigue in patients who received orthotopic liver and sequential liver and kidney transplant procedures compared with the general population and the influence of various clinical and socioeconomic factors on fatigue levels.Materials and methods:The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory survey was sent to all patients with a history of orthotopic liver and simultaneous/sequential liver and kidney transplant. The results were compared to data from a reference population.Results:Our survey included 276 eligible patients: 256 recipients (92.7%) of orthotopic liver transplant and 20 recipients (7.3%) of simultaneous/sequential liver and kidney transplant. Significantly lower fatigue scores were found in the general population compared with both transplant groups (P Conclusions:This is the first study to compare fatigue in recipients of orthotopic liver and simultaneous/sequential liver and kidney transplant. We found that fatigue is an important but still poorly understood outcome after transplant.
