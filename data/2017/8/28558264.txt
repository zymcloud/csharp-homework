Background:Recurrence or metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly intrahepatic after curative resection, demonstrating that the peritumoral environment is important but often neglected. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in intratumoral liver tissues is a poor prognosis factor whose impact is removed after curative resection. However, PD-L1 expression remains in the peritumoral liver tissues and its distribution and prognostic value are still not clear.Methods:We assessed the expression of PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry in peritumoral liver tissues from 90 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. The results were validated in an independent cohort of additional 90 HCC patients.Results:We found PD-L1 positive expression in 31.11% (28/90) of peritumoral tissues. Peritumoral PD-L1 expression was associated with a significantly worse overall survival (OS) (P=.000) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=.001) compared to the negative expression group. Additionally, peritumoral PD-L1 positivity significantly correlated with vascular invasion and a lower albumin level (â‰¤35 g/L). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models both revealed peritumoral PD-L1 as an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR=2.853, P=.002) and DFS (HR=2.362, P=.003). The prognostic value of PD-L1 positivity was validated in the independent data set.Conclusions:Our data suggest PD-L1 expression in peritumoral hepatocytes is an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS. This implies that future anti-cancer therapy should target not only residual tumor cells but also the "soil" for promoting tumor growth. Peritumoral PD-L1 could be a good target for adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy.
