Objective:Large body of evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) have the potential to serve as prognosis marker. This study is designed to investigate the expression of miR-370 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and to analyze its potential prognostic value.Patients and methods:Quantitative real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to examine the miR-370 level in HCC tissue and matched normal tissue from 83 HCC patients. The correlation of miR-370 level in HCC tissue with the clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. Moreover, the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression were utilized to analyze survival data and independent prognostic factors, respectively.Results:Our results showed that low miR-370 level significantly correlated with tumor node metastasis stage (p=0.013) and vein invasion (p=0.0082). However, no significant relation was found between miR-370 expression and gender (p=0.1275), age (p=0. 0915), size of tumor (p=0.0823), liver cirrhosis (p=0.2508) and tumor grade (p=0.5377). Moreover, addition, survival analysis suggested that low expression of miR-370 linked shorter overall survival compared with high expression and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis also showed that miR-370 function as an independent prognostic marker.Conclusions:Low level of miR-370 correlates with poor prognosis and miR-370 level can be considered as an independent prognostic marker in clinical evaluations.
