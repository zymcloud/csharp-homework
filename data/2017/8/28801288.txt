Objective:To investigate the expression of Wnt5b in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and its correlation with the clinicopathological parameters.Methods:Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining were employed to measure Wnt5b mRNA and protein expressions in two groups of HBV-related HCC patients (100 cases in each) selected from a cohort of 289 cases with HBV-related HCC using simple random sampling method. The correlation of Wnt5b expression with the clinicopathological parameters and the prognosis of HCC patients was analyzed.Results:Wnt5b mRNA expression was significantly higher in HCC tissues than that of adjacent noncancerous tissues in 65.0% (65/100) of the cases, and the positivity rate of Wnt5b protein was significantly higher in HCC tissues than that of adjacent noncancerous tissues (58.0% vs 22.0%, PConclusion:s Up-regulated Wnt5b might contribute to the progression of HBV-related HCC and predicts a poor prognosis.
