Excessive alcohol consumption is the most common cause of liver disease in the world. Chronic alcohol abuse leads to liver damage, liver inflammation, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, induce liver injury, which leads to the develo-pment of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Hepatoprotective cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, are also associated with ALD. IL-6 improves ALD via the activation of STAT3 and the subsequent induction of a variety of hepatoprotective genes in hepatocytes. Alcohol consumption promotes liver inflammation by incre-asing the translocation of gut-derived endotoxins to the portal circulation and by activating Kupffer cells through the lipopolysaccharide/Toll-like receptor 4 pathways. Oxidative stress and microflora products are also associated with ALD. Hepatic stellate cells play an important role in angiogenesis and liver fibrosis. Anti-angiogenic therapy has been found to be effective in the prevention of fibrosis. This suggests that blocking angiogenesis could be a promising therapeutic option for patients with advanced fibrosis. This review discusses the main pathways associated with liver inflammation and liver fibrosis as well as new therapeutic strategies.
