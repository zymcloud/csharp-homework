Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and its receptor, CSF-1R, regulate the differentiation and function of macrophages and play an important role in macrophage infiltration in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma. The therapeutic effects of CSF-1R blockade in hepatocellular carcinoma remain unclear. In this study, we found that CSF-1R blockade by PLX3397, a competitive inhibitor with high specificity for CSF-1R tyrosine kinase, significantly delayed tumor growth in mouse models. PLX3397 inhibited the proliferation of macrophages in vitro, but intratumoral macrophage infiltration was not decreased by PLX3397 in vivo Gene expression profiling of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) showed that TAMs from the PLX3397-treated tumors were polarized toward an M1-like phenotype compared with those from vehicle-treated tumors. In addition, PLX3397 treatment increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration, whereas CD4+ T-cell infiltration was decreased. Further study revealed that tumor cell-derived CSF-2 protected TAMs from being depleted by PLX3397. In conclusion, CSF-1R blockade delayed tumor growth by shifting the polarization rather than the depletion of TAMs. CSF-1R blockade warrants further investigation in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
