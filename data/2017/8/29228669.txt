Activation of YAP/TEAD signaling is very common in the progression of HCC (Hepatocellular carcinoma). Nuclear pore complex (NPC) regulates the shuttling of proteins between cytoplasm and nucleus. Nuclear accumulation of YAP protein has been observed in the majority of HCC tissues. However, whether NPC could regulate the YAP/TEAD signaling remains unknown. In this study, it was found NUP37, the component of NPC, significantly up-regulated in HCC clinical samples and mouse model. Over-expression of NUP37 promoted the growth, migration and invasion of HCC cells, while knocking down the expression of NUP37 inhibited the growth, migration, invasion and metastasis of HCC cells and improved the survival of the mouse model. NUP37 interacted with YAP and activated YAP/TEAD signaling by enhancing the interaction between YAP and TEAD. Taken together, these data demonstrated the oncogenic roles of NUP37 in the progression of HCC and suggested that NUP37 might be a promising therapeutic target.
