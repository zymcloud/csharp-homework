Background:The natural outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections vary considerably among individuals The infection may heal naturally, or patients may succumb to chronic liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanism is not fully understood.Objectives:To evaluate the interaction among four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their influence on different clinical outcomes.Methods:277 individuals infected with HBV and/or HCV, including 81 patients with chronic hepatitis B and C, 122 asymptomatic HBV and/or HCV carriers and 74 controls who cleared HBV and HCV spontaneously, were involved in this study. The SNPs of four genes (rs2069762/-330 G/T of IL-2, rs2430561/+874A>T of IFN-γ, rs1800896/-1082G>A and rs1800872/-592C>A of IL-10 and rs2243250/-589C>T of IL-4) were analysed using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction or sequence-specific primer PCR. The gene-gene interactions were assessed using the multifactor-dimensionality reduction method.Results:Interleukin (IL)-10-592 AC and IL-4-589 CC/CT showed a synergistic effect on liver inflammatory injury (pConclusions:Interactions among polymorphisms of IFN-γ+874 AA, IL-2-330 TT, IL-10-1082 AA, IL10--592 AC and IL-4-589 CC/CT significantly influenced the clinical progression of the subjects with HBV and/or HCV infection.
