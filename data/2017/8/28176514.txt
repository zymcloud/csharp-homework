Background:The negative effects of hepatic inflow occlusion (HIO) on postoperative liver function of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver resection have been reported. Nevertheless, whether or not HIO could influence the long-term outcomes remains unclear.Methods:A total of 396 patients were included in this study and divided into without occlusion (WO) group (N.=112) and HIO group (N.=284). Aiming to minimize influence of selection bias and confounding variables, we used propensity score matching (PSM) of a 0.2 caliper to balance baseline variables. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared by the Kaplan-Meier method. Independent prognostic factors for OS and DFS were identified by Cox proportional hazards regression model.Results:PSM were used to generate 101 pairs of patients. After PSM, OS was not significantly different between WO and HIO group (1-year: 86.1% vs. 83.2%; 3-year: 61.4% vs. 61.4%; 5-year: 45.5% vs. 39.6%; P = 0.626). Similar results of DFS were obtained between WO and HIO group (1-year: 54.5% vs. 53.5%; 3-year: 30.5% vs. 28.7%; 5-year: 14.2% vs. 14.9%; P=0.873). WO and HIO groups did not differ in 30-day, 90-day mortality and rate of postoperative complications (all P>0.05).Conclusions:Our data indicates that HIO might not negatively affect the OS and DFS of HCC patients undergoing liver resection and is likely to be a safe and viable option for intraoperative blood loss control.
