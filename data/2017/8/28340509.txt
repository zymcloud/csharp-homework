Liver transplantation (LT) is a well-established treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in carefully selected patients. Risk factors for tumors with poor prognostic features on explant have not been well described in a national cohort. We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult LT recipients with HCC transplanted from April 8, 2012 (when explant pathology in United Network for Organ Sharing [UNOS] became available) until September 30, 2014. We evaluated the association between listing diagnosis and other demographic factors with tumor features on explant using logistic regression. High-risk tumor features included the following: > 3 tumors, largest tumor > 5 cm, presence of vascular invasion, presence of metastases, and poor differentiation of tumor. In total, 3733 LT recipients with HCC who had complete explant data in UNOS were included. The median age was 60 years; 78% were male; and 68% were white. Of the primary non-HCC listing diagnoses, 2608 (70%) had hepatitis C virus (HCV); 271 (7%) had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); 246 (7%) had alcoholic cirrhosis; and 189 (5%) had hepatitis B virus. Also, 1140 (31%) had evidence of ≥ 1 high-risk explant feature(s). The presence of ≥ 1 high-risk explant feature(s) was associated with HCC recurrence after transplant (odds ratio [OR], 5.00; P
