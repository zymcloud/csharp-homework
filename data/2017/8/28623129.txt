Accumulating evidence has suggested that microRNA-31-5p (miR-31-5p) is dysfunctional in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism of HCC remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-31-5p in tumor formation and development of HCC. The expression of miR-31-5p was detected in HCC tissues, corresponding adjacent tissues, normal liver tissues, and HCC cell lines. miR-31-5p mimics and an inhibitor were transfected into HepG2 cells to assess the effects of miR-31-5p on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and invasion assays. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of Sp1 transcription factor (SP1), cyclin D1, and survivin in transfected HCC cells and control cells. The expression of miR-31-5p was significantly decreased in HCC cells and HCC tissues. Overexpression of miR-31-5p inhibited HCC cell growth, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of miR-31-5p reduced the expression of SP1 and cyclin D1, and knockdown of SP1 decreased cyclin D1 expression. The dual luciferase assay showed that miR-31-5p directly targeted SP1 in HepG2. Together, the results suggested that miR-31-5p acted as a tumor suppressor to regulate SP1, and that miR-31-5p could be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
