Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death in western countries. The major risk factors for HCC are hepatitis C or B viruses, alcohol and metabolic disorders. The increasing risk of HCC in patients with metabolic disorders (i.e. obesity, diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis/NASH) regardless of the presence of liver cirrhosis is becoming relevant. Nevertheless, molecular mechanisms linking these risk factors to liver oncogenesis are unclear. This review focuses on the pathogenic role of the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) pathway in HCC, highlighting the implications of this bioactive phospholipid in liver cancer biology and metabolism and as potential therapeutic target.
