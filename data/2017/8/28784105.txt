Background:We report a unique case of a superficial esophageal cancer arising in a single diverticulum, diagnosed with magnifying image-enhanced endoscopy and then successfully treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).Case presentation:A 66-year-old man with alcohol-related liver injury visited our hospital for endoscopy for investigation of varix. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no varix but a large epiphrenic diverticulum with an area of fainted redness just above the esophagogastric junction. Narrow band imaging revealed a sharply demarcated brownish dotted area, and dilated intra-epithelial papillary capillary loops (IPCL) were subsequently seen after magnification. Chromoendoscopy with 1% Lugol's iodine solution demonstrated a well-demarcated unstained area, approximately 20 mm in diameter. Endoscopic biopsy revealed a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).Conclusion:The tumor was completely resected by ESD without perforation. Histologically, it was an intraepithelial SCC without lympho-vascular invasion of cancer cells. No local recurrence or metastasis was detected at the last follow-up of 42 months.
