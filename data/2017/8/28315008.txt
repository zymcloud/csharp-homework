Purpose:To establish the optimal cut-off value of the preoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI) for prognosis according to the Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection.Methods:This retrospective study reviewed the records of 375 patients. The optimal cut-off value of the PNI was established according to the TNM stage, and overall survival was compared between the low and high PNI groups.Results:The optimal cut-off value of the PNI decreased with increasing TNM stage, with 52, 47, and 43 patients having stage I, II, and III HCC, respectively. A low preoperative PNI predicted a poorer overall survival than did a high PNI for stage I (P Conclusions:The findings of this study show that the optimal cut-off value for the PNI for prognosis differs among the TNM stages and that the preoperative PNI is a favorable prognostic factor for stage I HCC.
