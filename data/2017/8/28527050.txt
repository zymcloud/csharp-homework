Sirtuins (SIRT), first described as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent type III histone deacetylases, are produced by cells to support in the defense against chronic stress conditions such as metabolic syndromes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. SIRT-3 is one of the most studied members of the mitochondrial sirtuins family. In particular, its involvement in metabolic diseases and its dual role in cancer have been described. In the present review, based on the evidence of SIRT-3 involvement in metabolic dysfunctions, we aimed to provide an insight into the multifaceted role of SIRT-3 in many solid and hematological tumors with a particular focus on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SIRT-3 regulatory effect and involvement in metabolism dysfunctions may have strong implications in HCC development and treatment. Research literature widely reports the relationship between metabolic disorders and HCC development. This evidence suggests a putative bridge role of SIRT-3 between metabolic diseases and HCC. However, further studies are necessary to demonstrate such interconnection.
