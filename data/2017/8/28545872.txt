Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for end-stage chronic liver disease, fulminant liver failure and early stage hepatocellular carcinoma. As discussed in this review, state-of-the-art imaging modalities including ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a pivotal role in the selection of patients and donors, as well as in early detection of those complications at risk of impairing graft function and/or survival. We also illustrate main imaging findings related to the wide spectrum of clinical problems raised by LT.
