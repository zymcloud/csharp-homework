Clinical outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are highly variable. This study aims to identify and validate a simple, readily available, and objective prognostic index for the management of HCC. Data from 724 HCC patients undergoing curative resection were evaluated and randomly divided into two cohorts for building and validating the prognostic index. A best model, NγLR = (neutrophil count [109/L] × γ-glutamyl transpeptidase [U/L]) /(lymphocyte count [109/L] × U/L), was selected. An optimal cut-off value of 103.6 for NγLR stratified patients into high NγLR (>103.6) and low NγLR (≤103.6) groups. NγLR > 103.6 was closely associated with HCC malignant characteristics. Elevated NγLR predicted a worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for HCC patients and remained an independent predictor for both types of survival. Moreover, early recurrence rates in patients with NγLR > 103.6 were higher than that in patients with NγLR ≤ 103.6 (P < 0.0001). NγLR was an important independent predictor of survival for HCC patients and might be a new promising method to identify patients at different risks of early recurrence and survival after curative resection.
