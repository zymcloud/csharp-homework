Objective:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a malignant tumor that arises from the intrahepatic bile ducts. Although the pathologic and imaging features of ICC have been clearly identified, recent updates have addressed the pathologic classification and imaging features of ICC using new imaging techniques. First, a proposed new pathologic ICC subclassification includes perihilar large duct and peripheral small duct ICCs. Second, advanced MR-based imaging features of ICC, such as hepatobiliary phase imaging using hepatocytespecific contrast material and DWI, have recently been described. These imaging features are important when differentiating ICCs from hepatocellular carcinomas. Finally, some imaging features of ICC, such as prominent arterial enhancement or degree of delayed enhancement, exhibit potential as prognostic imaging biomarkers.Conclusion:Comprehensive and updated knowledge of ICC is necessary for accurate diagnosis and could facilitate prediction of clinical outcomes for patients with ICC.
