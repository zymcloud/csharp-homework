Background & aims:O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is a unique glycosyltransferase involved in metabolic reprogramming. We investigated the functional role of OGT in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (NAFLD-HCC).Methods:The biological function of OGT in NAFLD-HCC was determined by gain- or loss- of OGT functional assays in vitro and in nude mice. OGT target factors and pathways were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS), promoter luciferase assay, DNA binding activity assay and Western blot.Results:OGT was upregulated in 12 out of 18 (66.7%) NAFLD-HCC tumor tissues by transcriptome sequencing, which was confirmed in additional NAFLD-HCC tumor tissues and cell lines. Biofunctional investigation demonstrated that OGT significantly increased cell growth (pConclusions:OGT plays an oncogenic role in NAFLD-associated HCC through regulating palmitic acid and inducing ER stress, consequently activating oncogenic JNK/c-jun/AP-1 and NF-κB cascades.Lay summary:OGT, a unique glycosyltransferase enzyme, was identified to be upregulated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-associated hepatocellular carcinoma tissues by transcriptome sequencing. Here, we found that OGT plays a role in cancer by promoting tumor growth and metastasis in both cell models and animal models. This effect is mediated by the induction of palmitic acid.
