Objective:To investigate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with apatinib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal venous tumor thrombus (PVTT).Materials and methods:We retrospectively analyzed 19 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT who were treated with apatinib and TACE at a single center between January 2015 and January 2017. Clinical information on the patients was collected. Adverse events, overall survival, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and disease-control rate based on mRECIST criteria (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, 2008) were reviewed and evaluated.Results:All patients had complete follow-up records and the median follow-up time was 13 months (1-24 months). Among the 19 patients, 63.16% achieved a partial response and 21.05% achieved stable disease. The objective response and disease-control rates for the tumor were 63.16% and 84.21%, respectively, and the objective response and disease-control rates for PVTT were 10.93% and 89.47%, respectively. The median overall survival was 11.9 months, and the 6-month and 1-year overall survival rates were 94.7% and 48.8%, respectively. The median progression-free survival rate was 8.1 months, and the 6-month and 1-year rates were 73.3% and 22.9%, respectively. The most common apatinib-related adverse events were hand-foot-skin reaction, fatigue, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and hypertension, and the most common TACE-related adverse event was fever. No procedure-related mortality or grade 4 adverse events were observed, but grade 3 adverse events were observed in two patients.Conclusions:This exploratory study suggested that apatinib combined with TACE treatment was safe and might improve overall and progression-free survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the potential role of apatinib in hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT.
