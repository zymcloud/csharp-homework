Background:The aim of this study was to construct and validate a nomogram for predicting survival after the intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following an initial hepatectomy.Methods:A primary cohort of 268 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC at Shinshu University Hospital between 1990 and 2010 was retrospectively studied. A nomogram was constructed based on independent prognostic factors for overall survival after recurrence. The predictive performance was evaluated using the concordance index (c-index) and a calibration curve. The nomogram was then externally validated in a cohort of patients from Tokyo University Hospital (n = 296).Results:In multivariate analysis, the following 5 variables were identified as independent predictors of overall survival and incorporated into the nomogram-Japan Integrated Stage score at initial liver resection, platelet count at initial liver resection, time until intrahepatic recurrence, vascular invasion at recurrence, and type of treatment used for intrahepatic recurrence. The nomogram had a c-index of 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.60-0.85) for the Shinshu cohort and 0.71 (0.57-0.81) for the Tokyo cohort. The predicted 3- and 5-year survival probabilities corresponded well with the actual outcomes.Conclusions:The established nomogram might be useful for estimating survival after the intrahepatic recurrence of HCC.
