Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death, necessitating the discovery of serum markers for its early detection. In this study, a total of 180 serum samples from liver cirrhosis (LC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and paired samples of HCC patients who recovered (Recovery) were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) to verify biomarkers. The three-fold crossvalidation was repeated 100 times in the training and test sets to evaluate statistical significance of 124 candidate proteins. This step resulted in 2 proteins that had an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) values â‰¥0.800 in the training (n = 90) and test sets (n = 90). Specifically, fibronectin (FN1, WCGTTQNYDADQK), distinguished HCC from LC patients, with an AUROC value of 0.926 by logistic regression. A FN1 protein was selected for validation in an independent sample (n = 60) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The combination of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and FN1 improved the diagnostic performance and differentiated HCC patients with normal AFP levels. Our study has examined candidate markers for the benign disease state and malignancy and has followed up on the consequent recovery. Thus, improvement in the early detection of HCC by a 2-marker panel (AFP + FN1) might benefit HCC patients.
