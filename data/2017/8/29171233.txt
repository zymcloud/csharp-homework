A new napthalenone, rumexone A (1), was isolated from the roots of Rumex nepalensis. The structure of 1 was elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including 1D and 2D NMR spectra and MS data. Its cytotoxic effect was evaluated using four clinically relevant human cancer cell lines, gastric carcinoma SGC7901, breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231, lung carcinoma A549, and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2.
