Objective:Given the rarity of the disease, the post-resection clinical course of localized pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the outcomes of patients with localized pancreatic ACC who underwent curative surgical resection.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 20 patients with resectable pancreatic ACC who underwent surgery.Results:Altogether 20 patients were included in the study, with a median age of 57 years and a male predominance. There were eight pure ACC, 10 mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinomas and two mixed acinar-ductal adenocarcinomas. Among the 15 patients who were staged histologically, 3, 8 and 4 were at stages IB, IIA and IIB, respectively. Eleven patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil-based [n = 9]; gemcitabine [n = 1]; etoposide plus cisplatin [n = 1]). In a median follow-up period of 27.1 months, disease recurred in 10 patients, most commonly in the liver (90%). Median recurrence-free survival and overall survival were 16.9 months and 75.0 months, respectively. Elevation of cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), lymph node metastasis and neural invasion were significantly associated with poor overall survival (P = 0.007, P = 0.027 and P = 0.016, respectively).Conclusions:Compared with ductal adenocarcinoma, resectable pancreatic ACC has a favorable prognosis after surgery. Considering that distant metastasis is the most common pattern of recurrence, further studies are necessary to define the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for improving survival outcomes.
