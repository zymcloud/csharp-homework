Objective:To determine the effects of selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in the normal canine liver.Study design:Experimental study.Animals:Adult Beagle dogs (n = 5).Methods:Gelatin sponge particles (GSPs) were injected through a microcatheter for selective embolization of the left hepatic artery in normal dogs. Computed tomography (CT) and histology were performed during an 8-week observation period; biochemical analysis data were obtained during a 12-week observation period after TAE.Results:Embolization was successful in all dogs and did not induce any change in the clinical appearance of dogs. Postoperative CT was consistent with recanalization of the artery within 2 weeks of embolization in all dogs. Hepatic enzyme levels increased temporarily after embolization but gradually returned to normal ranges. Histological examinations did not differ between treated and untreated liver tissues.Conclusion:TAE appears safe in normal dogs observed for 12 weeks. Arterial recanalization seems to occur within 2 weeks after injection of GSPs in the left hepatic artery.Impact/clinical relevance:Selective TAE of the hepatic artery was well tolerated in normal dogs. Selective TAE may be applicable to canine hepatocellular carcinoma.
