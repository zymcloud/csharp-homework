Purpose:The aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of very early hepatic metastases (HMs) (<6 months) and their imaging patterns after cephalic duodenopancreatectomy (CDP) for periampullary carcinoma (excluding duodenal carcinoma) and to identify their associated risk factors.Methods:From January 2003 to June 2016, all patients who underwent surgical treatment for periampullary carcinoma by CDP at our institution and with adequate pre- and postoperative CT scans were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine factors associated with very early HM and recurrence.Results:Of the 132 patients included retrospectively, 27 (20.5%) patients developed HMs. The mean time to diagnosis of HM was 103.9±55.2days. HMs were multiple in 81.4% of cases and bilobar in 59.3% of cases; their mean maximum size was 16.7±12.7mm. In univariate logistic analysis, lymphovascular emboli were significantly associated with HM (p=0.02). No independent risk factors for HM were found in multivariate analysis. In multivariate logistic analysis, two independent risk factors were identified for the occurrence of early recurrence: tumor size >23mm on preoperative CT scan (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: [1.2-9.3]; p=0.02) and tumor differentiation (poor vs. good: OR 15.5; 95 CI [1.5-158.3]; moderate vs. good: OR: 17.1; 95% CI: [1.9-154.4]; p=0.04).Conclusions:Nearly one in five patients developed HM after CDP within 6 months with a highly consistent pattern. A thorough preoperative assessment, combining CT scan and MRI with a delay of less than three weeks before surgery, appears essential. A routine systematic postoperative CT scan at 8 weeks is also required prior to initiating adjuvant chemotherapy. The type of surgical intervention does not seem to be a risk factor, although the risk of HM occurrence appears to be related to the lymphovascular invasion of the tumor and maybe its degree of differentiation, elements not assessable by imaging.
