Background:Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) has been reported to be a new treatment strategy for patients with predicted small volumes of future liver remnant (FLR). ALPPS is associated with rapid hypertrophy of FLR but it has a high postoperative mortality and morbidity. Up to now, it is controversial to apply ALPPS in hepatocellular carcinoma, especially for patients with liver cirrhosis.Methods:Between May 2014 and June 2015, consecutive patients who underwent ALPPS with hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis carried out in our center were included into the study. Demographic characteristics, surgical outcomes, and pathological results were evaluated. Subsequently, follow-up was still in progress.Results:The median operating time of the first (n = 12) and the second procedures (n = 10) were 285.0 and 212.5 minutes, respectively. The median blood loss were 200 and 800 mL for 2 stages of operations. The severe complication (â‰¥IIIB) rates for the first and the second operations were 25.0% versus 40.0%, respectively. Six patients with too small future live remnant died of postoperative hepatic failure. On a median follow-up of 16 months of the 6 patients discharged, 4 patients were still alive and of 2 were disease-free.Conclusion:In terms of the feasibility and safety, this study showed that ALPPS in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with insufficient future liver remnant might be a double-edged sword, and careful patients selected was proposed. Too small of FLR/SLV, less than 30%, is not recommended for ALPPS in liver with cirrhosis.
