Integrins are a large family of cell surface receptors that bind extracellular matrix proteins and participate in cancer progression. However, the prognostic value of integrin family genes in post-operative patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this study, we investigated 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in integrin family genes and found that the AG/GG genotypes at rs988574 in ITGA1 predicted a better prognosis compared to carriers of the AA genotype (P = 0.025, HR = 0.69, 95%CI = 0.50-0.96). Moreover, rs988574 genotype combined with serum level of AFP had a better prognostic value in HBV-related HCC patients (P = 0.026, HR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.07-2.85). Furthermore, we compared the expression of 24 integrin family genes in HBV-related HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Survival analysis demonstrated that expression of three of the family members, ITGA5, ITGB5 and ITGA2B, were significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) or relapse-free survival (RFS) of HBV-related HCC patients. Additionally, patients with lower expression of both ITGA5 and ITGB5 had the best OS and RFS (P = 0.017 and P = 0.002, respectively). Our study demonstrated that rs988574 of ITGA1 and the expression of ITGA5, ITGB5 and ITGA2B are potential independent prognostic bio-markers and therapeutic targets for HBV-related HCC patients and may be useful for the diagnosis of HBV-related HCC.
