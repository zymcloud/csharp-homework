Objective:To determine the impact of intraoperative vascular occlusion during liver surgery on postoperative long-term outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients using a meta-analysis.Methods:A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central was conducted to discover relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Studies that reported postoperative long-term outcomes; 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS); and/or 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) for both an observation group (vascular occlusion) and a control group (vascular non-occlusion) were included. Forest plots were performed to calculate the difference between the 2 groups. The Q statistic and the I2 index statistic were used to assess heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test.Results:Four observational studies containing 2917 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimation results indicated that intraoperative vascular occlusion would not shorten the postoperative OS (RR = 1.01; 95%CI: 0.98-1.03; P = 0.763) and would not increase the risk of HCC recurrence (RR = 0.99; 95%CI: 0.97-1.02; P = 0.320) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0% and 12.7%, respectively). Furthermore, Egger's test did not reveal any publication bias (P = 0.405 and P = 0.269, respectively) in this research.Conclusions:Intraoperative vascular occlusion during liver surgery is safe for HCC patients. It does not affect the postoperative overall survival or increase the risk of HCC recurrence.
