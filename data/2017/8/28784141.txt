Background:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains an important public health issue. A20, a ubiquitin-editing protein encoded by tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducible protein 3 (TNFAIP3) gene, is complicated in HBV infection and liver injury. The tandem polymorphisms (rs148314165, rs200820567), deletion T followed by a T to A transversion and collectively referred to as TT > A in TNFAIP3, may attenuate A20 expression.Methods:The rs148314165 and rs200820567 polymorphisms were examined using PCR amplification followed by direct sequencing in 419 patients with chronic HBV infection, 77 HBV infection resolvers and 175 healthy controls of Chinese Han ethnicity.Results:The genotypes and alleles of rs148314165 and rs200820567 polymorphisms determined and the haplotypes constructed were consistently identical, confirming the reliable determination of the TT > A variant. The genotypes of rs148314165 and rs200820567 in HBV patients, HBV infection resolvers and healthy controls are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0. 05). The patients with chronic HBV infection had higher frequency of TT > A variant than healthy controls (6.6% vs. 3.4%; OR, 1.979; 95% CI, 1.046-3.742; P = 0.033). The frequency of TT > A variant between patients with chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma had no significant differences.Conclusions:The TT > A variant of TNFAIP3 may be associated with the susceptibility of chronic HBV infection but not the clinical diseases. Studies in large sample size of HBV patient and control populations are required to further clarify the role of this important variant in chronic HBV infection and the disease progression related to the infection.
