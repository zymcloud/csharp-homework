The objective of this study was to investigate use of the washout rate of hepatocellular carcinoma on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for pre-operative determination of the presence of microvascular invasion. The study included 271 patients who underwent liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma between April 2008 and December 2012, and were examined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound before surgery. Patients were followed up at 3-mo intervals for 3 y. Four washout patterns were classified according to the start time of washout: rapid, portal, delayed and slow. Rapid washout, presence of two or more tumors and tumor size â‰¥5 cm were identified as independent pre-operative predictors of microvascular invasion on multivariate analysis. Recurrence rates for patients with none, one, two or three predictors were 22.6%, 34.7%, 57.6% and 75.0%, respectively. In combination with tumor number and tumor size, contrast-enhanced ultrasound washout rate may have a role in identifying hepatocellular carcinoma patients with microvascular invasion.
