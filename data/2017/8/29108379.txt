Purpose:Limited studies have compared the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant therapies in HCC patients with microvascular invasion (MVI). In this study we assess the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant conservative therapy (CT), trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiotherapy (RT) in HCC patients with MVI.Results:Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients in the RT group have significantly improved RFS (RT vs TACE: p = 0.011; RT vs CT: p < 0.001) and OS (RT vs. TACE: p = 0.034; RT vs CT: P < 0.001) compared to TACE and CT groups. Further, subgroup analysis based on the degree of MVI and surgical margin width showed that patients with narrow surgical margin have significantly longer RFS and OS after adjuvant RT than the TACE and CT, independent of degree of MVI. Multivariate analysis indicated that MVI classification is the independent prognostic factor associated with RFS and OS.Materials and methods:Between July 2008 and December 2015, 136 HCC patients with MVI were divided into three groups according to their adjuvant therapies. Survival outcomes namely relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of the three groups were analyzed.Conclusions:Adjuvant radiotherapy following hepatectomy could result in better survival outcomes for HCC patients with MVI than TACE or CT.
