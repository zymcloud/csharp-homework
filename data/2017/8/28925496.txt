Objective:To investigate the relationship between Ras association domain family gene 10 (RASSF10 gene) and the biological behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.Materials and methods:HCC cell lines were generated with stable overexpression or low expression of RASSF10 protein. A cell line transfected with an empty vector was treated as control. At 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, the cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay, the invasion ability was determined by Transwell chambers, and the scratch assay was used to assess the migration ability. Additionally, cell lines were injected subcutaneously in the axillary fossa of nude mice aged 5-6 weeks. Tumors were measured weekly for 6 consecutive weeks to observe tumor volume, tumor growth rate, weight, and tumor metastasis in nude mice of the different groups.Results:In both the control group and low expression group, cell proliferation rates, cell invasion, and migration abilities, increased over time but decreased over time in the overexpression group. At each time point, data in the overexpression group were markedly lower than those in the control group, and highest in the low expression group. The differences were statistically significant (pConclusions:Like a tumor suppressor gene, RASSF10 can inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of HCC cells.
