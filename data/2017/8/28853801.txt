Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health concern associated with major clinical complications, notably chronic liver disease that can progress with time to cirrhosis or even to hepatocellular carcinoma. The management of HBV-infected patients is complex and requires the close collaboration between the general practitioner and the specialist. This review presents an overview of recently published guidelines, from the European Association for the Study of the Liver, and suggests strategies for initial management and referral of HBV-infected patients for the general practitioner.
