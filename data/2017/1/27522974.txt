Accessory right hepatic artery (ARHA) is a common anatomic variant. This variant has been frequently described in the literature. Here, we report a rare case of ARHA arising from splenic artery depicted during imaging work-up and transarterial hepatic chemoembolization of a 74-year-old gentleman with hepatocellular carcinoma. This patient's tumor was exclusively supplied by this variant artery. Splenic artery origin of the ARHA is extremely rare. This has been previously reported once in the literature on a cadaveric organ donor during dissection. To the best of our knowledge, our report is the first radiologically detected case of ARHA originating from splenic artery.
