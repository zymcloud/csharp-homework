Aim:To provide more information and therapeutic methods about gastric neuroendocrine carcinomas (G-NECs) which occur rarely but are highly malignant and clinically challenging.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics, treatments, and prognosis of 43 G-NEC patients at our hospital between January 2007 and December 2014. The diagnosis was based on the 2010 World Health Organization criteria.Results:Forty-three G-NECs containing 39 small cell carcinomas and 4 large cell NECs with Ki67 > 60% were included in this study, accounting for only 0.95% of all gastric carcinomas. The median patient age was 62 years (range, 33-82) and the male-to-female ratio was 4.4:1. All patients underwent surgery, including 38 curative resections and 5 palliative resections. Among these 43 patients, nearly half (48.84%) of these tumors were located in the cardiac region of the stomach, regional lymph node metastasis was found in 31 cases (72.09%), and liver metastasis was found in 6 cases (13.95%). Follow-up information was got for 40 patients. Twenty-three die of this disease with a median survival of 31 mo (range 1-90). The 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rate was 77.50%, 57.04%, 44.51%, and 35.05%, respectively. Survival was better in patients with tumor located in the cardiac region of the stomach, less than 7 lymph nodes metastasis and no liver metastasis. Five patients did not undergo postoperative chemotherapy, and the median survival time for these patients was 15 mo. For the remaining 34 patients who received postoperative chemotherapy, the median survival time was 44 mo and those received etoposide, cisplatin, and Paclitaxel survived the best. One patient with resected liver metastasis who received postoperative Capecitabine plus Oxaliplatin and Paclitaxel systemic chemotherapy plus octreotide LAR (30 mg intramuscularly, every 4 wk, for 2 years) has survived for 74 mo with no recurrence.Conclusion:G-NECs are mostly nonfunctioning, which lead to a delay in detection. Local and/or distant metastases were noticed in most patients when diagnosed, and they required postoperative medical treatment. Adjuvant etoposide, cisplatin plus Paclitaxel systemic chemotherapy is recommended for these patients.
