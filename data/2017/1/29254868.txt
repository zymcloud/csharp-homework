Background:Indications and efficacy of surgical treatment for liver metastases from gastric cancer (LMGCs) remain controversial. This retrospective study was designed to clarify the benefits of surgical treatment and identify prognostic factors.Methods:Between December 1997 and December 2015, 34 consecutive patients underwent hepatic resection and surgical microwave ablation for synchronous or metachronous LMGCs at our institution. We analyzed their cumulative overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates and clinical parameters to identify predictors of prognosis.Results:Of the 34 patients, 14 underwent hepatic resection, 13 underwent surgical microwave ablation, and 7 underwent hepatic resection combined with surgical microwave ablation. Their OS rates were 1-year: 84.4%, 3-year: 38.6%, and 5-year: 34.7%; and their RFS rates were 1-year: 38.5%, 3-year: 28.0%, and 5-year: 28.0%. OS did not significantly vary among the surgical procedures. In multivariable analysis, positive of both CEA and CA19-9 were independent predictors of poor survival (hazard ratio [HR] 4.51; P = 0.049) and early recurrence (HR 5.70; P = 0.047).Conclusions:Both hepatic resection and surgical microwave ablation for LMGCs are effective and can improve survival in selected patients.
