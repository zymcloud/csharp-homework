Purpose:To assess the predictive value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for disease recurrence after immunochemotherapy (R-CHT) and mediastinal irradiation (RT), using the recently published criteria of the Lugano classification to predict outcomes for patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.Methods and materials:Among 125 patients prospectively enrolled in the IELSG-26 study, 88 were eligible for central review of PET/CT scans after completion of RT. Responses were evaluated using the 5-point Deauville scale at the end of induction R-CHT and after consolidation RT. According to the Lugano classification, a complete metabolic response (CMR) was defined by a Deauville score (DS) ≤3.Results:The CMR (DS1, -2, or -3) rate increased from 74% (65 patients) after R-CHT to 89% (78 patients) after consolidation RT. Among the 10 patients (11%) with persistently positive scans, the residual uptake after RT was slightly higher than the liver uptake in 6 patients (DS4; 7%) and markedly higher in 4 patients (DS5; 4%): these patients had a significantly poorer 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival. At a median follow-up of 60 months (range, 35-107 months), no patients with a CMR after RT have relapsed. Among the 10 patients who did not reach a CMR, 3 of the 4 patients (positive predictive value, 75%) with DS5 after RT had subsequent disease progression (within the RT volume in all cases) and died. All patients with DS4 had good outcomes without recurrence.Conclusions:All the patients obtaining a CMR defined as DS ≤3 remained progression-free at 5 years, confirming the excellent negative predictive value of the Lugano classification criteria in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma patients. The few patients with DS4 also had an excellent outcome, suggesting that they do not necessarily require additional therapy, because the residual 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake may not reflect persistent lymphoma.
