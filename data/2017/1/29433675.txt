Background:Cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2) is not only highly expressed in many kinds of human tumors, but also promotes tumor cell growth via regulating the metabolism of arachidonic acids. CYP2J2 inhibitors can significantly reduce proliferation, migration and promote apoptosis of tumor cells by inhibiting epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) biosynthesis. Therefore screening CYP2J2 inhibitors is a significant way for the development of anti-cancer drug.Purpose:The aim of this study was to identify a new CYP2J2 inhibitor from fifty natural compounds obtained from plants.Study design:CYP2J2 inhibitor was screened from a natural compounds library and further the inhibitory manner and mechanism were evaluated. Its cytotoxicity against HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines was also estimated.Methods:The inhibitory effect was evaluated in rat liver microsomes (RLMs), human liver microsomes (HLMs) and recombinant CYP2J2 (rCYP2J2), using astemizole as a probe substrate and inhibitory mechanism was illustrated through molecular docking. The cytotoxicity was detected using SRB.Results:In all candidates, plumbagin showed the strongest inhibitory effect on the CYP2J2-mediated astemizole O-demethylation activity. Further study revealed that plumbagin potently inhibited CYP2J2 activity with IC50 value at 3.82 µM, 3.37 µM and 1.17 µM in RLMs, HLMs and rCYP2J2, respectively. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that plumbagin was a mixed-type inhibitor of CYP2J2 in HLMs and rCYP2J2 with Ki value of 1.88 µM and 0.92 µM, respectively. Docking data presented that plumbagin interacted with CYP2J2 mainly through GLU 222 and ALA 223. Moreover, plumbagin showed strongly cytotoxic effects on hepatoma cell lines, such as HepG2 and SMMC-7721, with lower toxicity on rat primary hepatocytes. Plumbagin had no effect on the protein expression of CYP2J2 in HepG2 and SMMC-7721, while down-regulated the mRNA level of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2.Conclusion:This study found out a new CYP2J2 inhibitor plumbagin from fifty natural compounds. Plumbagin presented a potential of anti-cancer pharmacological activity.
