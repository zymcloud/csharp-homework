Infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be overlooked on imaging. Radiologists should have a high index of suspicion for this entity in patients with chronic liver disease. Careful evaluation of the portal vein may help the radiologist diagnose infiltrative HCC, due to the high association (68%-100%) of portal vein tumor thrombus with this condition. This article will review the imaging findings of infiltrative HCC, particularly its association with portal vein thrombus, and describe imaging pitfalls and mimickers.
