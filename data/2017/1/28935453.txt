Background:Real-time tissue elastography during open hepatectomy facilitates the differential diagnosis of liver tumors by providing information on elasticity. This study investigated the utility of intraoperative real-time tissue elastography (IORTE) during laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH).Methods:Between 2012 and 2014, IORTE was performed during LH for 21 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), 16 adenocarcinomas and 5 other tumors in 32 patients. The elasticity images were classified into six categories according to the modified criteria on the elasticity type of liver tumors, in which type 1 tumors show more strain than the surrounding liver and type 6 tumors no strain. The concordance of the IORTE findings with those of the pathological examination of the tumors was assessed (The registration no. 1418).Results:Among the 21 HCCs, 20 were classified as "HCC pattern" (type 3, 4, or 5), resulting in a sensitivity of 95.2%, a specificity of 66.7% and an accuracy of 81.0%. Ten out of the 16 adenocarcinomas were classified as "adenocarcinoma pattern" (type 6), resulting in a sensitivity of 62.5%, a specificity of 92.3% and an accuracy of 81.0%.Conclusion:IORTE is feasible and provides useful information on the elasticity of liver tumors in LH, in which conventional tumor palpation is difficult.
