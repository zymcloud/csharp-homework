Porphyrin-containing carbon dots (CDs) possess ultrasmall size, excellent water solubility, and photostability. These CDs can effectively generate cytotoxic singlet oxygen upon irradiation, and induce the cell apoptosis. Photodynamic ability of CDs inhibits the growth of hepatoma. This work not only sheds light on developing functional carbon dots, but also highlights the importance of special-structure precursor molecules in synthesizing functional CDs.
