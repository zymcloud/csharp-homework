Three new minor valepotriate isomers, jatamanvaltrates Z1 (1), Z2 (2), and Z3 (3), have been isolated from the whole plants of Valeriana jatamansi (syn. Valeriana wallichii.). Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis, especially 2D NMR and ESI-MS/MSn. All isolated compounds displayed moderate cytotoxicity against the lung adenocarcinoma (A549), metastatic prostate cancer (PC-3 M), colon cancer (HCT-8), and hepatoma (Bel7402) cell lines with IC50 values of 2.8-8.3 Î¼M.
