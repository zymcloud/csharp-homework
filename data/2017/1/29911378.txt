Objective:The present study aimed to study survival and complications of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C who received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) at Rajavithi Hospital, Thailand.Material and method:The method used was a descriptive retrospective study using data collected from patient medical records from 2008 to 2012. The general information, complications, and causes of death of the patients were presented with descriptive statistics. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:During the 5-year period, our institution performed TACE on 396 patients. While 57 cases were classified as BCLC stage C, only 44 cases had complete records. The mean age of the patients was 56.3 years with an age range from 30 to 75 years. Thirty-six cases or 81.8% were male. Twenty-six cases or 59.1% had hepatitis B infections. Thirty-five cases or 79.5% were Child-Pugh A. The median survival time was 7.1 months. The most common complication was post-embolization syndrome which occurred in 39 patients (88.6%). Liver failure was a major procedural-related complication which occurred in 8 patients (18.2%) and was responsible for three deaths (6.8%).Conclusion:TACE in HCC patients with BCLC stage C at Rajavithi Hospital was an effective and safe palliative treatment.
