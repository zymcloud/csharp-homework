Although Metavir and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scores are typically used to assess the severity of liver fibrosis, the relationship between these scores and patient outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the severity of hepatic fibrosis in HBV-related HCC patients after curative resection. We examined the prognostic roles of the Metavir and preoperative FIB-4 scores in 432 HBV-HCC patients who underwent curative resection at two different medical centers located in western (Chongqing) and eastern (Shanghai) China. In the testing set (n = 108), the Metavir, FIB-4, and combined Metavir/FIB-4 scores were predictive of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Additionally, they were associated with several clinicopathologic variables. In the validation set (n = 324), the Metavir, FIB-4, and combined Metavir/FIB-4 scores were associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients after curative resection. Importantly, in the negative alpha-fetoprotein subgroup (â‰¤ 20 ng/mL), the FIB-4 index (I vs. II) could discriminate between patient outcomes (high or low OS and RFS). Thus Metavir, preoperative FIB-4, and combined Metavir/FIB-4 scores are prognostic markers in HBV-HCC patients after curative hepatectomy.
