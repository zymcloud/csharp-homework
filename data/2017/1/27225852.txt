The biological roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied. miRNA122 represents more than half of the miRNAs expressed in the liver and has various physiological and pathological functions, which include enhancing hepatitis virus replication, regulating lipid metabolism and suppressing hepatocellular carcinoma. miRNAs, whether globally or individually, have been linked with hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, some miRNAs have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Using nucleotide-based strategies, these miRNAs may be developed as potential therapeutic targets. Because changes in miRNA expression can be measured in sera, they may be used as non-invasive biomarkers if they correctly reflect the pathological state of the liver. In this review, we show the biological roles of representative miRNAs in liver disease and discuss the current issues that remain to be clarified for future clinical applications.
