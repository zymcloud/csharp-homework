Background:Several studies have shown that platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a prognostic factor for various cancers. However, there is no study about the role of PLR in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy of metastatic gastric cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to establish whether PLR is associated with the response to first-line chemotherapy and survival in patients with metastatic gastric cancer.Methods:We enrolled 273 patients diagnosed with metastatic gastric cancer. The best cut-off value of PLR to predict chemotherapeutic response was chosen by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Prognostic significance was determined using the log-rank test and multivariate Cox regression analysis.Results:Based on the cut-off value of PLR, patients were divided into a low PLR group and high PLR group. In logistic regression analysis, the low PLR group had a significantly higher disease control rate than the high PLR group had (91.3 vs 76.1%, P=.002), and PLR was an independent risk factor for response to first-line chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR]: 3.256; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.521-6.969; P=.002). The low PLR group had significantly longer overall survival (OS) than the high PLR group had (13.4 vs 9.2 months; P=.020). Multivariate survival analysis showed that PLR was significantly associated with OS [hazard ratio (HR): 1.002; 95% CI: 1.000-1.003; P=.020].Conclusions:Pre-treatment PLR is associated with the response rate to first-line chemotherapy and survival outcomes in patients with metastatic gastric cancer.
