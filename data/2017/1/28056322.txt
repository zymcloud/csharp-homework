Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotinib as first-line therapy in Chinese non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitive mutations. Methods: Patients with stage ⅢB/Ⅳ NSCLC who had EGFR sensitive mutation and had no previous treatment were enrolled into this study. The response rates, progress free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the safety were analyzed. Results: Ninety advanced adenocarcinoma patients were enrolled in this study, 44 patients had partial response (PR), 42 patients had stable disease (SD), 4 patients had progressive disease (PD), with an overall response rate (ORR) of 48.9%, and a disease control rate (DCR) of 95.6%. The median PFS was 14.9 months (95%CI 13.5-16.3) and the OS was 37.0 weeks (95%CI 27.9-46.1). Patients with brain metastases showed higher ORR(P=0.049). Patients with stage ⅢB had longer PFS than those with stage Ⅳ(P=0.007). The most common adverse events were grade 1-2 skin rash (38 patients, 40.9%). Other adverse events included dry skin, oral mucositis, diarrhea and liver function injury. Three patients withdrew because of severe liver injury or skin rash. No treatment related mortality occurred. Conclusions: Icotinib is effective and safe as first-line treatment for Chinese advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR sensitive mutation.
