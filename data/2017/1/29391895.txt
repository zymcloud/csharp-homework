The present study was undertaken to explore the association between the expression of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with clinicopathological factors and survival status, to obtain prognostic biomarkers in patients with glottis laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (GLSCC). The expression status of c-Met and EGFR protein was analyzed in 71 archival laryngeal cancer samples by immunohistochemistry. Statistical methods, including univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, were used to determine risk factors of progression. In addition, survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The present study detected positive expression of c-Met and EGFR in 69.0 and 91.5% of GLSCC samples, respectively. The median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) times of all patients were 42.4 and 81.8 months, respectively, and the 2-year DFS and OS rates were 60.1 and 84.91%, respectively. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that patients with high expression of EGFR or c-Met had a predisposition for tumor recurrence. The expression of c-Met expression was significantly associated with that of EGFR (P=0.001). High expression of c-Met or EGFR was associated with shorter DFS and OS times. Findings of the multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that c-Met-expression may be used as an independent predictor of DFS and OS (P=0.002 and P=0.008, respectively). However, EGFR expression was not an independent predictor for DFS and OS (P=0.352 and P=0.24, respectively). The high expression of c-Met and EGFR was associated with poor survival and are important predictors for prognosis of patients with GLSCC.
