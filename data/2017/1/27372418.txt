Purpose:The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of obesity on radiologic outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:A total of 100 TACE procedures performed in 57 patients (42 men, 15 women) with a mean age of 62 years±8.4 (SD) (range: 39-83 years) were retrospectively reviewed. The 1-2-month follow-up computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examinations was assessed for new or residual disease and radiologic response using mRECIST criteria. Patients were categorized into two groups according to body mass index (BMI). Patients with BMI2 were further referred as to low BMI patients and those with BMI≥25kg/m2 as high BMI patients. Outcomes were compared between the two groups.Results:Low and high BMI patients were similar in regard to age, gender, HCC etiology and stage, and pre-procedure disease burden. TACE for high BMI, compared to low BMI, patients resulted in lower complete response (39% vs. 66%) and higher progressive disease (21% vs. 5%) rates (P=0.04), and higher rates of residual disease (63% vs. 39%, P=0.02) and new lesions in untreated liver (39% vs. 18%, P=0.04) on 1-2-month follow-up imaging.Conclusions:High BMI is associated with significantly more residual disease, new lesions, and progressive disease in patients with HCC treated by TACE.
