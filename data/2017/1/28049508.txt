Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma has a poor prognosis; few patients can undergo surgical curative treatment according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines. Progress in surgical techniques has led to operations for more patients outside these guidelines. Our case shows a patient with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma presenting a good outcome after curative treatment.Case presentation:We report the case of an 80-year-old Moroccan man, who was positive for hepatitis c virus, presenting an intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (three lesions between 20 and 60 mm). He presented a complete tumor necrosis after portal vein embolization and achieved 24-month disease-free survival after surgery.Conclusions:Perioperative care in liver surgery and multidisciplinary discussion can help to extend indications for liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma outside European Association for the Study of the Liver/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommendations and offer a curative approach to selected patients with intermediate and advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma.
Complete tumor necrosis; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver resection; Portal vein embolization.
