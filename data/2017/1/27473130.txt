Background:The survival impact of distal pancreatectomy (DP) with celiac axis resection for locally advanced pancreatic body/tail cancer remains unclear.Methods:A total of 16 patients underwent DP with celiac axis resection, while 76 underwent standard DP for pancreatic body/tail cancer. The indications for DP with celiac axis resection included: (a) tumor invasion of either the celiac axis or common hepatic artery or both [CA/CHA (+)] and (b) tumor invasion of the root of the splenic artery, which is difficult to dissect without securing an adequate surgical margin [CA/CHA (-)].Results:DP with celiac axis resection presented longer operative time and greater amount of blood loss than DP. The median survival time was 17.5 months in the DP with celiac axis resection group and 43.1 months in the DP group (p = 0.040). Among the patients who underwent DP with celiac axis resection, the median survival time was 35.1 months in the CA/CHA (-) group and 13.2 months in the CA/CHA (+) group (p = 0.001). Comparing the patients undergoing standard DP and DP with celiac axis resection with a CA/CHA (-) status, there were no significant differences in either disease-free or overall survival times. The CA19-9 value, CA/CHA (+) status, and microscopic venous infiltration were revealed independent significant prognostic factors.Conclusions:DP with celiac axis resection should therefore be indicated in patients with a CA/CHA (-) status. However, it is difficult to justify the use of DP with celiac axis resection in patients with CA/CHA (+) status due to the poor survival.
