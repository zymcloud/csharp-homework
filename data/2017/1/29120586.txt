Hepatocellular Carcinoma?(HCC) is one of the most common cancer in Egypt. Interleukin-8 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (-251 and +781 SNPs) are proposed genes for cancer susceptibility. Our aim was to evaluate the association of these two IL-8 SNPs polymorphisms and IL-8 gene expression with HCC in Egyptian patients with liver cirrhosis. IL-8 -251 and + 781 SNPs were assayed by TaqMan technique and IL-8 gene Expression study was done by Syber green method in 50 patients with liver cirrhosis (without HCC n=25and with HCC n=25)and 50 healthy controls. The expression of IL8 was significantly high in all patients compared to controls (P = 0.001), and higher in cirrhosis patients with HCC than cirrhosis without HCC (P = 0.003). IL-8(-251) A/A genotype and A allele were significantly higher in HCC patients (P = 0.005 and 0.009 respectively), while IL-8(+781) homozygote T/T was significantly low in HCC patients (P= 0.04). Finally, haplotype A-251/C+781 were associated with HCC.
