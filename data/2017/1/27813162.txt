Background:Directly acting antiviral agents (DAA) have been associated with hepatic decompensation, especially in patients with pre-treatment cirrhosis, but this risk is not well defined.Aim:To determine the incidence of hepatic decompensation, liver transplantation, death and worsening renal function in patients treated with a Paritaprevir/ritonavir, Ombitasvir, Dasabuvir (PrOD), sofosbuvir/simeprevir or sofosbuvir/ledipasvir regimen.Methods:We followed ERCHIVES participants treated with the above regimens for up to 12 weeks post-treatment. We excluded those with HIV, HBsAg+ and pre-existing diagnosis of hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Of 3728 persons on PrOD, 1578 on sofosbuvir/simeprevir and 10 440 on sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, incidence rates (95% CI) of hepatic decompensation/1000 patient-years were 10.6 (5.89-17.36) for the PrOD, 32.4 (20.74-48.16) for the sofosbuvir/simeprevir and 13.0 (9.74-17.10) for the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir. Among those with baseline cirrhosis, these rates were 36.9 (19.1-64.5), 61.8 (38.2-94.5) and 41.1 (29.9-55.2) respectively, while among those without cirrhosis at baseline, these rates were 2.7 (0.6-8.0), 7.5 (1.5-21.8) and 2.7 (1.2-5.4). Advanced fibrosis was associated with increased risk of hepatic decompensation in all groups [HR (95% CI) per 0.5 unit increase in FIB-4 score: PrOD 1.11 (1.07-1.16); sofosbuvir/simeprevir 1.03 (1.01-1.05); sofosbuvir/ledipasvir 1.02 (1.01-1.03)]. There were no deaths. Proportion of persons with eGFR decrease >30 ml/min/1.73 m2 was higher among the PrOD group, but presence of cirrhosis did not appear to affect this.Conclusions:The incidence of hepatic decompensation in persons treated with PrOD, up to 12 weeks after completion of treatment, was comparable to those treated with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir regimen, and was lower than among those treated with a sofosbuvir/simeprevir regimen. Such risk was predominantly observed in those with pre-treatment cirrhosis.
