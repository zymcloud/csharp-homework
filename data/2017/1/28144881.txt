Evidence from recent researchers suggested that RTN4 is a multifunctional gene, including tumor suppression, apoptosis, vascular remodeling, and inhibition of axonal regeneration. The CAA and TATC insertion/deletion polymorphisms (CAA/TATC polymorphisms) of RTN4 3â€³-untranslated regions (UTRs) have been linked to cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), uterine leiomyomas (UL) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the association between these two polymorphisms sites with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) risk was not carry out before. A total of 284 HCC patients and 484 control subjects were recruited for this study. The RTN4 CAA/TATC insertion/deletion genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The ID/DD genotypes of CAA were significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC compared with the II genotype (ID vs. II: OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.10-2.04; DD vs. II: OR = 2.00, 95%CI: 1.15-3.46). Meanwhile, the frequency of D allele of CAA was significantly related with an increased risk of HCC compared with the I allele (D vs. I: OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.12-1.73). The ID genotypes of TATC was significantly associated with an increased risk of HCC compared with the DD genotype (ID vs. DD: OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.23-2.33). The present study provided evidence that RTN4 CAA/TATC polymorphisms were associated with HCC development in Chinese Han population.
