Background:A difficulty scoring system (DSS) based on the extent of liver resection, tumor location, liver function, tumor size, and tumor proximity to major vessels was recently developed to assess the difficulty of various laparoscopic liver resection procedures. We validated DSS in patients who underwent laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (LLS).Methods:We reviewed the clinical data of 124 patients who underwent laparoscopic LLS between July 2003 and November 2015 and validated the DSS in 90 patients who underwent laparoscopic LLS for tumor according to their surgical outcomes. We also developed and evaluated the modified DSS in 34 patients who underwent LLS for intrahepatic duct (IHD) stones.Results:The DSS score ranged from 3 to 6 in laparoscopic LLS for tumors. The median blood loss (P = 0.002) was significantly different among patients divided into subgroups by DSS score. We made modified DSS for IHD stones using factors influencing longer operation time, including stone location (P = 0.002), atrophy of liver parenchyma (P = 0.012), ductal stricture Conclusions:The surgical difficulty varies among patients undergoing the same laparoscopic LLS procedure. The modified DSS developed here can also be applied to patients with IHD stones.
