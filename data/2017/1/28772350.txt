Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a human hepatotropic virus, but many hepatoma cell lines are not permissive to this virus. In a previous study, we observed that SNU-182, SNU-398 and SNU-449 hepatoma cell lines were nonpermissive to HCV. To understand the nonpermissivity, we evaluated the ability of each cell line to support the different steps of HCV life cycle (entry, replication and production of infectious particles). Using retroviral pseudoparticles pseudotyped with HCV envelope proteins and recombinant HCV produced in cell culture, we observed that low level or absence of claudin-1 (CLDN1) expression limited the viral entry process in SNU-182 and SNU-398 cells, respectively. Our results also showed that supplementation of the three cell lines with miR-122 partly restored the replication of a JFH1 HCV replicon. Finally, we observed that expression of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) was very low or undetectable in the three cell lines and that its ectopic expression permits the production of infectious viral particles in SNU-182 and SNU-398 cells but not in SNU-449 cells. Nevertheless, the supplementation of SNU-182, SNU-398 and SNU-449 cells with CLDN1, miR-122 and ApoE was not sufficient to render these cells as permissive as HuH-7 cells. Thus, these cell lines could serve as cell culture models for functional studies on the role of CLDN1, miR-122 and ApoE in HCV life cycle but also for the identification of new restriction and/or dependency host factors essential for HCV infection.
