Background and aim:Circulating microRNA (miR)-122 has recently been investigated as a potential biomarker of various hepatic diseases, such as chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the association between plasma miR-122 levels and the treatment outcomes following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC patients.Methods:We included 177 HCC patients treated with TACE in the study; TACE refractoriness and liver transplantation-free survival were evaluated during follow up. Pretreatment plasma miR-122 levels were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Relative quantification of miR-122 expression (fold change) was determined using the 2(-ΔΔCt) method. MiR-16 was used as an internal control for the normalization of miRNA data.Results:During the mean follow up of 22.4 (range, 1-79) months, 112 (69.5%) patients exhibited TACE refractoriness. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor number (hazard ratio [HR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-4.41; P = 0.001) and tumor size (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.62-4.32; P = 0.000) can independently predict overall TACE refractoriness. High miR-122 expression (> 100) was associated with early TACE refractoriness (within 1 year; HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.12-6.86; P = 0.028), together with tumor number (HR, 22.73; 95% CI, 2.74-188.66; P = 0.004) and tumor size (HR, 4.90; 95% CI, 1.99-12.06; P = 0.001). Univariate analyses showed that high miR-122 expression tends to be associated with poor liver transplantation-free survival (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.95-2.11; P = 0.085). However, it was statistically insignificant in multivariate analysis.Conclusion:High expression levels of plasma miR-122 are associated with early TACE refractoriness in HCC patients treated with TACE.
