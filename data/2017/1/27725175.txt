β-Chitosan from the gladius was enzymatically depolymerized and utilized for the synthesis of β-chitosan nanoparticles using sodium tripolyphosphate by ionotropic gelation. The size and zeta potential of β-Chitosan nanoparticles (β-CNP) were determined. The structural features were evaluated by FT-IR and NMR spectral analysis. The morphological characterization, composition and surface topography of β-CNP were explored by SEM, EDAX and AFM techniques. The thermal and crystallographic nature of β-CNP was also studied. The cell viability of HepG2 cells inhibited by β-CNP was detected in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory concentration of β-CNP was 30μg/ml. Various biochemical parameters such as TBARS and lipid hydroperoxides, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant (SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH) studies proved the anticancer property of β-CNP in HepG2 cells. This study suggests that β-CNP should be a promising drug for treating hepatocellular carcinoma in future.
