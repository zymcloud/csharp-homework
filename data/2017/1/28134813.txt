Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It ranges from fatty liver to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.The most prevalent forms of ALD are alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and alcoholic cirrhosis, which frequently progress as people continue drinking. ALD refers to a number of symptoms/deficits that contribute to liver injury. These include steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis, which, when taken together, sequentially or simultaneously lead to significant disease progression. The pathogenesis of ALD, influenced by host and environmental factors, is currentlyonly partially understood. To date, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation from the gut to the portal blood, aging, gender, increased infiltration and activation of neutrophils and bone marrow-derived macrophages along with alcohol plus iron metabolism, with its associated increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), are all key events contributing to the pathogenesis of ALD. This review aimsto introduce the reader to the concept of alcohol-mediated liver damage and the mechanisms driving injury.
