Long noncoding RNAs can serve as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in human cancer; however, their biological functions and underlying mechanism in hepatocarcinogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we report a novel tumor suppressor long noncoding RNA on chromosome 8p12 (termed TSLNC8) that is frequently deleted and down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. The loss of TSLNC8 is highly associated with the malignant features of HCC and serves as a prognostic indicator for HCC patients. TSLNC8 significantly suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. TSLNC8 exerts its tumor suppressive activity by competitively interacting with transketolase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and modulating the STAT3-Tyr705 and STAT3-Ser727 phosphorylation levels and STAT3 transcriptional activity, thus resulting in inactivation of the interleukin-6-STAT3 signaling pathway in HCC cells.Conclusion:TSLNC8 is a promising prognostic predictor for patients with HCC, and the TSLNC8-transketolase-STAT3 axis is a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
