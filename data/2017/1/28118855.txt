Background:SESN2 plays important roles in the regulation of cell survival, cell protection, and tumor suppression. However, the relationship between SESN2 expression and the clinicopathological attributes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is barely investigated.Methods:One-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR, Western blotting analysis in 15 fresh HCC tissues, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis in a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 100 HCC cases were performed to examine SESN2 expression. Survival analyses by Cox regression method and Kaplan-Meier curve were performed to describe the overall survival of 100 HCC patients.Results:The SESN2 expression in HCC tissues declined dramatically compared with the corresponding noncancerous tissues, and SESN2 expression was remarkably associated with HBV infection (p = 0.019), HCV infection (p = 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.033). Survival analysis further demonstrated that SESN2 expression could serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for overall survival in univariate (p = 0.001) and multivariate analyses (p = 0.003).Conclusion:The data are the first to indicate that SESN2 might be a novel prognostic marker for HCC and that elevated SESN2 expression predicts advantageous outcomes in HCC patients.
