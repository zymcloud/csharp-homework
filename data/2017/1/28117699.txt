New 1-thia-azaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives, their derived thiazolopyrimidine and 1,3,4-thiadiazole compounds were synthesized. The thioglycoside derivatives of the synthesized (1,3,4-thiadiazolyl)thiaazaspiro[4.5]decane and thiazolopyrimidinethione compounds were synthesized by glycosylation reactions using acetylated glycosyl bromides. The anticancer activity of synthesized compounds was studied against the cell culture of HepG-2 (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma), PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma) and HCT116 (human colorectal carcinoma) cell lines and a number of compounds showed moderate to high inhibition activities.
1,3,4-thiadiazoles anticancer activity; 1-thia-azaspiro[4.5]decane; thiazolopyrimidine; thioglycosides.
