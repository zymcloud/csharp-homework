Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health concern that can cause severe liver disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Control of HCV requires vigorous T-cell responses, yet CD4+ T cells in chronic HCV patients are dysfunctional. T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells are a subset of regulatory T cells that suppress T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and the generation of high affinity antibody-producing B cells. In this study, we examined the accumulation of Tfr cells in the liver compartment during chronic HCV infection and defined the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying their expansion. Our analysis revealed a substantial population of Tfr cells in livers of chronic HCV patients that is absent in liver tissues from nonviral hepatitis or healthy subjects. Coculture of PBMCs from healthy subjects with HCV-infected hepatoma cells resulted in preferential expansion of circulating Tfr cells, leading to suppression of Tfh cells. Additionally, coculture of tonsillar cells with infected hepatoma cells lead to an expansion of germinal center Tfr. Notably, expansion was mediated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-containing exosomes released from HCV-infected hepatocytes given that blockade of exosome-associated TGF-β or inhibition of exosome release abrogated Tfr expansion.Conclusion:These results show that liver-derived exosomes play a pivotal role in the accumulation of Tfr cells, likely leading to suppression of Tfh responses in HCV-infected patients. Our study identifies a novel pathway in which HCV infection in hepatocytes exacerbates Tfr cell responses to subvert antiviral immunity. (Hepatology 2018;67:71-85).
