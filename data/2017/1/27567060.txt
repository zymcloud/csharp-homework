The World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) has produced guidelines for the use of elastography techniques, including basic science, breast, liver and thyroid elastography. Here we present elastography in prostate diseases. For each available technique, procedure, reproducibility, results and limitations are analyzed and recommendations are given. Finally, recommendations are given based on the level of evidence of the published literature and on the WFUMB expert group's consensus. This document has a clinical perspective and is aimed at assessing the usefulness of elastography in the management of prostate diseases.
