Purpose To assess the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for lymph node (LN) oligometastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all patients provided written informed consent. From January 2004 to December 2013, 119 consecutive patients with HCC and LN oligometastases (115 men [mean age, 51.3 years; age range, 16-83 years] and four women [mean age, 38.2 years; age range, 23-47 years]) were included in this study. A matched cohort composed of 46 patients from each group was selected after adjustment with propensity score matching. The median follow-up time was 14.0 months in the RFA group and 13.8 months in the non-RFA group. The overall survival (OS), local control rate, and complications were evaluated. Survival curves were constructed with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test. Results Eighty-seven patients had LN metastases located in the regional site, and 32 patients had LN metastases in the distant site. No significant differences were observed in the baseline characteristics between groups after propensity score matching adjustment. The RFA group showed higher 6-month and 1-year OS rates compared with the non-RFA group (87.0% and 58.3% vs 62.4% and 17.9%, respectively; P = .001). The 3-month local control rate after RFA was 84.4%, including complete response in 71.1% of patients and partial response in 13.3%. The complications of RFA were short-term abdominal pain and self-limited local hematoma, which occurred in 10 patients (21.7%) and five patients (10.9%), respectively. Conclusion Percutaneous CT-guided RFA may be a safe and effective treatment for the LN oligometastases generated by HCC. Â© RSNA, 2016.
