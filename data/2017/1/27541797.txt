Two novel Schiff base ligands H2L1 and H2L2 have been synthesized by condensation reaction of amine derivative of 1,2,4-triazole moiety with 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde. Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) of the synthesized Schiff bases were prepared by using a molar ratio of ligand:metal as 1:1. The structure of the Schiff bases and synthesized metal complexes were established by 1H NMR, UV-Vis, IR, Mass spectrometry and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of the complexes was study by TGA. Fluorescence quenching mechanism of metal complexes 1-4 show that Zn(II) and Cu(II) complex binds more strongly to BSA. In DFT studies the geometries of Schiff bases and metal complexes were fully optimized with respect to the energy using the 6-31+g(d,p) basis set. The spectral data shows that the ligands behaves as binegative tridentate. On the basis of the spectral studies, TGA and DFT data an octahedral geometry has been assigned for Co(II), Ni(II), square planar for Cu(II) and tetrahedral for Zn(II) complexes. The anticancer activity were screened against human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (Hep-G2). Result indicates that metal complexes shows increase cytotoxicity in proliferation to cell lines as compared to free ligand.
