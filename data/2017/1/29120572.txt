Cytokines as IL 1? and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tumor growth, invasion, and remote metastasis in various cancers. IL-1? ?31T/C polymorphism in the promoter region has been linked to an elevated risk of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MMP3 polymorphism at 1171 has also been linked to an elevated risk and a highly invasive type of HCC. Studying the association between IL-1? 31C/T gene polymorphism and MMP3 11715A/6A gene polymorphism in cases of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HCC. The study was done on 20 HCV infected patients, 20 HCC patients and 15 healthy controls. IL-1? 31 C/T and MMP3 1171 5A/6A gene polymorphisms was investigated using restriction fragment length polymorphism discrimination assay. Data revealed that the frequency of IL-1? C/T and MMP3 5A/6A polymorphisms was higher in patient groups (HCC and HCV) compared with healthy controls. A significant association was found between IL-1? C/T, MMP3 5A/6A polymorphism and HCC susceptibility. In conclusion, IL-1? C/T and MMP3 5A/6A polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of developing HCC in Egyptian patients.
