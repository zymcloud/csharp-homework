Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of drug-eluding beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in treatment of unrecectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The clinical data of 42 consecutive HCC patients undergoing TACE were retrospectively analyzed, including 20 cases received conventional TACE (cTACE group) and 22 cases received TACE with epirubicine-loaded microspheres (CalliSpheres Â®) (DEB-TACE group). MRI scans were performed 1 week before and 1, 3 and 6 months after initial therapy. The response to treatment, disease recurrence, complications and adverse effects were documented and compared between two groups. Results: There were no significant differences in 1-month, 3-month and 6-month objective response rate (CR+PR) and disease control rate (CR+PR+SD), disease recurrence, complications and adverse effects of interventional therapy between cTACE group and DEB-TACE group. Additionally, there were no significant differences about locoregional biliary injuries, intrahepatic biloma, and newly detected intra- or extrahepatic HCC on MRI between cTACE group and DEB-TACE group. Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences between cTACE group and DEB-TACE group with regard to the short-term response, disease recurrence, complications and side effects. Hepatic-locoregional complications may be more frequent in DEB-TACE group than those in cTACE group.
