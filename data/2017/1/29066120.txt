Purpose:To conduct a large single-institution comparison of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) outcomes in similar groups of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods and materials:From 2006 to 2014, 209 patients with 1 to 2 tumors underwent TACE (n=84) to 114 tumors or image guided SBRT (n=125) to 173 tumors. Propensity score analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to compare outcomes between treatments while adjusting for imbalances in treatment assignment. Local control (LC), toxicity, and overall survival (OS) were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The TACE and SBRT groups were similar with respect to the number of tumors treated per patient, underlying liver disease, and baseline liver function. Patients treated with SBRT were older (65 vs 61 years, P=.01), had smaller tumors (2.3 vs 2.9 cm, PConclusions:Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a safe alternative to TACE for 1 to 2 tumors and provides better LC, with no observed difference in OS. Prospective comparative trials of TACE and SBRT are warranted.
