The aim of the present study was to report the case of a 55-year-old female patient with a sizeable (7.1×6.2 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who succumbed to massive pulmonary artery embolism. The main symptoms included sudden thoracodynia, dyspnea and transient coma. The initial diagnosis was HCC according to the typical abdominal ultrasound and triple-phase abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings, chronic hepatitis B infection and elevated α-fetoprotein levels (1,036 µg/l; normal, 0-20 µg/l). Two days following admission, the patient developed recurrent chest pain and shortness of breath. The electrocardiogram and myocardial enzyme levels were normal, but the D-dimer level was elevated to 7,210 µg/l (normal, 0-550 µg/l). Magnetic resonance angiography and a contrast-enhanced chest CT confirmed that the inferior vena cava and right atrium were invaded by tumor thrombi; the bilateral pulmonary embolism was also suspected to be formed by tumor thrombi. The final diagnosis was HCC with inferior vena caval and right atrial tumor thrombi, as well as massive pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular weight heparin calcium was administered; however, the patient succumbed to pulmonary embolism in
D-dimer; anticoagulant therapy; contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography; hepatocellular carcinoma; pulmonary arterial embolism.
