A series of novel substituted uracil-1'(N)-acetic acid esters (6-20) of camptothecins (CPTs) were synthesized by the acylation method. These new compounds were evaluated for in vitro antitumor activity against tumor cell lines, A549, Bel7402, BGC-823, HCT-8 and A2780. In vitro results showed that most of the derivatives exhibited comparable or superior cytotoxicity compare to CPT (1) and topotecan (TPT, 2), with 12 and 13 possessing the best efficacy. Four compounds, 9, 12, 13 and 16, were selected to be evaluated for in vivo antitumor activity against H22, BGC-823 and Bel-7402 in mice. In vivo testing results indicated that 12 and 13 had antitumor activity against mouse liver carcinoma H22 close to Paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide. 12 had similar antitumor activity against human gastric carcinoma BGC-823 in nude mice compared to irinotecan (3) and possessed better antitumor activity against human hepatocarcinoma Bel-7402 in nude mice than 2. It is also discovered that 12 showed a similar mechanism but better inhibitory activity on topoisomerase I (Topo I) compared to 2. These findings indicate that 20(S)-O-fluorouracil-1'(N)-acetic acid ester derivative of CPTs, 12, could be developed as an antitumor drug candidate for clinical trial.
