Objectives:Patients treated with nivolumab often experience its unique adverse events, called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Regarding the mechanisms of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the occurrence of irAEs may also reflect antitumor responses. Here, we report the clinical correlation between irAEs and efficacy in NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab.Materials and methods:Between December 2015 and February 2017, 38 advanced NSCLC patients were treated in our institution. All the patients were enrolled in our single-institutional, prospective, observational cohort study (UMIN000024414). IrAEs were defined as having a potential immunological basis that required more frequent monitoring and potential intervention. We divided the patients into two groups (irAEs group or no-irAEs group) and evaluated the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS).Results:The median age of the patients was 68.5 years (range 49-86 years); male/female ratio was 28/10; squamous/non-squamous cell carcinoma cases were 10/28; performance status was 0-1/2/3, 7/26/5. Among the overall population, ORR was 23.7% and median PFS was 91days. At the data cutoff, 14 irAEs were observed. The most common irAE was interstitial pneumonia (n=5). Other irAEs were hypothyroidism (n=4), hyperthyroidism, hypopituitarism, liver dysfunction, rash, and elevated thyroid stimulating hormone levels (n=1, each). Patients with irAEs had significantly higher ORRs compared with no-irAE patients (63.6% versus 7.4%, p <0.01). Similarly, the PFS among irAE patients was longer (median: not reached [95% confidence interval {CI}: 91days to not applicable]) than no-irAE patients (median 49days [95% CI: 36-127days], hazard ratio [HR] 0.10 [95% CI: 0.02-0.37, p<0.001]). Landmark analysis of patients who achieved PFS â‰¥60days demonstrated similar tendencies, but this was not significant (HR 0.28 [95% CI: 0.04-1.46], p=0.13).Conclusion:There was a correlation between irAE and efficacy in NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab.
