Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is third leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Evidence suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of tumorigenesis and metastasis in HCC. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of SNHG12 and explored whether SNHG12 can directly interact with miR-199a/b-5p in the progression of HCC.Methods:We determined the expression level of SNHG12 in HCC tissues with quantitative real-time PCR and then studied its clinical significance. The binding site between SNHG12 and miR-199a/b-5p was confirmed using dual luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. SNHG12 was silenced through the siRNA transfection to determine whether SNHG12-siRNA is able to affect cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis.Results:SNHG12 was significantly higher in the HCC tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues. There were direct interactions between miR-199a/b-5p and the binding site of SNHG12. SNHG12 functioned as an endogenous sponge for miR-199a/b-5p to regulate the expression of MLK3 and affect the NF-ÎºB pathway.Conclusion:SNHG12 may serve as a valuable biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
