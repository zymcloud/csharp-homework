Aims:We sought to compare the effects of FIB-4 index and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients undergoing entecavir (ETV) therapy.Patient and methods:A total of 338 nucleosides analogue therapy na√Øve CHB patients initially treated with ETV were analyzed. The optimal cutoff points in each continuous variable were determined by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. The effects of FIB-4 index and APRI on HCC incidence were compared using time-dependent ROC analysis and factors linked to HCC incidence were also examined using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:There were 215 males and 123 females with the median age of 52 years and the median baseline HBV-DNA level of 6.6 log copies/ml. The median follow-up interval after the initiation of ETV therapy was 4.99 years. During the follow-up period, 33 patients (9.8%) developed HCC. The 3-, 5- 7-year cumulative HCC incidence rates in all cases were 4.4%, 9.2% and 13.5%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, FIB-4 index revealed to be an independent predictor associated with HCC incidence, while APRI was not. In the time-dependent ROC analyses for all cases and for all subgroups analyses stratified by viral status or cirrhosis status, all area under the ROCs in each time point (2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-year) of FIB-4 index were higher than those of APRI.Conclusion:FIB-4 index rather than APRI can be a useful predictor associated with HCC development for CHB patients undergoing ETV therapy.
