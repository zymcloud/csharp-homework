Approximately 350 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is associated with morbidity and mortality related to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver failure. Recently, vast improvements have been made with the development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, which are all-oral, are better tolerated than interferon-based treatment, and provide a sustained virologic response in more than 90% of treated patients. This article reviews the new therapies available for HCV infection, with a focus on patients who have chronic HCV with and without compensated cirrhosis. As DAA development continues, more attention will need to be given to special patient populations, specifically to patients who fail treatment due to emerging resistant strains. Considerable challenges yet to be overcome are incremental diagnosis of unidentified patients and linkage to care that is affordable and available to all patients.
