Background:This study describes the epidemiology and clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and it investigates any association between Child-Pugh's classification and HCC.Materials and methods:A retrospective chart review was performed for HCC cases diagnosed between 2008 and 2014 at King Abdulaziz University Hospital. We documented the age at cancer diagnosis, gender, occupation, ethnic origin, HCC etiology, Child-Pugh scores, tumor characteristics, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels at diagnosis, and treatment administered. The Chi-square test was used to determine differences between categorical variables.Results:We included 128 patients. Hepatitis B and C viral infections were documented in 24.2% and 33.6% of the patients, respectively. Patients with tumors >5 cm were more likely to have Child's Class C disease, whereas those with tumors â‰¤2 cm were more likely to have Child's Class A (P Conclusion:Hepatitis C and B infections were the main risk factors associated with HCC.
