During the past two decades, several studies showed reduced rates of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis after interferon-based antiviral therapies respect to untreated controls, even without reaching viral clearance. The recent development of new all-oral regimens with direct-acting antivirals has radically improved the therapeutic management of hepatitis C. Nevertheless, paradoxical, or at least unexpected, high rates of both occurrence and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after a treatment with direct-acting antivirals, have been reported in the recent literature. These findings generated a strong rebound in the hepatology community and are at present still controversial. We sought to compare the hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence-free survival of a historical cohort treated with pegylated interferon/ribavirin and an untreated cohort with a cohort treated with direct-acting antivirals.
