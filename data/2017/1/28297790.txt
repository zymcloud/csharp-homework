Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases in China and manifests as simple fatty liver, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Studies have shown that intestinal flora can affect the development and progression of NAFLD via the "gut-liver axis" . Probiotics are active microorganisms with beneficial effects on the host, and more and more studies have found that probiotics play a positive role in improving NAFLD. They are cheaper, less harmful, and safer compared with antibiotics and surgery, and therefore, it may become a new method for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. This article reviews the research advances in probiotics in the treatment of NAFLD, in order to provide a basis for the treatment of NAFLD using probiotics.
