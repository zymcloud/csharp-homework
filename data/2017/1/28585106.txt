Background:The risk of postoperative hepatic insufficiency (PHI) is increased among patients with significant postchemotherapy hepatic atrophy. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate whether the liver regeneration stimulated by portal vein embolization (PVE) can protect against PHI.Methods:Clinicopathological features of 177 patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by PVE and hepatectomy were reviewed. Degree of atrophy was defined as the ratio of percentage difference in total liver volume (estimated by manual volumetry) to standardized liver volume. Kinetic growth rate (KGR, degree of hypertrophy [absolute % change in future liver remnant volume] divided by the number of weeks after PVE) and PHI events were compared between patients with degree of atrophy <10 vs ≥10%. Risk factors for the PHI were assessed using logistic regression.Results:Seventy patients (40%) experienced significant hepatic atrophy ≥10% following preoperative chemotherapy. PHI rates were not significantly increased in patients who experienced significant hepatic atrophy (5.6 vs 8.6%, P = 0.443). KGR <2%/week (odds ratio, 8.10, P = 0.037) was the sole independent preoperative predictor of PHI. KGR ≥2% was associated with decreased PHI in both patients with <10% atrophy (0 vs 9.5%, P = 0.035) and ≥10% atrophy (2.6 vs 16.0%, P = 0.044).Conclusions:Even in high-risk patients with ≥10% degree of atrophy from preoperative chemotherapy, KGR ≥2% mitigates the deleterious effects of hepatic atrophy and significantly reduces PHI to almost zero. In these high-risk patients, PVE with KGR calculation remains the most important preoperative technique to reduce liver failure after major hepatectomy.
