Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a precursor to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, caused by a Hepatitis B viral infection. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been conducted to find genes associated with CHB risk. In previous GWAS, EHMT2 was identified as one of the susceptibility genes for CHB. To further characterize this association and discover possible causal variants, we conducted an additional association study. A total of 11 EHMT2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were selected and genotyped in 3902 subjects (1046 CHB patients and 2856 controls). An additional eight imputed SNPs were also included in further analysis. As a result, rs35875104 showed a strong association with the CHB, along with the previously reported genetic marker for CHB risk, rs652888 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, P = 2.20 × 10-8 at rs35875104 and OR = 1.58, P = 9.90 × 10-12 at rs652888). In addition, linkage disequilibrium and conditional analysis identified one SNP (rs35875104) as a novel genetic marker for CHB susceptibility. The GRSs (genetic risk scores) were calculated to visualize the combined genetic effects of all known CHB-associated loci, including EHMT2 rs35875104, which was additionally identified in this study. The findings from the present study may be useful for further understanding of the genetic etiology of CHB.
