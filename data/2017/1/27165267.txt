Purpose:To evaluate the effects of implementing an "enhanced recovery after surgery" (ERAS) program on the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of extensive and potentially curative liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We compared clinicopathologic factors, surgical factors, and outcomes of patients who underwent extended hepatectomy (defined as resection of more than two sections) for HCC, before and after the introduction of an ERAS program.Results:Operating times and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter, and total volume infused during surgery was significantly lower, for the ERAS group than for the control group. Although the ERAS group had a significantly lower percentage of patients with retention of abdominal drainage, this group had a higher frequency of abdominal paracentesis in patients without intraoperative abdominal drainage. Oral dietary intake and the ability to walk steadily resumed significantly earlier in the ERAS group. Postoperative serum concentrations of albumin and cholinesterase were significantly higher in the ERAS group than in the control group.Conclusions:The ERAS program was feasible and effective for patients with chronic liver disease undergoing extended liver resection for HCC, because it allowed earlier oral dietary intake and promoted faster postoperative recovery.
