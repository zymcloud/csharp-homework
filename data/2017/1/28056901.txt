Background:The Hangzhou criteria expand the Milan criteria safely and effectively in selecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) candidates for liver transplantation (LT), but some patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria still show poor outcomes due to early tumor recurrence. In this study, the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was employed to differentiate high-risk tumor recurrence recipients, and a new method combining PLR and the Hangzhou criteria was established.Methods:The clinical data of 343 LT for HCC were retrospectively analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the PLR cut-off value to stratify patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) of recipients was compared after stratification. The Hangzhou criteria & PLR method was proposed and its feasibility was validated by ROC analysis.Results:PLR 120 was the most significant cut-off value when comparing RFS of patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria. After stratification, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS of patients exceeding the Milan but fulfilling the Hangzhou criteria with PLR Conclusions:The Hangzhou criteria combined with the pre-transplant PLR can accurately exclude high-risk tumor recurrence recipients; this approach expands the Milan criteria effectively without any sacrifice.
