Background and aim:Plasma renin concentration (PRC) is increased in patients with cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the relation of PRC to (i) portal hypertension, (ii) degree of liver dysfunction, and (iii) survival.Methods:Plasma renin concentration (range 2.8-39.9 μU/mL) was measured after 30 min in supine position. Also, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), Child-Pugh (CPS), model for end-stage liver disease scores and transient elastography values (TE, Fibroscan) were evaluated at this time. Mortality was recorded during follow-up.Results:One hundred fifty cirrhotic patients (age 55 ± 11 years; 73% male; CPS A 41.3%/B 41.3%/C 17.3%) were included. Mean HVPG was 16.6 ± 6.5 mmHg. Median PRC according to CPS was A 15.45 μU/mL (95%CI 1.56-261.5), B 37.3 μU/mL (95%CI 4.29-1317.65), and C 175.3 μU/mL (95%CI 5.3-5684; P Conclusions:In cirrhotic patients PRC correlates with the severity of portal hypertension and liver dysfunction. Moreover, elevated PRC represents an independent risk factor for mortality.
