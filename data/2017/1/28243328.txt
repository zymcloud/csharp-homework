Despite consideration of benzyl isothiocyanate(BITC) is applied to prevention and therapeutic of cancer, the role of BITC in inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) cells is still unclear. In this study, we aim to explore the effects of BITC on the growth, migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. When human HCC cell lines, Bel 7402 and HLE, were treated with an optimal concentration of BITC for 48 hours, the results indicated that BITC inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis of HCC cells; BITC has a significant inhibitory effect on the migration and invasion of HCC cells. BITC stimulated expression of caspase-3/8 and PARP-1, and suppressed expression of survivin, MMP2/9 and CXCR4. BITC also inhibited the enzymatic activities of MMP2 and MMP9. Altogether, BITC was able to induce apoptosis and suppress the invasive and migratory abilities of Bel 7402 and HLE cells. The role mechanism of BITC might involve an up-regulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and down-regulating the expression of metastasis-related proteins. BITC may be applied as a novel chemotherapy for HCC patients.
