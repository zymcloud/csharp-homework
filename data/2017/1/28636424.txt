Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a subtype of malignant liver cancer with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. It is noteworthy that mechanical forces in tumor microenvironment play a pivotal role in mediating the behaviors and functions of tumor cells. As an instrumental type of mechanical forces in vivo, fluid shear stress (FSS) has been reported having potent physiologic and pathologic effects on cancer progression. However, the time-dependent mechanochemical transduction in HCC induced by FSS remains unclear. In this study, hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were exposed to 1.4 dyn/cm2 FSS for transient duration (15s and 30s), short duration (5 min, 15 min and 30 min) and long duration (1h, 2h and 4h), respectively. The expression and translocation of Integrins induced FAK-Rho GTPases signaling events were examined. Our results showed that FSS endowed HepG2 cells with higher migration ability via reorganizing cellular F-actin and disrupting intercellular tight junctions. We further demonstrated that FSS regulated the expression and translocation of Integrins and their downstream signaling cascade in time-dependent patterns. The FSS downregulated focal adhesion components (Paxillin, Vinculin and Talin) while upregulated the expression of Rho GTPases (Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA) in long durations. These results indicated that FSS enhanced tumor cell migration through Integrins-FAK-Rho GTPases signaling pathway in time-dependent manners. Our in vitro findings shed new light on the role of FSS acting in physiologic and pathological processes during tumor progression, which has emerged as a promising clinical strategy for liver carcinoma.
