Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) and cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) have both been implicated in the occurrence and development of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, whether HBx contributes to the stem-like properties of OV6+ CSCs in HCC remains elusive. In this study, we showed that the concomitant expression of HBx and OV6 was closely associated with the clinical outcomes and prognosis of patients with HBV-related HCC. HBx was required for the stem-like properties of OV6+ liver CSCs, including self-renewal, stem cell-associated gene expression, tumorigenicity and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, HBx enhanced expression of MDM2 by directly binding with MDM2 and inhibiting its ubiquitin-directed self-degradation. MDM2 translocation into the nucleus was also upregulated by HBx and resulted in enhanced transcriptional activity and expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 independent of p53. This change in expression activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promoted the stem-like properties of OV6+ liver CSCs. Furthermore, we observed that the expression of any two indicators from the HBx/MDM2/CXCR4/OV6 axis in HCC biopsies could predict the prognosis of patients with HBV-related HCC. Taken together, our findings indicate the functional role of HBx in regulating the stem-like properties of OV6+ CSCs in HCC through the MDM2/CXCL12/CXCR4/β-catenin signaling axis, and identify HBx, MDM2, CXCR4 and OV6 as a novel prognostic pathway and potential therapeutic targets for patients with HBV-related HCC patients.
