Background:A recent clinical trial on the immune check-point inhibitor pembrolizumab demonstrated that microsatellite instability (MSI) is a good biomarker for response to this inhibitor. However, clinicopathological features of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) with high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) are unclear.Patients and methods:A total of 2,439 surgically resected CRC tissues were analyzed for MSI status, and mutational status of V-Ki-Ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF). Stage IV cases were selected, and clinical and molecular features were evaluated.Results:There was no significant survival difference observed between MSI-H CRC and microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC in patients with stage IV disease (3.92 vs. 2.50 years; p=0.766). However, hematogenous and lymphogenous metastasis-dominant CRC with MSI-H demonstrated poor prognosis, whereas peritoneal metastasis-dominant CRC with MSI-H demonstrated good prognosis, (1.33 vs. 5.2 years; p=0.006).Conclusion:Prognosis of stage IV CRC with MSI-H depended on the metastatic pattern. These findings provide useful information for the adaptation of CRC immunotherapy.
