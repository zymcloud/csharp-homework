Orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) has been regarded as the best cure among the three curative treatment modalities. However, when to consider LT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients remains a complicated clinical question. In this article, we will look into the recent updates in the context of LT for HCC, including the timing of orthotopic LT (primary or salvage LT), patient selection criteria, newer prognostic markers and scoring systems, down-staging and bridging therapy, salvage LT and treatment option of post-LT HCC recurrence. Evolution of immunosuppressive therapy and future development of the LT for HCC will also be discussed.
