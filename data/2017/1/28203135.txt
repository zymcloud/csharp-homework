A 42-year-old woman with liver tumors was referred to our hospital. Her condition was complicated by Fanconi anemia, and she had undergone total laryngectomy 8 years ago. On admission, contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed hypervascular tumors in the right hepatic lobe. Ultrasound-guided tumor biopsy revealed that the tumor comprised moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the patient exhibited preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A), complete blood count revealed severe pancytopenia. Eventually, the tumor was successfully treated by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). Both platelet transfusion and systemic administration of antibiotics were performed. She was discharged 35 days after TAE.
