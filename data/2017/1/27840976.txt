Increasing evidence has demonstrated that Notch genes, including Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Notch4, are involved in carcinogenesis. However, the expression and regulation of Notch genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues have not been fully investigated. In the present study, immunohistochemical and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses were performed to examine the expression of Notch genes in normal human liver, HBV-related HCC and paired peritumoral tissues. Additionally, qPCR and western blotting were utilized to investigate the impact of hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) and hypoxia‑inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) on the regulation of Notch gene expression. The immunohistochemical and qPCR results showed that the expression levels of Notch1, Notch3 and Notch4 were significantly higher in HCC tissues than the levels in peritumoral and normal liver tissues. However, no significant difference in Notch2 expression was found between HCC and peritumoral tissues. Among the four Notch genes, immunohistochemical analyses found that only the increased level of Notch3 in HCC tissues was positively correlated with vascular invasion of liver cancer (P
