Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered to be an advancing antitumor technology. PDT using hydrophilic/lipophilic tetra‑α-(4-carboxyphenoxy) phthalocyanine zinc (TαPcZn-PDT) has exhibited antitumor activity in Bel-7402 hepatocellular cancer cells. However, the manner in which p38 MAPK and caspase-9 are involved in the regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the TαPcZn-PDT-treated LoVo human colon carcinoma cells remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, a siRNA targeting p38 MAPK (siRNA-p38 MAPK) and the caspase‑9 specific inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk were used to examine the crosstalk between p38 MAPK and caspase-9 during mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the TαPcZn-PDT‑treated LoVo cells. The findings revealed that the TαPcZn-PDT treatment of LoVo cells resulted in the induction of apoptosis, the formation of p38 MAPK/caspase-9 complexes, the activation of p38 MAPK, caspase-9, caspase-3 and Bid, the downregulation of Bcl-2, the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), the upregulation of Bax and the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c (Cyto c). By contrast, siRNA‑p38 MAPK or z-LEHD-fmk both attenuated the effects of TαPcZn-PDT in the LoVo cells. Furthermore, the results revealed that siRNA-p38 MAPK had more significant inhibitory effects on apoptosis and mitochondria compared with the effects of z-LEHD-fmk in TαPcZn-PDT-treated LoVo cells. These findings indicated that p38 MAPK plays the major regulatory role in the crosstalk between p38 MAPK and caspase-9 and that direct interaction between p38 MAPK and caspase-9 may regulate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the TαPcZn-PDT-treated LoVo cells.
