Objective:The aim of the study was to evaluate outcomes after resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) and concurrent extrahepatic disease (EHD), and to define prognostic factors.Background:There is increasing evidence to support resection of liver metastases and concurrent EHD in selected patients. Long-term survival data are lacking, and prognostic factors are not well defined.Methods:Retrospective review of 219 patients was undertaken between January 1992 and December 2012, who underwent hepatectomy for CRLM and resection of synchronous EHD. Survival outcomes were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors were performed. A scoring system for prognostication was developed.Results:The median, 3, 5, and 10-year overall survival were 34.4 months, 49%, 28%, and 10%, respectively. Disease recurred in 185 patients (90.2%) at a median of 8 months. There were 8 actual 10-year survivors. The site of EHD affected survival, with portal, retroperitoneal nodes and multiple sites associated with the worst prognoses. The size of the largest CRLM, the number of CRLM, unfavorable site of EHD, and progression of CRLM on neoadjuvant therapy were associated with overall survival on univariate and multivariate analyses. Three variables, assigned 1 point each, were used to create an EHD risk score: largest CRLM greater than 3 cm, greater than 5 CRLM, and unfavorable site of EHD. The resulting score was prognostic of overall and recurrence-free survival.Conclusions:Long-term survival is possible after resection of liver metastases and concurrent EHD, but true cure is rare. A proposed scoring system may identify patients most likely to benefit from surgery.
