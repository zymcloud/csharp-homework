Iron depletion has been confirmed as an efficient strategy for cancer treatment. In the current study, a series of 1,4,7-triazacyclononane derivatives HE-NO2A, HP-NO2A and NE2P2A, as well as the bifunctional chelators p-NO2-PhPr-NE3TA and p-NH2-PhPr-NE3TA were synthesized and evaluated as iron-depleting agents for the potential anti-cancer therapy against human hepatocellular carcinoma. The cytotoxicity of these chelators was measured using hepatocellular cancer cells and compared with the clinically available iron depletion agent DFO and the universal metal chelator DTPA. All these 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-based chelators exhibited much stronger antiproliferative activity than DFO and DTPA. Among them, chelators with phenylpropyl side chains, represented by p-NO2-PhPr-NE3TA and p-NH2-PhPr-NE3TA, displayed the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells. Hence, these compounds are attractive candidates for the advanced study as iron depletion agents for the potential anti-cancer therapy, and could be further in conjugation with a targeting moiety for the future development in targeted iron depletion therapy.
