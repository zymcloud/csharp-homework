Background:International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS) proposed the standardized definition for bile leakage (BL) after hepatectomy (Hx) at 2011 to precisely perceive incidence and predictive factors of this critical condition.Methods:We conducted a multicenter retrospective study using the ISGLS definition of BL after Hx.Results:Perioperative data regarding 631 patients undergoing elective Hx for hepatic tumors without biliary reconstruction performed between January 2009 and December 2011 were analyzed. BL was observed in 30 patients (4.8%). (Grade A, 8 (1.3%); B, 21(3.3%); C, 1 (0.2%)). Five independent predictors (diagnosis of liver metastases, prolonged operation, high risk procedures defined as Hx with broad exposure of the hilar Glissonean sheath, low platelet count and high serum total bilirubin on postoperative day 1) for grade B/C BL were elucidated by the multivariate analysis. When the study cohorts were divided into groups by number of accompanying these predictors, the more the accompanying independent predictors, the higher the incidence of BL. Notably, incidence of BL exceeded 40% in patients with four or more of these predictors.Conclusions:Risk stratification for BL after Hx can be achievable using independent predictors clarified in this study. However, proper management for high risk patients remains to be elucidated.
