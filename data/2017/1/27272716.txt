Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread toxic heavy metal and has long biological half-life. It has potential carcinogenic effects on multiple organ systems of human. However, no studies have evaluated the adverse effects of cadmium on incidence of cancer in gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between urine cadmium (U-Cd) levels and risk of gastrointestinal cancer. This descriptive study was accomplished on 111 GI cancer patients as cases and 111 healthy people as control subjects from January to October in Tabriz, northwest Iran, during 2013. Cadmium in urine samples was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer (GFAAS). GI cancer patients had higher urine cadmium levels in comparison to healthy individuals (p < 0.05). The multivariate regression model manifested a significant association between the U-Cd concentrations and the risk of GI cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1.70, 95 % CI = 1.35-2.20). Cases were 70 % more than controls at risk of cancer incidence. Our data indicates an association between U-Cd levels and GI cancer risk.
