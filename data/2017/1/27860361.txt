Background:The risk factors of postoperative complications and prognostic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients aged ≥80 years have not yet been defined. We aimed to identify these factors in this patient population.Methods:This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 625 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy from January 2004 to December 2013. Elderly patients were defined as those aged ≥80 years. Clinicopathological data and outcomes after hepatectomy for 60 elderly patients and 565 non-elderly patients were compared.Results:The elderly group had more comorbidities than the non-elderly group. Liver function, surgical data, tumor factors, the incidence of postoperative complications, disease-free survival rate, and overall survival rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. Results of multivariate analysis showed that the levels of cholinesterase, total cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c were predictors of complications in the elderly group. The Child-Pugh grade, protein induced in vitamin K absence or antagonists-II level, and multiple tumors were significantly associated with disease-free survival.Conclusions:Although elderly patients had more comorbidities, their postoperative complications and prognosis were comparable to those of the non-elderly patients. Hepatectomy may be justified for elderly patients, but it is important to evaluate levels of cholinesterase, total cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c preoperatively.
