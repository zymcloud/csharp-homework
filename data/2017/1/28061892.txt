Background:A ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often fatal. In addition to surgery and transarterial embolization, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) might be another option for treating a ruptured HCC. Unfortunately, conventional RFA has a limited ablation zone; as such, it is rarely used to treat ruptured tumors.Case presentation:This case was a 60-year-old man who had a large, ruptured HCC in which hydrochloric acid (HCl)-enhanced RFA successfully controlled the bleeding and made the tumor completely necrotic.Conclusion:Considering the effectiveness of HCl-enhanced RFA in achieving hemostasis and tumor ablation, it might be a new option for treating large, ruptured HCCs.
