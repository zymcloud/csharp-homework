Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) of hepatocellular carcinoma has been introduced at Aarhus University Hospital. 90Y-microspheres are implanted in the tumour by catheterization of the tumour feeding liver artery. Pretreatment angiography and test treatment using 99mTc-labelled particles followed by scintigraphy ensure a feasible and effective treatment. Post-treatment imaging of radiation from 90Y visualize the localization of microspheres. Currently, SIRT is also applied for liver metastases of neuroendocrine tumours. Future indications may include other liver tumours and metastases.
