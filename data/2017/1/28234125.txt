The optimal timing of the surgical strategy for colorectal cancer (CRC) presenting with resectable synchronous liver metastases remains unclear and controversial. The aim of this study was to compare simultaneous with staged resection, with respect to morbidity, mortality, and prognosis, including recurrence. A total of 107 patients who underwent initial hepatic resection for resectable synchronous liver metastasis from colorectal cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 16.4 per cent in the simultaneous group, and 24.0 per cent in the staged group (P = 0.5486). The 5-year overall survival rates were 70.7 per cent in the simultaneous group and 67.9 per cent in the staged group (P = 0.8254). Perioperative chemotherapy did not have a significant effect. Tumor depth of CRC (â‰¥pT4) was the only key factor influencing prognosis. Postoperative intestinal anastomotic leakage occurred in nine patients (8.4%). On multivariate analysis, simultaneous surgery was shown to be the only independent risk factor for the occurrence of postoperative intestinal anastomotic leakage (P = 0.0163). In conclusion, neither timing of hepatic resection (simultaneous or staged) nor perioperative chemotherapy represented significant prognostic factors. The simultaneous surgery was the only independent risk factor for intestinal anastomotic leakage. Therefore, we recommend staged hepatic surgery for synchronous CRC and liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
