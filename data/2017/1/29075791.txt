Myrmecodia platytyrea Becc., a member of the Rubiaceae family, is found throughout Southeast Asia and has been traditionally used to treat cancer. However, there is limited pharmacological information on this plant. We investigated the anticancer effects of the methanol extract of Myrmecodia platytyrea Becc. leaves (MMPL) and determined the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of MMPL on metastasis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. MMPL dose-dependently inhibited cell migration and invasion in SK‑Hep1 and Huh7 cells. In addition, MMPL strongly suppressed the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP‑2 and MMP‑9). Diminished telomerase activity by MMPL resulted in the suppression of both telomerase activity and telomerase-associated gene expression. The levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) expression as well as the phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were also attenuated by MMPL. The above results collectively suggest that MMPL has anticancer effects in HCC and that MMPL can serve as an effective therapeutic agent for treating human liver cancer.
