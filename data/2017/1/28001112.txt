CASE DESCRIPTION 5 dogs between 9 and 11 years of age were evaluated for treatment of primary (n = 2) or metastatic (3) hepatic neoplasia. CLINICAL FINDINGS Patients were evaluated on an elective (n = 3) or emergency (2) basis. Two dogs with primary hepatic neoplasia were evaluated because of lethargy and inappetence. One dog was referred after an enlarged anal sac was detected via palpation per rectum during a routine physical examination. Two dogs were evaluated on an emergency basis because of lethargy and weakness, and hemoabdomen in the absence of a history of trauma was detected. All 5 dogs underwent thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasonography, with CT performed in both dogs with primary hepatic neoplasia. All dogs had preoperative evidence of abdominal neoplasia, and none had evidence of thoracic metastasis. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME All dogs underwent ventral midline laparotomy and had diffuse hepatic neoplasia that precluded complete resection. Locoregional treatment with MWA was applied to hepatic lesions (0.5 to 2.5 cm diameter) without procedural complications. Histopathologic diagnoses were biliary adenocarcinoma (n = 1), hemangiosarcoma (2), hepatocellular carcinoma (1), and apocrine gland adenocarcinoma (1). CLINICAL RELEVANCE MWA is being increasingly used as an adjunct in the surgical treatment of human patients with primary and metastatic liver disease. Results of the present small case series suggested that MWA is feasible and potentially effective as an adjunctive treatment for appropriately selected dogs with nonresectable hepatic tumors. Further investigation is indicated.
