Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related mortality worldwide. HCC incidences have increased worldwide though more prevalent in Asia and Africa. Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections are mostly responsible of increased number of HCC cases. Biomarkers can help early detection and improve treatment regimen in patients as advanced stage is chemo-refractive with limited treatment options. Potential of proteomics in finding new biomarkers for early detection has been explored more recently. Future developments in this area rely on how efficiently we manage vast amount of data generated by these techniques and speed up the clinical trials to improve patient care.
