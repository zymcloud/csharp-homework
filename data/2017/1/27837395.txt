Purpose:To determine the usefulness of arrival time parametric imaging (AtPI) using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Sonazoid in evaluating early response to sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Twenty-one advanced HCC patients with low α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (≤35 ng/ml) who received sorafenib for at least 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. CEUS was performed before and 2 weeks after treatment, and the images of the target lesion in the arterial phase were analyzed by AtPI. In the color mapping images obtained by AtPI, the mean arrival time of the contrast agent in the target lesion from the reference point (mean time: MT) was calculated. In each patient, differences between MT before and MT 2 weeks after treatment were compared. MT (+) and MT (-) groups were defined as difference of 0 s or greater and less than 0 s, respectively. Overall survival was evaluated between the two groups.Results:In the MT (+) (11 patients) and MT (-) (10 patients) groups, the median survival time was 792 and 403 days, respectively, which was statistically significant.Conclusions:The results suggested that AtPI was useful for evaluating early response to sorafenib for advanced HCC with low AFP level.
