Objective:To investigate the effects of Shiquanyuzhentang (Traditional Chinese Medicine) on the immunologic function of tu-mor-bearing mice and its mechanism of antitumor.Methods:Thirty SPF grade male Kunming mice transplanted with H22 hepatocellular carci-noma were divided into three groups randomly:model group,positive control group and Shiquanyuzhentang group(n=10). Another 10 mice were selected as normal control group. Normal control group and model group received normal saline and distilled water supplementation by 10 mL/kg everyday. Positive control group and Shiquanyuzhentang group received Shengyi(80 mg/ml)and Shiquanyuzhentang decoction at the doses of 8 g/kg and 18 g/kg respectively everyday. After 14 days of continuous administration, the mice were killed and the thymus, spleen index, tumor inhibition rate,peripheral blood leukocytes,lymphocyte content,cell percentage of T cell subsets CD3, CD4, CD8,interleukin 2 (IL-2)in serum,tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α),interferon β(IFN-β) content,lymphocyte proliferation ability and NK cell were measured.Results:Compared with normal control group, the weight of mice and thymus and spleen index of the Shiquanyuzhentang group were increased significantly(P<0.05);leukocyte and lymphocyte CD3、CD4、CD8 and TNF-α were increased greatly(P<0. 05),IL-2 and IFN-β were de-creased significantly(P<0.05). Compared with model group,thymus and spleen index of Shiquanyuzhentang group were increased significant-ly(P<0.05);leukocyte and lymphocyte CD3、CD4、IL-2、IFN-β and TNF-α of Shiquanyuzhentang group were increased significantly(P<0. 05),CD8 content was decreased significantly(P<0.05);NK cell and lymphocyte proliferation were increased significantly(P<0.05).Conclusions:Shiquanyuzhentang can promote the growth of immune organs in mice bearing H22, enhance immune function and is beneficial to the recovery of tumor body.
