Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (US-guided PMWA) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the analysis of prognostic factors.Materials and methods:The treatment and survival parameters of 433 patients with HCC (â‰¤10 cm), who met the inclusion criteria and had received US-guided PMWA in Renji Hospital from July 2010 to November 2014, were retrospectively analyzed. Imaging examination (contrast-enhanced CT or MR) and tumor markers (AFP and CA199) 1 month after MWA were used to evaluate the efficacy of US-guided PMWA. SPSS software was used to perform all statistical analyses.Results:The initial complete ablation (CA) rate was 94.9 % (411/433). Twenty-two patients with incomplete ablation received repeat PMWA, and the total CA rate was up to 98.6 % (427/433). Multiple tumor number, tumor >5 cm in diameter, and higher serum AFP level (>20 ng/ml) were significant unfavorable prognosticators of progression-free survival (PFS). The cumulative 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 83.5, 66.1, and 58.7 %, respectively (median: 43 months). Tumor >5 cm in diameter and serum AFP >400 ng/ml were significant unfavorable prognosticators of OS.Conclusions:PMWA is well tolerated in HCC patients and capable of offering high CA rate. Tumor number, tumor size, and AFP level were significant prognosticators of patients' PFS, whereas tumor size and AFP level were significant prognosticators of OS.
