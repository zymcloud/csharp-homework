Objective: To investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA) for specific-location hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: To retrospectively analyze 496 patients with specific-location hepatocellular carcinoma treated with LRFA from January 2010 to January 2015 in our hospital. There was a total of 652 hepatic lesions with a mean diameter of (2.8±1.3) cm including 397 cases with single lesion and 99 cases with multiple lesions. The hepatic lesions were adjacent to major hepatic vessels, hepatic hilar region, diaphragmatic dome, gallbladder, or gastrointestinal tract and on the surface of the liver, respectively. Results: The 496 patients with 652 hepatic lesions were treated with LRFA successfully.The mean operation time was (48.2±9.6) minutes and the mean LRFA time per lesion was (30.3±8.6) minutes. No severe complications such as bleeding, bile leakage, gastrointestinal tract damage, diaphragmatic injury and liver function failure occurred after operation. The complete necrosis rate of the specific-location hepatocellular carcinomas was 78.4% (389/496) in one month after RFA, partially necrosis rate was 21.6% (107/496) and overall necrosis rate was 100%. In addition, the 1- and 3-year overall survivals (OS) were 95.6% and 88.5%, and progression free survivals (DFS) were 87.9% and 80.8%, respectively. Conclusions: LRFA is a safe, effective, economic and minimally-invasive therapeutic approach for patients with specific-location hepatocelluar carcinoma and has good clinical application value.
