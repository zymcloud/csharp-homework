Ribosomes, which are important sites for the synthesis of proteins related to expression and transmission of genetic information in humans, have a complex structure and diverse functions. They consist of a variety of ribosomal proteins (RPs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs. Owing to the involvement of ribosomes in many important biological processes of cells, their major components, rRNAs and RPs, have an important role in human diseases, including the initiation and evolvement of malignancies. However, the main mechanisms underlying the involvement of ribosomes in cancer remain unclear. This review describes the crucial role of ribosomes in various common malignant tumors; in particular, it examines the effects of RPs, including S6, the receptor for activated C-kinase and RPS15A, on the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.
