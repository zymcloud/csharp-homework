Objective:Maintenance of liver function is important for better outcomes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to examine the effects of oral branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation on liver function, intrahepatic recurrence rate, and incidence of complications after RFA for HCC.Methods:Patients with cirrhosis who underwent RFA were enrolled between August 2009 and April 2012, randomized to oral supplementation with Aminoleban EN (BCAA group) or diet alone (control group), and followed to determine changes in serum parameters and health status. Patients in the BCAA group were instructed to ingest a packet of Aminoleban EN twice daily. Levels of physical and mental stress were assessed using the Short Form-8 health survey. Oral BCAA and dietary interventions were initiated 2 wk before local therapy, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed every 3 mo to assess recurrence.Results:We evaluated 25 patients in the BCAA group and 26 in the control group. The median follow-up period was 3.9 y (736-1818 d). There were no significant differences between the two groups in basal characteristics. Complications were less frequent in the BCAA group (P = 0.03). Event-free survival was significantly higher in the BCAA group, whereas the intrahepatic recurrence rate was significantly lower (P = 0.04 and 0.036, respectively). A significant improvement in the Short Form-8 mental component score was observed in the BCAA group only (P Conclusion:Aminoleban EN may be beneficial for cirrhotic patients after RFA to relieve mental stress and reduce the risks for intrahepatic recurrence and complications.
