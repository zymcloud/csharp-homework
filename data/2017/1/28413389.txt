As the fifth most common malignancy worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequently encountered clinical entity. Symptomatology associated with the diagnosis includes hepatic dysfunction and pain from capsular spread. Additionally, due to its propensity for vascular spread, extrahepatic intravascular involvement can also be seen. We present a unique case of intracardiac involvement of HCC. Originally diagnosed as acute on chronic heart failure, echocardiography revealed the symptom source - tumor obliteration of the right atrium. Clinical case presentation and management, along with radiographic images are presented. A review of the current literature highlights this uncommon presentation and the need for clinical suspicion of cardiac involvement in patients with a history of HCC presenting with heart failure.
