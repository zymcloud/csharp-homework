Ga-PSMA based integrated PET/MRI is emerging as a novel imaging technique for the staging of prostate carcinoma. We report a case of a 77-year-old man with raised prostate-specific antigen who presented to us for Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[Ga-(HBED-CC)] (Ga-PSMA) simultaneous PET/MRI scan for prostate cancer evaluation. A PSMA avid hepatic lesion on the background of cirrhotic liver was noted apart from PSMA avid lesion in the peripheral gland of the prostate. On histopathological examination, the hepatic lesion turned out to be hepatocellular carcinoma.
