Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein thrombosis is considered a relative contraindication for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic factors and management in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Methods: Between February 2011 and February 2015, 140 patients presented to our specialized multidisciplinary HCC clinic. All were assessed by imaging at regular intervals for tumor response and the data compared with baseline laboratory and imaging characteristics obtained before treatment. Results: At the end of the follow up in February 2015, 78 (55.7%) of the 140 patients had died, 33.1% in the 1st year and 20.7% in the 2nd year. The overall median survival was 10 months from the date of diagnosis. Clinical progression was noted in 45 (32.1%). Univariate analysis revealed that, the Child-Pugh score, the performance states (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group “ECOG” 0-1) and the presence of ascites exerted non-significant affects on survival. Similarly, the serum albumen level and AFP >400 ng/ml were without influence. However, patients with =>2 tumors, abdominal lymphadenopathy and serum bilirubin >2mg/dl had a significantly worse prognosis. Specific treatment significantly increased survival compared to patients left untreated (P value = 0.027). Conclusion: Application of specific treatments (curative or palliative) significantly increased survival in HCC patients with PVT. TACE can be considered as a promising procedure for unresectable PVT-associated HCCs. The main predictors of survival in our study were the serum bilirubin level and specific treatment application.
