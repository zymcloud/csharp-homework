Purpose:To review Multi-detector CT findings of seven cases with spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC).Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 7 patients confirmed with diagnosis of HCC. Triphasic CT scan using multi-detector CT scanner was done for all patients. They were 2 women and 5 men. 1st patient presented with metastatic HCC underwent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from vertebral metastasis. 2nd patient underwent only one session of trans-arterial chemo-lipidol. 3rd patient exposed to blunt trauma with rib fissure fracture. 4th patient presented with two HCCs underwent radio-frequency ablation of one lesion. 5th patient underwent FNAC from HCC and exposed to fracture acetabulum. 6th and 7th patients underwent FNAC from hepatic focal lesions.Results:Complete regression of primary HCC and metastases occurred in 1st patient. 2nd patient showed partial lipidol uptakes of HCC with complete regression of HCC on follow up. Incomplete regression of HCC detected in 3rd, 6th and 7th patients. Partial regression of nonablated lesion detected in the 4th patient. Complete regression of HCC occurred on 5th patient.Conclusion:Spontaneous regression of HCC is an interesting phenomenon. It has been hypothesized that invasive techniques and trauma may be linked. They may initiate immunologic mechanisms that may be involved in the regression. More reports and accumulation of such cases should help to clarify the mechanisms, contribute to a further understanding of this phenomenon and may lead to a new treatment strategy for HCC.
