This meta-analysis was conducted to compare transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with TACE alone for hepatocellular carcinoma. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL for all relative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective studies until October 31 2016. Tumor response, recurrence-free survival, overall survival and postoperative complications were the major evaluation indices. Review Manager (version 5.3) was used to analyze the data. Dichotomous data was calculated by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). There were 1 RCT and 10 retrospective studies with 928 patients in this meta-analysis: 412 patients with TACE plus RFA and 516 patients with TACE alone. Compared with TACE alone group, TACE plus RFA group attained higher tumor response rates (OR = 6.08, 95% CI = 4.00 to 9.26, P
