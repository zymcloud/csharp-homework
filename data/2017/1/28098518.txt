To develop Pleurotus eryngii varieties with improved medicinal qualities, protoplasts of P. eryngii were mutagenized using 4-nitroquinoleneoxide. The effects of the resulting variant mushrooms on a human cell were evaluated by applying their aqueous extracts to the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, in vitro and examining any alteration in the proteomes of the treated HepG2. The P. eryngii mutant, NQ2A-12, was selected for its effects on increasing the expression level of Pin1 in HepG2. Pin1 is one of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases known to play an important role in repressing Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Validity of NQ2A-12 related to Alzheimer's disease was shown with an enhanced expression of Pin1 in a mouse brain tissue by injecting the NQ2A-12 extract. The mutant mushroom, NQ2A-12, could be developed as a new variety of P. eryngii with potential to protect against Alzheimer's disease.
