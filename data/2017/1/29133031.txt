Impaired apoptosis and systemic toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs make cancer treatment suboptimal. Thus, there is urgency for drug repurposing which facilitates discovery of safe and effective combination therapy. This study aimed to evaluate chloroquine's (CQ) ability to trigger TRAIL/TRAILR2 apoptotic pathway in thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) either alone or in combination with doxorubicin (DOX). Moreover, its ability to attenuate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity was investigated. TAA was injected in male Sprague Dawely rats (200 mg/kg; ip; 2 times/week) for 16 weeks. After the 16th week, rats were further divided into different groups (n = 10) and treated for 7 weeks. CQ group (received CQ 25 mg/kg/day; orally), DOX group (received DOX 1 mg/kg; ip; 2 times/week) and CQ/DOX group. Liver function biomarkers, AFP, hepatic levels of MDA and GSH, serum CK-MB and LDH enzymes activity were measured. Quantitative, Real-Time PCR was used to measure TRAIL, TRAILR2, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, BCL-2 and TGF-Î²1 genes expression levels. Necroinflammation and fibrosis were scored by histopathological examination. CQ improved liver functions, reduced AFP level and attenuated HCC progression. CQ induced apoptosis via upregulation of TRAIL/TRAILR2, caspase-8, caspase-3 and caspase-8 genes and downregulation of BCL-2 gene. Moreover, CQ/DOX showed marked decrease in hepatic MDA level, serum CK-MB, LDH enzymes activity, as well as marked increase in hepatic GSH level. In conclusion, this work assess the in vivo efficacy of CQ/DOX combination therapy in this HCC model that not only has enhanced anti-tumor activity but it also protects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Nevertheless, more studies should be performed to illustrate the molecular mechanism of CQ's cardioprotective effect.
