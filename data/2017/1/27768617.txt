Purpose:This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-MRI) in predicting eligibility for liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on Milan criteria (MC).Materials and methods:We reviewed Gd-EOB-MRI of 44 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC with cirrhosis for the presence/size of HCCs, vascular invasion, and transplant eligibility based on MC. Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed based on conventional radiological hallmarks (arterial enhancement and washout) or the modified criteria.Results:Among 44 patients, 16 was beyond MC. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of conventional radiological hallmark and the modified criteria for predicting eligibility by MC were 31.3%, 96.3%, and 72.7%, and 68.8%, 96.3%, and 86.4%, respectively.Conclusions:Gd-EOB-MRI showed high specificity but poor sensitivity for assessing transplant eligibility based on MC when adopting the conventional radiological hallmarks of HCC. Our modified criteria showed significantly better sensitivity and accuracy than the conventional radiological hallmarks.
