Background and aims:The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade is a recently emerging alternative of the Child-Pugh (CP) grade. The Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) was demonstrated to be a useful prognostic model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in large prospective cohorts. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of substituting the CP grade by the ALBI grade in the CLIP system and compare the prognostic performance with other existing staging systems.Methods:A large cohort of 1973 Chinese patients with HCC was recruited to evaluate the prognostic performance of CP-based CLIP (CP-CLIP) and ALBI-based CLIP (ALBI-CLIP) systems and nine other staging systems by homogeneity likelihood chi-square, c-index, and corrected Akaike information criterion.Results:The ALBI-CLIP system provided comparable prognostic performance than the CP-CLIP system, which was indicated by homogeneity likelihood chi-squares (ALBI-CLIP 1186.35 vs CP-CLIP 1145.54), c-indices (ALBI-CLIP 0.789 vs CP-CLIP 0.785) and AICs (ALBI-CLIP 15 493.47 vs CP-CLIP 15 534.28). Among 11 staging systems, ALBI-CLIP and CP-CLIP systems were associated with the highest homogeneity chi-squares and c-indices, and the lowest corrected Akaike information criterion. Patients in ALBI-CLIP score 0-4 had better median survival than those in corresponding CP-CLIP score.Conclusions:The ALBI grade performs as well as the CP grade when integrating into the CLIP system. ALBI-CLIP and CP-CLIP systems are the most accurate prognostic models among 11 existing staging systems.
