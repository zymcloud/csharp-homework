This study aimed to explore the effects of RACK1 gene silencing on the apoptosis and proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) MHCC97-H cells. After transfecting MHCC97-H cells with siRNA, RACK1 gene silencing model was established. The cells were divided into blank group, siRNA group and empty plasmid group, respectively. The mRNA and protein expressions of RACK1, cyclin D1 and BAX were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry and FITC-Annexin V/PI staining were used to determine cell viability, cell cycle and cell apoptosis, respectively. The results of qRT-PCR and Western blotting suggested that when compared with the blank group and the empty plasmid group, the mRNA and protein expressions of RACK1 and Cyclin D1 decreased significantly while the mRNA and protein BAX expressions increased substantially in the siRNA group (all P
