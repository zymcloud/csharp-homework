The combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir is efficacious in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but its efficacy and predictors of efficacy in the elderly (â‰¥70 years) remain unclear. In this study, 844 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection, were treated with daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) plus asunaprevir (100 mg twice daily) for 24 weeks. Using the intention-to-treat analysis, the sustained virological response (SVR) rates were 87% and 88% for all 844 patients and 411 elderly (>70 years of age), respectively. In both groups, multivariate analysis identified NS5A-Y93H mutation (
