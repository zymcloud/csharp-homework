Photodynamic therapy (PDT) investigations have seen stable increases and the development of new photosensitizers is a heated topic. Sinoporphyrin sodium is a new photosensitizer isolated from Photofrin. This article evaluated its anticancer effects by clonogenic assays, MTT assays and xenograft experiments in comparison to Photofrin. The clonogenicity inhibition rates of sinoporphyrin sodium-PDT towards four human cancer cell lines ranged from 85.5% to 94.2% at 0.5 μg/mL under 630 nm irradiation of 30 mW/cm² for 180 s. For MTT assays, the IC50 ranges of Photofrin-PDT and sinoporphyrin sodium-PDT towards human cancer cells were 0.3 μg/mL to 5.5 μg/mL and 0.1 μg/mL to 0.8 μg/mL under the same irradiation conditions, respectively. The IC50 values of Photofrin-PDT and sinoporphyrin sodium-PDT towards human skin cells, HaCaT, were 10 μg/mL and 1.0 μg/mL, respectively. Esophagus carcinoma and hepatoma xenograft models were established to evaluate the in vivo antineoplastic efficacy. A control group, Photofrin-PDT group (20 mg/kg) and sinoporphyrin sodium group at three doses, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, were set. Mice were injected with photosensitizers 24 h before 60 J 630 nm laser irradiation. The tumor weight inhibition ratio of 2 mg/kg sinoporphyrin sodium-PDT reached approximately 90%. Besides, the tumor growths were significantly slowed down by 2 mg/kg sinoporphyrin sodium-PDT, which was equivalent to 20 mg/kg Photofrin-PDT. In sum, sinoporphyrin sodium-PDT showed great anticancer efficacy and with a smaller dose compared with Photofrin. Further investigations are warranted.
