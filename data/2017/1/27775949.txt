Purpose:The aim of this article was to evaluate the prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) on preoperative F-FDG PET/CT for predicting intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (IHRFS), extrahepatic metastasis-free survival (EHMFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with very early/early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:We retrospectively enrolled 132 patients with very early/early HCC who underwent F-FDG PET/CT followed by surgery. The maximum tumor SUV-to-mean normal liver SUV ratio, MTV, and TLG were measured for each patient. Prognostic significances of PET/CT parameters and clinicopathologic factors for IHRFS, EHMFS, and OS were evaluated. Cumulative IHRFS, EHMFS, and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Thirty-three (25%) and 21 (15.9%) of 132 patients experienced intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrence, respectively, during a median follow-up period of 38.1 months. In multivariate analysis, none of the factors were significant for IHRFS. Metabolic tumor volume and TLG were only significant factors for EHMFS and OS (P Conclusions:Metabolic tumor volume and TLG on preoperative PET/CT were independent prognostic factors for EHMFS and OS but not IHRFS in patients with very early/early HCC. Therefore, patients with high MTV or TLG should be closely observed for extrahepatic metastasis using systemic evaluations.
