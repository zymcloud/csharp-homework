Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually managed by the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, this technique has been challenged since severe complications have been observed in clinical practices. As a result, clinicians have started to seek other minimally invasive surgeries with equivalent efficacy. The corresponding surgeries were assessed by the five outcomes: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progression disease (PD) and objective response rate (ORR). Direct meta-analysis and network meta-analysis were performed and the results were represented by odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence and credential intervals. Furthermore, the value of surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA)was calculated to provide corresponding rankings.Seventeen studies were incorporated into the network meta-analysis which indicated that TACE + external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and drug-eluting beads (DEB) were better than TACE at controllingPD. TACE + EBRT demonstrated their advantages compared to TARE-90Y.However, network meta-analysis comparison showed no significant difference between the corresponding eight treatments with respect to CR, PR, SD and ORR. Moreover, the SUCRA suggested that TACE+EBRT were better than other treatments at treating unresectableHCC.Based on the present results of this network meta-analysis, TACE + EBRT was more effective than the other seven minimally invasive surgeries and therefore it is considered as the optimal treatment for HCC.
