Dysplastic nodules are premalignant neoplastic nodules found in explanted livers with cirrhosis. Genetic signatures of premalignant dysplastic nodules (DNs) with concurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may provide an insight in the molecular evolution of hepatocellular carcinogenesis. We analyzed four patients with multifocal nodular lesions and cirrhotic background by whole-exome sequencing (WES). The genomic profiles of somatic single nucleotide variations (SNV) and copy number variations (CNV) in DNs were compared to those of HCCs. The number and variant allele frequency of somatic SNVs of DNs and HCCs in each patient was identical along the progression of pathological grade. The somatic SNVs in DNs showed little conservation in HCC. Additionally, CNVs showed no conservation. Phylogenetic analysis based on SNVs and copy number profiles indicated a nonlinear segregation pattern, implying independent development of DNs and HCC in each patient. Thus, somatic mutations in DNs may be developed separately from other malignant nodules in the same liver, suggesting a nonlinear model for hepatocarcinogenesis from DNs to HCC.
