Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is responsible for 80 to 85 percent of all primary renal malignancies. In the United State%, there are about 63,000 new cases and almost :14,000 deaths per year from RCC. Surgical resection of localized RCC can be curative but many patients eventually recur. Immunotherapy appears to be a promising new modality for many malignancies, including RCC. Nivolumab, a specific immunotherapy agent indicated for advanced RCC, may restore antitumor immunity and allow for greater progression-free survival by targeting proteins that negatively regulate T cell immunity. This case study aims to demonstrate the integration of nivolumab into the management of a patient with advanced RCC and provide a stimulus for further investigation and research into this treatment modality.
