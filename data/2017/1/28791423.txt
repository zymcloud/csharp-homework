Background:Laparoscopic liver surgery is seldom performed, mainly because of the risk of hepatic vein bleeding or incomplete resection of the tumour. This risk may be reduced by means of an augmented reality guidance system (ARGS), which have the potential to aid one in finding the position of intrahepatic tumours and hepatic veins and thus in facilitating the oncological resection and in limiting the risk of operative bleeding.Methods:We report the case of an 81-year-old man who was diagnosed with a hepatocellular carcinoma after an intraabdominal bleeding. The preoperative CT scan did not show metastases. We describe our preferred approach for laparoscopic left hepatectomy with initial control of the left hepatic vein and preliminary results of our novel ARGS achieved postoperatively. In our ARGS, a 3D virtual anatomical model is created from the abdominal CT scan and manually registered to selected laparoscopic images. For this patient, the virtual model was composed of the segmented left liver, right liver, tumour and median hepatic vein.Results:The patient's operating time was summed up to 205 min where a blood loss of 300 cc was recorded. The postoperative course was simple. Histopathological analysis revealed the presence of a hepatocellular carcinoma with free margins. Our results of intrahepatic visualization suggest that ARGS can be beneficial in detecting the tumour, transection plane and medial hepatic vein prior to parenchymal transection, where it does not work due to the substantial changes to the liver's shape.Conclusions:As of today, we have performed eight similar left hepatectomies, with good results. Our ARGS has shown promising results and should now be attempted intraoperatively.
