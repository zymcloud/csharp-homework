Background:Liver resection is a well-established treatment for colorectal, neuroendocrine and sarcomatous metastases but remains ill-defined for metastases from other primary sites. This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of hepatic resection for metastases not of colorectal, neuroendocrine, sarcomatous, or ovarian (NCNSO) origin and to identify predictors of outcome.Methods:Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing resection for NCNSO metastases in three western centers. Patients were analyzed according to the primary cancer. Outcomes were recurrence and survival.Results:We analyzed 188 patients, divided in: gastrointestinal (59), breast (59) and "others" (70). Median time to recurrence was 15.3 months, while median survival was 52 months. Survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 78%, 60.4% and 47.8%, respectively. In term of prognostic factors, metastases >35 mm from gastrointestinal tumors were associated with lower survival (p = 0.029) and age>60 years was associated with better survival in breast metastases (p = 0.018).Conclusions:Liver resection for NCNSO metastases is feasible and results in long-term survival are similar to colorectal metastases. In gastrointestinal metastases, size (<35 mm) could be used to select patients.
