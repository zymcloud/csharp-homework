We performed allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with GATA2 deficiency and an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related spindle cell tumor involving the liver and possibly bone. He received a matched-related donor transplant with donor peripheral blood stem cells following a myeloablative conditioning regimen. He achieved rapid and high levels of donor engraftment and had complete reversal of the clinical and immunologic phenotype of MonoMAC/GATA2 deficiency and eradication of the EBV tumors after 3 years of follow-up. Thus, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant results in reconstitution of immunologic function and cure of EBV-associated malignancy in MonoMAC/GATA2 deficiency.
Epstein-Barr virus; GATA2.
