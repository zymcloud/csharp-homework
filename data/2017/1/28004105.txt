Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 2 (UHRF2) is a multi-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase which is involved in epigenetic regulation and plays an essential role in tumorigenesis. However, the role of UHRF2 in histone H3 acetylation has not yet been fully elucidated and few studies have reported its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we examined the correlation between UHRF2 and acetylated H3 in HCC. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis demonstrated that the levels of histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac) were higher in the HCC tissues and HepG2 HCC cells compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues and L02 normal cells. The level of UHRF2 was higher in the HCC tissues compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues, but its expression did not exhibit a significant difference between the HepG2 HCC cells and the L02 normal cells. In addition, when comparing the HCC tissues, a higher expression of UHRF2 correlated with a lower expression of H3K9ac in the HCC tissues. The overexpression of UHRF2 increased the expression of H3K9ac in L02 normal cells (P
