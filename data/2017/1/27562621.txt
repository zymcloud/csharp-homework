Purpose:To perform an external validation of the Assessment for Retreatment with Transarterial Chemoembolization (ART) and α-fetoprotein (AFP), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Child-Pugh, and response (ABCR) scores and to compare them in terms of prognostic power.Materials and methods:From 2000 to 2015, 871 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent transarterial chemoembolization at a tertiary referral hospital, and 176 met all inclusion and exclusion criteria for both scores and were analyzed. Nineteen percent (n = 34) had BCLC stage A disease and 81% had stage B disease. Thirty-nine patients (22%) presented with elevated AFP levels. Overall survival was calculated. Scores were validated and compared with a Harrell C-index, integrated Brier score (IBS), and prediction error curves.Results:Before the second chemoembolization procedure, 22 patients (12%) showed an increase of 1 point in Child-Pugh score and 51 patients (22%) had an increase of ≥ 2 points. Thirty-one patients (23%) showed a > 25% increase in aspartate aminotransferase level, and 114 (65%) showed a response to treatment. Consequently, 127 patients (72%) had a low ART score and 49 (28%) had a high ART score. One hundred fifty-eight patients (90%) had a low ABCR score, whereas 18 (10%) had a high ABCR score. Low and high ART score groups had median survival durations of 20.8 and 15.3 mo, respectively. Harrell C-indexes were 0.572 and 0.608, and IBSs were 0.135 and 0.128, for ART and ABCR, respectively. For both scores, an increase in Child-Pugh score ≥ 2 points and a radiologic response were significantly associated with survival.Conclusions:Both scores were of limited predictive value, and neither was sufficient to support clear-cut clinical decisions. Further effort is necessary to determine criteria for making valid clinical predictions.
