Altered microRNA expression is associated with tumor proliferation, metastasis, and tumorigenesis. In this study, we studied the role of miR-3117 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation and found that miR-3117 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. MTT assay, soft agar growth assay, BrdU assay, and cell cycle assay revealed that miR-3117 overexpression promoted HCC HepG2 cell proliferation and that knockdown of miR-3117 suppressed HepG2 proliferation. Mechanism analysis suggested PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase-like (PHLPPL) as the target of miR-3117. Luciferase reporter assay suggested that miR-3117 directly binds to the 3'UTR of PHLPPL. Double knockdown of miR-3117 and PHLPPL copied the phenotypes caused by miR-3117 overexpression, suggesting that miR-3117 contributes to the proliferation of HepG2 by targeting PHLPPL. Our study provided a target for HCC therapy.
