Background:Intermediate-stage [Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage-B (BCLC-B)] hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) comprises of a heterogeneous population of patients with a wide range of tumor burdens. We therefore formulated a subclassification of BCLC-B HCC using the up-to-seven criteria and tumor markers according to the results of a retrospective analysis of these patients.Methods:This study included 125 patients newly diagnosed with BCLC-B HCC who underwent transarterial chemoembolization. Among them, 39 and 86 were within or beyond the up-to-seven criteria, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to investigate factors that contributed to better prognosis associated with the criteria.Results:Cumulative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival rates were significantly higher for patients within the up-to-seven criteria compared with those beyond (p = 0.034 and p = 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that low concentrations of des-Î³-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) (Conclusion:The subclassification system incorporating the up-to-seven criteria combined with DCP and AFP levels may serve as better predictors of prognosis that may guide efforts to improve treatment strategies.
