Objectives:Aggressive spread and liver metastases are predominant features of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study investigates activation of PDAC circulating tumor cells (CTC) and immunosuppression in the portal venous system.Methods:Portal venous and peripheral blood were collected during pancreaticoduodenectomy from patients with PDAC (n = 21) or other non-PDAC pancreatic conditions (n = 20). Circulating tumor cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and characterized for messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and acetylated chromatin encoding K-RAS exon 12 mutation (K-RASmut). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were identified using flow cytometry.Results:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma K-RASmut mRNA expression in portal venous blood CTC was significantly elevated compared with preoperative and postoperative peripheral blood (P = 0.0123 and P = 0.0246, respectively). There was no significant variation in total CTC numbers between portal and peripheral blood.Portal venous M-MDSC were elevated compared with peripheral blood in PDAC patients (P = 0.0065). M-MDSC increases correlated with K-RASmut mRNA-expressing CTC present in PDAC portal blood (P < 0.0001).Conclusions:Association of MDSC with active CTC in portal venous blood may support immunosuppression within the portal venous circulation to promote PDAC CTC survival.
