Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a disease that is a major health care issue across the globe, includes the deviant expression of miRNAs in its development, progression, and resistance to treatment. We focused our study on miR‑503 expression and its role in HCC. miR‑503 was found in HCC tissues and cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR (RT‑qPCR). Western blot analyses and the luciferase reporter assay were used to determine the miR‑503 potential target in the HCC cells. We used MTT to analyze cell proliferation activity and noted that there was a considerable decrease of miR‑503 in HCC tissues and cell lines when measured against the controls. miR‑503 upregulation decreased expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (EIF4E), and reduced HCC cell proliferation and sensitized HCC cells to anticancer drugs. miR‑503 overexpression hindered luciferase activity of EIF4E 3' untranslated region-based reporter construct among HepG2, BEL-7402, and SMMC-7721 cells, revealing that miR‑503 may increase sensitivity to therapies at least partially through targeting EIF4E suppression of HCC proliferation.
