Long term outcome of ablation-assisted hepatic resection is unclear for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This study was scheduled to compare the outcome of Habib 4X ablation assisted resection (Habib group) with clamp-crush resection (CC group) for HCC. In this study, we retrospectively enrolled 81 patients from the Habib group and 103 patients from the CC group. Oncologic outcomes were analyzed using a propensity score matching (PSM) method. Compared with the CC group, the Habib group had higher levels of Î³-glutamyltransferase (P=0.044) and albumin (P=0.001), larger tumor sizes (P=0.007), shorter operation times (P=0.001), less blood loss (P=0.005), and less blood transfusions (P=0.038). There were no significant differences in complications (P=0.310), recurrence-free survival rates (RFS, P=0.112), or overall survival rates (OS, P=0.203) between the two groups. For the 67 patient pairs selected from the PSM analysis, the Habib group had better RFS and OS (P=0.033 and P=0.014, respectively). A Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that Habib-assisted resection was an independent factor for RFS and OS (P=0.008 and P=0.016, respectively). Furthermore, for the 42 patients with central and large tumors, the Habib group had better RFS and OS than the CC group (P=0.035 and P=0.038, respectively). However, the differences of RFS and OS (P=0.117 and P=0.126, respectively) were not significant among 92 patients with peripheral or small tumors. Hence, HabibTM 4X-assisted resection is safe and provides better survival for HCC patients, particularly those with central and large tumors.
