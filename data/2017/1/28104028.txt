Objective: To investigate the effect of hypoxia inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) on regulating CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis. Methods: HIF-2α-knocked down and HIF-2α-stably overexpressing cells (MHCC97H) were prepared by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and lentivirus transfection, respectively. The expression of CDCP1 protein and mRNA in the above cells was detected by western blot and real-time PCR. The effect of HIF-2α on cell invasion ability was determined by Transwell assay. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of CDCP1 in human HCC tissue samples. Results: Both HIF-2α and CDCP1 were induced under hypoxic conditions. The activation of CDCP1 under hypoxic conditions was dependent on the expression of HIF-2α.When HIF-2α was overexpressed, the mRNA level of CDCP1 was greatly upregulated (5.92±0.28, P<0.05). When HIF-2α was knocked down by siRNA for 48 h and 72 h, the expression of CDCP1 was significantly downregulated (48 h: 0.25±0.04; 72 h: 0.18±0.02, all P<0.05). Moreover, analysis of human HCC samples showed that CDCP1 expression was correlated with tumor-free survival (P<0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the expression of CDCP1 is regulated by HIF-2α and is correlated with the progression of HCC. Inhibition of HIF-2α/CDCP1 may play certain inhibitory role in the metastasis of HCC.
