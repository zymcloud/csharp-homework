Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies. Recently, the overexpression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in many cancers. However, the expression of PD-L1 or PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2) and clinical outcomes have not been fully investigated in HCC.Materials and methods:Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were obtained from 85 patients with HCC who underwent surgery. The expression of PD-Ls (PD-L1, PD-L2) was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis.Results:The proportion of high expression groups of PD-L1 and PD-L2 was 27.1% and 23.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that tumor size (p Conclusion:The overexpression of PD-Ls in HCC patients is correlated with survival and tumor recurrence. Further evaluation of PD-1 and PD-Ls as therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers for HCC is warranted.
