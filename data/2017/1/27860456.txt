The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal trends in locoregional therapy (LRT) use in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients listed for transplant, and evaluate independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in HCC patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database was used to identify HCC patients listed for liver transplantation from 1988 to 2014, and longitudinal rates of bridging LRT were calculated. OLT recipients listed from 2002 to 2013 and transplanted up to 2014, with â‰¥1 year of follow-up were further analyzed. OS was compared between patients receiving bridging LRT versus none, high versus low wait times (HWT vs. LWT), and by geographic region. Bridging LRT use in the US has increased dramatically over 25 years, with more than 50% of listed patients receiving at least 1 LRT in 2014. Of 17,291 HCC patients listed for LT from 2002 to 2013, 14,511 received OLT, mean age 57.4 years, 76.8% male; 3889 received bridging LRT. Comparison groups were similar for gender, race, body mass index (BMI), HCC etiology, and biological MELD scores (P > 0.05). Significant differences in mean OS in regions with HWT/high LRT (122.4 months), HWT/low LRT (104.5 months), LWT/high LRT (104.2 months), and LWT/low LRT (102.3 months) were observed, P = 0.0006. Recipient age, donor age, bridging LRT, and longer wait times were independent prognostic factors of survival from OLT. Increasing longitudinal trends in bridging LRT for HCC patients were observed. Younger age, younger donor age, high wait times, and bridging LRT were significant independent prognostic factors for prolonged survival from transplant.
