Background: Increasing evidence indicates that in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) abnormal gene expression, for example of glypican-3 (GPC-3) and insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), are associated with the occurrence and progression of HCC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the differential expression of GPC-3 and IGF-II mRNAs in HCC tissues with a background of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 cirrhosis, in relation to Ki-67 and alpha-feto protein (AFP) tissue markers. Methods: One hundred and five patients with HCCs who had undergone hepatectomy, were included, after obtaining informed consent. Total RNA was extracted from malignant and corresponding peri-malignant liver tissues, and GPC-3 and IGF-II mRNAs in addition to beta-actin mRNA as an internal control, were evaluated in all samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). Routine histopathological diagnosis as well as immunohistochemical (IHC) staining using monoclonal antibodies for Ki-67 and AFP were also performed. Result: Expression of GPC-3 mRNA was positive in all HCC malignant tissue, with overexpression in 86/105 (81.9%); in respect to the grade of the tumor (1-3 grades), while in peri-malignant tissue it was over expressed only in 20/105 (19%). The IGF-II mRNA was over expressed in only 10/105 (9.5%) malignant and peri-malignant samples. AFP was expressed in 33.3% of malignant samples but absent in peri-malignant tissues. Ki-67 expression was significantly increased in malignant compared to peri-malignant tissue. Conclusion: GPC-3 and IGF II mRNAs may be good molecular markers for HCC, especially with a background of cirrhosis due to chronic HCV infection. Significant correlations were noted with the pattern of AFP and Ki-67 expression.
