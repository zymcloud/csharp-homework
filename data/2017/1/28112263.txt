To confirm the safety and effectiveness of the minimally invasive thermal monitor technique on percutaneous ultrasound-guided microwave ablation (MWA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk locations, a total of 189 patients with 226 HCC nodules in high-risk locations were treated with MWA. The real-time temperature of the tissue between the lesion margin and the vital structures was monitored by inserting a 21G thermal monitoring needle. The major indexes of technical success, technique effectiveness, local tumour progression and complications were observed during the follow-up period. Technical success was acquired in all patients. Technique effectiveness was achieved with one session in 119 lesions based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) 3-5 days after treatment. An additional 95 lesions achieved technique effectiveness at the second session. Within the follow-up period of 6-58 months (median 38 months), the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year local tumour progression rate was 11.1%, 18.1%, 19.1%, and 19.9%, respectively. There were no major complications in all the patients except for the common side effects. These results indicate that the thermal monitor technique can be applied to prevent major complications in vulnerable structures and allow percutaneous MWA to achieve satisfactory technique effectiveness in the treatment of HCC in high-risk locations.
