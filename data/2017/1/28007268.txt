Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are rare and usually appear in childhood and adolescence. These tumors often take a benign course, but tend to reoccur in a quarter of cases and metastasize locally. Distant IMT metastases are extremely uncommon. To our knowledge, metastatic spread to the heart has not been reported. We present a case of a 43-year-old woman with small intestinal IMT metastatic spread to the cavity of the left ventricle, stomach, liver, vertebra, and pelvic bones. The cardiac tumor was resected, and the patient survived for 9 months. She dies because the progression of IMT at other sites.
