Feline mammary carcinoma (FMC) is similar to human breast cancer in the late age of onset, incidence, histopathologic features, biological behavior, and pattern of metastasis. Therefore, FMC has been proposed as a relevant model for aggressive human breast cancer. The goals of this study were to develop a nude mouse model of FMC tumor growth and metastasis and to measure the expression of genes responsible for lymphangiogenesis, angiogenesis, tumor progression, and lymph node metastasis in FMC tissues and cell lines. Two primary FMC tissues were injected subcutaneously, and 6 FMC cell lines were injected into 3 sites (subcutaneous, intratibial, and intracardiac) in nude mice. Tumors and metastases were monitored using bioluminescent imaging and characterized by gross necropsy, radiology, and histopathology. Molecular characterization of invasion and metastasis genes in FMC was conducted using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 6 primary FMC tissues, 2 subcutaneous FMC xenografts, and 6 FMC cell lines. The histologic appearance of the subcutaneous xenografts resembled the primary tumors. No metastasis was evident following subcutaneous injection of tumor tissues and cell lines, whereas lung, brain, liver, kidney, eye, and bone metastases were confirmed following intratibial and intracardiac injection of FMC cell lines. Finally, 15 genes were differentially expressed in the FMC tissues and cell lines. The highly expressed genes in all samples were PDGFA, PDGFB, PDGFC, FGF2, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, VEGFD, VEGFR3, and MYOF. Three genes ( PDGFD, ANGPT2, and VEGFC) were confirmed to be of stromal origin. This investigation demonstrated the usefulness of nude mouse models of experimental FMC and identified molecular targets of FMC progression and metastasis.
