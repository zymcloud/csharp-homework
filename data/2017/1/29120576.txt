Occult Hepatitis B infection (OBI), defined as the presence of serum HBV DNA without detectable HBsAg, can be classified into seropositive OBI [anti-HBc and/or anti-hepatitis B surface (anti- HBs) positive] and seronegative OBI (anti-HBc and anti- HBs negative). We examined the role of anti-HBc as a screening test for OBI in HCV patients with chronic liver diseases and evaluated the possible impact of OBI on liver disease progression. 90 patients with hepatitis C related chronic liver diseases (CLD) and negative for HBsAg were divided into three equal groups; chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients were tested for anti-HBc by ELISA and by PCR for S-gene. Total anti-HBc was found in 26 patients (28.9%). 8 patients (8.9%) had positive serum HBV DNA. Of these, 2 were positive for anti-HBc and 6 negative for anti-HBc. No correlation between OBI and severity of HCV related CLD was observed. In conclusion, as OBI was not associated with total anti-HBc, it is invaluable surrogate marker for OBI detection.
