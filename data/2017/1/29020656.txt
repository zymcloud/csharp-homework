Four novel water-soluble Cu(II) derivatives based on the meso-10, 15, 20-Tris (N-methyl-X-pyridyl)-5-(4'-salicyloylhydrazone) metalloporphyrin ligands (X=4, M=Zn(1) Co(2); X=2, M=Zn(3), Co(4)), have been prepared and isolated. Various physicochemical techniques indicate that complex 2 interacts with calf thymus DNA stronger than the others through partial intercalation, suggesting that Co(II) has no axial ligands at porphyrin core plays a crucial role, interestingly, 2 exhibits higher DNA binding affinity compared to 4, which could be ascribed to the influences of peripheral electronic effect of porphyrin ring. Cytotoxicity studies manifest all conjugates possess superior cytotoxicity towards non-small cell lung cancer (A549) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) but weak toxicity for human normal breast cells (Hs 578Bst) boiled down to the tumor selectivity of porphyrin. In addition, the IC50 value of 1 is lower than its analogues against HepG2 cells when cultivated 72h, thus the effects of representative complex 1 on cell morphological and cell cycle have been tailed.
