Repeat transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) becomes more challenging for patients with intrahepatic biloma following TACE for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical course, incidence, imaging features and outcome and to explore the reasonable therapy scheme for intrahepatic biloma following TACE for HCC.A total of 4,695 TACE procedures were performed for 1,923 patients with HCC. Twenty patients with intrahepatic biloma following TACE were studied retrospectively. The incidence of intrahepatic biloma was 1.04% in this study. The 20 patients underwent 55 TACE procedures (mean, 2.75). Portal vein invasion was found in half of the patients. Eleven patients developed round solitary or multiple cystic biloma, 6 patients had branched biloma and 3 patients developed both cystic and branched biloma. Percutaneous drainage was applied for 4 patients. One patient underwent partial hepatectomy and one mortality occurred due to progressive biloma and multiple organ failure. Although severe intrahepatic biloma following TACE is rare, the procedure should be performed with caution. Timely and appropriate management, including percutaneous drainage, partial hepatectomy and antibiotic administration should be performed in the case of any signs of infection.
