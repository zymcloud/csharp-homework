Aim:To investigate the prospective importance of serum micro (mi)RNAs (miR-125b, miR-138b, miR-1269, miR-214-5p, miR-494, miR375 and miR-145) as early biomarkers for the diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Two-hundred and fifty HCV4a patients, 224 HCV4a-HCC patients, and 84 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Expression levels of miR214-5p, miR-125b, miR-1269 and miR-375 were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR.Results:Expression of the selected miRNAs in serum was significantly lower in HCC patients than in the healthy controls, except for miR-1269 and miR-494. There was a significant difference between HCC and HCV patients, in particular for HCC and late stage fibrosis, rather than HCV patients and early fibrosis. It is obvious that miR-1269 was significantly upregulated in HCC cases compared to hepatic fibrosis cases. Each miRNA can show HCC progression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the tested panel of miRNAs (miR214-5p, miR-125b, miR-1269 and miR-375) represent accurate and specific indictors of HCC development.Conclusion:This study presents a panel of miRNAs with strong power as putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HCV-induced HCC. Moreover, miR-214-5p and miR-1269 could be considered as early biomarkers for tracking the progress of liver fibrosis to HCC.
