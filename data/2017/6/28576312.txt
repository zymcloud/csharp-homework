Congenital porto-caval shunt is a rare anomaly that can result in direct shunt-related complications (encephalopathy, pulmonary hypertension) or indirect complications such as the development of benign or malignant hepatic neoplasms. Treatment consists of management of the complications and occlusion of the porto-caval shunt in one or two stages by either a surgical or an interventional radiology approach.
