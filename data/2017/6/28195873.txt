Background and aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognostic scores could be useful in addition to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system to clarify patient prognosis and guide treatment decision. The NIACE (tumor Nodularity, Infiltrative nature of the tumor, serum Alpha-fetoprotein level, Child-Pugh stage, ECOG performance status) score distinguishes different prognosis groups among BCLC A, B, and C HCC patients. Our aims are to evaluate the NIACE score and its additive value in two HCC cohorts treated either by surgery or by chemoembolization, and then according to the BCLC recommendations.Patients and methods:This was a retrospective multicenter study with two BCLC A, B, and C HCC cohorts treated either by surgery (n=207) or by chemoembolization (n=168) carried out between 2008 and 2013. We studied survival time according to the baseline NIACE score and compared it with the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score and the BCLC system.Results:The NIACE score differentiates between subgroups of patients with different prognosis within each BCLC class. Among BCLC A patients treated by surgery and BCLC B patients treated by chemoembolization, the NIACE score differentiates between two subgroups with a significant difference in survival time: 68 (55-81) months versus 35 (21-56) months (P=0.0004) and 20 (17-24) months versus 13 (7-17) months (P=0.0008), respectively. Among those subgroups, the NIACE score has a significantly better prognostic value than the BCLC system or the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program score.Conclusion:In this study, among HCC patients treated according to the BCLC recommendations, the NIACE score predicts more accurately than any other system the survival time.
