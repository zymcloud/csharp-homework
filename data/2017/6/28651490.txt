Angiogenesis plays important roles in progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. The antiangiogenic mechanisms of vitexicarpine are not fully defined. Therefore, we conducted the following study to evaluate the antiangiogenic mechanism and antitumor activity of vitexicarpine in vivo model of hepatocellular carcinoma through modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. Hepatocellular carcinoma was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by thioacetamide. Hepatocellular carcinoma was assessed by measuring serum alpha-fetoprotein and investigating liver sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Hepatocellular carcinoma rats were injected with vitexicarpine (150 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. Hepatic vascular endothelial growth factor was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Protein and expression of hepatic phospho-Ser473-AKT (p-AKT) and phospho-Tyr419-Src (p-Src) were determined. The apoptotic pathway was evaluated by assessment of protein expression of caspase-3. Vitexicarpine increased rats' survival time and decreased serum alpha-fetoprotein as well as it ameliorated fibrosis and massive hepatic tissue breakdown. It attenuated hepatocellular carcinoma-induced protein and gene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, p-AKT, p-Src, and caspase-3. In conclusion, this study suggests that vitexicarpine possesses both antiangiogenic and antitumor activities through inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, p-AKT/AKT, and p-Src with subsequent inhibition of apoptotic pathway.
