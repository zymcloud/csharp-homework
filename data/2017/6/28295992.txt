This meta-analysis compared the effects of liver transplantation (LT) and liver resection (LR) on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) small transplantable HCC or within Milan criteria. Articles comparing LR with LT for HCC, based on Milan criteria or small size, published up to June 2015 were selected, and a meta-analysis was performed. No randomized controlled trial has been published to date comparing survival outcomes in patients with HCC who underwent LR and LT. Nine studies were identified, including 570 patients who underwent LR and 861 who underwent LT. For HCC within the Milan criteria, the 1-year OS rates following LR and LT were 84.5% (473/560) and 84.4% (710/841), respectively (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.33; P = 0.8), and the 5-year OS rates were 47.9% (273/570) and 59.3% (509/858), respectively (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.35-1.02; P = 0.06). One-year DFS rates were similar (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.39-2.61; P = 1.00), whereas the 3-year DFS rate was significantly lower in the LR group (54.4%, 210/386) than in the LT group (74.2%, 317/427; OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.80; P = 0.02), and the 5-year DFS rate was significantly lower for LR than LT (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.53; P
