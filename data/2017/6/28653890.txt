This study aimed to explore the clinical significance and prognostic value of Fra-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after curative resection. Fra-1 expression was investigated using a combination of techniques: immunohistochemistry for 66 samples of hepatocellular carcinoma and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays for 19 matched hepatocellular carcinoma specimens. Fra-1 was present in 38 of 66 (57.6%) tumor tissues, with intense staining in the nuclei. There was also positive staining in 14 of 66 (21.2%) adjacent peritumoral tissues, with weak staining in the cytoplasm. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays confirmed higher expression of Fra-1 messenger RNA and Fra-1 protein in tumor tissues than adjacent non-tumor tissues for 19 hepatocellular carcinoma samples (p
