Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually develops in chronically damaged liver. We investigated hepatic reserves during chemotherapy of patients with advanced HCC and compensated liver function to evaluate the effect on patients' outcomes of maintaining hepatic reserve after chemotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 190 patients with Child-Pugh A with advanced HCC who were treated with sorafenib or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). We investigated the Child-Pugh score and albumin-bilirubin grade for hepatic reserve, and evaluated the effect of the change in Child-Pugh scores on patients' outcomes. Subjects were treated with sorafenib (n = 59) or HAIC (n = 131). Of patients with Child-Pugh data, 66.7% maintained or improved their Child-Pugh score after 4 weeks. Treatment with HAIC was the only factor that significantly contributed to maintaining Child-Pugh scores after 4 weeks. The overall survival of patients with a higher Child-Pugh score after 4 weeks was shorter than that of patients whose Child-Pugh classification was unchanged. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that an increased Child-Pugh score after 4 weeks was one of the independent unfavorable prognostic factors. The change of hepatic reserve as a function of albumin-bilirubin grade did not significantly correlate with patients' outcomes. Maintaining the Child-Pugh score during chemotherapy benefits the outcomes of patients with advanced HCC, even those with sufficient hepatic reserve.
