Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) has been reported as a tumor suppressor in some kinds of cancers. In the present study, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) microarray analysis showed that RUNX3 expression was significantly lower in HCC tissues compared with that in adjacent non-tumor tissues, and was negatively associated with metastasis and TNM stage. RUNX3 was an independently prognostic factor for 5-year overall and disease-free patient survival. Mechanically, RUNX3 repressed metastasis and invasion of HCC, and increased E-cadherin expression. RUNX3 also repressed microRNA-186 to increase E-cadherin expression. We demonstrated that miR-186 mimics attenuated RUNX3-induced increase of E-cadherin and inhibition of metastasis and invasion. In conclusion, RUNX3 suppressed HCC cell migration and invasion by targeting the miR-186/E-cadherin/EMT pathway. RUNX3 may be recommended as an effective prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for patients with HCC.
