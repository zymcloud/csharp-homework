Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and the third highest cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. The treatment of HCC is complicated by its variable biological behavior and the frequent coexistence of chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. To date, multiple treatment modalities have been developed according to the stage of the tumor and the hepatic functional reserve, including transarterial treatments such as transarterial chemoembolization, transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE), and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). We conducted a phase I and II study of the combination therapy with double platinum agents, miriplatin and cisplatin, and confirmed its safety and efficacy. Here, we describe two cases of unresectable HCC who were successfully treated by miriplatin-TOCE/cisplatin-HAIC combination therapy, resulting in complete responses with no significant adverse events. This report will provide that the combination therapy can be the therapeutic option for HCC patients in the advanced stage.
