Long non-coding RNAs are classified as a kind of RNA, which are longer than 200 nucleotides in length and cannot be translated into proteins. Multiple studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs are involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and metastasis. Among numerous long non-coding RNAs, we focus on Sprouty4-Intron 1 (SPRY4-IT1), a well-known long non-coding RNA that is overexpressed in various kinds of tumor tissues and cell lines. Accumulating evidences show that SPRY4-IT1 was dysregulated in various cancers, including melanoma, breast cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and amplification of SPRY4-IT1 was associated with different clinicopathological features of cancer patients. Importantly, SPRY4-IT1 exerts important roles in tumor progression and metastasis. However, detailed molecular mechanisms of SPRY4-IT1 in cancer progression and metastasis were poorly understood. In this review, we have focused on the characteristics of SPRY4-IT1 and illustrated the biological function and mechanism of SPRY4-IT1 in cancer development.
