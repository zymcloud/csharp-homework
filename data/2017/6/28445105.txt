Background:Open esophagectomy is a high-risk procedure in patients with liver cirrhosis. With the advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques, the overall morbidity and mortality rates of esophagectomy have decreased. The aim of this study was to describe short-term outcomes of minimally invasive esophagectomy in patients with proven liver cirrhosis.Methods:Retrospective observational cohort study. Demographics, preoperative clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy for carcinoma were analyzed. Patients with concomitant liver cirrhosis were compared to patients without liver cirrhosis undergoing similar surgical procedures. In addition, variables possibly associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis were investigated.Results:Out of 443 patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy, 18 (4.1%) had concomitant liver cirrhosis. Demographics and preoperative clinical variables were similar in the 2 patient groups. While the overall morbidity rate was similar, the 90-day mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with liver cirrhosis (P = .023). There was a significantly higher rate of sepsis and anastomotic, respiratory, and hemorrhagic complications in patients with liver cirrhosis who died in the postoperative period.Conclusions:Minimally invasive esophagectomy is feasible in patients with liver cirrhosis. Future strategies should focus on total minimally invasive procedures and early recognition of surgical complications.
