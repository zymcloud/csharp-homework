Objectives:To assess the impact of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 280 treatment-naïve early-stage HCC patients who had Child-Pugh grade A or B and received upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at the time of HCC diagnosis. CSPH was defined as (1) a platelet count 3 associated with splenomegaly and/or (2) the presence of oesophageal/gastric varices by endoscopy. Factors determining poor overall survival and recurrence after RFA were analysed by Cox proportional hazards model and propensity score matching analysis.Results:A total of 192 (68.6 %) patients had CSPH. The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 50.6 % and 76.7 % in patients with and without CSPH, respectively (p = 0.015). Based on multivariate analysis, age > 65 years (hazard ratio (HR) 1.740, p = 0.025), serum albumin levels ≤ 3.5 g/dL (HR 3.268, p Conclusions:CSPH was not associated with poor outcomes after RFA.Key points:• CSPH was common in HCC patients who underwent RFA therapy. • CSPH was not an independent risk factor in determining poor prognosis. • Serum albumin level was more important to determine the outcomes.
