Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the smallest partially double-stranded DNA virus known to infect humans. Worldwide, more than 50% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases are related to chronic Hepatitis B. Development of HCC from normal liver cells is characterized by changes in cell surface N-glycans, which can promote the invasive behavior of tumor cells, leading ultimately to the progression of cancer. However, little is understood about the cell surface N-glycans of HBV-infected liver cells. We try to address this by taking advantage of the HepAD38 cell line, which can replicate HBV in the absence of tetracycline [tet(-)] in growth medium. In the presence of tetracycline [tet(+)], this cell line is free from the virus due to the repression of pregenomic (pg) RNA synthesis. In culture medium without tetracycline, cells express viral pgRNA and start to secrete virions into the supernatant. Here we studied the expression of glycosyltransferases and the cell surface N-glycan composition of tet(+) and tet(-) HepAD38. Among the glycosyltransferases upregulated by the expression of HBV were GnT-II, GnT-IVa, ST6Gal1, and GnT-V, whereas GnT-I, GnT-III, Î²4GalT1, and FUT8 were downregulated. About one-third of the total cell surface N-glycans found on tet(-)HepAD38 were sialylated. As for tet(+)HepAD38, sialylation was 6% lower compared to the tet(-) cells. Neither treatment changed the cell surface N-glycans expression of the total complex type or the total fucosylated type, which were about 50% or 60%, respectively. Our results showed that the expression of HBV triggers higher sialylation in HepAD38 cells. Altogether, the results show that HBV expression triggered the alteration of the cell surface N-glycosylation pattern and the expression levels of glycosyltransferases of HepAD38 cells.
