The occurrence and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are affected by complicated signal transduction factors. Our previous study identified Ikaros as a novel reactivated therapeutic target that acts as a transcriptional repressor and reactivates anticancer mechanisms in HCC therapy. Annexin A4 (ANXA4) is a member of the Annexin family that plays an essential role in several cancers, but it has not been investigated in HCC proliferation. Using cDNA microarrays, ANXA4 was shown to be associated with Ikaros in Ikaros-overexpressing cells. The aim of this work was to characterize the relationship between Ikaros and ANXA4 and the role of ANXA4 in HCC. The effect of Ikaros on ANXA4 was analyzed in HCC cell lines and HCC patient samples, and functional recovery experiments were performed between Ikaros and ANXA4. Furthermore, the effect of ANXA4 on cell proliferation in vitro was analyzed by MTT and colony formation assays in HCC cells. We used a subcutaneous xenograft model to elucidate the role of ANXA4 in vivo. We found that ANXA4 overexpression promotes HCC cell proliferation, but Ikaros can inhibit ANXA4 expression by repressing its promoter activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that downregulated expression of ANXA4 inhibited HCC cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Our findings indicate that ANXA4 may be a critical factor in HCC tumorigenesis. Ikaros is an attractive inhibitor of ANXA4 and may function as an anticancer agent in HCC.
