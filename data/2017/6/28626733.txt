Aim/background:The ultimate aim of any treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is to improve overall survival (OS); however, the clinical significance of time to progression (TTP) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is unclear. This retrospective study examined the association between OS and the newly defined time to TACE progression (TTTP) to assess whether TTTP can be an alternative to OS in HCC patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B.Methods:Between January 2006 and December 2013, 592 patients with HCC (BCLC B1, n = 118; BCLC B2, n = 170) underwent TACE. TTTP was then redefined as time to progression from the first image taken after TACE. The relationship between TTTP and OS was then examined based on survival time.Results:Survival analysis revealed significant differences in the OS of patients with BCLC B1 and those with BCLC B2 (median OS: 42.3 months, 95% confidence interval [CI] 34.4-50.7; and 29.3 months, 95% CI 26.1-37.6, respectively, p = 0.0348). The median TTTP values were 9.5 months (95% CI 7.0-10.9) and 5.3 months (95% CI 4.6-6.7), respectively (p = 0.0078). There was a moderate positive correlation between OS and TTTP for both B1 (R2 = 0.6563, p = 0.0045) and B2 (R2 = 0.6433, p = 0.0052) substages. There was also a positive correlation between OS and TTTP for the combined B1 and B2 substages (R2 = 0.6590, p = 0.0024).Conclusions:There was a moderate correlation between the TTTP and OS of patients with HCC after TACE therapy, where the patients with short TTTP represented short OS, indicating that TTTP is an alternative parameter for survival analysis of HCC patients with BCLC stage B tumors who undergo TACE.
