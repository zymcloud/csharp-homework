Background and purpose:Chromosomal instability is not only a hallmark of cancer but also an attractive therapeutic target. A diverse set of mitotic kinases maintains chromosomal stability. One of these is monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1, also known as TTK), which is essential for chromosome alignment and for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Pharmacological inhibition of Mps1 has been suggested as a cancer therapeutic; however, despite the existence of a novel Mps1 inhibitor, TC Mps1 12, no such studies have been performed.Experimental approach:The effects of TC Mps1 12 on cell viability, chromosome alignment, centrosome number, mitotic duration, apoptosis and SAC were determined in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In addition, the association of Mps1 expression with the overall survival of HCC patients was analysed.Key results:Treatment of human HCC cells with TC Mps1 12 led to chromosome misalignment and missegregation, and disorganization of centrosomes. Even in the presence of these errors, TC Mps1 12-treated cells overrode the SAC, resulting in a shortened mitotic duration and mitotic slippage. This mitotic catastrophe triggered apoptosis and, finally, inhibited the growth of HCC cells. In addition, the expression of the Mps1-encoding TTK gene was associated with poor overall survival of HCC patients.Conclusion and implications:TC Mps1 12 results in the accumulation of chromosomal instabilities and mitotic catastrophe in HCC cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that the inhibition of Mps1 kinase using TC Mps1 12 is a promising therapeutic approach for liver cancer.
