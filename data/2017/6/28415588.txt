Understanding cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance pathways is critical for the development of CSC-targeting therapy. Here, we investigated the functional role of the cyclin D1-dependent activation of Smad2/3 and Smad4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) CSCs and in HCC primary tumors. Cyclin D1 sphere-derived xenograft tumor models were employed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of a Smad inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy. Cyclin D1 overexpression confers stemness properties by enhancing single sphere formation, enhancing the CD90+ and EpCAM+ population, increasing stemness gene expression, and increasing chemoresistance. Cyclin D1 interacts with and activates Smad2/3 and Smad4 to result in cyclin D1-Smad2/3-Smad4 signaling-regulated liver CSC self-renewal. The cyclin D1-dependent activation of Smad2/3 and Smad4 is also found in HCC patients and predicts disease progression. A Smad inhibitor impaired cyclin D1-Smad-mediated self-renewal, resulting in the chemosensitization. Thus, pretreatment with a Smad inhibitor followed by chemotherapy not only successfully suppressed tumor growth but also eliminated 57% of the tumors in a cyclin D1 sphere-derived xenograft model. Together, The cyclin D1-mediated activation of Smad2/3 and Smad4 is an important regulatory mechanism in liver CSC self-renewal and stemness. Accordingly, a Smad inhibitor induced CSC differentiation and consequently significant chemosensitization, which could be an effective strategy to target CSCs.
