Background:The introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) has increased sustained virological response (SVR) rates in patients with advanced liver disease and chronic hepatitis C(CHC)infection. At present, data on clinical outcome and long-term durability of viral eradication after successful DAA therapy are scarce.Aim:To evaluate the long-term success of viral eradication in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis treated with DAAs.Methods:Five hundred and fifty-one patients with advanced fibrosis (n = 158) or cirrhosis (CPS-A:317,CPS-B/C:76) and SVR after interferon and ribavirin-free DAA therapy treated between October 2013 and April 2016 were studied with a median follow-up of 65.6 (13.0-155.3) weeks. Only patients without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at baseline and without liver transplantation were included.Results:Twelve patients (2.2%) died during follow-up: the mortality rate was 0.6% in F3, 2.2% in CPS-A and 5.3% in CPS-B/C patients (P = .08). During follow-up 36 patients with cirrhosis (9.1%) developed a liver related event, including 16 with de-novo HCC (4.1%). Seven patients were transplanted at a median of 9.7 (range 3.8-21.7) months after EOT. History of decompensation was significantly associated with liver related events during follow-up (HR 7.9; 95% CI 2.7-22.6; P Conclusions:Eradication of HCV by DAA therapy was durable irrespective of the DAA combination used. Most of the cured patients had an excellent long-term clinical prognosis. Nevertheless, the risk of new occurrence of HCC remains worrisome and thus regular surveillance is obligatory even after clinical stabilization and improvement of the patient.
