Purpose:To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cone-beam computed tomography (CT)-guided chemoembolization for probable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) smaller than 1 cm in patients at high risk for HCC.Materials and methods:From December 2009 to May 2014, 57 patients (43 male and 14 female; mean age, 61.1 y) at high risk for HCC underwent cone-beam CT-guided conventional chemoembolization for 79 treatment-naive probable HCCs Results:Initial follow-up images obtained 2-3 months after chemoembolization showed complete response in all 79 tumors. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year local progression rates were 10.4%, 21.7%, and 35.7%, respectively. Subsegmental catheterization (P Conclusions:Cone-beam CT-guided chemoembolization can be a useful and safe option for probable HCCs
