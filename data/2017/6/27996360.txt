Purpose:Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is curative for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is typically a disease of older adults (OAs); therefore, characteristics and outcomes of OLT for young adults (YAs) (ages 18-40) are not described. The objective of this study was to assess the characteristics and outcomes of YAs with HCC receiving OLT and compare these to OAs (ages >40 years).Methods:YAs with HCC who had OLT from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database were included in this study. As a comparison group, OAs with HCC were matched 4:1 to the YA group. Descriptive statistics of demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were generated. Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates were used to assess patient and graft survival. Conditional logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards frailty models were used to compare the groups.Results:A total of 464 YAs received OLT for HCC. The most common underlying liver diseases were hepatitis C virus (21.3%), hepatitis B virus (HBV, 15.5%), and autoimmune/cholestatic disease (12.3%). An increased number of YAs received OLT for HCC after implementation of model for end-stage liver disease scoring. One thousand two hundred eighty OAs served as the comparison group. Post-transplant 5-year survival was 73.1% in YAs with a retransplantation rate of 7.8%. In OAs, survival and retransplantation rates were lower (68.6% p = 0.093; 4.3% p = 0.001).Conclusion:Four hundred sixty-four YAs with HCC received OLT in the UNOS database. Compared to the older population, survival and retransplantation rates were higher. HBV, which is vaccine preventable, is a frequent contributor to HCC in YAs.
