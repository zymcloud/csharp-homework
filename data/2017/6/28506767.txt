The ablation of Mig-6 has been shown to induce tumor formation in various tissues. However, the relationships between Mig-6 expression, clinical pathological factors, and prognosis have not been clarified in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the mechanism by which Mig-6 regulates the proliferation of HCC cells has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the clinical significance of the loss of Mig-6 expression in HCC and the mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell proliferation by Mig-6. The down-regulation of Mig-6 correlated significantly with large tumors, a more advanced BCLC stage, and a more advanced TNM stage, and low Mig-6 expression predicted significantly reduced survival. Low Mig-6 expression and high Cyclin D1 expression were independent predictors for survival. The overexpression of Mig-6 led to significant G1 arrest and growth inhibition in HCC cells, possibly through the inhibition P-ERK and Cyclin D1. These results indicate that Mig-6 expression is low in HCC, which predicts a poor prognosis. Mig-6 may regulate cell proliferation and the cell cycle through the P-ERK/Cyclin D1 pathway.
