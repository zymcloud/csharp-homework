Aim:To evaluate the application of qualitative and quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in predicting the histological grade of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Two hundred and fifty-four patients with pathologically confirmed HCC who underwent hepatic DWI on a 1.5-T platform (b = 0, 600 s/mm2) were evaluated retrospectively. HCCs were divided into well-, moderately, and poorly differentiated groups. The relationships between naked-eye signal intensity (SI), SI values, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on DWI, and the histopathological differentiation of HCC were analysed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to determine the optimal operating points (OOPs) of the SI and ADC values to predict the tumour grade.Results:A weak negative correlation (r=-0.350, p-3, 1.31±0.16×10-3, and 1.08±0.11×10-3 mm2/s, respectively, with significant differences between any two combinations of groups. The OOPs of ADC to diagnose well- and poorly differentiated HCC were 1.5×10-3 and 1.24×10-3 mm2/s, respectively.Conclusion:Qualitative and quantitative SI and ADC values at DWI may be useful to estimate the histological grade of HCC preoperatively and non-invasively.
