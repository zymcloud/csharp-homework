Objective: To explore the related factors for primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) caused by chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatitis C (CHC). Methods: According to the principle of cross-sectional study, a cluster random sample method was used, a total of 366 chronic hepatitis patients in hospitals were recruited from three provincial tertiary hospitals in Shanxi, Henan and Jilin between July 2016 and October 2016, respectively. Using a self-designed unified questionnaire, face-to-face interviews was conducted on subjects, including sex, age, alcohol consumption, coffee consumption, green tea consumption, fish consumption, smoking, HBV/HCV diagnosis and treatment, diabetes mellitus, family history of PHC (whether PHC in first-degree relatives), etc. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression were performed to identify the related factors for PHC with CHB and CHC. According to the clinical diagnosis the patients were divided into a chronic hepatitis group (not developing to PHC) and a PHC group. Results: Among 366 cases patients, 287 (78.4%) cases were male, 79 cases were female (21.6%), average age was (52.7Â±9.3) years. 202 cases were chronic hepatitis group, 164 cases were PHC group. Multivariate unconditional logistics regression analysis indicated that alcohol consumption (odds ratio (OR)=2.11, 95%CI: 1.18-3.75), family history of PHC (OR=5.12, 95%CI: 2.60-10.08) were positively correlated with the development of PHC in chronic b, green tea consumption (OR=0.45, 95%CI: 0.23-0.88), antiviral treatment (OR=0.19, 95%CI: 0.11-0.32) were negatively correlated. Alcohol consumption (OR=3.98, 95%CI: 1.14-13.85) was positively correlated with the development of PHC in chronic c, antiviral treatment (OR=0.14, 95%CI: 0.04-0.50) was negatively correlated. Conclusion: Alcohol consumption, family history of PHC, green tea consumption and antiviral treatment were the related factors for the development of PHC in chronic hepatitis b. Alcohol consumption and antiviral treatment were the related factors for the development of PHC in chronic hepatitis c.
