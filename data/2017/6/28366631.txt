Dysregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a valuable treatment target. Recent studies have developed a highly-selective and potent mTOR kinase inhibitor, CZ415. Here, we showed that nM concentrations of CZ415 efficiently inhibited survival and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Huh-7) and primary-cultured human HCC cells. Meanwhile, CZ415 inhibited proliferation of HCC cells, more potently than mTORC1 inhibitors (rapamycin and RAD001). CZ415 was yet non-cytotoxic to the L02 human hepatocytes. Mechanistic studies showed that CZ415 disrupted assembly of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 in HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, activation of mTORC1 (p-S6K1) and mTORC2 (p-AKT, Ser-473) was almost blocked by CZ415. In vivo studies revealed that oral administration of CZ415 significantly suppressed HepG2 xenograft tumor growth in severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mice. Activation of mTORC1/2 was also largely inhibited in CZ415-treated HepG2 tumor tissue. Together, these results show that CZ415 blocks mTORC1/2 activation and efficiently inhibits HCC cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
