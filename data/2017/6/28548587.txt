Objective:This study was designed to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with apatinib and TACE alone in the treatment of intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From March 2015 to August 2015, a total of 44 patients with moderate and advanced HCC, who were admitted in the Navy General Hospital of China, were included into this study. These patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: group A and group B. Patients in group A underwent TACE alone, while patients in group B underwent the combined treatment of TACE with apatinib. Differences in preoperative general data between these 2 groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). All patients were followed up for 12-18 months. Changes in Î±-fetal protein (AFP) at 3 months after treatment and the objective response rate (ORR) at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment were compared between these 2 groups. Furthermore, progression-free survival (PFS) and the incidence of adverse reactions were also compared between these 2 groups.Results:AFP levels in groups A and B significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment, compared with the levels before treatment, and the differences were statistically significant (P 0.05). ORR at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment was 36.36%, 27.27%, 13.64% and 9.09%, respectively, in group A; and 60%, 50%, 45% and 35%, respectively, in group B. At 3 and 6 months after treatment, the differences between these 2 groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05); while at 9 and 12 months after treatment, the differences between these 2 groups were statistically significant (P Conclusions:For intermediate and advanced HCC, the long-term curative effect of TACE combined with apatinib is better than that of TACE alone. The former can obviously prolong the PFS of patients and has a confirmed safety.
Adverse reactions; apatinib; hepatocellular carcinoma; transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.
