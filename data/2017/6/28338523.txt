Introduction:Laparoscopic liver resection has become important procedure for malignant liver disease. In this report, we describe the relevant technical maneuvers and perioperative outcomes in laparoscopic anatomic segment 6 liver resection using the Glissonian approach.Patients and methods:From March 2003 and October 2015, 7 patients who diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma had undergone laparoscopic anatomic segment 6 liver resection at the single institution. We performed retrospective analysis of the clinical and perioperative outcomes of these patients.Results:All patients were men with mean age of 62.3 years (range, 49 to 73 y). The mean operation time was 352.8 minutes (range, 180 to 435 min) and there was no case of open conversion. The mean estimated blood loss was 521.4 mL (range, 200 to 800 mL) and intraoperative transfusion needed in 1 patient. There was no postoperative morbidity and mortality. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.5 days (range, 5 to 12 d). All patients obtained negative resection margins. There was no patient had developed tumor recurrence during a median follow-up period of 43 months (range, 7 to 60.7 mo).Conclusions:Laparoscopic anatomic segment 6 liver resection is a feasible operative procedure, being possible even in patients with limited liver function.
