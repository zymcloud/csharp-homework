Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a common chronic liver disease closely associated with obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. It can gradually progress to liver cirrhosis or even hepatocellular carcinoma; however, there are still no specific therapeutic agents for this disease. Liraglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue and has a marked effect in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. At present, many studies indicate that liraglutide also has a certain therapeutic effect on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease during the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. This article reviews the known mechanisms of action of liraglutide in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
