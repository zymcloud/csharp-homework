Objective:Liver resection (LR) and living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) are considered the two potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a difference in the oncologic outcomes between LR and LDLT according to tumor biology.Methods:Patients (137 LDLTs and 199 LRs) were stratified into four groups by tumor biology according to the number of risk factors for recurrence (preoperative alpha-fetoprotein >200 ng/mL, Edmonson grade 3 or 4, tumor size >3 cm, and presence of microvascular invasion).Results:In the favorable tumor biology patients (groups I and II), there was a significantly worse recurrence-free survival rate in those patients who underwent LR compared to those who underwent LDLT (group I, P = .002; group II, P = .001). The overall survival rates in the LR and LDLT groups were not different (group I, P = .798; group II, P = .981). In the poor tumor biology patients (groups III and IV), there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of recurrence-free survival rate (group III, P = .342; group IV, P = .616). The LDLT group showed a significantly lower overall survival rate (group III, P = .001; group IV, P = .025).Conclusions:Primary LDLT should not be recommended in early stage HCC patients with poor tumor biology because of lower survival rates and a high chance of HCC recurrence.
