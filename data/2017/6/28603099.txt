Background:The various combination of multiphase enhancement multislice spiral CT (MSCT) makes the diagnosis of a small hepatocellular carcinoma (sHCC) on the background of liver cirrhosis possible. This study was to explore whether the combination of MSCT enhancement scan and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level could increase the diagnostic efficiency for sHCC.Methods:This study included 35 sHCC patients and 52 cirrhotic patients without image evidence of HCC as a control group. The diagnoses were made by three radiologists employing a 5-point rating scale, with postoperative pathologic results as the gold standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the three MSCT combination modes (arterial phase+portal-venous phase, arterial phase+delayed phase, arterial phase+portal-venous phase+delayed phase) and AFP levels for sHCC on the background of liver cirrhosis.Results:The area under ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the combination of arterial phase+portal-venous phase+delayed phase were 0.93, 93%, and 82%, respectively. The average AUC of the arterial phase+portal-venous phase+delayed phase combination was significantly greater than that of the arterial phase+portal-venous phase (AUC=0.84, P=0.01) and arterial phase+delayed phase (AUC=0.85, P=0.03). Arterial phase+portal-venous phase had a smaller AUC (0.84) than arterial phase+delayed phase (0.85), but the difference was insignificant (P=0.15). After combining MSCT enhancement scan with AFP, the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.95, 94%, and 83%, respectively, indicating a greatly increased diagnostic efficiency for sHCC.Conclusions:The combination of AFP and 3 phases MSCT enhancement scan could increase the diagnostic efficiency for sHCC on the background of liver cirrhosis. The application of ROC curve analysis has provided a new method and reference in HCC diagnosis.
