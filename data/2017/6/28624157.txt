Background and study aims:Intra-abdominal and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are often difficult to diagnose, particularly in the absence of a primary lesion. Endosonography (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration and cytology (FNAC) has provided an easy and safe access to these lymph nodes, sparing the use of invasive and costly interventions. The main aim of this study is to assess the specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value of EUS-guided FNAC in the diagnosis of benign and malignant lymph nodes. In addition, the study aims to determine significant EUS features that could help in predicting lymph node malignancy.Patients and methods:This prospective study included 142 patients with intra-abdominal or intrathoracic lymphadenopathy who were referred for EUS-guided FNAC because of inaccessibility by other imaging modalities. Ninety (63.3%) patients were found to have malignant lymph nodes, and 52 (36.6%) had lymphadenopathy of benign nature.Results:EUS-guided FNAC had a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 100% respectively. It had positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 88% for malignancy, respectively. By logistic regression analysis, EUS features and shortest diameter were found to be potential predictors of malignancy with p-value of <0.0001.Conclusion:EUS-guided FNAC is a powerful modality in the diagnosis of benign and malignant lymph nodes. Additional complementary EUS features could be added to this technique for definitive diagnosis.
