Purpose:To compare segmental radioembolization with segmental chemoembolization for localized, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable to ablation.Materials and methods:In a single-center, retrospective study (2010-2015), 101 patients with 132 tumors underwent segmental radioembolization, and 77 patients with 103 tumors underwent segmental doxorubicin-based drug-eluting embolic or conventional chemoembolization. Patients receiving chemoembolization had worse performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0, 76% vs 56%; P = .003) and Child-Pugh class (class A, 65% vs 52%; P = .053); patients receiving radioembolization had larger tumors (32 mm vs 26 mm; P Results:Toxicity rates were low, without significant differences. Index and overall complete response rates were 92% and 84% for radioembolization and 74% and 58% for chemoembolization (P = .001 and P Conclusions:Segmental radioembolization demonstrates higher complete response rates and local tumor control compared with segmental chemoembolization for HCC, with similar toxicity profiles. Superior progression-free survival was achieved.
