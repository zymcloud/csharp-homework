Background and aims:Restorative proctocolectomy in elderly inflammatory bowel disease [ IBD] patients is controversial and limited data are available on the outcomes of surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and long-term results of ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis in elderly patients, in a multicentre survey from European referral centres.Methods:The International Pouch Database [IPD] combined 101 variables. Patients aged ≥ 65 years were matched on the basis of open versus laparoscopic surgery with a control group of consecutive younger unselected patients with a ratio of 1:2. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed t test, chi square and Fisher's exact tests, Kaplan-Meier function, and log-rank tests where appropriate.Results:In the IPD, 77 patients aged ≥ 65 years [Group A] and 154 control patients [Group B] were identified. Elderly patients had more comorbidities [p = 0.0001], longer disease duration [p = 0.001], less extensive disease [p = 0.006], more previous abdominal operations [p = 0.0006], surgery for cancer or dysplasia more frequently [p = 0.0001], fewer single-stage procedures [p = 0.03], more diversions after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis [IPAA] [p = 0.05], and a higher laparoscopic conversion rate [p = 0.04]. Postoperative complications and pouch failure were similar between the groups, but Group A had more Clavien-Dindo IV-V complications [p = 0.04], and longer length of stay [p = 0.007]. Laparoscopy was associated with a shorter duration of surgery [p = 0.0001], and length of stay [p = 0.0001], and the same complication rate as open surgery.Conclusions:Restorative proctocolectomy can be performed in selected elderly patients, but there is a higher risk of postoperative complications and longer length of stay in this group. Laparoscopy is associated with shorter operating time and length of stay.
