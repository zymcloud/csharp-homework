This study evaluated the midterm delivery of doxorubicin in liver specimens from patients (N = 4) with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with drug-eluting embolic (DEE) transarterial chemoembolization. The patients had surgical resection 57, 79, 80 and 105 days after doxorubicin DEE chemoembolization. Doxorubicin concentrations inside embolic particles and in surrounding tissues were assessed by infrared microspectroscopy and microspectrofluorimetry, respectively. Embolic particles still contained doxorubicin and provided sustained drug delivery within targeted tissues 80 days after chemoembolization. Doxorubicin was undetectable after 105 days. In addition, aggregation of embolic particles inside vessel lumina was associated with slower doxorubicin elution and higher tissue concentrations when the number of aggregated embolic particles increased.
