Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most predominant subjects of liver malignancies, which arouses global concern in the recent years. Advanced studies have found that Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are differentially expressed in HCC, with its regulatory capacity in HCC pathogenesis and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this review, we summarized the functions and mechanisms of those aberrantly expressed circRNAs in HCC tissues. We hope to enlighten more comprehensive studies on the detailed mechanisms of circRNAs and explore their potential values in clinic applications. It revealed that hsa_circ_0004018 can be used as a potential biomarker in HCC diagnosis, with its superior sensitivity to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Notably, the correlation of circRNA abundance in the proliferation of liver regeneration (LR) has recently been clarified and different circRNA profiles served as candidates for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) diagnosis also be discussed. Therefore, the improved understanding of circRNAs in HCC pathogenesis and metastasis proposed a novel basis for the early diagnosis in HCC patients, which provides a useful resource to explore the pathogenesis of HCC.
