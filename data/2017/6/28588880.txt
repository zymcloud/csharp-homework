Background and aims:Some studies have explored the prevalence of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs). Only one study based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) report examination focused specifically on intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in a European general population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of IPMN in a population of patients who had MRI for a non-pancreatic disease.Methods:We conducted a retrospective, single-center study. All consecutive patients placed on the French liver transplant waiting list who had MRI for a non-pancreatic disease before liver transplantation between 2009 and 2013 were included. Only diagnoses consistent with IPMN were retained (cyst(s) clearly communicating with the main pancreatic duct).Results:Among 315 patients on the national waiting list, 212 patients had an MRI. PCLs with ductal communication were diagnosed in 14 patients (6.6%; six women, eight men, median age 62 years (45-70)). Liver disease was caused by a virus in seven cases, alcohol in three cases, other in four cases (multiple causes possible). Four patients had hepatocellular carcinoma. No patient had clinical or radiological sign of chronic pancreatitis. The median diameter of the largest cystic lesion was 14 mm (7-22). The number of PCLs was one (n = 4), two (n = 2), four (n = 3), five (n = 2), > 5 (n = 3), respectively. There was no worrisome or main pancreatic duct involvement.Conclusions:Prevalence of pancreatic cystic lesions consistent with the diagnosis of IPMN was 6.6% in French patients waiting for liver transplantation. These results underscore that IPMN can be considered as a public health problem and justify a screening.
