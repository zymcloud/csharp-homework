Background/aims:The association between the kinesin family member 1B (KIF1B) gene polymorphism and the risk of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been investigated in many peer-reviewed studies. However, scholars have failed to replicate these results in validation tests. The purpose of the present study was to explore whether the KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to HCC.Methods:The results of case-controlled studies on the correlation between the KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and HCC susceptibility were collected using Google Scholar and the EMBASE, PubMed and CNKI databases. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 5 papers with a total of 12 cohorts were included in this study.Results:The 12 cohorts were integrated, and the results showed that the rs17401966 polymorphism reduced the risk for HCC under the allele, heterozygous, homozygous, and dominant models but not under the additive or recessive models. Moreover, the merged results showed strong heterogeneity, and the cumulative meta-analysis results were unreliable. A genetic differentiation analysis of the 12 cohorts found different degrees of genetic differentiation between the 5 cohorts in Zhang et al.'s study and the cohorts in the other studies. We further divided the 12 study cohorts into 2 subgroups based on fixation index value; however, the results of that analysis were inconsistent.Conclusions:The results of this meta-analysis were not able to verify the association between the KIF1B rs1740199 polymorphism and HCC risk. Therefore, a well-designed, large-scale, multicenter validation study is needed to confirm the relationship.
