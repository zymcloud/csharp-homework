Objective: To investigate the role of enolase 1 (ENO1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and possible mechanism. Methods: Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to measure the expression of ENO1 in HCC tissue, adjacent tissue, hepatoma cells, and normal hepatocytes. The siRNA interference technique was used for ENO1 knockout in HepG2 cells, and then CCK-8, colony formation assay, and transwell assay were used to measure the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to measure the expression of proteins and genes involved in the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. The two-independent-samples t test and a one-way analysis of variance were used for comparison. Results: HCC tissue and HepG2 cells had significantly higher expression of ENO1 than adjacent tissue and normal hepatocytes (P < 0.05). There were significant reductions in the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells after siRNA interference (P < 0.05). There were also significant reductions in the expression of N1ICD, snail, slug, HEY1, HES1, and HES5 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: ENO1 may promote the development of HCC, possibly by participating in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway.
