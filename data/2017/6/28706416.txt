The prognosis for patients who are diagnosed with advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poor because there are few treatment options. Recent research has focused on the identification of novel molecular entities that can be targeted to inhibit oncogenic signals that are involved in the carcinogenesis, proliferation and progression of HCC. Among all of the pathways that are involved in the development of HCC, Hedgehog (HH) signalling has demonstrated a substantial role in hepatocarcinogenesis and HCC progression. HH plays a physiological role in embryogenesis, through the induction of the differentiation of hepatocytes from endodermal progenitors. The re-activation of the HH pathway in chronic damaged liver is a mechanism of fibrotic degeneration and is implicated in various stages of HCC development. HH activation sustains the sub-population of immature liver epithelial cells that are involved in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and HCC, and HH itself is a mediator of the alcohol-derived malignant transformation of liver cells. High levels of expression of HH protein markers in liver tumour tissues are correlated with aggressive histological and biological features and a poor clinical outcome. In vitro and in vivo inhibition models of the HH pathway confirm that HH is essential in maintaining tumour growth, metastasis and a mesenchymal phenotype.
