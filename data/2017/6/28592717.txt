Aberrant DNA methylation, which can be detected in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), is one of the major epigenetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). UBE2Q1, a putative member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, might play substantial roles in tumorigenesis. However, the methylation status of the UBE2Q1 gene in HCC remains unknown. We aimed to determine the methylation status of the UBE2Q1 gene promoter and to evaluate its potential clinical significance for HCC detection. The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) assay was used to detect the UBE2Q1 gene methylation status in serum samples from 80 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC, 40 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 40 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Significantly lower methylation frequencies were detected in HCC patients (33.75%) compared with LC patients (55.00%, p = 0.026) and CHB patients (60.00%, p = 0.006) and HCs (65.00%, p = 0.011). Hypomethylation of the UBE2Q1 gene was negatively associated with the tumor node metastasis stage (rs = -0.30, p = 0.008). The UBE2Q1 gene methylation status combined with alpha fetoprotein using cut-off points of 20, 200 and 400 ng/ml showed sensitivity and specificity values of 58.8% and 75.0%, 53.8% and 87.5%, and 37.5% and 88.7%, respectively, and yielded a significantly increased area under the ROC curve (0.720, 0.760 and 0.694, respectively) for discriminating HCC from LC and CHB. Our study results suggest that hypomethylation of the UBE2Q1 gene promoter is a potential biomarker for detecting HBV-associated HCC.
