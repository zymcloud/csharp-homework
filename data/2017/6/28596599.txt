The Warburg effect is a metabolic hallmark of cancer. Tumor cells rapidly adjust their energy source to glycolysis in order to efficiently proliferate in a hypoxic environment, but the mechanism underlying this switch remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that hypoxia potently induces the down-regulation of miR-125a expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and tumors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-125a could decrease the production of lactate, the uptake of glucose, and the levels of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HCC cells. We investigated the molecular mechanism through which miR-125a inhibits HCC glycolysis and identified hexokinase II (HK2) as a direct target gene of miR-125a. Finally, we revealed that the miR-125a/HK2 axis is functionally important for regulating glycolysis of HCC cell and progression of cancer in vitro and in vivo. In summary, our findings demonstrate for the first time that hypoxia-down-regulated miR-125a regulated HCC glycolysis and carcinogenesis by targeting hexokinase HK2, a key glycolytic enzyme for the Warburg effect, and add a new dimension to hypoxia-mediated regulation of cancer metabolism.
