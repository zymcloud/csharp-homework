Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a relatively rare form of liver cancer with a poor prognosis. The therapeutic options for patients with advanced ICC are limited and usually ineffective. There is currently no approved targeted therapy for ICC, although accumulating evidence supports inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ICC. Here, we report a patient with stage IV ICC harboring a PIK3CA mutation who responded well to the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated shrinkage of the tumor and maintenance of a partial response for 6.5 mo after everolimus treatment as the best response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical case report in the literature of clinical benefit from everolimus treatment in an ICC patient with PIK3CA mutation.
