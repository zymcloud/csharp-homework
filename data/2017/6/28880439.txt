Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare cancer, with estimate population incidence of 0.7-2.0 cases per 1 million each year. It also carries poor prognosis with estimated 5-year survival of less than 15% of those with metastatic disease and has a poor response to cytotoxic treatment. A randomized controlled trial published in 2012 by Fassnacht et al. demonstrated improved progression-free survival with first-line etoposide-doxirubicin-cisplatin-mitotane (EDP-M) compared to first-line streptozocin-mitotane in patients with stage III-IV disease. We report a case of a 25-year-old female diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma with liver and lung metastases treated with adjuvant EDP-M chemotherapy. During her treatment, the patient experienced ongoing significant liver-associated burden of disease, which prompted a trial of trans-hepatic arterial chemoembolization with doxorubicin and mitomycin. The patient subsequently experienced complete remission of disease at 18 months with no fludeoxyglucose (FDG) avid lesions on PET/CT.
