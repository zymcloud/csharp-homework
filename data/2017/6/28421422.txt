Purpose of review:Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have markedly improved the prognosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-genotype 3 (GT3), a highly prevalent infection worldwide. However, in patients with hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GT3 infection presents a treatment challenge compared with other genotypes. The dependence of the HCV life cycle on host lipid metabolism suggests the possible utility of targeting host cellular factors for combination anti-HCV therapy. We discuss current and emergent DAA regimens for HCV-GT3 treatment. We then summarize recent research findings on the reliance of HCV entry, replication, and virion assembly on host lipid metabolism.Recent findings:Current HCV treatment guidelines recommend the use of daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir (DCV/SOF) or sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) for the management of GT3 based upon clinical efficacy [â‰¥88% overall sustained virological response (SVR)] and tolerability. Potential future DAA options, such as SOF/VEL co-formulated with GS-9857, also look promising in treating cirrhotic GT3 patients. However, HCV resistance to DAAs will likely continue to impact the therapeutic efficacy of interferon-free treatment regimens. Disruption of HCV entry by targeting required host cellular receptors shows potential in minimizing HCV resistance and broadening therapeutic options for certain subpopulations of GT3 patients. The use of cholesterol biosynthesis and transport inhibitors may also improve health outcomes for GT3 patients when used synergistically with DAAs. Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with HCV-GT3 infection compared to other genotypes, efforts should be made to address current limitations in the therapeutic prevention and management of HCV-GT3 infection.
