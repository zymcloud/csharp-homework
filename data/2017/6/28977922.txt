Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors without effective diagnostic biomarkers. This study intended to dynamically analyze serum proteomics in different pathological stages of liver diseases, and discover potential diagnostic biomarkers for early HCC. Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, liver cirrhosis (LC), or HCC together with healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Proteins differentially expressed between groups were screened using isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), and promising HCC biomarker candidates were subjected to bioinformatics analysis, including K-means clustering, gene ontology (GO) and string network analysis. Potential biomarkers were validated by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and their diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Finally, 93 differentially expressed proteins were identified, of which 43 differed between HBV and HC, 70 between LC and HC, and 51 between HCC and HC. Expression levels of gelsolin (GELS) and sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) varied with disease state as follows: HC
CD14; biomarker; diagnosis; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); iTRAQ.
