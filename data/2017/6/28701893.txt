Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients without hepatitis B (HBV) and -C virus (HCV) infection are increasing in Japan. Method for detecting high-risk liver diseases of HCC in general population has still not been established. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) using transient elastography (TE; FibroScan System) are useful for detecting liver fibrosis and steatosis. The aim of this study is to clarify TE for risk assessment of HCC in general population.Methods:This cross-sectional study was performed for residents aged â‰¥ 40 years in an intermountain town in Japan with a population of 3,493. Blood laboratory testing included tumor markers, abdominal ultrasound (AUS), and TE was performed.Results:Among 175 subjects (64 men, 111 women), TE was evaluated and three patients with HCC were detected by AUS. For detecting HCC, the cut-off value of LSM was 5.3 kPa sensitivity 100%, specificity 75%, AUROC 0.88). The combination of LSM and CAP (LSM > 5.3 kPa with any CAP and CAP > 248 dB/m with any LSM) could detect the high-risk liver diseases of HCC (HCC, nonalcoholic fatty liver/steatohepatitis, HBV or HCV related chronic viral hepatitis with alanine transaminase (ALT) > 30 IU/L for men or > 19 IU/L for women or cirrhosis of any cause) with high sensitivity (sensitivity 90%, specificity 55%, positive predictive value 10%, negative predictive value 99%, P = 0.006).Conclusion:The combination of LSM and CAP can be useful in detecting high-risk liver diseases of HCC out of general population.
