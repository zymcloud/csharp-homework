Current methods for HCC diagnosis have not an optimal diagnostic accuracy. The detection of more than one biomarker seems to improve their individual performance and provide an accurate HCC diagnosis approach. Individual gene expression seems to influence whether or not the treatment is successful, since several molecules have interfere with cancer associated pathways and have been related to poor prognosis which condition the lack of effective treatment options. Areas covered: Novel biomarkers have been proposed as a useful tool in each patient prognosis. This article aims to review the recent evidence based on HCC biomarkers which seems to have a regulative role according to tumor cell development leading to a specific biological response. Epigenetic regulation, miRNAs, and genome sequencing analysis propose molecular expression signatures as novel biomarkers which allowed achieve the major goal for the use of biomarkers in clinical practice. Moreover, a deeper analysis for determine the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers has been made. Expert commentary: To improve of methodological designs and sample sizes are needed in order to support the role of biomarkers in HCC. Furthermore, is necessary to consider HCC etiologies and all clinic disease context to carried out clinical phase studies to thrust biomarkers application.
