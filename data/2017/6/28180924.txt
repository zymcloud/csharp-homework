Purpose:To develop a CT-based radiomics signature and assess its ability for preoperatively predicting the early recurrence (â‰¤1 year) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 215 HCC patients who underwent partial hepatectomy were enrolled in this retrospective study, and all the patients were followed up at least within 1 year. Radiomics features were extracted from arterial- and portal venous-phase CT images, and a radiomics signature was built by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model. Preoperative clinical factors associated with early recurrence were evaluated. A radiomics signature, a clinical model, and a combined model were built, and the area under the curve (AUC) of operating characteristics (ROC) was used to explore their performance to discriminate early recurrence.Results:Twenty-one radiomics features were chosen from 300 candidate features to build a radiomics signature that was significantly associated with early recurrence (P Conclusions:The radiomics signature was a significant predictor for early recurrence in HCC. Incorporating radiomics signature into conventional clinical factors performed better for preoperative estimation of early recurrence than with clinical variables alone.
