Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most common causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite recent strides in pharmacotherapy, complete cure of HBV infection still remains an enigma. The biggest obstacle in HBV therapy is clearance of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid (cccDNA). We discuss about the role of cccDNA in HBV life cycle, efficacy and shortcomings of currently available antivirals as well as promising novel targets to achieve ideal HBV cure.
