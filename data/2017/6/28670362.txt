Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and aggressive malignant tumors in the world. In China, traditional medicine is commonly used in the treatment of cancer. Among these medicines, Jianpi Huayu Decoction (JHD) is a typical clinical prescription against multiple tumors. However, the exact function and targets of JHD are currently unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of JHD against HCC.Methods and results:Hepatic carcinoma SMMC7221 cells were treated with JHD drug-serum in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), western-blot (WB), and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that JHD increased both the mRNA and protein levels of Smad7 and decreased the protein level of p-Smad3. It subsequently increased the E-cadherin expression level and decreased those of N-cadherin and Vimentin. Metastasis and invasion were eventually inhibited, as determined by the wound healing and transwell invasion assays. Treatment of Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) showed similar results as JHD, indicating that it is most likely the main functional drug monomer of JHD. The in vivo assay in nude mice also revealed the efficacy of JHD to inhibit epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT).Conclusion:JHD was shown to be an effective therapeutic strategy against HCC.
