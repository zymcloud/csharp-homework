Objective: To analyze the epidemiological features, spectrum and case fatality of malignant tumor patients in Shenzhen city, to provide evidence for the development of prevention and treatment strategies on malignant tumor in Shenzhen. Methods: All the hospitalized malignant tumor patients including deaths, were monitored from 1995 to 2014 in Shenzhen, and data was analyzed by SPSS 20.0 software. Results: There were 160 988 inpatients of malignant tumors between 1995 and 2014 in Shenzhen. The top three hospitalized tumors were lung (13.64%), liver (11.13%) and breast (7.86%) cancers. Numbers of the malignant tumor inpatients had been rapidly increasing during the past 20 years, 12.3 times in 2014 higher than in 1995. The total number of deaths due to malignant tumors was 19 460. Deaths of the top three malignant tumors were lung (24.40%), liver (19.84%) and colorectal (8.63%) cancers and the number of deaths was increasing, 12.5 times higher in 2014 than in 1995. The overall case fatality rate was 12.09%. The annual percent change (APC) of malignant tumors case fatality rate was 9.7%(95%CI: 2.0%-18.0%), during 1995-2003, with an increasing trend (t=2.72, P<0.05). The APC of case fatality rate during 2003-2014 was -3.4%(95%CI: -7.6%-1.1%), but the decreasing trend (t=-1.63, P>0.05) was not statistically significant. The top three major malignant tumors related to case fatality rate were lung cancer (21.62%), liver cancer (21.39%), and esophageal cancer (16.50%). The case fatality rates of leukemia and liver cancer had decreased during the past 20 years. The case fatality rates of cancers in lung, esophagus, stomach, breast, colorectal and nasopharyngeal, had all increased. The number of male patients was significantly exceeding the females (χ(2)=41.691, P<0.01), with sex ratio as 1.65∶1. From age 35 and on, the number of deaths due to malignant tumors increased significantly, with the peak after 60 years of age. Conclusions: The number of malignant tumor inpatients had an annual increase as well as the case fatality rate. Cancers in lung, liver appeared the leading causes of death among the malignant tumor patients, with elderly in particular. Strategies related to the prevention and treatment of cancers in lung, liver should be strengthened.
