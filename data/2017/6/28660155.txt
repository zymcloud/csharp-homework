Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is an intractable condition but common phenomenon in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC patients with PVTT may have worse liver function, a higher chance of comorbidity related to portal hypertension, lower tolerance to treatment and poorer prognoses. In Western guidelines, patients are offered palliative treatment with sorafenib or other systemic agents because HCC with PVTT is grouped together with metastatic HCC during the planning of its management. In recent years, various treatment options have become available for patients with HCC and PVTT. Therapy has also shifted toward evidence-based treatment. However, policies for the management of HCC with PVTT have not been established. This comprehensive literature review aims to present current and available management options for patients with HCC and PVTT. Evidence is mainly based on studies published after 2010.
