A lack of effective prognostic biomarkers and molecular targets is a serious problem in hepatocellular carcinoma. KCTD11, reported as a tumor suppressor, are still not well understood. In this study, KCTD11 was found low-expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. The HCC patients with low expression of KCTD11 suggested shorter overall survival. We found KCTD11 inhibiting cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, by activating p21 and repressing cycle related proteins. KCTD11 also inhibited cell adhesion by decreasing CTGF and CLDN1. We found CTGF binding COL3A1 in HCCLM3, which might lead to reduction of COL3A1 expression. KCTD11 also inhibited cell migration and invasion in HCC, by repressing MMPs and EMT. We found the tumor suppression function of KCTD11 was at least partly through activating Hippo pathway in HCC. Base on the enhanced Hippo pathway, KCTD11 could activate p21 by stabilizing p53 or promoting the MST1/ GSK3Î²/p21 signaling in HCC. Overall, these results suggest that KCTD11 works as a tumor suppressor and owns prognostic and therapeutic potentials in HCC.
