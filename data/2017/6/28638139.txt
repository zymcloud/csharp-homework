Platelets in the primary tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in the regulation of tumor progression, but the mechanisms underlying are poorly understood. Here, we report that platelet releasates exerted a proliferative effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells both in vitro and in vivo. This effect depended on a reduction of KLF6 expression in HCC cells. After incubation with either platelets or platelet granule contents, SMMC.7721 and HepG2 cells exhibited significant increases in proliferation and decreases in apoptosis. However, no effect was observed when incubating cancer cells with resuspended activated platelet pellet which exhausted of releasates. Platelet releasates also increased the population of HCC cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and reduced the cell population in the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, knocking down KLF6 expression significantly diminished the platelet-mediated enhancement of HCC growth. In addition, blocking TGF-β signaling with the TGF-β receptor inhibitor SB431542 counteracted the effect of platelets on KLF6 expression and proliferation of HCC cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that platelet releasates, especially TGF-β, promote the proliferation of SMMC.7721 and HepG2 cells by decreasing expression of KLF6. This discovery identifies a potential new therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
