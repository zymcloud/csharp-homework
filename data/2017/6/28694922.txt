Chronic hepatitis B is a global health problem, and is one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotyping helps in decision making for clinical management of HBV infection, and is important for epidemiological studies. The objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of HBV genotypes circulating in the Philippines; molecularly characterize untypable genotype restriction patterns; and analyze the presence of surface gene variants. HBV genotypes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and DNA sequencing. Three genotypes, HBV A (76%; 73/96), HBV B (10%; 10/96) and HBV C (14%; 13/96) were detected by RFLP. Out of the 96 isolates, 9% were untypable by RFLP analysis. DNA sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis revealed that these isolates belonged to HBV genotypes A (67%; 6/9), B (11%; 1/9) and C (22%; 2/9). Out of the 9 isolates, 55% showed single or multiple variations which resulted to amino acid changes. Overall, the identification of untypable genotype can be resolved by sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the S gene and this approach can also be used to detect single or multiple variants. Our findings underscore the importance of accurate genotyping and detection of surface gene variants by DNA sequencing for optimal clinical management.
