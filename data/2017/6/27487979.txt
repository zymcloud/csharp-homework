Aim:Laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH), microwave ablation (MWA), and open hepatectomy (OH) are three widely used methods to treat small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, few studies have compared the short- and long-term outcomes of these three treatments. The aim of this study was to investigate their effectiveness.Methods:The data were reviewed from 280 patients with HCCs measuring â‰¤3 cm (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A) who received LH (n = 133), OH (n = 87), or MWA (n = 60) in our research center from 2005 to 2010. Short-term outcomes included intraoperative blood loss, operation time, and length of hospital stay. The disease-free survival and overall survival rates were analyzed as long-term outcomes.Results:The patients in the MWA and LH groups showed better short-term outcomes compared with those in the OH group. There were no significant differences in overall survival rates among the three treatments. The LH group showed significantly lower recurrence rates than the MWA group (P = 0.0146).Conclusions:Laparoscopic hepatectomy may be a better option for patients with small HCC located on the liver surface and left lateral lobe. The short-term outcome of MWA is promising, although the high risk of local recurrence after the operation should be considered when planning treatment.
