A new series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines tethered with nitric oxide (NO) producing functionality was designed and synthesized. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) protein assay revealed that NO releasing moiety in the synthesized compounds significantly decreased the cell growth more than the des-NO analogues. Compounds 7C and 7G possessing N-para-substituted phenyl group, released the highest NO concentration of 4.6% and 4.7% respectively. Anti-proliferative activity of synthesized compounds on HepG2 cell line identified compounds 7h, 7p, 14a and 14b as the most cytotoxic compounds in the series of IC50=3, 5, 3 and 5μM, respectively, compared to erlotinib as a reference drug (IC50=25μM). Flow cytometry studies revealed that 7h arrested the cells in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle while 7p arrested the cells in S phase. Moreover, docking study of the synthesized compounds on EGFR (PDB code: 1M17) and cytotoxicity study indicated that N-1 phenyl para substitution, pyrazole C-3 alkyl substitution and tethering the nitrate moiety through butyl group had a significant impact on the activity.
