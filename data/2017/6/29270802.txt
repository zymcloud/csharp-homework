Background:Laparoscopic hepatectomy has been performed in many hospitals, with the development of the laparoscopic operation technique. However, performing complex laparoscopic hepatectomy, such as right hemihepatectomy, is still a challenge. The aim of this study was to describe the application of a simple vascular occlusion technique and new liver hanging maneuver (LHM) in complex laparoscopic hepatectomy, which are both advocated by Chen Xiaoping for open hepatectomy.Methods:The clinical data of 29 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy (LRH) from October 2014 to October 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. During operation, the vascular occlusion technique without hilus dissection and LHM through the retrohepatic avascular tunnel on the right side of the inferior vena cava were used.Result:All 29 operations were successfully performed laparoscopically, while adopting Chen's methods. The study consisted of 23 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, four patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and two patients with hepatic metastasis of colonic carcinoma. The tumor size was 12.4 ± 1.9 cm. The operation time of LRH was 190.3 ± 49.9 min. The intraoperative blood loss of LRH was 281.7 ± 117.8 mL; five patients required blood transfusion, and the amount of blood transfusion was 300.0 ± 89.4 mL. No case was converted to open surgery, and no death occurred. All resulted in R0 resections. The median free margin was 20.1 ± 10.8 mm. The time of postoperative oral diet intake was 2.10 ± 0.96 days. The complication rate was 17.2%. The average hospital stay after operation was 10.0 ± 2.9 days.Conclusion:Complex hepatectomy is a bloodless procedure that can be performed under a laparoscope safely using Chen's methods of vascular occlusion technique and LHM.
