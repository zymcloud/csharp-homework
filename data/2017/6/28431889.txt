Cholangiolocellular carcinoma is a type of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). According to the 2010 World Health Organization classification, this carcinoma is a combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma with stem cell features, cholangiolocellular type (CHC-SC-CLC). The aim of this study was to compare the clinicopathological characteristics of CHC-SC-CLC and conventional ICC. Based on the gross and histologic characteristics, we divided consecutive ICC tumors into CHC-SC-CLC (n = 23), mass-forming (MF; n = 57), and non-MF (n = 22) groups. Compared with MF and non-MF groups, the CHC-SC-CLC group featured history of hepatolithiasis or bile duct operation in significantly fewer patients (4.3% versus 14.8% and 86.4%, respectively; P
Bile ducts; Cholangiocarcinoma; Cholangiolocellular carcinoma; Hepatic tumors; Isocitrate dehydrogenase.
