Background and objectives:This study evaluates predictive factors for observed long-term survival of more than 5 and 10 years for patients after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma and compares their life expectancy to the normal national population matched for sex, year of birth and age at resection.Methods:230 patients after primary liver resection for HCC (01.01.1995-31.12.2004) were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression models were determined based on Cox regression results and their prognostic capability evaluated with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs).Results:Life years after surgery in deceased patients compared to the normal national population matched for sex, year of birth and age at resection was reduced by median 21.7 years. Independent predictive factors for 10-year survival were age at resection (p Conclusions:Liver resection enables predictable long-term survival >5 and > 10 years. The proposed resection severity index quantifies the prognostic relevance of liver cellular damage, synthesis and loss of parenchyma for long-term survival.
