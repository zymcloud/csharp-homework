Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Although 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is used as the first choice treatment for advanced HCC, it exerts poor efficacy and is associated with acquired and intrinsic resistance. Sphingosine kinases (Sphk) 1 and 2 play tumour-promoting roles in different cancer types including HCC and thus represent promising pharmacological targets. In the present study, we have investigated for the first time the anticancer efficacy and underlying molecular mechanisms of combined administration of 5-FU and dual Sphk1/Sphk2 inhibitor SKI-II (4-[[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]amino]phenol) in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Here, we report that co-administration of 5-FU and SKI-II at low sub-toxic concentrations of 20 μM and 5 μM, respectively, synergistically inhibit cell proliferation, markedly reduce cell migration and the clonogenic survival, and increase apoptosis induction in HepG2 cells. Additional Western blot analyses have shown that possible mechanisms underlying enhanced sensitivity to 5-FU induced by dual Sphk 1/2 inhibition could include abrogation of FAK-regulated IGF-1R activity and down-regulation of osteopontin expression culminating in the inhibition of NF-κB activity and its downstream signalling mediated by sirtuin 1 and p38 MAPK. Our results clearly show that pharmacological blockade of both Sphk isoforms represents a promising strategy to boost the anti-tumour efficacy of 5-FU and provide a rationale for further in vivo studies into the possible use of SKI-II inhibitor as an adjunct to 5-FU treatment in HCC.
