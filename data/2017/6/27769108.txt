It is well known that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops as a consequence of hepatic fibrosis progression. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the inflammatory and fibrosis markers as predictors for HCC development among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) related chronic liver disease to help in early diagnosis and management of HCC. A total of 280 patients with chronic liver disease were included in this retrospective study, out of them 140 had liver cirrhosis with HCC and 140 had cirrhosis without HCC. Eight readily available blood indices King score, Fibro Q, AST-ALT ratio (AAR), APRI, LOK index, Goteborg University Cirrhosis Index (GUCI), fibro alpha, and Biotechnology Research Center (BRC) were constructed to compare the accuracies of these non invasive scores in predicting HCC development. All fibrosis scores except APRI were significantly higher in HCC. We found that Fibro alpha and BRC had superior diagnostic performance in prediction of HCC based on area under curve of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively compared to other scores with area under curve ranged from poor to failure (0.59-0.66). Almost all cirrhotic cases were secondary to HCV (93.6%), while HBV was detected in 2.1% of cases only. Anti-HCV positive was reported in 100% of HCC cases (P = 0.002). Fibro alpha and BRC scores can be used for prediction of HCC. J. Med. Virol. 89:1062-1068, 2017. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
