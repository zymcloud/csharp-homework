A 56-year-old Japanese man with liver cirrhosis (LC) due to hepatitis C virus was admitted to our hospital for radiofrequency ablation of residual tumor following lusutrombopag administration. Laboratory tests revealed thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. The patient's LC was managed, and he was classified as Child-Pugh A. After admission, lusutrombopag was administered for 7 days. The platelet count increased to over 50,000/mm3 after 7-14 days and returned to previous levels 50 days after administration. Leukocyte and erythrocyte counts also increased in response to the treatment and stayed elevated for over 120 days. Lusutrombopag acts selectively on human thrombopoietin (TPO) receptors and activates signaling pathways that promote the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells into megakaryocytes, consequently increasing the blood platelet count. However, the patient treated with lusutrombopag in our case study showed increased blood leukocyte and erythrocyte counts as well. Given that TPO receptors are reportedly expressed in not only megakaryocyte progenitor cells but also hematopoietic progenitors, lusutrombopag may potentially improve pancytopenia caused by LC and can be used for the recovery of blood counts before other treatments.
