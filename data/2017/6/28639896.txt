The phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway is one of the most commonly altered pathways in human cancers. The serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) family of serine/threonine kinases consists of three isoforms, SGK1, SGK2, and SGK3. This family of kinases is highly homologous to the AKT kinase family, sharing similar upstream activators and downstream targets. Few studies have investigated the role of SGK2 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we report that SGK2 expression levels were upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and human hepatoma cell lines compared to the adjacent normal liver tissues and a normal hepatocyte line, respectively. We found that downregulated SGK2 inhibits cell migration and invasive potential of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (SMMC-7721 and Huh-7).We also found that downregulated SGK2 suppressed the expression level of unphosphorylated (activated) glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. In addition, SGK2 downregulation decreased the dephosphorylation (activation) of β-catenin by preventing its proteasomal degradation in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. These findings suggest that SGK2 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression and mediates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta/β-catenin signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
