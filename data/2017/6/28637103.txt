Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be one of the important causes of cryptogenic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD-related HCCs (NAFLD-HCCs) have the following clinical features: high body mass index, deranged lipid profiles, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Among them, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and high Fe contents in the liver are risk factors of developing HCC in patients with NAFLD. Inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, insulin like growth factor-I, and lipotoxicity are intermingled and may cross react with each other to develop HCC. Because there is no guideline for early detection of HCC in patients with NAFLD, NAFLD-HCCs tend to be greater in size and in advanced stages when detected compared with hepatitis virus-related HCCs. Therefore, there is an urgent need of a surveillance program for the early detection of HCC. Treatment of NAFLD-HCCs is not different from other causes-related HCCs. However, patients with NAFLD-HCCs have cardiovascular disease and other metabolic problems, which may complicate treatment.
