Liver transplantation for metastatic neuroendocrine tumor in the liver used to be the main reason for liver transplantation for metastatic liver tumor. It is reported that liver transplantation in selected patients with non-resectable metastatic neuroendocrine tumor in the liver had favorable outcomes equivalent to liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, liver transplantation for colorectal liver metastasis has attracted attention. According to the SECA study in Oslo, liver transplantation for non-resectable colorectal liver metastasis had a high rate of recurrence but a favorable prognosis. Further discussion on patient selection, attempts at immunosuppressive therapy, and combination with chemotherapy and treatment at the time of relapse are required in order to improve the outcomes of liver transplantation for metastatic liver tumor.
