Aim:To investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of surgical patients with non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) compared to those of hepatitis B virus (HBV)- and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HCC.Patients and methods:Clinical data and outcomes were compared among the three groups. Prognostic factors of patients with NBNC-HCC were investigated.Results:Compared to HBV-HCC, patients with NBNC-HCC had higher chance of hypertension (HTN) (p25 kg/m2 Compared to HCV-HCC, patients with NBNC-HCC had higher incidence of DM and higher BMI >25 kg/m2 (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in overall survival (OS) rate among the three groups. In patients with NBNC-HCC, albumin (Alb; p<0.05) was an independent prognostic factor of OS, while Alb and α-fetoprotein (AFP) were independent prognostic factors of disease-free survival (DFS; p<0.01 each).Conclusion:Surgical patients with NBNC-HCC often have concomitant DM, HTN and high BMI, for whom factors related to prognosis were Alb and AFP.
