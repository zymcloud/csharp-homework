Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the worldwide obesity epidemic and currently affects one-third of adults or about one billion people worldwide. NAFLD is predicted to affect over 50% of the world's population by the end of the next decade. It is the most common form of liver disease and is associated with increased risk for progression to a more severe form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. This review article will focus on the role of alternative splicing in normal liver physiology and dysregulation in liver disease.
