Previous study has identified that the genetic variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP/DQ region were strongly associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. But their roles in liver function recovery after hepatic transplantation were still obscure. This study aimed to investigate whether HLA-DP/DQ polymorphisms were associated with post-transplant etiologies and prognosis in Chinese liver transplant recipients.A total of 144 liver transplant recipients were enrolled, which were divided into 2 groups according to the transplant etiology: HBV-related disease and non-HBV-related disease. HBV-related disease includes 3 subgroups: liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and progressive HBV hepatitis. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms HLA-DP (rs3077 and rs9277535) and HLA-DQ (rs7453920) were studied in all recipients by high-resolution melting curve analysis. Liver function indices (albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin) and coagulation indices (prothrombin time, platelet, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen) were routinely tested. After transplant, 10 recipients who were positive for HBsAg or with elevation in HBV virus load were regarded as HBV recurrence.No significant association of HLA-DP/DQ polymorphisms with HBV recurrence or transplant etiology was observed (P
