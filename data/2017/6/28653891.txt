Hypoxia plays a critical role in the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by activating the key transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1. This study aims to identify the novel mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that histone deacetylase 5, a highly expressed histone deacetylase in hepatocellular carcinoma, strengthened the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells under hypoxia but not normoxia condition. Furthermore, histone deacetylase 5 induced the transcription of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α by silencing homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 expression, which was also dependent on hypoxia. And then knockdown of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α decreased the expressions of mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin, and Vimentin, as well as matrix metalloproteinases, MMP7 and MMP9; however, the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, increased. Phenotype experiments showed that the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells were impaired by knockdown of histone deacetylase 5 or hypoxia-inducible factor-1α but rescued when eliminating homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which suggested the critical role of histone deacetylase 5-homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2-hypoxia-inducible factor-1α pathway in hypoxia-induced metastasis. Finally, clinical analysis confirmed the positive correlation between histone deacetylase 5 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in hepatocellular carcinoma specimens and a relatively poor prognosis for the patients with high levels of histone deacetylase 5 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. Taken together, our findings demonstrated a novel mechanism underlying the crosstalk between histone deacetylase 5 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.
