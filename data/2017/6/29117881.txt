Trophinin-associated protein (TROAP) was a protein first identified to mediate the process of embryo transplantation and later found to be involved in microtubule regulation. However, little is known about the role of TROAP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we reported that both TROAP mRNA and protein expressions were downregulated in human HCC samples as well as cell lines. A high level of TROAP was associated with small tumor size (p
