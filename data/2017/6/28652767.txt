Background:Accumulated studies have investigated the prognostic role of insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) in various cancers, but inconsistent and controversial results were obtained. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the potential value of IMP3 in the prognostic prediction of human solid tumors.Materials and methods:A systematic literature search in the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library (updated to April 2016) was conducted to identify eligible studies. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for survival outcomes were calculated and gathered using STATA 12.0 software.Results:A total of 53 studies containing 8,937 patients with solid tumors were included in this meta-analysis. High IMP3 expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) of solid tumors (HR =2.08, 95% CI: 1.80-2.42, P<0.001). Similar results were observed in cancer-specific survival (CSS), disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS). Further subgroup analysis stratified by tumor type showed that elevated IMP3 expression was associated with poor OS in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lung cancer, oral cancer, urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).Conclusion:The current evidence suggests that high IMP3 expression is associated with poor prognosis in most solid tumors. IMP3 is a potential valuable prognostic factor and might serve as a promising biomarker to guide clinical decisions in human solid tumors.
