Hepatocellular carcinoma is third leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Long non-coding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 has been reported to be dysregulated and plays a crucial role in various cancers. In this study, we investigated the interactions between plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 and miR-186-5p in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and explored the functional significance of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1. It was determined that plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 was significantly higher, while miR-186-5p was statistically lower in the hepatocellular carcinoma tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function methods, our results revealed that plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 affected hepatocellular carcinoma cells proliferation, invasion, and migration. It was found that there was direct interaction between miR-186-5p and the binding site of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 by performing dual-luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, it was identified that plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 regulated the expression of the miR-186-5p target gene, yes-associated protein 1. Taken together, plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 served as an endogenous sponge for miR-186-5p to reduce its inhibiting effect on yes-associated protein 1 and thus promoted the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
