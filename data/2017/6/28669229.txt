The chemical investigation of the methylene chloride fraction of marine sponge Hyrtios erectus led to the isolation of the known oxysterol (2) along with a new alkyl benzoate compound identified by spectroscopic methods (NMR and MS) as 4'-methylheptyl benzoate (1), whilst the n-butanol fraction afforded the known indole 3-carbaldehyde and β-carboline derivatives. Moreover, the hexane fraction was analysed by GC-MS for their fatty acids (FAs). A total of 17 FAs with chain lengths between 14 and 25 carbons were identified. Methyl-branched FAs are predominated suggesting the presence of bacterial symbionts in the H. erectus sponge. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 2 displayed significant cytotoxicity against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) with IC50 values of 2.4 and 3.8 μM, respectively, since compound 2 was also shown to have potent cytotoxic effect against hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2) with IC50 value of 1.3 μM.
