The optimal palliative treatment for unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remains controversial. While selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using yttrium-90 microspheres is a well-accepted treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, data related to its use for locally advanced ICC remain relatively scarce. Twenty-nine patients (mean age 66 Â± 11 years; 15 female) with unresectable biopsy-proven ICC treated with SIRT between June 2008 and April 2015 were retrospectively evaluated for post-treatment toxicity, overall survival, and imaging response using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1 response was evaluable following 26 treatments [complete response (CR):0, partial response (PR):3; stable disease (SD):16, progression of disease (PD):7]. Objective response rate (CR+PR) was 12%. Disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) was 73%. Median time to progression was 5.6 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0-12.0] months. Median survival following SIRT was 9.1 (95% CI: 1.7-16.4) months. Post-treatment survival was prolonged in patients with absence of extrahepatic disease (p = 0.03) and correlated with RECIST 1.1 response (p = 0.02). Toxicities were limited to grade I severity and occurred following 27% of treatments. These findings support the safe, effective use of SIRT for unresectable ICC. Post-treatment survival is prolonged in patients with absence of extrahepatic disease at baseline. RECIST 1.1 response following SIRT for ICC is predictive of survival.
