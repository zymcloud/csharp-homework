Aims:Iran is located in the Asian esophageal cancer belt. It is a high-risk region for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The extent to which genetic components, especially variants within miRNAs or their binding sites, contribute to risk of ESCC in the region is not yet fully understood. Herein, tests were done on an Iranian cohort to evaluate the association of miRNA-related polymorphisms in miR-423 (rs6505162) and peroxisomal biogenesis factor 6 (PEX6) (rs1129186 within a miR-149-5p-binding site) with the risk of ESCC risk.Methods:This study recruited 200 ESCC patients and 300 healthy individuals. Genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Target genes and biological processes that are regulated by miR-423 and may be affected by a change in miR-423 expression were identified by in silico analysis.Results:Logistic regression analyses revealed an association between rs6505162 and ESCC, assuming codominant (AA vs. CC, odds ratios, OR [95% confidence interval, CI]: 0.32 [0.15-0.69], p-value: 0.0076), recessive (AA vs. CC+CA, OR [95% CI]: 0.35 [0.16-0.73], p-value: 0.0027), and log-additive models (OR [95% CI]: 0.69 [0.52-0.91], p-value: 0.0084). No significant association was observed for PEX6 rs1129186. In silico analyses revealed several genes and biological processes that are regulated by miR-423 in ESCC.Conclusion:This study identified the first evidence of an association of a miRNA-related variant with risk of ESCC in an Iranian cohort. PEX6 rs1129186 may not modulate the risk of ESCC in the cohort.
