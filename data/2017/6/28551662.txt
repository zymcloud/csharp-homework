Aim:To retrospectively evaluate the feasibility and safety of repeated transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) three or more times using miriplatin-lipiodol (M-LPD) suspension (repeated M-LPD TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Sixteen patients who underwent repeated M-LPD TACE were examined. Total dose of miriplatin, lipiodol and porous gelatin sponge particles and adverse events of the first and last M-LPD TACE were evaluated.Results:The mean±standard deviation (SD) of the total number of M-LPD TACE per patient was 3.7±1.1. The mean±SD dose of total miriplatin, lipiodol and porous gelatin sponge particles per patient was 303±103 mg, 21±7.3 ml and 84±57 mg, respectively. There were no significant differences in any adverse events between the first and last M-LPD TACE.Conclusion:Repeated M-LPD TACE for HCC is feasible and safe in selected patients.
