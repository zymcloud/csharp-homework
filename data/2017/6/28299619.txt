The prognostic implications of the expression patterns of three tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3) and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), have been evaluated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). From January 1994 to December 2014, 1182 consecutive patients underwent hepatic resection and surgical microwave ablation for HCC at our institution. This study analyzed 475 patients within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh class A. Cumulative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were analyzed relative to the number of positive tumor markers. OS and DFS at 5 years postoperatively were 85.3 and 44.2% in triple-negative patients, 79.4 and 48.0% in single-positive patients, 56.2 and 32.9% in double-positive patients, and 61.7 and 35.7% in triple-positive patients with statistical significance. OS in triple-negative or single-positive patients was 85.3%, and that in all double- or triple-positive patients was 58.0% (P
