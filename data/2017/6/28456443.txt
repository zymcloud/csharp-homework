Background:The feasibility of salvage hepatectomy for locally recurrent hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) is unclear, especially for patients with viable parts of previously multinodular tumors.Methods:We reviewed charts of patients who underwent initial hepatectomies between 2000 and 2014 to select those with local recurrences (LR) after non-surgical treatments. Their postoperative outcomes, including morbidity, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared with matched patients who underwent initial hepatectomies for primary HCCs (PR). Their local recurrence patterns were divided into recurrent solitary tumors (Subgroup A); and recurrent parts of multinodular tumors (Subgroup B).Results:Among 664 patients, hepatectomy for LR was performed in 62 patients. Matched 59 patients were selected as PR. Clinicopathologic profiles at initial surgery were comparable between the LR and PR groups. Incidence of major morbidity (LR vs. PR, 7% vs. 5%, P = 1.00), 5-year RFS (21% vs. 37%, P = 0.28), and 5-year OS (69% vs. 69%, P = 0.62) were comparable. In the LR group, Subgroup B showed worse 5-year RFS (A vs. B, 29% vs. 0%, P Conclusion:Salvage hepatectomy for locally recurrent HCCs is feasible, and results in prognosis comparable with hepatectomy for primary HCCs. Although the risk of postoperative recurrence was high in Subgroup B, rare local recurrence suggests the usefulness of salvaging uncontrolled tumor by nonsurgical treatment.
