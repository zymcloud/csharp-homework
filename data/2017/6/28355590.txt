This study was to investigate the synergistic effects of polysaccharides with the molecular weight more than 80kDa (OTPS1) and polyphenols (OTP) isolated from oolong tea on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. The physicochemical properties of OTPS fractions were characterized. The synergistic effects of OTPS1 and OTP were evaluated based on the combination index (CI). Results showed that the highest uronic acid contents (32.96%) and viscosity (239.56mLg-1), multicavity structure of OTPS1 were contributed to the synergistic effects with OTP (52.17% content of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)). OTPS1 and OTP showed the strongest synergism ability on SMMC7721 cells (CI<0.2). Co-administrated with OTPS1 and OTP exhibited the synergistic effects on the tumor proliferation and growth with the CI values of 0.34 and 0.39, respectively. Antioxidative and immune levels of the mice were obviously increased after combination administration. These results suggested that OTPS1 in combination with OTP might be functional supplements for the treatment of HCC.
