Chronic infection with hepatitis B affects more than 240 million persons worldwide and is a major public health concern. Despite national and global initiatives to promote hepatitis B elimination, including newborn vaccination, catch up vaccination in adolescents and high-risk adults, screening of the blood supply and treatment of those in need, both new infections and a reservoir of chronic infections continue to result in morbidity and mortality. As with many chronic diseases, racial and ethnic disparities are seen in hepatitis B virus infection.Purpose of review:The goal of this review is to synthesize the data concerning the burden of hepatitis B infection in African Americans and Hispanics, two racial/ethnic groups in the United States who encounter barriers in access to care, low engagement in care and low utilization of diagnostic and treatment services.Recent findings:Recent data, though sparse in certain areas, continue to suggest differences in rates of incidence and prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in African Americans, and differences in screening, specialty referral and initiation of therapy for African Americans and Hispanics. Data are lacking about differences in liver disease progression and manifestations in both African Americans and Hispanics.Summary:Disparities in hepatitis B diagnosis, disease management, treatment and prevention remain for African Americans and Hispanics. These disparities require a commitment from governmental and public health organizations. The efforts should include increasing vaccination in those most susceptible to infection, screening those at highest risk for infection, initiating antiviral therapy in those who require it and monitoring for liver-related complications, such as decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the chronically infected. This multi-pronged approach is necessary to realize hepatitis B elimination.
