Objective:Though synergy of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is well discussed in previous reports, association of lipiodol retention by sorafenib addition to TACE with the survival outcomes remain elusive. Therefore, we studied the impact of sorafenib addition to TACE on survival outcomes mediated by lipiodol retention.Materials and methods:This is a long-term, retrospective, single-center study using medical records of patients diagnosed with HCC at the Department of Interventional Radiology of Zhengzhou University Affiliated Cancer Hospital (China) between April 2004 and March 2012.Results:Lipiodol deposition of > 50% was significantly increased in TACE + sorafenib group (70.87%) compared to TACE alone group (45.11%) (P = 0.0001). Significant increase in lipiodol deposition with sorafenib treatment was observed compared to TACE alone group (OR = 0.449, P = 0.041). The median overall survival in TACE + sorafenib and TACE alone groups were 38 months [95% CI = 9.772-56.228] and 31 months [95% CI = 21.855-40.145] respectively. Also, the hazard of death was comparatively greater in TACE alone group than TACE + sorafenib group [HR = 1.071]. Response rate to the therapy significantly increased after sorafenib administration to TACE patients, [compared to TACE alone treatment [69/103 (66.99%)] vs 55/133 (41.35%)], P = 0.0001.Conclusions:Lipiodol deposition is significantly increased upon sorafenib addition after TACE. However, there was no significant impact of lipiodol deposition on the survival benefits exerted by the synergistic combination and hence, future prospective trails are warranted to validate the findings of this study.
