Objectives:To investigate haemodynamic changes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver under hepatic artery occlusion.Methods:Thirty-eight HCC nodules in 25 patients were included. Computed tomography (CT) during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) with and without balloon occlusion of the hepatic artery was performed. CT attenuation and enhancement volume of HCC and liver with and without balloon occlusion were measured on CTHA. Influence of balloon position (segmental or subsegmental branch) was evaluated based on differences in HCC-to-liver attenuation ratio (H/L ratio) and enhancement volume of HCC and liver.Results:In the segmental group (n = 20), H/L ratio and enhancement volume of HCC and liver were significantly lower with balloon occlusion than without balloon occlusion. However, in the subsegmental group (n = 18), H/L ratio was significantly higher and liver enhancement volume was significantly lower with balloon occlusion; HCC enhancement volume was similar with and without balloon occlusion. Rate of change in H/L ratio and enhancement volume of HCC and liver were lower in the segmental group than in the subsegmental group. There were significantly more perfusion defects in HCC in the segmental group.Conclusions:Hepatic artery occlusion causes haemodynamic changes in HCC and liver, especially with segmental occlusion.Key points:• Hepatic artery occlusion causes haemodynamic changes in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver. • Segmental occlusion decreased rate of change in hepatocellular carcinoma-to-liver attenuation ratio. • Subsegmental occlusion increased rate of change in hepatocellular carcinoma-to-liver attenuation ratio. • Hepatic artery occlusion decreased enhancement volume of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver. • Hepatic artery occlusion causes perfusion defects in hepatocellular carcinoma.
