Aim:Apatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor mainly targeting VEGFR-2, exerts both antiangiogenesis and antiproliferation effects. Apatinib shows clinical benefit in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at an initial dose of 750 mg qd. We further assessed the efficacy and safety of apatinib at a more frequently used dose of 500 mg qd. The preliminary clinical outcome of apatinib in patients with brain metastases was also reported.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 25 patients who received apatinib between August 2015 and May 2016. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The objective response rate and disease control rate were 8.0% and 68.0%, respectively. The median PFS was 5.17 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-9.57) months. In the second-line setting (n = 13), the median PFS was 7.37 (95% CI: 0.01-14.72) months, whereas the median PFS for the 12 patients treated with apatinib as third line or beyond therapy was 5.17 (95% CI: 1.78-8.55) months. Of the seven patients with brain metastases, four patients had stable disease. All patients were well tolerant to apatinib without any grade 3 or 4 adverse events. The most common grade 1 or 2 adverse events included hypertension (72.0%), hand-foot-skin reaction (24.0%), fatigue (24.0%) and abnormal liver function (20.0%).Conclusions:Apatinib is effective and well tolerated in patients with advanced NSCLC, even at a dosage of 500 mg qd, and might offer a new option for the treatment of such patients with brain metastases.
