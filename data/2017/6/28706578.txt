Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common neoplasia which represents the second leading cause of cancer related death. Most cases occur in developing countries, but its incidence is rising in Western countries due to hepatitis C. Although hepatitis therapies have evolved and the HCC screening has increased in several areas, 40% present with advanced disease which is only amenable for palliative systemic treatment. HCC continues posing a challenge, in part due to the inherent chemoresistance of this neoplasia, the pharmacologic challenges due to an ill liver, difficulty in assessing radiological responses accurately, etc. Traditional chemotherapy have shown some responses without clear survival benefit, however, sorafenib demonstrated advantages in survival in advanced HCC when liver function is kept and recently immunotherapy seems to be a promising approach for some patients. This article will briefly expose the most relevant systemic treatment modalities to offer a general view from the past to the future.
