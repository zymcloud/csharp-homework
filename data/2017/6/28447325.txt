Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains the main cause of liver disease and can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV may also develop extrahepatic manifestations in the skin, eyes, joints, kidneys, nervous system, and immune system. In fact, several studies reported that up to 70% of HCV patients experienced extrahepatic manifestations. Lichen planus (LP), which is an immune system disorder that is triggered by viral infections, allergens, and stress, can affect the skin, mouth, nails, and scalp. The association of LP with HCV has been reported, but the effect of HCV treatment on LP remission is controversial. We encountered a 53-year-old man with HCV genotype 2a and LP that were successfully treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks. After treatment, he achieved sustained virological response against HCV and remission of erosive LP lesions on the lip. In the era of interferon (IFN)-based treatment for HCV, exacerbation of autoimmune diseases is a common adverse event. Therefore, use of an IFN-free regimen of direct-acting antivirals for HCV might prevent the extrahepatic manifestation of an immune disorder.
