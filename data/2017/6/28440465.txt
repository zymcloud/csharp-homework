In the current study, we synthesized a series of new compounds targeting tubulin and tested their anti-proliferative activities. Among these new synthetic com-pounds, 5-(furan-2-yl)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiol-3-one oxime (6f) exhibited significant anti-proliferative activity against different human cancer cell lines including human gastric adenocarcinoma SGC-7901, human non-small cell lung cancer A549, and human ﬁbrosarcoma HT-1080. As a result, 6f was selected to further test the sensitivity to different cancer cell lines including human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549, human liver carcinoma cell line HepG-2, human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines KB, SGC-7901 and HT-1080. Among these cell lines, HT-1080 and HeLa are the most sensitive. Therefore, HT-1080 was selected to further explore the properties of anti-proliferative activity and the underlying mechanisms. Our data proved that 6f exhibited strong anti-proliferative effects against HT-1080 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We showed that the growth inhibitory effect of 6f in HT-1080 cells was related with microtubule depolymerisation. Molecular docking studies revealed that 6f interacted and bound efﬁciently with the colchicine-binding site of tubulin. In addition, 6f treatment induced G2/M cell cycle arrest dose-dependently and subsequently induced cell apoptosis. Western blot study indicated that upregulation of cyclin B1 and p-cdc2 was related with G2/M arrest. 6f-induced cell apoptosis was associated with both mitochondrial and death receptor pathway. In conclusion, our data showed that 6f, among the newly synthetic compounds, exhibited highest anti-proliferative activity by disrupting the microtubule polymerisation, causing G2/M arrest and subsequently inducing cell apoptosis in HT-1080 cells. Hence, 6f is a promising microtubule depolymerising agent for the treatment of various cancers especially human ﬁbrosarcoma.
