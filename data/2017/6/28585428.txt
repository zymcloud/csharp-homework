Hepatocarcinoma is one of the malignant cancers with significant morbidity and mortality. Immunotherapy has emerged in clinical treatment, owing to the limitation and severe side effects of chemotherapy. In the immune system, natural killer (NK) cells are important effectors required to eliminate malignant tumor cells without the limitation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule issues. Hence, treatment which could stimulate NK cells is of great interest. Here, we investigated the efficacy of the combined therapy of TT-1 (a mutant of melittin) and interferon-α (IFN-α) on NK cells and human liver cancer HepG-2/Huh7 cells in vitro and in vivo, as well as the mechanism involved. The combination therapy significantly inhibited the growth of HepG-2/Huh7 cells in vivo, but this effect was impaired after depleting NK cells. TT-1 not only up-regulated MHC class I-related chain molecules A (MICA) expression, but also prevented the secretion of soluble MICA (sMICA). Both the mRNA and protein of a disintegrin and metallopeptidase 10 (ADAM 10) in HepG-2/Huh7 cells were decreased after TT-1 treatment. The combined therapy of TT-1 and IFN-α could suppress the growth of HepG-2/Huh7 xenografted tumor effectively via promoting the interaction of NK group 2, member D (NKG2D) and MICA, indicating that TT-1+IFN-α would be a potential approach in treating liver cancer.
