Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been identified as one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) attract much attention of researchers, and they are demonstrated to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. LncRNA gastric carcinoma high expressed transcript 1 lncRNA GHET1 is found to be dysregulated in gastric cancer (GC). However, its clinical value and potential biological function in HCC remains unclear. In this study, the expression level of GHET1 was analyzed in 72 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). GHET1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher level of GHET1 was related to vascular invasion, cirrhosis, tumor size, edmindson grade, and poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of GHET1 inhibited cell proliferation of HCC, and also caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that GHET1 could epigenetically repress transcription of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) in HCC cells by recruiting PRC2 into KLF2 promoter region. Our results indicated that lncRNA GHET1, as a growth regulator, might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.
