Few studies have reported progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following surgery and adjuvant therapies. Enrolled in this study were 155 MSCC patients with primary HCC who received surgery and adjuvant therapies between 2000 and 2015. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox's proportional hazards regression mode were performed to investigate the clinical features and prognostic factors affecting PFS and OS. The median PFS and OS was 7.0 months and 9.7 months, respectively. 92.9% patients responded well to surgery according to the Visual Analogue Scale, Frankel Score and postoperative complication occurrences. 68 (43.9%) patients who received circumferential decompression achieved better PFS than the remaining 87 (56.1%) patients who received laminectomy. Favorable outcomes were achieved after surgery during the perioperative period. Circumferential decompression was associated with better PFS than laminectomy. The postoperative Frankel Score E, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 1 or 2, no visceral metastasis, administration of postoperative radiation and the use of Sorafenib were found to be significant predictors of better PFS and OS. Patients who previously underwent resection of primary HCC with/without liver transplantation tended to have a better OS.
