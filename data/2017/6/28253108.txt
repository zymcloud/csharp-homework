Purpose To characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells surviving ischemia with respect to cell cycle kinetics, chemosensitivity, and molecular dependencies that may be exploited to potentiate treatment with transarterial embolization (TAE). Materials and Methods Animal studies were performed according to institutionally approved protocols. The growth kinetics of HCC cells were studied in standard and ischemic conditions. Viability and cell cycle kinetics were measured by using flow cytometry. Cytotoxicity profiling was performed by using a colorimetric cell proliferation assay. Analyses of the Cancer Genome Atlas HCC RNA-sequencing data were performed by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Activation of molecular mediators of autophagy was measured with Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy. In vivo TAE was performed in a rat model of HCC with (n = 5) and without (n = 5) the autophagy inhibitor Lys05. Statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad software. Results HCC cells survived ischemia with an up to 43% increase in the fraction of quiescent cells as compared with cells grown in standard conditions (P Â© RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
