Benefits of liver transplantation (LT) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are well established. However, there is debate regarding optimal and equitable selection of patients best served by LT, particularly in the face of limited organ availability. Herein, we discuss topics regarding LT selection criteria for patients with HCC. Recent change in UNOS policy currently mandates a 6-month observation period prior to priority listing and institutes a cap of 34 MELD exception points for patients with HCC. Additionally, two further proposed changes to UNOS policy include (1) requiring locoregional therapy for those with small (2-3 cm) unifocal HCC prior to applying for exception points and (2) allowing downstaging in select patients with UNOS T3 lesions. These policies move beyond simply using tumor burden to using markers of tumor biology for selecting patients who have the lowest risk of post-transplant recurrence and best chance at long-term post-transplant survival. Given increasing time on transplant waiting lists and shortage of donor grafts, LT should be reserved for patients who may achieve significant benefit compared to non-transplant therapies. Potential benefit to HCC patients must be weighed against the harm from delaying or precluding LT for non-HCC patients on the waiting list, particularly in regions with limited donor availability. The relative benefit of LT in patients with small (
