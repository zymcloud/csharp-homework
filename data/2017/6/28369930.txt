Background:A 23-year-old male Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) showed left ptosis, which progressed to exophthalmos.Methods:The macaque underwent a clinical examination, CT and MRI, and was euthanized. Necropsy and histopathological examination were performed after euthanasia.Results:The CT revealed and MRI confirmed an intracranial mass at the skull base with orbital extension. At necropsy, there were a large hepatic mass and an intracranial mass compressing the left temporal lobe of the brain. Histopathological and immunohistological examinations revealed that the masses were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a metastatic lesion. In both the primary and metastatic lesions, neoplastic hepatocytes were arranged mainly in a trabecular pattern. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2) and hepatocyte paraffin 1 and negative for cytokeratin 7 and 20 and vimentin.Conclusion:To our knowledge, this is the first case report of HCC with intracranial metastasis in a macaque.
