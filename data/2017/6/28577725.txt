Background:Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The hepatectomy is the most effective and the only potentially curative treatment for patients with resectable neoplasm. Precisely preoperative assessment of remnant liver volume is essential in preventing postoperative liver failure. The aim of our study is to report our experience of using a medical image three dimensional (3D) visualization system (MI-3DVS), which was developed by our team, in assisting hepatectomy for patients with liver cancer.Methods:Between January 2010 and June 2016, 69 patients with liver cancer underwent hepatic resection based on the MI-3DVS were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent CT scan 5 days before the surgery and within 5 days after resection. CT images were reconstructed with the MI-3DVS to assist to perform hepatectomy. Simple linear regression, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used to evaluate the relationship and agreement between actual excisional liver volume (AELV) and predicted excisional liver volume (PELV).Results:Among 69 patients in this study, 62(89.85%) of them were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma by histopathologic examination, and 41(59.42%) underwent major hepatectomy. The average AELV was 330.13 cm3 and the average PELV was 287.67 cm3. The simple regression equation is AELV = 1.016 Ã— PELV+30.39(r = 0.966; p < 0.0003). PELV (ICC = 0.964) achieved an excellent agreement with AELV with statistical significance (p < 0.001). 65 of 69 dots are in the range of 95% confidence interval in Bland-Altman analyses.Conclusions:The MI-3DVS has advantages of simple usage and convenient hold. It is accurate in assessment of postoperative liver volume and improve safety in liver resection.
