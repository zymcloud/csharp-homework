Objective: To investigate the association between expression of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) in liver cancer tissue and prognosis, as well as its influence on metastasis and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods: Overexpression and downregulated expression of PGK1 in HCC cells were mediated by lentivirus to establish hepatoma cell lines with different expression levels of PGK1. The Transwell chamber invasion assay, wound healing assay, and colony-forming assay were used to investigate the influence of PGK1 on metastasis, invasion, and proliferation of HCC cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure the expression of PGK1 in liver cancer tissue samples from 116 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent radical surgery, and the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test were used to determine the association between PGK1 expression and prognosis of patients with liver cancer. Results: HCCLM3 and MHCC97H HCC cells with high metastatic potential had significantly higher expression of PGK1 than Hep3B and Huh7 HCC cells with low metastatic potential. Downregulation of PGK1 expression significantly inhibited the migration (31.2% ± 2.4% vs 12.0% ± 1.3%, t = 21.57, P < 0.01), invasion (58 ± 11 vs 21 ± 8, t = 4.687, P < 0.05), and colony-forming ability (168.6 ± 15.1 vs 118.4 ± 8.1, t = 6.650, P < 0.05) of MHCC97H cells, while overexpression of PGK1 enhanced the migration (62.8% ± 4.4% vs 83.6% ± 6.1%, t = 20.56, P < 0.01), invasion (80 ± 12 vs 121 ± 15, t = 4.603, P < 0.05), and colony-forming ability (52.3 ± 8.6 vs 84.7 ± 9.0, t = 27.18, P < 0.01) of Hep3B cells. The high PGK1 expression group had significantly shorter median disease-free survival time and mean survival time than the low PGK1 expression group (22.00 ± 8.51 vs not reached, P < 0.05; 46.00 ± 16.87 vs not reached, P < 0.01). Conclusions: PGK1 is involved in the regulation of metastasis and invasion of HCC cells and can promote the migration and invasion of HCC cells. Therefore, PGK1 may be an important predictor of prognosis and postoperative recurrence in patients with liver cancer.
