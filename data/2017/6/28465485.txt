Background & aims:Although immunotherapy has emerged as an attractive therapy for refractory cancers, its limited efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggests the need for a combination strategy that can either enhance or complement therapeutic effect. We investigated whether combination of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and radiation could enhance antitumor effect in a murine HCC model.Methods:Using murine HCC, HCa-1, the effect of radiation on programmed death-ligand1 (PD-L1) expression was determined by real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and western blotting. Signaling pathways involved in altered PD-L1 expression were examined. Tumor growth and survival rate were evaluated for a combination of anti-PD-L1 and radiation. Immunological parameters in the tumor were assessed using flow cytometry and histological study.Results:Radiation upregulated PD-L1 expression in tumor cells through IFN-Î³/STAT3 signaling, which could facilitate therapeutic action of anti-PD-L1. Combination of anti-PD-L1 and radiation significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to treatment with anti-PD-L1 alone or radiation alone group (PConclusions:The combination of anti-PD-L1 and radiation significantly improved the antitumor effect shown in tumor growth delay as well as in survival, supporting a novel combination strategy of immunoradiotherapy in HCC.
