Laparoscopic liver surgery has become an established procedure in the treatment of liver tumors. Due to its short-term and long-term advantages, the number of centers with experience in laparoscopic liver surgery has greatly increased in the last few years. The complexity of the interventions performed has nearly reached the level of open surgery. This article describes the importance of laparoscopic hepatic surgery and discusses the evidence for the procedure. In addition, the indications for the most frequently resected tumors, metastases of colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma are explained together with important aspects of certain tumor localizations. In addition, the authors explain the technical aspects of the surgical technique and give an overview on new developments. To illustrate the possibilities of laparoscopic liver surgery, a video of a complete laparoscopically performed associating liver partition and portal vein ligation (ALPPS) procedure is available as supplementary material.
