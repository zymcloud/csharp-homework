Aim:Our aim was (1) to evaluate the prevalence of steatosis in lymphoma patients and its evolution during treatment; (2) to evaluate the impact of hepatic steatosis on 18F-FDG liver uptake; and (3) to study how hepatic steatosis affects the Deauville score (DS) for discriminating between responders and non-responders.Methods:Over a 1-year period, 358 PET scans from 227 patients [122 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 57 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 48 Follicular lymphoma (FL)] referred for baseline (n = 143), interim (n = 79) and end-of-treatment (EoT, n = 136) PET scans were reviewed. Steatosis was diagnosed on the unenhanced CT part of PET/CT examinations using a cut-off value of 42 Hounsfield units (HU). EARL-compliant SULmax were recorded on the liver and the tumour target lesion. DS were then computed.Results:Prevalence of steatosis at baseline, interim and EoT PET was 15/143 (10.5%), 6/79 (7.6%) and 16/136 (11.8%), respectively (p = 0.62).Ten out of 27 steatotic patients (37.0%) displayed a steatotic liver on all examinations. Six patients (22.2%) had a disappearance of hepatic steatosis during their time-course of treatment. Only one patient developed steatosis during his course of treatment. Liver SULmax values were significantly lower in the steatosis versus non-steatotic groups of patients for interim (1.66 ± 0.36 versus 2.15 ± 0.27) and EoT (1.67 ± 0.29 versus 2.17 ± 0.30) PET. CT density was found to be an independent factor that correlated with liver SULmax, while BMI, blood glucose level and the type of chemotherapy regimen were not. Using a method based on this correlation to correct liver SULmax, all DS4 steatotic patients on interim (n = 1) and EoT (n = 2) PET moved to DS3.Conclusions:Steatosis is actually a theoretical but not practical issue in most patients but should be recognised and corrected in appropriate cases, namely, for those patients scored DS4 with a percentage difference between the target lesion and the liver background lower than 30%.
