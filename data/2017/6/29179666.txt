Background:This study evaluates the surgical stress response following laparoscopic and open liver resection for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM).Methods:Patients with CRLM were prospectively randomized to receive open or laparoscopic liver resection (NCT03131778). Blood samples were drawn preoperatively and 24 h after resection. The serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 levels were measured. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of angiogenesis-related factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] and HIF-1) and inflammation-related factors (COX-2 and MMP-9) in both tumor tissue and normal liver parenchyma were detected.Results:Twenty patients for each arm were included. Size of metastasis, type of resection, and neoadjuvant therapy were comparable between groups. Postoperative stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group. Higher levels of IL-6 were observed after the operation in both open and laparoscopic groups, although no differences in the post-operative levels between the groups was noted. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the mRNA expression of VEGF, HIF-1, MMP-9, and COX-2 between the treatment groups. No differences were observed in terms of overall survival and disease free survival.Conclusions:The immunological effects of treatment were similar between the groups. Thus, the laparoscopic approach does not seem to significantly influence the surgical stress and tumor related factors in patients suffering from colorectal liver metastases.
