Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determine the recommended doses in the Phase I part of the study, and to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity in the Phase II part, of continuous hepatic intra-arterial infusion therapy with 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone and cisplatin (FMP therapy) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Forty-five patients with advanced HCC were enrolled. The therapy consisted of continuous intra-arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil from Day 1 through Day 5, and intra-arterial administration of mitoxantrone and cisplatin on Day 1 [5-fluorouracil/mitoxantrone/cisplatin (mg/m2): Level 1; 400/4/60, Level 2; 400/6/60, Level 3; 500/6/60].Results:In the Phase I part of the study, one of the six patients at Level 1 developed DLTs, including Grade 3 pulmonary embolism, while none of the patients at either Level 2 or Level 3 exhibited any DLTs. In the Phase II part, at Level 3, 36 patients were enrolled. Nine patients (25%) showed partial response, representing a response rate of 25% (95% confidence interval: 12-42%). The overall median survival time, 1-year survival rate and median progression-free survival time were 11.3 months, 46.9% and 7.0 months, respectively. The main Grade 3 or 4 hematological and non-hematological toxicities were leukopenia (36%), neutropenia (39%), thrombocytopenia (19%), and elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (22%), elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (14%) and occlusion of hepatic artery (22%), respectively.Conclusion:Hepatic intra-arterial infusion therapy of FMP could not demonstrate a favorable tumor response and overall survival in patients with advanced HCC.
