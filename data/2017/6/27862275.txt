Background and aim:Long non-coding RNA zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1) is frequently amplified in hepatocellular carcinoma and promotes metastasis by increasing zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), which can potentiate the progression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the expression pattern and role of ZFAS1 in colonic cancer remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of ZFAS1 and its clinical significance in colonic cancer.Methods:Paired clinical colonic cancer tissue samples and clinicopathologic characteristics of 73 patients were analyzed. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to evaluate expression levels of ZFAS1 in colonic cancer tissues, cell lines, and plasma. ZEB1 and EMT-related markers expression levels also were explored. Cell biology assays were used to explore the biologic consequences of ZFAS1 in regulating cell proliferation and invasion, as well as the roles in regulating EMT.Results:Zinc finger antisense 1 was up-regulated in colonic cancer tissues compared with adjacent mucosa (P Conclusions:Long non-coding RNA ZFAS1 may function as an oncogene by modulating ZEB1 to induce EMT. Manipulation of ZFAS1 level may be a novel approach to suppress colonic cancer progression. In addition, ZFAS1 in plasma has the potential to be a diagnostic biomarker of colonic cancer.
