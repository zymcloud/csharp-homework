miR-26a is known to play an important oncosuppressive role in HCC. However, its regulatory role and relationship with other non-coding RNAs is less clear. In the present study, we report that the expression levels of miR-26a and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) were frequently downregulated in HCC tissues compared to matched non-malignant tissues. In addition, the expression levels of miR-26a and MEG3 were negatively correlated with the tumor sizes and TNM clinical stage in HCC patients. Overexpression of miR-26a significantly reduced the capacity of proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3B) was a direct target gene of miR-26a. Overexpression of miR-26a suppressed the expression level of DNMT3B. Inhibited expression of DNMT3B showed similar tumor suppressive effects induced by miR-26a upregulation, and resulted in the upregulation of MEG3. Furthermore, we found that the expression levels of DNMT3B were upregulated in the HCC tissues compared with non-malignant tissues, and it was inversely correlated with miR-26a and MEG3 in HCC tissues. Thus, these results provided a plausible link between the observed reduction of miR-26a and MEG3 in HCCs. Together, the present study added miR-26a/DNMT3B/MEG3 axis to the complex mechanisms of HCC development.
