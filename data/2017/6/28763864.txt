Objective: To further understand the interaction protein spectrum of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein AB (hnRNP AB), and to investigate their clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: We carried out mass spectrometry to reveal the specific peptides of KRAB-associated protein 1 (Kap1) and hnRNPAB, and verified their interaction by immunocoprecipitation and western blotting. Expression of hnRNPAB/Kap1 proteins were detected by immunohistochemical staining in the tissue microarrays. Categorical data were analyzed by the chi square test or Fisher exact test; enumeration data between groups were compared using Student t-test or Wilcocon signed rank test; the cumulative recurrence and survival rates were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the differences were assessed using the log-rank test. Results: We identified Kap1 as a molecular partner for hnRNPAB in HCCLM3 cells and HepG2 cells as well. We found that the 5-year survival rate of the Kap1high patients was significantly lower than the survival rate of those of the Kap1low group (36% vs 59% , HR = 1.67, P < 0.001). Similarly, Kap1high HCC patients had the poorest prognosis at 5-years, with higher cumulative recurrence rate than Kap1low patients (72% vs 54%, HR = 1.66, P = 0.001). Univariate and Multivariate analyses revealed that hnRNPAB /Kap1 alone (HR = 1.35 /1.28, P = 0.001) or in combination with Kap1 (HR =1.24 /1.27, P < 0.05) were independent prognostic indicators for overall survival and time to recurrence. Conclusion: In HCC cells, hnRNPAB and Kap1 form protein complexes. The expression levels of hnRNPAB alone or in combination with Kap1 in HCC patients are important because they provide not only a predictor for HCC prognosis but also a therapeutic target for future studies.
