Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) dysfunctions have been associated with cancer development. SNORD126 is an orphan C/D box snoRNA that is encoded within introns 5-6 of its host gene, cyclin B1-interacting protein 1 (CCNB1IP1). The cancer-associated molecular mechanisms triggered by SNORD126 are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that SNORD126 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patient samples. SNORD126 increased Huh-7 and SW480 cell growth and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Knockdown of SNORD126 inhibited HepG2 and LS174T cell growth. We verified that SNORD126 was not processed into small RNAs with miRNA activity. Moreover, SNORD126 did not show a significant expression correlation with CCNB1IP1 in HCC samples or regulate CCNB1IP1 expression. Our gene expression profile analysis indicated that SNORD126-upregulated genes frequently mapped to the PI3K-AKT pathway. SNORD126 overexpression increased the levels of phosphorylated AKT, GSK-3β, and p70S6K and elevated fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) expression. siRNA-mediated knockdown or AZD4547-mediated inactivation of FGFR2 in SNORD126-overexpressing Huh-7 cells inhibited AKT phosphorylation and suppressed cell growth. These findings indicate an oncogenic role for SNORD126 in cancer and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target.
