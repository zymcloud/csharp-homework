To investigate effects of miR-503 on cisplatin sensitivity in BEL-7402 cells by targeting of bcl-2. Methods: MiR-503 and bcl-2 mRNA expression levels in hepatocellular carcinoma cells were measured by real-time quantitative (qRT)-PCR; Bcl-protein level was detected by Western blot; miR-503 mimics were transiently transfected to the BEL-7402 cells by liposome transfection; potential target genes of miR-503 were predicted by Bioinformatics software; miR-503 potential targets were validated by dual luciferase activity; and the cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Results: MiR-503 level was down-regulated and Bcl-2 protein expression level was up-regulated in BEL-7402 cells compared with HL-7702 cells. MiR-503 could interact with bcl-2 and inhibit its expression. Cell vitality with miR-503 transfection was significantly reduced compared to that in the negative control. Conclusion: MiR-503 may enhance the sensitivity of BEL-7402 cells to cisplatin and inhibit the cell proliferation by targeting bcl-2.
