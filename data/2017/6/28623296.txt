This study evaluated if iodine-125 brachytherapy prophylaxis after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) prolongs time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) of patients in high risk of locoregional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. 116 patients with total tumor necrosis after RFA were divided into iodine-125 brachytherapy prophylaxis treatment group and control group. The primary endpoint was TTR, and secondary endpoints were OS and treatment-related adverse events. There were no significant differences among the baseline characteristics of two subgroups patients. The mean iodine-125 particles were 29.8 (26.59 Â± 12.51 mCi) per patient. The mean follow-up was 25 months, and mean TTR of treatment and control groups were 21.7 and 15.9 months (P = 0.733); mean OS of two subgroups were 41.7 and 40.9 months (P = 0.316). There were no significant differences of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-and 5-years TTR and OS and patients' immunity pre- and 1 month post-treatment. Extrahepatic metastasis was found to have a statistically significant influence on TTR, and AFP, extrahepatic metastasis were found to have a statistically significant influence on OS by multivariate analysis. There was no major complications and procedure related death. Iodine-125 brachytherapy prophylaxis after RFA can't improve TTR and OS of HCC patients who were in high risk of locoregional tumor recurrence.
