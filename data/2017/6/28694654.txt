Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) has been recently demonstrated as a method to induce rapid and extensive hypertrophy within a short time and has been employed for a variety of primary and metastatic liver tumors. However, controversies remain due to its high morbidity and mortality. To enable safer surgery, liver surgeons have searched for better technical modifications, such as partial ALPPS, mini-ALPPS, minimally invasive ALPPS, and Terminal branches portal vein Embolization Liver Partition for Planned hepatectomy (TELPP). It seems that TELPP is very promising, because it has the main advantage of ALPPS - the rapid increase of future liver remnant volume, but the morbidity and mortality are much lower because only one surgical operation is required.
