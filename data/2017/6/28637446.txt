Background:This study aimed to investigate potential miRNAs and genes associated with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Weighted co-expression network analysis was utilized to analyze the mRNA and miRNA sequencing data of HCC from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. Significant network modules were identified, and then functions of genes in the gene network modules and target genes of miRNAs in the miRNA network modules were explored. Additionally, correlations between network modules and prognostic factors of HCC were analyzed.Results:In total, 10 mRNA network modules were identified, three of which were significantly related to tumor stage, NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and patient age. Four miRNA network modules were identified, of which one was associated with tumor stage. Targets of hsa-miR-363-5p were found distributed in the gene network modules, such as RGPD5, RGPD6, ZNF445 and ZNF780B. Kaplan-Meier test revealed that low expression of hsa-miR-363-5p was associated with better overall survival of HCC patients.Conclusion:hsa-miR-363-5p may be a potential prognostic marker for HCC.
