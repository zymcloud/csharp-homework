Background:Early recurrence (ER) after hepatic resection (HR) is a poor prognostic factor for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to identify the clinicopathological features, outcomes, and risk factors for ER after HR for small HCC in order to clarify the reasons why ER is a worse recurrence pattern.Methods:We retrospectively examined 130 patients who underwent HR for small HCC (â‰¤30 mm). Recurrence was classified into ER (Results:ER was observed in 39 patients (30.0%). The survival rate of the ER group was significantly lower than that of the LR group (PConclusions:ER was a highly malignant recurrence pattern associated with DBMC and subsequent poor survival after HR for small HCC. Multi-nodularity, non-simple nodular type, and microvascular invasion predict ER, and taking these factors into consideration may be useful for the decision of the treatment strategy for small HCC after HR.
