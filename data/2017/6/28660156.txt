Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) frequently occurs with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is an important factor in determining the prognosis of HCC. In many cases of HCC with advanced PVTT, treatment is difficult because the tumor has considerable extension into the liver, and portal hypertension is a frequent complication. The standard therapy for unresectable HCC with advanced PVTT is sorafenib therapy in patients with good hepatic function. However, the outcomes of sorafenib therapy are not completely satisfactory, making the development of another therapy an urgent task. Therefore, this review aims to summarize non-operative treatments for HCC with advanced PVTT and discuss future perspectives based on those therapies, including therapies still being developed.
