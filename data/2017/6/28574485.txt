Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of daucosterol on HCC by investigating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In this study, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were treated with varying concentrations of daucosterol, and the corresponding inhibitory effects on HCC cells were examined via CCK-8 assays. Cell migration and invasion abilities were detected via transwell assays. β-Catenin and phospho (p)-β-catenin levels were analyzed via western blotting. Our results showed that daucosterol reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities of HCC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, daucosterol reduced the levels of β-catenin and p-β-catenin in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, the Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor SB-216763 was used to treat HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells with daucosterol. Our results showed that co-treatment with daucosterol and SB-216763 abolished the effects of daucosterol on cell inhibition ratios, cell migration, and cell invasion. These findings indicated that daucosterol inhibited cell migration and invasion in HCC cells via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, our study highlights the use of daucosterol as a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.
