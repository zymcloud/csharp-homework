Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatotropic virus that is responsible for a significant burden of disease, causing liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a small DNA virus with a replication strategy that is similar to that of a retrovirus. HBV is prone to mutagenesis and under the influence of diverse selection pressures, has evolved into a pool of quasispecies, genotypes and mutants, which confers a significant survival advantage. The genome is small, circular, and compact but has a complex replication strategy. The viral life cycle involves the formation of a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is organized into a minichromosome that is the template for the synthesis of viral mRNA. HBV DNA (double-stranded linear form) can also integrate into the host genome, ensuring lifelong persistence of the virus. To date, despite great advances in therapeutics, once HBV is chronically established, it is incurable. This is by virtue of many aspects of its virological structure and viral life cycle. In this review, we aim to discuss important aspects of the virology of HBV with a focus on clinical implications.
