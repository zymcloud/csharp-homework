In this study, a glycyrrhetinic acid-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN-GA) was prepared for active tumor targeting. MSN-GA exhibited satisfactory loading capacity for insoluble drugs, uniform size distribution, and specific tumor cell targeting. Glycyrrhetinic acid, a hepatocellular carcinoma-targeting group, was covalently decorated on the surface of MSN via an amido bond. The successful synthesis of MSN-GA was validated by the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and zeta potential measurement. TEM images revealed the spherical morphology and uniform size distribution of the naked MSN and MSN-GA. Curcumin (CUR), an insoluble model drug, was loaded into MSN-GA (denoted as MSN-GA-CUR) with a high-loading capacity (8.78%Â±1.24%). The results of the in vitro cellular experiment demonstrated that MSN-GA-CUR significantly enhanced cytotoxicity and cellular uptake toward hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells via a specific GA receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism. The results of this study provide a promising nanoplatform for the targeting of hepatocellular carcinoma.
