Background Gadoxetic acid is being widely used for detection and characterization of hepatic nodules. However, there are no data regarding intra-individual comparison of imaging features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on dynamic computed tomography (CT), gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-DTPA-MRI), and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI). Purpose To evaluate typical imaging features of HCC and capsule appearance with dynamic CT, Gd-DTPA-MRI, and Gd-EOB-MRI. Material and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 56 HCCs in 49 patients. Lesion attenuation/signal intensity was graded using a five-point scale based on dynamic phase and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging. Subjective washout and capsule appearance were evaluated on portal venous phase (PVP) or delayed/transitional phase (DP/TP) imaging. The tumor-to-liver contrast ratio (TLCR) was calculated. Results Gd-DTPA-MRI and Gd-EOB-MRI was graded higher than CT on arterial phase ( P
