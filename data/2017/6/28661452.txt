In order to develop novel chemotherapeutic agents with potent anticancer activities, a series of dehydroabietic acid (DHA) derivatives bearing an acylhydrazone moiety were designed and synthesized by the condensation between dehydroabietic acylhydrazide (3) and a variety of substituted arylaldehydes. The inhibitory activities of these compounds against CNE-2 (nasopharynx), HepG2 (liver), HeLa (epithelial cervical), and BEL-7402 (liver) human carcinoma cell lines were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in vitro. The screening results revealed that many of the compounds showed moderate to high levels of anticancer activities against the tested cancer cell lines and some displayed similar potent inhibitory activities to the commercial anticancer drug cisplatin, while they exhibited lower cytotoxicity against normal human liver cell (HL-7702). Particularly, compound 4w, N'-(3,5-difluorobenzylidene)-2-(dehydroabietyloxy)acetohydrazide, with an IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) value of 2.21 μM against HeLa cell, was about 17-fold more active than that of the parent compound, and showed remarkable cytotoxicity with an IC50 value of 14.46 μM against BEL-7402 cell. These results provide an encouraging framework that could lead to the development of potent novel anticancer agents.
