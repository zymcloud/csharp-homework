Posttransplant hepatitis C virus (HCV) recurrence is universal in chronic hepatitis C recipients. Antiviral therapy is suggested after liver transplant to halt disease progression. Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy remains the standard of care in many areas where direct antiviral agents are poorly accessible. This study aimed to assess the treatment efficacy and safety of the regimen for Taiwanese patients with post-transplant HCV recurrence. Nine patients with HCV recurrence postliver transplantation were allocated. Patients received either pegylated interferon α-2a 180 μg/wk or pegylated interferon α-2b 1.5 mg/kg/wk plus ribavirin for 24-48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the achievement of sustained virological response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA throughout 6 months of follow-up after the end of treatment. The safety profiles were also documented. The rates of rapid virological response, early virological response, end-of-treatment virological response, and SVR were 33%, 63%, 75%, and 56% respectively. Of the four patients who failed antiviral treatment, the treatment responses were nonresponse (n = 1), loss of follow-up (n = 1), and relapse (n = 2). Three patients terminated therapy early due to severe adverse events, including severe anemia, intra-abdomen infection, and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence. One of the three patients who terminated treatment early at Week 6 experienced rapid virological response followed by SVR. Pegylated interferon/ribavirin combination allowed a chance for cure with a fair SVR rate in Taiwanese chronic hepatitis C patients postliver transplantation. Early identification of side effects and careful monitoring during therapy might enhance the treatment efficacy.
