Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a big problem in China where the Hepatitis B (HBV) infection patients are near to 120 million. Early screening and diagnosis is the key to reduce the incidence and mortality of HCC. Serum AFP detection is the main methods for diagnosis, recurrent monitoring and therapeutic evaluation of primary HCC. Hepatitis patients should detect the AFP at least once every six months to help early diagnosis of HCC. Unfortunately, most hepatitis and other liver disease patients do not test their AFP regularly. Therefore, a rapid, convenient detect kit for AFP is necessary for the hepatitis patients to test AFP at home by themselves. It will be very helpful to the HCC early screening and early diagnosis. We screened 859 individuals who were HBsAg positive and had high risk of HCC in Qidong by using two different kits, AFP one-step rapid detection kit (Shanghai Outdo Biotech) and AFP Diagnostics ELISA kit (Zhengzhou Autobio Diagnostics), and compared the results. As a result, the positive accordance rate and the negative accordance rate of AFP one-step rapid detection kit and the Autobio ELISA kit were 95.65% (22/23) and 99.40% (831/836), respectively. The total diagnose accordance rate reached up to 99.30% (853/859). The screening results showed a high accordance rate of two methods. It is so meaningful to achieve home-test and improve HCC early screening and diagnosis by using AFP one-step rapid detection kit.
