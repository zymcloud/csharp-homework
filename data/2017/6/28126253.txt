Background:The segmentation of the right anterior sector of the liver still is debatable due to the lack of an anatomic landmark of the boundary between Couinaud segments V and VIII (cranio-caudal segmentation). Some authors have proposed the concept of a ventro-dorsal segmentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate which concept of segmentation better reflects the anatomy.Methods:Using 3-dimensional computed tomography software, the ramification pattern of the right anterior portal vein was examined in 100 patients. A thick, hepatic, venous branch that passes through Couinaud segment VIII was termed V8, and its course was investigated using a virtual hepatectomy.Results:Regarding the anatomy of the portal vein in the right anterior sector, the cranio-caudal type was found in 53 patients, the ventro-dorsal type in 23 patients, and the trifurcation type in 13 patients. The remaining 11 patients had miscellaneous patterns of ramification. In the cranio-caudal type, the volume of the cranial segment was greater (P < .001) than that of the caudal segment. In the ventro-dorsal type, the volume of the ventral segment was greater (P = .007) than that of the dorsal segment. The V8 was identified in 81 of the 89 (91%) patients analyzed. The proportion of cases in which the V8 functioned as a landmark of the border between the ventral and dorsal segments was 63% (56/89 patients).Conclusion:Regarding the segmentation of the right anterior sector of the liver, the cranio-caudal segmentation introduced by Couinaud is dominant (53%), while ventro-dorsal segmentation is less common (23%). Therefore, universalization of the concept of the ventro-dorsal segmentation is unrealistic.
