MicroRNA-874 (miR-874), a novel cancer-associated microRNA (miRNA), has been reported to play a suppressive role in multiple malignancies. However, its function in cell migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Here, we found miR-874 to be significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, this decreased expression strongly correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. Accordingly, ectopic expression of miR-874 in HCC cells markedly inhibited their migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Concerning the underlying mechanism, SRY (sex-determining region Y) -box 12 (SOX12) was identified as a direct target of miR-874, and its expression was found to be inversely correlated with that of this miRNA in HCC cells. Importantly, SOX12 knockdown had an inhibitory effect on HCC cells similar to that caused by miR-874 overexpression, whereas SOX12 overexpression in these cells negated the suppressive effects of miR-874 on migration, invasion, and EMT. Overall, these findings demonstrate that miR-874 inhibits metastasis and EMT in HCC by targeting SOX12, suggesting that this miRNA may constitute a promising therapeutic target for this disease.
