Diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) images show significant contrast for cancer tissues against non-cancerous tissues. Fusion of a DWIBS and a T2-weighted image (DWIBS/T2) can be used to obtain functional, as well as anatomic, information. In the present study, the performance of DWIBS/T2 in the diagnosis of abdominal solid cancer was evaluated. The records of 14 patients were retrospectively analyzed [5 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 4 with metastatic liver cancer, 3 with pancreatic cancer, 1 with renal cellular carcinoma and 1 with malignant lymphoma of the para-aortic lymph node]. T1WI and T2WI scans did not detect pancreatic cancer in certain cases, whereas DWIs and DWIBS/T2 clearly demonstrated pancreatic cancer in all cases. In addition, metastatic liver cancer and HCC were successfully detected with abdominal US and CECT; however, US did not detect pancreatic cancer in 1 case, while CECT and DWIBS/T2 detected pancreatic cancer in all cases. In conclusion, the diagnostic performance of DWIBS/T2 was the same as that of abdominal US and CECT in detecting primary and metastatic liver cancer. DWIBS/T2 enabled the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in cases where it was not detected with US, T1WI or T2WI.
