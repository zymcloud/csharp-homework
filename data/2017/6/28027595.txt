Obesity is a critical risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it remains unknown whether inhibition of de novo lipid biosynthesis can suppress HCC. In this study, we blocked the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, one of the key determinants of lipid homeostasis, by ablating 78-kDa cell-surface glycoprotein or SREBP cleavage-activating protein in hepatocytes, as well as by administering a chemical compound called betulin. We found that either genetically or pharmacologically inhibiting the SREBP pathway dramatically reduced diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC progression by down-regulating tumor-promoting cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-1Î².Conclusion:Inhibition of de novo lipid biosynthesis by suppressing the SREBP pathway prevents HCC. This study identifies a previously underappreciated role of the SREBP pathway in HCC and suggests a novel metabolic strategy to control liver cancer. (Hepatology 2017;65:1936-1947).
