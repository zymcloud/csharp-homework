Background:Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) has a crucial role in treatment of proximal biliary cancer (PBC). We assessed the incidence, risk factors, and impact of acute pancreatitis (AP) post-PTBD.Methods:Forty patients with PBC scheduled for PTBD from January 2005 to December 2015 were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were missing clinical data, PTBD performed in other institutions, and palliative PTBD.Result:The 40 patients comprised 8 (20%) with gallbladder cancer, 6 (15%) with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 26 (65%) with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. A median of 1 PTBD procedure was performed per patient; 16 (40%) patients underwent PTBD more than once. PTBD was left-sided in 14 (35.0%) patients, right-sided in 21 (52.5%), and bilobar in 5(12.5%). Seventeen (42.5%) patients had one or more drainage-related complications. Five (12.5%) patients developed AP. A significantly higher percentage of patients with than without AP developed sepsis (60.0 vs. 11.4%, respectively) and did not undergo the planned liver resection [2 (40.0%) vs. 0 (0.0%), respectively]. Significantly more patients with than without AP underwent left-sided PTBD [10 (28.6%) vs. 4 (80.0%), respectively].Conclusion:PTBD is frequently complicated by AP. AP plays a key role in the development of sepsis. Nearly half of patients with AP lose the opportunity for surgical treatment.
