Objective:Studies on the effects of propofol on the growth of hepatoma xenografts in Balb/c mice.Methods:In an effort to establish a hepatoma-xenograft model of BALB/C mice, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells SMMC-7721 were inoculated subcutaneously into BALB/C mice. Forty mice were randomly divided into five different groups (n=8): control group (C group), Intralipid group (Y group), low dose (50mg/kg) propofol group (P1 group), medium dose (100mg/kg) propofol group (P2 group) and high dose (150mg/kg) propofol group (P3 group). The tumor volume was measured before treatment and every 3days after treatment (T0d-T18d, T0 represents time point before treatment, T3d-T18d represent time points every 3days after treatment for a total of 18 days). All mice were sacrificed 19days after drug withdrawal. The tumor masses were extracted, weighed, and the tumor inhibition rate of propofol was calculated. The protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the xenografted tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining.Results:No statistical significance in the tumor volume at T0d (before treatment), T3d (3days after treatment), and T6d (6days after treatment) among the five groups (P>0.05) could be determined. Compared to group C, the tumor volumes in the P1, P2, and P3 groups were found to be significantly decreased in size upon increasing the propofol dosages (P<0.05). There was no statistical significance at time points T9d-T18d in group Y compared to group C (P>0.05). The tumor weights in the P1, P2, and P3 groups were found to be significantly lower as the propofol dosages increased (P<0.05), with no statistical significance determined in group Y (P>0.05). MMP-2 and VEGF protein levels were found to be significantly lower in the P1, P2, and P3 groups as the propofol dosages increased (P<0.05), with no statistical significance in group Y (P>0.05).Conclusion:Within a certain range, propofol was found to inhibit tumor growth and expression of MMP-2 and VEGF proteins in hepatoma xenografts in BALB/C mice in a dose-dependent manner.
