Background/aims:Previous studies have observed disturbances in the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) blood spectral profiles in malignancy. No study has metabotyped serum or plasma of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients from two diverse populations. We aimed to delineate the HCC patient metabotype from Nigeria (mostly hepatitis B virus infected) and Egypt (mostly hepatitis C virus infected) to explore lipid and energy metabolite alterations that may be independent of disease aetiology, diet and environment.Methods:Patients with HCC (53) and cirrhosis (26) and healthy volunteers (19) were recruited from Nigeria and Egypt. Participants provided serum or plasma samples, which were analysed using 600 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy with nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy pulse sequences. Median group spectra comparison and multivariate analysis were performed to identify regions of difference.Results:Significant differences between HCC patients and healthy volunteers were detected in levels of low density lipoprotein (P = 0.002), very low density lipoprotein (P < 0.001) and lactate (P = 0.03). N-acetylglycoproteins levels in HCC patients were significantly different from both healthy controls and cirrhosis patients (P < 0.001 and 0.001).Conclusion:Metabotype differences were present, pointing to disturbed lipid metabolism and a switch from glycolysis to alternative energy metabolites with malignancy, which supports the Warburg hypothesis of tumour metabolism.
