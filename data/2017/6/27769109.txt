During Hepatitis B virus infection, the pathogen sensors Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a role in innate immunity system. The study aimed to investigate mRNA expression levels of TLR2 and TLR3 in Hepatitis B virus (HBV) mediated chronic hepatitis B (CHB), cirrhosis (CIRR), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to correlate viral load with severity of these diseases and expression of TLRs. A total of 180 HBV DNA positive samples were selected for the study. HVB-DNA was detected by multiplex PCR. Viral load estimation was done by using the Ampisure HBV Quantitative kit as per manufacture instructions. Expression levels of TLR2 and TLR3 were determined by real time PCR. The viral load was estimated to be 6.64log10 IU/ml in CHB, 4.88log10 IU/ml in CIRR, and 4.86log10 IU/ml in HCC. No significant association of viral load was found with increasing age. Upregulation of TLR2 expression in CHB when individually compared with CIRR and HCC was found to be statistically significant. Downregulation of TLR3 expressions in CIRR when compared to both CHB and HCC individually were found to be statistically significant. No significant effect of viral load on the expression of TLR2 and 3 were found. With severity of the disease from CHB to HCC, the HBV load decreases. The study suggests the possibility of HBV interacting with signalling of both analysed TLR receptors which partially explains the induction of immune tolerance pathways by Hepatitis B virus. J. Med.
