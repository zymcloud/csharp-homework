The Platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) has been reported to predict prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study examined the prognostic potential of stratified PLR for HCC patients undergoing curative liver resection. Medical records were retrospectively analyzed for 778 HCC patients undergoing curative liver resection at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University and the First People's Hospital of Changde between April 2010 and October 2013. Patients were stratified based on quintile analysis of their preoperative PLR, and patients in different quintiles were analyzed for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Independent predictors of death or recurrence were explored using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression. Higher PLR quintiles were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (p
