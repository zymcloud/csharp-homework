Chronic liver disease is a growing problem that has substantial effects on public health. Many paediatric liver conditions are precursors of adult chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical management of Wilson's disease, autoimmune liver disease, and chronic biliary disorders, such as biliary atresia, which remains the most common paediatric chronic liver disease and indication for liver transplantation, is similar in children and adults. In the past 10 or so years, paediatric hepatology has expanded into neighbouring clinical areas, such as metabolic liver diseases and systemic conditions with liver involvement. We aim to describe some of these disorders, and outline their natural history and possible differences between management in adults and children to stimulate further debate on the optimal transition of care between paediatric and adult specialists.
