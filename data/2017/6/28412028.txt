Introduction:The search for mutations epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has changed the therapeutic approach and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has been demonstrated orally in patients with EGFR mutation. We report the case of a patient for whom treatment with TKI was started effectively in a Critical Care Unit.Observation:A patient of 59 years is followed for a stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with metastases in liver, brain, adrenal, lung and pleura. After a first course of chemotherapy (cisplatin-gemcitabine), the patient presents a multi-factorial acute respiratory distress. Due to an EGFR mutation, transfer to intensive care is decided then orotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. It is decided to initiate treatment with erlotinib via nasogastric tube. The evolution will be marked by a tumor response leading to a favorable issue.Conclusions:This case shows the value of initiate TKI despite hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit and highlights the question of the transfer in ICU patients with EGFR mutation.
