This is a case report of a patient of lymphoma with liver metastasis who had persistent pain and jaundice despite multiple lines of chemotherapy. She underwent palliative liver irradiation. This is an uncommon modality due to fear of radiation induced hepatitis. We reviewed literature available on the use of liver irradiation for palliation and concluded that it can be safely used with good results. A 33-year-old female with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) presented with obstructive jaundice. She underwent stenting followed by chemotherapy. She was lost to follow up to later present with a progressively increasing right hypochondrial mass, pain and icterus. Ultrasound abdomen revealed massive hepatomegaly with hypodense lesions in both liver lobes and centring the porta with dilatation of biliary radicals. Despite multiple lines of chemotherapy and use of opioids, there was no symptomatic relief in pain, size of mass or any decrease in biochemical parameters. Then she was offered palliative radiation in the form of partial liver irradiation to a dose of 21Gy/7 fractions. She had >50% pain relief after 2 fractions and was off opioids by last fraction. Liver span reduced from 6cm to 1cm below costal margin in mid clavicular line. Radiologically 60% reduction in size of liver lesions was observed. Also, a decreasing trend in biochemical parameters was observed. Use of whole or partial liver irradiation is rare in clinical practice due to fear of radiation induced hepatitis by conventional techniques. Newer techniques of delivering radiation can highly improvise accuracy and permit further dose escalation.
