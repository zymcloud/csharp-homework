Nucleostemin (NS)/GNL3 protein has been recently documented to be a nucleolar protein that was abundantly expressed in stem cells and cancer cells. Herein, we showed that NS was upregulated in HCC tissues and the expression of NS was inversely correlated with that of p53. Overexpression of NS predicted significantly worsened prognosis in HCC patients, suggesting that NS might serve as a prognostic marker of HCC. In addition, we found that depletion of NS sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we found that the mechanism underlying NS-mediated sorafenib resistance involved dysregulated expression of p53, and downstream Bax and Bcl-2 proteins. NS interacted with p53 in HCC cells. Depletion of NS increased the expression of p53 and Bax, whereas impaired the level of cellular Bcl-2. Interference of NS enhanced the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in HCC cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of NS impaired the apoptosis of HCC cells following sorafenib exposure. Therefore, NS may contribute to sorafenib resistance in HCC cells through the modulation of p53 pathway and Bcl-2 proteins. These findings indicated that the combination of silencing NS expression and sorafenib treatment is a promising therapeutic strategy in treatment of HCC.
