Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be difficult to distinguish from its mimics, including metastatic tumor, benign hepatocellular lesion, and high-grade dysplastic nodule, especially when limited biopsy material is available. Hence, the judicious use of immunohistochemical stains is necessary to establish a correct diagnosis. This article describes advantages and disadvantages of immunohistochemical markers that are most commonly used to distinguish between these lesions. Diagnostic workup of malignant liver mass (HCC and its histologic variants vs metastatic tumor) as well as well-differentiated hepatocellular lesion (well-differentiated HCC vs focal nodular hyperplasia vs hepatocellular adenoma) is also discussed.
