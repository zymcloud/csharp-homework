WEE1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that inactivates cell division cycle 2 and is therefore a critical cell cycle regulator. Increased WEE1 expression has been observed in numerous types of human malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma. WEE1 inhibition also results in evident anti-tumor effects in several human tumor cells including colon cancer cells, suggesting WEE1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. However, the expression pattern of WEE1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In the present study, WEE1 mRNA expression in 43 cases of CRC tissues matched with adjacent normal tissues was determined by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that WEE1 mRNA expression was significantly increased in CRC tissues and that this upregulation correlated significantly with hepatic metastasis, distant metastasis and high tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage of CRC. Additionally, WEE1 protein in 102 CRC tissue samples was detected by immunohistochemistry, and positive staining of WEE1 was identified in more than half of patients with CRC. WEE1 staining scores were also observed to be associated with distant metastasis and high TNM stage of CRC. In addition, patients with CRC with high WEE1 staining score (2+ or 3+) exhibited either poorer overall survival or poorer disease-free survival compared with those with low WEE1 staining score (0 or 1+). The multivariable Cox model also identified a high WEE1 staining score as well as high TNM stage to be independent prognostic factors for CRC. In conclusion, WEE1 upregulation is associated with a high degree of malignancy and poor prognosis of CRC, suggesting WEE1 as a potential prognostic biomarker for CRC.
