Purpose:The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in treating patients with liver metastases from pancreatic cancer, and explore the prognostic risk factors.Results:Three of the 27 patients were totally recovered, and 12 were partially alleviated. The total efficacy rate was 55.6% (15/27). The median survival time was 13.6 months, and the 0.5-, 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 70.4% (19/27), 48.1% (13/27), 22.2% (6/27), 14.8 (4/27), 11.1% (3/27), respectively. None of the groups showed any severe complications. Univariate analysis showed that pathological type, concomitant therapies for liver metastasis, vascular supply, CA199 levels and extrahepatic metastasis were related to prognosis (P Methods:The clinical records of 27 patients with lliver metastases from pancreatic cancer diagnosed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University between May 2009 and May 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The short-term and long-term efficacy and toxic side effects of TACE were observed. The prognostic risk factors were analyzed using Cox (proportional hazards) regression model.Conclusion:TACE is an effective therapy for treating liver metastases from pancreatic malignancy. Pathological type and extrahepatic metastasis of pancreatic tumor are independent risk factors for patients' prognosis. The prognosis of patients with liver metastasis from pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm is superior to that of extrahepatic metastasis.
