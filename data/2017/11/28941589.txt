Purpose:To test the hypothesis that prophylactic administration of dexamethasone alleviates postembolization syndrome (PES) after transarterial chemoembolization for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a single center from August 2015 to June 2016. A total of 88 patients with intermediate-stage HCC were enrolled. After randomization, 44 patients were assigned to the dexamethasone group and the other 44 to the control group. In the dexamethasone group, 12 mg of intravenous dexamethasone was administered before chemoembolization. Nausea, vomiting, fever, pain, and alanine aminotransferase level elevation were evaluated after chemoembolization had been performed with the use of Lipiodol and doxorubicin.Results:The incidences of PES were 78.0% in the dexamethasone group and 97.5% in the control group (P = .008). Mean hospitalization times after chemoembolization were 2.7 days ± 1.44 in the dexamethasone group and 2.9 days ± 1.83 in the control group (P = .553). Mean doses of antiemetic and analgesic agents were lower in the dexamethasone group than the control group (0.2 ± 0.58 vs 1.0 ± 1.89 [P = .029] and 0.6 ± 0.97 vs 1.92 ± 2.54 [P = .006], respectively). Prophylactic administration of dexamethasone was a significant factor that influences PES occurrence after chemoembolization (odds ratio = 10.969, P = .027).Conclusions:This study demonstrates that the prophylactic administration of dexamethasone before chemoembolization is an effective way to reduce PES.
