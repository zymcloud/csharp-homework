Background:Preoperative serum inflammatory markers have been correlated with outcome after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but studies have had conflicting results. This study aimed to evaluate the association of six inflammatory markers with recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and microvascular invasion (MVI), a well-known prognostic factor.Methods:This study investigated 370 patients who underwent resection of HCC from 1992 to 2016, retrospectively evaluating their inflammatory indices and individual components including their neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and aspartate aminotransferase-to-neutrophil ratio index (ANRI). Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate these markers for RFS, OS, and MVI.Results:The median RFS was 23 months, and the median OS was 60 months. Factors independently associated with worse RFS were higher PLR and alpha-fetoprotein level, male gender, and the presence of MVI as well as multiple nodules. Factors independently associated with worse OS were higher PLR and international normalized ratio, male gender, older age, presence of MVI and multiple nodules, larger tumor, presence of cirrhosis, and absence of steatosis. The study identified MVI in 47% of the patients. Lower level of albumin, higher level of alpha-fetoprotein, and larger tumor on preoperative imaging were independently associated with MVI.Conclusions:This largest Western series to evaluate the utility of preoperative inflammatory markers in patients with HCC found that only PLR was associated with RFS and OS and that albumin was associated with MVI.
