The efficacy of repeated lusutrombopag administration for thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease who undergo two or more planned invasive procedures is unknown. We herein report our findings regarding the effects of repeated lusutrombopag administration given to avoid platelet transfusion in a patient with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia. The platelet count showed a positive response to lusutrombopag treatment prior to the initial invasive procedure to treat a hepatoma, so platelet transfusion was not necessary. In conclusion, lusutrombopag may be a useful drug for patients with thrombocytopenia to avoid platelet transfusion in those undergoing two or more planned invasive procedures.
