Purpose:In clinical practice, most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma require subsequent treatments for remaining, progressing, or recurring tumors. We investigated all-treatment array and outcomes in an HCC cohort from initial diagnosis to death.Methods:We enrolled 1687 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent initial diagnosis and treatment at the National Cancer Center, Korea, from January 2004 to December 2009.Results:In total, 1357 patients (80.4%) showed RPRTs during median 20.4-month follow-up. Initial transplantation resulted in the least rate (32.3%) of RPRTs. Median treatment frequency was 3.0 times (range 1-20) and 382 patients (27.3%) received treatments â‰¥6 times. The median treatment frequency was different based on four factors (p Conclusions:Our findings suggest that the survival outcome of patients with HCC is based on the results of cumulative multiple treatments rather than an initial treatment. It is time to consider prospective studies evaluating sequential treatment array of HCC.
