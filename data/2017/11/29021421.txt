Major portal vein invasion (MVI) by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carries an extremely poor prognosis. Our aim was to clarify the indications of hepatic resection in the presence of MVI by HCC. Between 2001 and 2015, 1,306 patients undergoing primary treatment for HCC were analyzed (866 hepatic resections and 440 transarterial therapies). Significant prognostic factors were identified by retrospectively analyzing tumor status, liver function and treatment. Overall survival was compared in terms of the degree of vascular invasion and treatment. The 5-year survival rates according to the degree of vascular invasion (Vp) were Vp0: 51.9%, Vp1: 33.0%, Vp2: 16.7%, Vp3: 21.8%, and Vp4: 0%, respectively. Overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between patients with Vp3 and Vp4 MVI (p = 0.153). Median survival following hepatic resection of Vp3 cases was significantly better than that for Vp4 cases (1,913 vs. 258 days, p = 0.014), while OS following transarterial therapy was not significantly different (164 vs. 254 days in Vp3 vs. Vp4, p = 0.137). Multivariate analysis revealed hepatic resection (Odds: 2.335 [95%CI: 1.236-4.718], p = 0.008) and multiple tumors (1.698 [1.029-2.826], p = 0.038) as independent predictors of survival. Hepatic resection in HCC patients with MVI should be indicate in patients with Vp3 invasion.
