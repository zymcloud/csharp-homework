Cirrhosis is the terminal stage of hepatic diseases and is prone to develop into hepatocyte carcinoma. Increasing evidence suggests that the transplantation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) may promote recovery from cirrhosis, but the key regulatory mechanisms involved remain to be determined. In this study, we overexpressed human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) in primary rat DPSCs and evaluated the effects of HGF overexpression on the biological behaviors and therapeutic efficacy of grafted DPSCs in cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis was induced via the intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 twice weekly for 12 weeks and was verified through histopathological and serological assays. HGF was overexpressed in DPSCs via transduction with a hHGF-lentiviral vector and confirmed based on the elevated expression and secretion of HGF. The HGF-overexpressing DPSCs were transplanted into rats intravenously. The HGF-overexpressing DPSCs showed increased survival and hepatogenic differentiation in host liver tissue at 6 weeks after grafting. They also exhibited a significantly greater repair potential in relation to cirrhosis pathology and impaired liver function than did DPSCs expressing HGF at physiological levels. Our study may provide an experimental basis for the development of novel methods for the treatment of liver cirrhosis in clinical practice.
