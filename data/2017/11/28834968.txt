Purpose The locoregional interventional oncological treatment approach is an accepted modality for liver neoplasms, especially for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and oligonodular liver metastases. Materials and Methods The main aim of ablation therapies like microwave ablation (MWA) is to eradicate all malignant cells in a minimally invasive technique under imaging guidance while preserving the healthy tissue with a sufficient safety margin (at least 5 mm) surrounding the ablated lesion. Results Ablation therapy can be performed via a percutaneous, laparoscopic or intraoperative approach under ultrasound, MRI or CT guidance for adequate localization and monitoring of the ablation process. Conclusion Ablation is the method of choice for oligonodular HCCs ≤ 3 cm. The technical success rate varies from 88 % to 98 % and progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years from 27 % to 91.7 %. The same criteria apply to the therapy of liver metastases. Key Points · Careful selection of patients proves to be essential for optimum results of MWA. · Interventionists should be familiar with all aspects of complication and rapid assessment of imaging methods in order to evaluate induced damage by thermal ablation. · MWA seems to have some advantages over radiofrequency ablation, like shorter ablation time, less pain, less heat sink effect; however, scientific proof is needed.
