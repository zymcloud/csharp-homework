Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder is a rare entity that comprises approximately 1%-3% of all primary gallbladder cancers. We report the case of a 37-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a locally invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder. Surgical pathology revealed a predominantly squamous cell carcinoma composition of the tumor with a few microscopic foci of adenocarcinoma (<1% of tumor). We discuss pertinent clinical features, risk factors, and imaging characteristics to prompt early diagnosis and treatment, which will ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.
