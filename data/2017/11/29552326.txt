FOXC1 is a vital member of FOX families which play important roles in biological processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, metabolism, and longevity. Here we are focusing on roles of FOXC1 and their mechanisms in cancers. FOXC1 promoted progress of many cancers, such as breast cancer (especially basal-like breast cancer), hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer and so on. FOXC1 was also found to be associated with drug resistance of cancers. FOXC1 promoted metastasis of cancers by increasing expression of MMP7, NEDD9 and Snail. Proliferation and invasion of cancers were increased by FOXC1 by mediating NF-ÎºB, MST1R and KLF4 expression. FOXC1 was associated with development by regulating expression of FGF19 and MSX1. Recently, FOXC1 was found to be required for niche of stem cells or development of stem cells by mediating expression of Gli2, CXCL12, SCF, NFATC1, BMP and Myh7. Overall, FOXC1 exerts its functions by many mechanisms and may be used as a potential biomarker for diseases.
