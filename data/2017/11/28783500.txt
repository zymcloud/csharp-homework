Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a confirmed risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) possesses tumor suppression function that is frequently defective in HCC tumors. PTEN-Long, a translation isoform of PTEN, functions in a cell non-autonomous manner. In this study, we demonstrated that intracellular overexpression of PTEN-Long inhibits HCV replication. More importantly, we showed that treatment with extracellular PTEN-Long protein inhibits HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that PTEN-Long interacts with HCV core protein and this interaction is required for HCV replication inhibition by PTEN-Long. In summary, we demonstrated, for the first time, that PTEN-Long protein, an isoform of the canonical PTEN and in the form of extracellular protein treatment, inhibits HCV replication. Our study offers an opportunity for developing additional anti-HCV agents.
