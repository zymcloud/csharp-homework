A 69-year-old man presented with left upper abdominal pain and weight loss. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a 9 cmsized extragastric tumor located between the left lateral liver section and the gastric lesser curvature. Gastroendoscopy showed a type 3 tumor located at the lesser curvature of the antrum. Biopsy confirmed that the tumor was an adenocarcinoma. With a diagnosis of extragastric-developing gastric cancer with hepatic and pancreatic invasion, the patient underwent a totalgastrectomy, D2 lymph node dissection, partiall iver resection, and pancreatic body tailexcision. The pathologicaldiagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma suggesting squamous differentiation. Despite receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient died of recurrence 7 months later.
