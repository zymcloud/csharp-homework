Among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, liver disease remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. While the etiologies are varied and often overlapping in the individual patient, the underlying mechanisms, including oxidative stress, direct activation of stellate cells, HIV interaction with hepatocytes, and bacterial translocation with systemic immune activation, seem to be unifying characteristics. Early and fully suppressive HIV antiretroviral therapy is a mainstay of management either before or concurrent with treatment of etiologic cofactors, including hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Significant barriers to care that still exist include liver disease recognition, appropriate linkage to care, ongoing substance abuse, and psychiatric comorbidities in the HIV-infected population. Emerging issues in these patients include acute and chronic hepatitis E, underreported hepatitis D, and a rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. (Hepatology Communications 2017;1:987-1001).
