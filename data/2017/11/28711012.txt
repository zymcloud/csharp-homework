Recently osteopontin (OPN), a protein of the extracellular matrix, has generated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) a significant interest as a prognostic factor. Aim of this study was to confirm, in liver tissues of subjects with HCV-positive HCC undergoing liver transplantation (RL, n=10) and of donors (DL, n=14), the increase of OPN plasma and tissue concentration, the OPN splicing isoforms expression profiling together with those of thrombin, and to evaluate a possible association between OPN measurements. Their association with Notch-1, IV-Collagen-7s domain, IL-6 and TNF-Î± were also evaluated. Real-Time PCR experiments and immunometric assay were performed. mRNA expression resulted higher in RL than in DL for all analyzed genes and several correlations were found between them. The more relevant association were between OPN-a and OPN-b (p
