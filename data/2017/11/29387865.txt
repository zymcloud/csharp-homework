Epidemiological studies have suggested the link between cumulative diabetic exposure and cancer. Interaction of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) with their receptor (RAGE) may contribute to the phenomenon. We examined here the effects of DNA aptamer raised against RAGE (RAGE-aptamer) on growth and liver metastasis of G361 melanoma in nude mice. Malignant melanoma cells were intradermally injected into the upper flank region of nude mice, which received continuous administration of RAGE-aptamer (38.4 pmol/day/g body weight) or vehicle intraperitoneally by an osmotic pump up to 42 days. RAGE-aptamer significantly reduced levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxy-guanosine, AGEs, RAGE, proliferating nuclear antigen, cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and CD31 and Mac-3, respective markers of endothelial cells and macrophages in tumors of nude mice and suppressed the proliferation and liver metastasis of malignant melanoma. Furthermore, RAGE-aptamer attenuated the AGE-induced oxidative stress generation, proliferation, and VEGF and MCP-1 gene expression in both G361 melanoma cells and endothelial cells. The present findings suggest that RAGE-aptamer could attenuate melanoma growth and liver metastasis in nude mice by suppressing the tumor angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration via inhibition of the AGE-RAGE system. RAGE-aptamer may be a novel therapeutic tool for the treatment of malignant melanoma.
