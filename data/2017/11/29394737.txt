The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of surgical site infection(SSI)after hepatectomy in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). From June 2010 through December 2016, 276 cases of hepatectomy for HCC were performed in our hospital, and 39 cases included patients aged>80 years. The rate of SSI in the elderly group compared to the non-elderly group was 15.38%(6/39 cases)vs 7.73%(p=0.0855). The Child-Pugh classification(A/B/C)in the SSI group (n=6)vs in the non-SSI group(n=33)was 6/0/0 vs 32/1/0(p=0.5605), the liver damage classification(A/B/C)was 4/ 2/0 vs 25/8/0(p=0.6467), BMI was 23.3 kg/m / 2 vs 22.8 kg/m2(p=0.6544), PNI was 43.1 vs 46.2(p=0.3804), the operation time was 348.5 minutes vs 315.1 minutes(p=0.4478), blood loss was a small amount vs 401.5mL(p=0.0143), and the hospital stay after the operation was 27.5 days vs 10.0 days(p=0.0401), respectively. Hepatectomy for elderly patients was safe and feasible, and the only significant risk factor for SSI in elderly HCC patients was intraoperative blood loss.
