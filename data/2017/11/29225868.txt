Small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is a high-grade carcinoma rarely encountered in extra-pulmonary sites. A 40-year-old lady presented with epigastric pain and was noted to have an ulcerated small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in her duodenum with liver metastases. She underwent palliative chemotherapy but unfortunately passed away. Duodenal SCNC is an unusual malignancy with an aggressive phenotype.
