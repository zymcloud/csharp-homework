We report a case of combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma with hemobilia. A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of pain in the right hypochondralrigion. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed bile duct dilatation in the lateral segment of liver and blood test findings showed elevation of the hepatobiliary enzyme, so ERC was performed and hemorrhage from the duodenal papilla was observed. In cholangiography, dilation of the left hepatic bile duct and filling defect were observed, and in the peroral cholangioscopy, a hemorrhagic papillary elevated lesion was identified in the left hepatic bile duct and diagnosed as adenocarcinoma as a result of biopsy. Left hepatectomy with caudate lobe, extrahepatic bile duct resection, lymph node dissection was performed by diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In the resected specimen, tumor size was 16 mm, which was found in the left hepatic duct and invasived into the liver parenchyma. Histopathological examination revealed a combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma. Gemcitabin was administered as adjuvant chemotherapy for 8 months, but 1 year and 8 months after the operation, it recurred in the liver. Gemcitabin was administered, but it became PD, now it has changed to S-1 and it is SD for 2 years.
