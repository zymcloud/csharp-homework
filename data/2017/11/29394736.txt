A 66-year-old man presented with recurrences in the peritoneum 3 years after heavy particle beam therapy with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)and underwent laparoscopic surgery.Five months after surgery, a new peritoneal dissemination found in the vicinity of the colon hepatic flexure area by CT examination, and laparoscopic resection was planned again.Indocyanine green(ICG)0.5 mg/kg was administered on the day before surgery.ICG imaging by the PINPOINT®system revealed 2 small ICG accumulation sites in the diaphragm, as well as the main lesion, and each lesion was excised laparoscopically.All lesions were diagnosed as peritoneal dissemination of HCC, and the postoperative course was uneventful.Although new dissemination nodules were appeared 6 months after surgery, he underwent laparoscopic surgery again and survives.In PINPOINT fluorescence mode, high-definition white-light image and fluorescence image was combined, and it was easy to determine the cut line but also to visualize the small lesion difficult to identify in the visible light mode.It was suggested that the PINPOINT®system might be useful in cases of HCC peritoneal dissemination.
