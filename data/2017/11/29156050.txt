Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) exhibits a variety of clinical outcomes, ranging from spontaneous resolution of hepatitis B to severe adverse consequences, including the development of cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The heterogeneous clinical courses of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection reflect the complex host-virus interactions, and point to the difficulty and necessity of identifying the patients at risk. With the advance of HBV virology, several viral factors have been found to be associated with the long-term clinical outcomes of CHB patients. Different viral factors probe different aspects of CHB. Integration of these viral factors may help to determine the disease state of patients more accurately, and identify the patients who require timely antiviral therapy to prevent the development of detrimental clinical outcomes. In this article, we will introduce the conventional and emerging viral factors that are associated with clinical outcomes and discuss their utility in a clinical setting.
