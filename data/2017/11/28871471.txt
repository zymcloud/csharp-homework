Background and aim:The basis of host response in hepatitis E virus (HEV)-related liver disease during pregnancy-is still unclear. The study aims to evaluate anthropometric parameters and biochemical nutritional parameters in hepatitis E infection during pregnancy and correlate it with severity of the disease.Methods:A total of consecutive 267 pregnant women with jaundice were recruited. The jaundiced patients were classified as acute viral hepatitis (AVH) or acute liver failure (ALF). The study group included 144 pregnant women with HEV infection and 144 healthy asymptomatic age and gestational age-matched pregnant women as controls. Nutritional factors were evaluated on basis of anthropometric parameters and biochemical factors. Serum prealbumin and folate were assayed by ELISA kit.Results:All nutritional parameters were significantly lower in pregnant women with HEV infection as compared with healthy pregnant controls. Some of the nutritional parameters significantly lower in ALF pregnant patients compared to AVH pregnant patients in HEV group. Linear regression analysis of the AVH group showed that serum total protein and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were significant predictors for bilirubin, body mass index (BMI) could significantly predict viral load level, and total protein, prealbumin, folate, and tricep skin fold thickness (TSFT) could significantly predict prothrombin time. In ALF group, serum prealbumin could significantly predict bilirubin levels and MUAC could significantly predict prothrombin time.Conclusion:Malnutrition might confer a higher predisposition for HEV infection during pregnancy and is associated with increased severity of disease in terms of occurrence of ALF.
