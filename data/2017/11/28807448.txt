The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of 2-D shear wave elastography (2-D-SWE) in evaluations of liver stiffness in patients with liver tumors before resection. A total of 121 consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 93), intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 6), mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 6), liver metastases (n = 10) and benign tumors (n = 6) were prospectively enrolled in this study from June 2015 to March 2016. Three valid 2-D-SWE measurements for each patient and median liver stiffness values were calculated. Fibrosis staging was evaluated according to the METAVIR scoring system. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess diagnostic performance. In this study, we found that median liver stiffness values were significantly higher in patients with primary liver tumors than in those with liver metastases and benign tumors (11.80 kPa vs. 5.85 kPa, p NCT02958592).
