Purpose:Patient, surgical, and tumor factors affect the outcome after surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The surgical factors are only modifiable by the surgeon. We reviewed our experience with curative resection for HCC in terms of surgical factors.Methods:After analyses of the prospectively collected clinical data of 256 consecutive patients undergoing surgical resection for HCC, prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were identified; all patients were stratified by tumor diameters > or Results:Multivariate analyses showed that microvascular invasion, estimated blood loss, blood transfusion, and the number of tumors were independent adverse prognostic factors for DFS, whereas microvascular invasion, serum alpha fetoprotein, and tumor diameter were independent adverse prognostic factors for OS. Blood transfusion had borderline significance (P = 0.076). After stratification by tumor diameter, blood transfusion was only associated with poor DFS and OS in patients with tumor diameters > 5 cm.Conclusion:Tumor recurrence after liver resection for HCC depends on tumor status, bleeding, and transfusions, which subsequently lead to poor patient survival. Surgeons can help improve the prognosis of patients by minimizing blood loss and transfusion, particularly in patients with larger tumors.
