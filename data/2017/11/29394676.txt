Case 1: A7 2-year-old man, during diabetes medical treatment, was introduced at our hospital for liver cancer treatment. He had a subcutaneous mass 4 cm in size in the right precordial region, and subsequently underwent an operation. Histopathological findings indicated subcutaneous metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Case 2: A6 0-year-old man presented with a subcutaneous mass noted in the right shoulder during hepatocellular carcinoma treatment. It was diagnosed as metastasis of the hepatocellular carcinoma to the dermis. Metastasis to the skin of internal organ-related tumors is relatively rare and is reported with approximately a 1.4-6.7%frequency of all dissection cases. Hepatocellular carcinoma is infrequent and it is reported that hypodermal and skin metastasis is 0.3-0.7% in autopsy cases. In addition, metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma to the skin is a relatively terminal symptom.
