Objective: To detect the expression of B cell transposition gene 3(BTG3) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC), and explore its relationship with postoperative recurrence and metastasis of tumor. Methods: Six self-paired frozen PDAC specimens and 3 normal pancreatic tissues from the Second Hospital of Jiaxing Affiliated to Jiaxing University were collected and the expression of BTG3 was detected by qPCR. Ten normal pancreatic tissues and 52 cases of PDAC tumor and paracarcinomatous tissues from the Second Hospital of Jiaxing Affiliated to Jiaxing University were collected from June 2009 to December 2016. The expression of BTG3 and relationship among BTG3 and clinicopathological characteristics of PDAC and patients' prognosis were detected and analyzed using immunohistochemistry.χ(2) test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to analyzed the data. Results: The results of qPCR showed that expression level of BTG3 in PDAC (0.63±0.17) was lower significantly than that in paracarcinomatous (0.96±0.04) and normal tissues (1.00)(t=4.673, 5.502; both P<0.05). Immunohistochemistrv showed that BTG3 mainly expressed in the cytoplasm.The high expression rate of BTG3 in PDAC tumor tissues was 25.0%(13/52), which was remarkably lower than that in paracarcinomatous tissues(65.4%) and normal liver tissues(7/10)(χ(2)=17.120 and 5.849, both P<0.05). The low expression of BTG3 in PDAC was correlated with primary tumor, and TNM stage(χ(2)=7.704, P=0.006; U=154.000, P=0.018, respectively). Survival analysis showed that disease free survival rate of patients with low expression of BTG3 was significantly less than that with high expression(χ(2)=192.493, P<0.01). The Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that low expression of BTG3 was independent risk factors for disease free survival in patients with PDAC after a curative resection(RR=3.366, 95%CI: 1.040-10.889, P=0.043). Conclusion: BTG3 may be involved in the occurence and development of tumor, and its low expression may be associated with poor prognosis in patients with PDAC.
