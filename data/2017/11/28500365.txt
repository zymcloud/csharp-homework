Objective:To determine the added value of capsule, septum, and T2 hyperintense foci for differentiating large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; ≥ 5 cm) from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) using gadoxetic acid MRI.Methods:The study included 116 patients (94 men, 22 women; mean age, 56.8 years) with surgically confirmed HCCs (n = 87, 5.0-18.0 cm) or ICCs (n = 29, 5.0-14.0 cm) who underwent gadoxetic acid MRI. Three observers independently reviewed MRIs in two sessions, examining enhancement patterns only and then adding capsule, septum, and T2 hyperintense foci. Reviewers used a five-point scale to score accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.Results:A significant increase was observed in accuracy when ancillary features (96.1-98.3%) were added compared to enhancement pattern only (83.6-88.4%; p ≤ 0.02). Sensitivity was significantly increased with combined reading (97.1-98.3%) compared to enhancement features only (81.6-88.5%; p ≤ 0.006) for two observers, with no difference in specificity (84.5-89.7% vs. 86.2-98.3%; p > 0.05). We found substantial to excellent interobserver agreement for ancillary features (0.598-0.976).Conclusion:Adding capsule, septum, and T2 hyperintense foci to enhancement patterns for gadoxetic acid MRI increased diagnostic performance for characterizing large HCC by differentiating it from ICC.Key points:• Capsule, septum, and T2 hyperintense foci were useful for characterizing large HCC. • Adding ancillary features to enhancement pattern increased accuracy for diagnosing large HCC. • Interobserver agreement was substantial to excellent for ancillary features.
