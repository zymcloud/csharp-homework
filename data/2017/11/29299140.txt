Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumor invasion, metastasis, and recurrence. We previously showed that the pluripotency factor Nanog not only serves as a novel biomarker of CSCs but also potentially plays a crucial role in maintaining the self-renewal ability of liver CSCs. However, how CSCs maintain Nanog gene expression has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that microRNA-449a (miR-449a) is overexpressed in poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, drug-resistant liver cancer cells, cultured liver tumorspheres, and Nanog-positive liver cancer cells. The upregulation of miR-449a in non-CSCs increased stemness, whereas the downregulation of miR-449a in Nanog-positive CSCs reduced stemness. Furthermore, transcription factor 3 (TCF3), a target of miR-449a, could downregulate Nanog expression, and restoring TCF3 expression in miR-449a-expressing Nanog-negative cells abrogated cellular stemness. These data establish that the miR449a-TCF3-Nanog axis maintains stemness in liver CSCs.
