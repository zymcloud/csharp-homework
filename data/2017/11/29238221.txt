Background:This study aimed to investigate the association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.Methods:We conducted a population-based cohort study by using claims data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The study cohort comprised 1380 newly diagnosed HBV-infected patients with SSRI use who were frequency matched by age, sex, liver cirrhosis, and index year with HBV-infected patients without SSRI use in the comparison cohort. Each patient case was followed from 2000 to 2012 to identify incident HCC cases. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to evaluate the association between SSRI use and HCC risk. The further sensitivity analysis used case-control study design. A total of 9070 HCC subjects retrieved from NHIRD, and equal non-HCC subjects were analyzed after matching for age and sex.Results:We identified 9 and 24 HCC cases in the study and comparison cohorts during the follow-up period of 7056 and 6845 person-years, respectively. The incidence rate of HCC was 1.28 and 3.51 per 1000 person-years for SSRI and non-SSRI users, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for SSRI use was 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.64; p = 0.0027). For SSRI users with a cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) of 28-89, 90-364, and â‰¥365, the adjusted HRs were 0.51, 0.22, and 0.12, respectively, (95% CI, 0.21-1.25, 0.05-0.94, and 0.02-0.90, respectively) compared with non-SSRI users (<28 cDDD). The sensitivity analysis showed that the SSRI presented with a dose-response protective effect for HCC in the multivariate analysis.Conclusion:SSRIs use may possibly reduce the risk of HCC in HBV-infected patients in a dose-responsive manner.
