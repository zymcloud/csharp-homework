Backgrounds/aims:Diagnosis and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is critical because of the variety of treatment methods and prognosis. [18F]fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F]FDG-PET/CT) has been suggested as a diagnostic modality in HCC. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of FDG-PET for staging of HCC after surgical resection and histological confirmation.Methods:We retrospectively collected data of 56 patients that underwent FDG-PET before surgical resection for HCC March 2011-May 2017, all of whom were suitable for resection by conventional HCC staging. Results of the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were compared with histological confirmation.Results:A larger tumor size was related with higher SUVmax (â‰¥4.9). The serum alpha-feto protein was associated with SUVmax. Recurrence rate was higher in patients with higher SUVmax and patients with lower SUVmax had a better survival rate.Conclusions:The SUVmax correlates well with tumor size and factors associated with biological behavior of HCC such as alpha-feto protein, and it could be a beneficial modality in providing prognostic information for HCC.
