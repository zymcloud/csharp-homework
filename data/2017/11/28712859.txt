Dysregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms for ROS in tumorigenesis have not been well established. In this study, hydrogen peroxide activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and RhoA GTPase. In particular, we found that hydrogen peroxide lead to phosphorylation of RhoA at Tyr42 via tyrosine kinase Src. Phospho-Tyr42 (p-Tyr42) residue of RhoA is a binding site for Vav2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which then activates p-Tyr42 form of RhoA. P-Tyr42 RhoA then binds to IκB kinase γ (IKKγ), leading to IKKβ activation. Furthermore, RhoA WT and phospho-mimic RhoA, RhoA Y42E, both promoted tumorigenesis, whereas the dephospho-mimic RhoA, RhoA Y42F suppressed it. In addition, hydrogen peroxide induced NF-κB activation and cell proliferation, along with expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1 in the presence of RhoA WT and RhoA Y42E, but not RhoA Y42F. Indeed, levels of p-Tyr42 Rho, p-Src, and p-65 are significantly increased in human breast cancer tissues and show correlations between each of the two components. Conclusively, the posttranslational modification of as RhoA p-Tyr42 may be essential for promoting tumorigenesis in response to generation of ROS.
