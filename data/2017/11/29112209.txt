We developed a dual-target theranostic F671, which could exhibit synergetic anticancer effects for inhibiting the activities of glutathione S-transferase and the accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1Î±. F671 undergoes self-immolative cleavage when exposed to GSTP1-1 in live cancer cells, facilitating the visualization of molecule release and distribution, as well as confirming the autophagy-induced apoptosis.
