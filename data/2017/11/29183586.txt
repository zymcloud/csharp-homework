The study objective was a determination of thiram cytotoxicity and silybin cytoprotective activity in course of the fungicide impact on cell metabolism and membrane integrity. Firstly, human, rat, chicken hepatoma cells and rat myoblasts cultures were incubated with thiram. The results showed higher sensitivity of myoblasts on thiram exposure than the hepatoma cells. Among hepatoma cells, the chicken cultures were the most sensitive on the fungicide endangering. The mitochondrial activity was the most thiram affected function within all types the cell lines used. When silybin co-acted with thiram, an increase of the cell viability was recorded. The EC50-values were higher for thiram subjected to interaction with silybin than the effect of alone thiram action. The interaction mode between the studied compounds shown by combination index (CI) represented an antagonistic or an additive nature and was depended on thiram concentration, type of the cells and the assay used. Moreover, the morphology changes were dependent on silybin presence in the cell cultures subjected to thiram impact at the same time. Staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium ioidium revealed the apoptosis cell death in the incubation cultures. Definitely, the results have shown a potential of silybin to protect the cultured cells in course of cytotoxicity induced by thiram. However, future studies taking into account other endpoints of thiram cytotoxicity pathways including species differences and the cytoprotection efficacy could be of interest.
