According to the REGARD and RAINBOW trials, ramucirumab(RAM)was introduced as second-line therapy for advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. RAM may impair wound healing due to the inhibition of angiogenesis; details on the postoperative course of patients who underwent surgery during RAM treatment remain unclear. Between 2011 and 2016, 93 patients with incurable gastric cancer were treated with RAM in our institute. Among them, 3 patients underwent surgery after RAM treatment. Case 1: A 74-year-old man with liver metastasis from gastric cancer was treated with a paclitaxel(PTX)plus RAM regimen. Perforation of the stomach was observed 3 days after final RAM administration. He was successfully treated with omental repair and discharged 19 days after surgery. Case 2: A 31-year-old woman with peritoneal recurrence after total gastrectomy received the PTX plus RAM regimen as second-line treatment. Stenting was performed for rectal stenosis. Perforation of the rectum just proximal of the stent was observed 5 days after final RAM administration. Ileostomy was performed. Closure of the perforation was not obtained until the patient died 210 days after surgery. Case 3: A 60-year-old man with remnant gastric cancer received the PTX plus RAM regimen. Accidentally, the enteral feeding tube was removed. Six weeks after the cessation of RAM administration, the enteral feeding tube was inserted under general anesthesia. He was discharged 4 days after surgery. If surgery is required in patients receiving RAM treatment, sufficient drug withdrawal is desirable. If emergency surgery is needed, less invasive procedures should be selected to the maximum extent possible.
