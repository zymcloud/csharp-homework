Sorafenib is currently the only efficient molecular targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although its effect is relatively moderate and variable between individuals. The present study aimed to evaluate the significance of peripheral blood neutrophils in the prognosis of HCC patients treated with sorafenib. A total of 464 patients with HCC were treated with sorafenib at Zhongshan Hospital (Shanghai, China) between January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2012, among which 120 patients were enrolled in the study. The optimal cutoff point for low vs. high neutrophil count (3.65×109) was obtained from a receiver operating characteristic curve. Overall survival (OS) was compared between the patients with low and high peripheral neutrophil counts. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore the prognostic factors associated with OS in the patients treated with sorafenib. A nomogram model was also performed to predict the OS times of these patients. The median OS time was 9.0 months (95% confidence interval, 5.9-12.1 months) in the whole group of patients, with 1-, 2- and 3-year OS rates of 36, 24 and 16%, respectively. Using a cutoff level of 3.65×109 neutrophils/l, the median OS time was longer in the group of patients with a low peripheral neutrophil count than in those with a high peripheral neutrophil count (11.5 vs. 5.0 months, respectively; P<0.001). The multivariate analysis showed that peripheral neutrophil count, α-fetoprotein level and tumor size were independent prognostic factors for OS. In addition, using the nomogram model for the prediction of OS, the Harrell's c-index was 0.79. Therefore, it was concluded that a lower peripheral blood neutrophil count was associated with a better prognosis following treatment with sorafenib therapy.
