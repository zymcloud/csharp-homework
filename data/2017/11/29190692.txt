Targeted therapy is currently the standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but an effective treatment after the discontinuation of sorafenib therapy remains uncertain. We aim to investigate the survival benefits of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) after stopping sorafenib therapy. We retrospectively analyzed all patients with advanced HCC, who had received palliative TACE after terminating sorafenib therapy, from January 2008 to June 2016. Patients who were in the terminal stage (Child-Pugh class C or performance status 3-4), who received a liver transplantation, or who had received any HCC treatment other than TACE, were excluded. Finally, 28 patients were recruited as the TACE group, and were randomly matched 1:1 by age, gender, Child-Pugh class, extrahepatic metastasis, and portal vein thrombosis with 28 controls who only received supportive care. For avoiding any immortal time bias, the index date of outcome follow-up was also matched. Cumulative incidences of, and hazard ratios (HRs) for, patient mortality were analyzed. The baseline demographic data between the TACE group and the control group were similar, but the 1-year overall survival rate in the TACE group was significantly higher than that of the control group (41.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.4-63.0% vs. 24.5%, 95% CI: 6.3-42.7%; p 400ng/mL, Child-Pugh class B, and tumor extension > 50% of liver volume, TACE was independently associated with a decreased mortality risk(HR 0.19, 95% CI: 0.08-0.42). In addition, tumor extension > 50% of the liver was another independent prognostic factor associated with an increased mortality risk (HR 2.99, 95% CI: 1.31-6.82). Multivariate stratified analyses verified the association of TACE with a decreased mortality rate in each patient subgroup (all HR
