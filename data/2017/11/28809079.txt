Purpose:Evaluate changes in use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and red blood cell transfusion in cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy following regulatory and reimbursement actions.Methods:Calendar year patient cohorts (2005-2013) with breast, colorectal, lung, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian, or prostate cancer and receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy were identified within the Marketscan database. Incidence of ESA treatment and transfusion were estimated in each year, as was median number of ESA administrations. Clinical characteristics associated with ESA administration and transfusions were evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression. Additionally, annual new ESA user cohorts within the Oncology Services Comprehensive Electronic Records database (2011-2014) were examined to assess hemoglobin levels at ESA initiation.Results:Across all tumor types, ESA use decreased substantially (breast cancer: 53.7 to 3.2%; lung cancer: 66.0 to 13.3%, non-Hodgkin lymphoma: 39.8 to 3.8%), transfusion use increased (2 to 5.5%, 5.5 to 18.2%, and 4.5 to 9.1%, respectively), and median number of ESA administrations declined. Across all tumor types, proportion of patients initiating an ESA with hemoglobin >10 g/dL was <10% from 2011 onward. In recent years, cancer patients who are older, female, and have chronic kidney disease or moderate or severe liver disease were most likely to receive ESAs.Conclusion:Subsequent to important regulatory and reimbursement ESA-related actions, total ESA exposure among cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy declined substantially. Today, fewer patients receive ESA therapy, and among those treated, more are initiated at hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL and are exposed for a shorter duration, consistent with current product labeling.
