Metastatic ovarian tumors from colon cancer would be resistant to chemotherapy, and compromising quality of life(QOL) of these patients was caused by acute enlargement of the tumors. A 37-year-old woman with abdominal distension was diagnosed with transverse colon cancer, bilateral ovarian metastases, liver metastases, and peritoneal dissemination at prior hospital. Two courses of chemotherapy(FOLFOX)were administered, but metastaticovarian tumors enlarged. Chemotherapy was discontinued and she was referred to our institution. To achieve symptom relief, improving QOL, and to resume chemotherapy, we planned bilateral oophorectomy and primary tumor resection if other stenotic lesion was not present. As a result, we safely performed open bilateral oophorectomy and right hemi colectomy, and the patient discharged on postoperative day 11 without complications. Chemotherapy was resumed and continued for 7 months up to this time. Even though, curative resection could not be achieved, oophorectomy should be performed in patients with enlarged metastatic ovarian tumor from colon cancer, in spite of administration of chemotherapy.
