Long-term surgical outcomes after hepatic resection for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) to interferon (IFN) therapy remain inconclusive. Clinical records of 277 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCV-related early stage HCC (met the Milan criteria) between 1993 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-seven patients achieved the SVR during HCC detection (pre-SVR group), whereas 23 achieved SVR using adjuvant interferon therapy after hepatic resection (post-SVR group). The control group included remaining 217 patients. We investigated the SVR effects on surgical outcomes. Disease-free survival (DFS) rates at 5/10/15 years after hepatic resection were significantly greater in the pre and post-SVR groups than in the control group (46/30/30per cent and 61/36/27 per cent vs 23/7/7 per cent, respectively; P
