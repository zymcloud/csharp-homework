Background and aim:Studies suggest that antiviral therapy performed after curative resection improves the postoperative prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the evidence has been contradictory. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect of antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogs (NAs) after curative resection on the long-term postoperative survival of patients with HBV-related HCC.Materials and methods:MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched up to August 2017 with no limits. Outcome measures were the primary parameter of overall survival (OS) after radical resection of HBV-related HCC and the secondary parameter of postoperative recurrence-free survival (RFS).Results:A total of 9,009 patients (2,546 of whom received antiviral therapy and 6,463 received no treatment) were included. The pooled analysis revealed that antiviral therapy was associated with significantly improved OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-0.67; P<0.00001) and RFS (HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.63-0.74; P<0.00001). Moderate heterogeneity among studies for both OS and RFS was observed, which disappeared or decreased after pooling studies using one type of NA as antiviral drug. In the subgroup analysis, anti-viral therapy significantly prolonged both OS (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.52-0.92; P=0.01) and RFS (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.49-0.70; P<0.00001) in patients with high baseline HBV DNA level (≥20,000 IU/mL) with no heterogeneity, but not in patients with low baseline HBV DNA level (<20,000 IU/mL).Conclusion:Antiviral therapy with NAs confers significant survival benefits in patients with HBV-related HCC after curative resection, especially in patients with high baseline HBV DNA level (≥20,000 IU/mL).
