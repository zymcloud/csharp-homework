The objective of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics and imaging features on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thirty-one pathologically proven CHCs were included and 31 HCCs were randomly selected as controls. Elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 alone and simultaneous elevation of α-fetoprotein and CA19-9 were more frequent in CHC than in HCC patients (p = 0.004 and 0.029, respectively). On CEUS, homogeneous, heterogeneous and peripheral irregular rim-like enhancement was illustrated in 8 (25.8%), 12 (38.7%) and 11 (35.5%) CHCs and in 6 (19.4%), 23 (74.1%) and 2 (6.5%) HCCs, respectively (p = 0.007). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed CA19-9 elevation (p = 0.011, odds ratio [OR] = 6.545) and peripheral irregular rim-like enhancement on CEUS (p = 0.017, OR = 7.718) were independent variables. A receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted and the area under the curve was 0.740. CHC should be watched for in HBV-infected patients with liver tumor manifesting peripheral irregular rim-like enhancement on CEUS, accompanied by CA19-9 elevation.
