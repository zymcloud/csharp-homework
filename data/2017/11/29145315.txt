Rationale:The image-guided iodine-125 seed implantation has been widely used for a variety of tumors, including prostatic cancer, pulmonary cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. However, the clinical value of iodine-125 seed implantation for the treatment of pancreatic metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported. We presented the first case with ultrasound-guided iodine-125 seed implantation for this disease.Patient concerns:We presented the case of a 48-year-old man patient with primary hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic metastasis who was managed with ultrasound-guided iodine-125 seeds implantation.Diagnoses:She was diagnosed with synchronous pancreatic metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma.Interventions:Puncture biopsy and ultrasound-guided iodine-125 seeds implantation.Outcomes:The hepatic and pancreatic tumors were obviously reduced after 15 months. Moreover, the liver function test was mildly abnormal in glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase.Lessons:The image-guided iodine-125 seeds implantation was an important therapeutic approache to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with pancreatic metastasis. However, more related cases should be reported for further evaluating the value of the way.
