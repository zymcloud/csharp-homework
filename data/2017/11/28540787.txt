Purpose:The resection rate for liver metastases from gastric cancer is only 1.4-21.1%. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) for liver metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma (LMGC).Materials and methods:A database of 108 gastric adenocarcinoma patients with liver metastases who underwent MWA (n = 32) or systemic chemotherapy (n = 76) for LMGC between 2008 and 2016 was reviewed. Overall survival curves were assessed and compared based on different therapies.Results:All the patients were followed up for a median of 15 months (range, 2-68 months). The median cumulative survival times of patients after MWA and systemic chemotherapy were 25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.5-33.5) months and 12 (95% CI 7.7-16.3) months, respectively (HR 1.751, 95% CI 1.077-2.845; p = .015). The 1-, 3-, and 5- year survival rates were 80.9%, 31.2%, and 16.7% (MWA group); and 50.0%, 18.8%, and 5.4% (chemotherapy group), respectively. In the MWA group, side effects were reported in eight patients who developed abdominal pain, transient fever, or nausea. Dominant size, number of liver metastases, therapeutic modalities, and presence of extrahepatic metastases showed significant prognostic value in univariate analyses; while the latter three were identified as independent prognostic factors in multivariate regression analysis.Conclusions:MWA is a safe and useful alternative for liver metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma in selected patients.
