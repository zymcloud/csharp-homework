Effective adjuvant therapies have not been established for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study aimed to determine prognostic influence of statin against HCC recurrence after initial resection. From 2003 to 2013, 734 patients underwent initial HCC resection. Exposure to statins was defined as the use at the recommended daily dosage for > 90 days after surgery. Outcomes were compared between patients who did and did not receive statins. Of 734 patients, 31 (4.2%) received statins for dyslipidemia (statin group) and 703 (95.8%) did not (non-statin group). The proportions of hepatitis B (6.5% vs. 22.8%, P = 0.032), C (19.4% vs. 45.0%, P = 0.005), and a fibrosis score of F3-4 (16.1 % vs. 39.8%, P = 0.008) were significantly lower in the statin than non-statin group. The recurrence-free survival rate was significantly higher in the statin than non-statin group (P In conclusion:The statins use reduced the risk of HCC recurrence after initial resection. Statins may have protective influences on HCC recurrence in patients who undergo initial liver resection.
