The patient was a 30-year-old man who underwent a medical examination for shortness of breath.An abdominal computed tomography(CT)scan revealed advanced ascending colon cancer with multiple metastases to the liver.We performed a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy first, due to the obstruction.Postoperatively, the patient received capecitabine plus oxaliplatin( CapeOX)chemotherapy.After 10 courses of CapeOX, the multiple liver metastases had reduced remarkably in size. Colectomy of the anastomosis and partial hepatectomy were then performed.Histological examination of the resected tissue revealed no residual cancer cells, suggestive of a pathological complete response.
