The human tripartite motif (TRIM) 59 has been implicated in tumorigenesis of many types of cancer. However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of TRIM59 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In our study, the purpose was to investigate the impact of TRIM59 on the biologic behavior of HCC cells. We observed that TRIM59 was highly expressed in HCC cells compared with a normal human hepatocyte cell line. Lentivirus-mediated knocking down of TRIM59 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells, whereas overexpression of TRIM59 enhanced cell growth and metastasis. Furthermore, our study showed that silencing of TRIM59 decreased the expression of E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin and vimentin expression, whereas TRIM59 overexpression had the opposite effects on the above proteins. Finally, we found that p53 protein expression level was regulated by TRIM59, so we proposed that TRIM59 may enhance HCC cell proliferation and metastasis through p53 signaling pathway. In summary, these data indicated that TRIM59 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
