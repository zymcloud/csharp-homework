Liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria (MC) is nowadays a curative procedure. Yttrium-90 microspheres radioembolization (Y90-RE) has shown to be an effective and safe treatment of primary liver tumors. The aim of this work is to offer a view on the publications which report on the use of Y90-RE as bridge or downstaging prior to LT. Twenty articles have been considered for this world review. About 178 LT in patients were treated with Y90-RE prior to LT. Most of patients had a downstaging strategy. In all series alpha-fetoproteins decreased between Y90-RE and LT. Therefore, Y90-RE may have an important role in the bridge and downstaging treatments.
