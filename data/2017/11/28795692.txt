Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a well-known polyphenol that is present in grapes, peanuts, pine seeds, and several other plants. Resveratrol exerts deleterious effects on various types of human cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the cell death-inducing mechanisms of resveratrol-006 (Res-006), a novel resveratrol derivative in human liver cancer cells in vitro. Res-006 was more effectively suppressed the viability of HepG2 human hepatoma cells than resveratrol (the IC50 values were 67.2 and 354.8 μmol/L, respectively). Co-treatment with the ER stress regulator 4-phenylbutyrate (0.5 mmol/L) or the ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC, 1 mmol/L) significantly attenuated Res-006-induced HepG2 cell death, suggesting that pro-apoptotic ER stress and/or ROS may govern the Res-006-induced HepG2 cell death. We further revealed that treatment of HepG2 cells with Res-006 (65 μmol/L) immediately elicited the dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS. It also collapsed the mitochondrial membrane potential and further induced ER stress and cell death. These events, except for the change in mitochondrial morphology, were prevented by the exposure of the HepG2 cells to the mitochondrial ROS scavenger, Mito-TEMPO (300-1000 μmol/L). The results suggest that Res-006 may kill HepG2 cells through cell death pathways, including the ER stress initiated by mitochondrial ROS accumulation. The cell death induced by this novel resveratrol derivative involves crosstalk between the mitochondria and ER stress mechanisms.
