Antiplatelet therapy has shown protective effects against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in preclinical studies. However, it is unclear whether antiplatelet therapy lowers the risk of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B. A retrospective analysis was conducted of data from 1,674 chronic hepatitis B patients, enrolled between January 2002 and May 2015, whose serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels were suppressed by antivirals to Conclusion:Antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of HCC in chronic hepatitis B patients whose hepatitis B virus is effectively suppressed. However, antiplatelet therapy containing clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding. (Hepatology 2017;66:1556-1569).
