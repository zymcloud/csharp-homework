Although the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) plays important roles in both inflammation and cancer, the mechanism by which this factor promotes cervical carcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated a potential role for tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 11a (TNFRSF11a), the corresponding gene of which is a direct binding target of KLF5, in tumour cell proliferation and invasiveness. Coexpression of KLF5 and TNFRSF11a correlated significantly with tumorigenesis in cervical tissues (P < 0.05) and manipulation of KLF5 expression positively affected TNFRSF11a mRNA and protein expression. Functionally, KLF5 promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness in a manner dependent partly on TNFRSF11a expression. Moreover, in vivo functional TNFRSF11a-knockdown mouse studies revealed suppression of tumorigenicity and liver metastatic potential. Notably, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced KLF5 expression by activating the p38 signalling pathway and high KLF5 and TNFRSF11a expression increased the risk of death in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma. Our results demonstrate that KLF5 and TNFRSF11a promote cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness.
