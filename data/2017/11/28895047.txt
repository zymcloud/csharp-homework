Oral mucositis (OM) is one of the cancer chemotherapy-related side effects which can affect the quality of life of affected patients. This study was designed to investigate the healing effect of Elaeagnus angustifolia in 5-flurouracil (5-FU)-induced OM in golden hamster. Fifty-six adult male golden hamsters received three intraperitoneal injections of 5-FU at a dose of 60 mg/kg on days 0, 5, and 10. The cheek pouch mucosa was scratched superficially under local anesthesia. Then, two horizontal scratches were made across the everted cheek pouch on days 3 and 4. All treatments were started on day 12 for equal number of animals in control group with no treatments, gel base group that was treated with carboxy methyl cellulose as gel base which used in preparation of the topical gel, topical gel group that used gel containing 10% hydroalcoholic extract of E. angustifolia (HEEA) topically, and dietary group which was treated with 300 mg/kg HEEA. At 2 and 5 days after treatment, blood and pouch tissue sampling were done and analyzed for blood composition, tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities plus histopathological evaluations. Both topically and orally HEEA-treated groups showed a significant relief in OM compared to the control and base gel groups. However, the systemic form had higher efficiency in some parts especially decreasing the MPO (0.27 ± 0.17 vs. 0.56 ± 0.17 IU/L) and increasing SOD (6.46 ± 0.15 vs. 5.36 ± 0.18 IU/L) activities in pouch tissue in comparison to topical form mostly at 5 days after treatment. It seems that hydroalcoholic extract of E. angustifolia can be used as an appropriate drug choice for the treatment of oral mucositis based on its healing stimulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.
