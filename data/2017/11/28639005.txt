Background:Surgical management of centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma (CL-HCC) poses a great challenge. Major hepatectomy (MH) might compromise future remnant liver volume (FRLV), while the long-term benefits of central hepatectomy (CH) had not been well demonstrated.Methods:Consecutive patients with early-stage CL-HCC who underwent liver resection were enrolled. Fifteen patients underwent CH, while thirty-three were subjected to MH. All relevant clinicopathological variables were analyzed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of both groups were compared.Results:There were no differences between CH and MH in terms of predisposing liver disease, tumor size, blood loss, complication rate and vascular invasion. Mean FRLV increased from 40.9 to 69.2% by using CH resection lines. The parenchymal transection time is longer in CH. There were no differences of DFS between two groups. The 5-year OS rates of CH and MH were 93.3 and 62.6%, respectively. MH was a poor prognostic factor.Conclusions:CH is a relatively time-consuming and technique-demanding procedure, but excellent long-term survival could be achieved. CH could increase liver volume preservation without compromising intra-hepatic recurrence. In an endemic area of hepatitis and cirrhosis, CH should still play an important role in surgical treatment of CL-HCC.
