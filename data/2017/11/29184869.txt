Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is a high mortality neoplasm in gynecologic malignancy. It usually can metastasize to distant organs such as pleura, liver, lung, and lymph nodes. However, the skin metastases are not common and related to very poor prognosis. Here we report a 54-year-old patient with ovarian clear cell carcinoma with skin metastases on the anterior chest at 11 months after initial diagnosis. Although she received palliative chemotherapy, she expired due to disease progression 2 months later after the diagnosis of skin metastases.
