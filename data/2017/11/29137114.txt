Liver cancer is a progressive, irreversible and aggressive malignant disease, which has no effective chemotherapeutic drugs. RA-XII, a natural cyclopeptide isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Rubia yunnanensis, exerts anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities. This work aimed to investigate the effects of RA-XII on a hepatic tumor and its underlying mechanisms in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The results showed that RA-XII effectively inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Consistently, RA-XII significantly induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells by decreasing the expression of caspase 3, 8, 9, and promoting the Cleavage of PARP. Moreover, RA-XII-induced apoptosis was attenuated in the presence of apoptosis inhibitor N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (O-Me) fluoromethyl keton, suggesting that RA-XII induced apoptosis-cell-death in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, autophagy-related proteins and mRNA levels were dramatically reduced after RA-XII treatment. Meanwhile, we observed that autophagy inhibitor chloroquine could enhance apoptosis in RA-XII-treated HepG2 cells, indicating that autophagy played a protective role in HepG2 cells and RA-XII might inhibit protective autophagy. Further analysis showed that RA-XII inhibited AMPK phosphorylation and led to the mTOR/P70S6K pathway activation, suggesting that RA-XII inhibited autophagy through AMPK/mTOR/P70S6K pathways. This study demonstrated that RA-XII promoted apoptosis and inhibited protective autophagy through AMPK/mTOR/P70S6K pathways in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that RA-XII might potentially be a candidate as an autophagy inhibitor agent for further therapy of liver cancer.
