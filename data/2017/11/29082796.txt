Objective:To evaluate the safety of thermal ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with abnormal coagulation function.Methods:Fifty-seven HCC tumours in 50 patients were treated with thermal ablation. All patients had a meted platelet count 9/L or international normalised ratio (INR) ≥ 1.7. Gastroscopy before ablation, platelet concentrate or fresh frozen plasma transfusion during ablation and contrast enhanced ultrasoundgraphy (CEUS)-guided ablation to cease needle tract bleeding were performed to reduce haemorrhage. The incidences of haemorrhage and other major complications were recorded and patients were followed up to observe the local tumour progression (LTP), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates.Results:Two incidences of needle tract bleeding and one needle tract bleeding together with bleeding at the suture of the spleen fossa were found. Three needle tract bleeding events were detected by CEUS and ceased after CEUS-guided complementary ablation. CEUS failed to detect bleeding at the suture of the spleen fossa. Therefore, a laparotomy was conducted for haemostasis. No other major complications were found after ablation. The median follow-up periods were 18.7 ± 12.0 months (range 1 ∼ 42 months) and 1 LTP and 15 IDRs occurred. The 1-, 2- and 3-year OS rates were 84.8%, 82.7% and 82.7%, and RFS rates were 67.9%, 64.0% and 64.0%, respectively.Conclusion:With gastroscopy before ablation, platelet concentrate or fresh frozen plasma transfusion during ablation and CEUS-guided ablation to cease needle tract bleeding, thermal ablation is a safe treatment for HCC in patients with abnormal coagulation function.
