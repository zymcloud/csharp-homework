Aim:The Neoadjuvant PI3K inhibition in HER2 OverExpressing Breast cancEr (NeoPHOEBE) trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of buparlisib, a pan-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel as neoadjuvant treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer.Methods:NeoPHOEBE was a neoadjuvant, phase II, randomised, double-blind study. Women with HER2+ breast cancer were randomised within two independent cohorts by PIK3CA mutation status and, in each cohort stratified by oestrogen receptor (ER) status to receive buparlisib or placebo plus trastuzumab (first 6 weeks) followed by buparlisib or placebo with trastuzumab and paclitaxel. Primary end-point was pathological complete response (pCR) rate; key secondary end-point was objective response rate (ORR) at 6 weeks. Exploratory end-points were evaluation of Ki67 levels and change in tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in intermediate biopsies at day 15.Results:Recruitment was suspended mainly due to liver toxicity after enrolment of 50 of the planned 256 patients. In each arm (buparlisib n = 25; placebo n = 25) 21 patients (84%) had wild type PIK3CA and 4 patients (16%) had mutant PIK3CA. Overall, pCR rate was similar between buparlisib and placebo arms (32.0% versus 40%; one-sided P = 0.811). A trend towards higher ORR (68.8% versus 33.3%; P = 0.053) and a significant decrease in Ki67 (75% versus 26.7%; P = 0.021) was observed in buparlisib versus placebo arm in the ER+ subgroup (Pinteraction = 0.03).Conclusions:Addition of the pan-PI3K inhibitor buparlisib to taxane-trastuzumab-based therapy in HER2+ early breast cancer was not feasible. However, the higher ORR and Ki67 reduction in the ER+, HER2+ subgroup indicates a potential role for PI3K-targeted therapy in this setting and may warrant further investigation with better-tolerated second-generation PI3K inhibitors.Trial registration identifier:NCT01816594.
