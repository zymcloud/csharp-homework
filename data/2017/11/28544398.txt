An abundance of noninvasive scores have been associated with fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. We aimed to compare the prognostic ability of these scores in relation to liver histology in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Liver biopsies from treatment-na√Øve CHB patients at one tertiary care centre were scored by a single hepato-pathologist. Laboratory values at liver biopsy were used to calculate the PAGE-B, REACH-B, GAG-HCC, CU-HCC and FIB-4 scores. Any clinical event was defined as HCC development, liver failure, transplantation and mortality. HCC and mortality data were obtained from national database registries. Of 557 patients, 40 developed a clinical event within a median follow-up of 10.1 (IQR 5.7-15.9) years. The PAGE-B score predicted any clinical event (C-statistic.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.92), HCC development (C-statistic .91) and reduced transplant-free survival (C-statistic .83) with good accuracy, also when stratified by ethnicity, antiviral therapy after biopsy or advanced fibrosis. The C-statistics (95% CI) of the REACH-B, GAG-HCC, CU-HCC and FIB-4 scores for any event were .70 (0.59-0.81), .82 (0.75-0.89), .73 (0.63-0.84) and.79 (0.69-0.89), respectively. The PAGE-B event risk assessment improved modestly when combined with the Ishak fibrosis stage (C-statistic .87, 95% CI: 0.82-0.93). The PAGE-B score showed the best performance in assessing the likelihood of developing a clinical event among a diverse CHB population over 15 years of follow-up. Additional liver histological characteristics did not appear to provide a clinically significant improvement.
