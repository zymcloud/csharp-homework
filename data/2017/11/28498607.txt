Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) exhibit a diversity of molecular phenotypes, raising major challenges in clinical management. HCCs detected by surveillance programs at an early stage are candidates for potentially curative therapies (local ablation, resection, or transplantation). In the long term, transplantation provides the lowest recurrence rates. Treatment allocation is based on tumor number, size, vascular invasion, performance status, functional liver reserve, and the prediction of early (Conclusion:Well-differentiated HCCs display mutually exclusive periportal or perivenous zonation programs. Among all HCCs, periportal-type tumors have the lowest intrinsic potential for early recurrence after curative resection. (Hepatology 2017;66:1502-1518).
