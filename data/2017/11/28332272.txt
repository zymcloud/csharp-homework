Aim:This study explored treatment outcomes of sofosbuvir (SOF)/ledipasvir (LDV) therapy for chronic hepatitis C patients with and without prior daclatasvir (DCV)/asunaprevir (ASV) therapy.Methods:Overall, 530 Japanese patients who were infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 received SOF/LDV therapy for 12 weeks, and resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the hepatitis C virus non-structural protein (NS)5A and NS5B regions were assessed at baseline and virological relapse by direct sequencing.Results:Sustained virological response (SVR) rates did not significantly differ between patients with and without NS5A Y93H/N (94.2% [113/120] vs. 97.7% [345/353]), but the SVR rate was significantly lower in patients with prior DCV/ASV therapy compared to those without (69.2% [18/26] vs. 98.4% [496/504], P Conclusions:Prior DCV/ASV therapy is associated with failure of SOF/LDV therapy due to multiple RAVs.
