This study was to assess the safety and efficacy of artificial ascitetes in assisting CT-guided cryoablation of hepatic tumors adjacent to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A total of 84 patients with peripheral hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract, who were treated cryoablation, were included in this retrospective study. Of these 84 patients, cryoablation had been performed in 39 patients with 41 peripheral hepatic tumors. These were assisted by induction artificial ascites while 40 patients with 43 peripheral hepatic tumors underwent cryoablation without induction of ascites. The artificial ascites separation success rate, the cryoablation technique effectiveness, local tumor progression and complications were all evaluated. The results showed that the artificial ascites separation success rate for 41 hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract was 95% (39/41). Technique effectiveness of group I was achieved in 35 of 43 tumors (81.3%) after follow-up imaging three months after cryoablation. In group II, technique effectiveness was achieved in 39 of 41 tumors after follow-up imaging three months following cryoablation. No major complications were encountered in either of the two groups. Artificial ascites assisting in CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation is a reliable and effective method for the treatment of hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract, and it can achieve a fine local control of such tumors.
