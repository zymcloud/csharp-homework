Recently, metastatic colorectal cancer(CRC)patients with a left-side primary tumor have been reported to have a significantly longer survival period than those with a right-side primary tumor. However, the impact of the location of the primary lesion on the survival outcomes of patients with resectable liver metastases of CRC has not yet been fully investigated. The subjects of this retrospective study were 113 consecutive patients who underwent a hepatic metastatectomy for CRC between 2001 and 2016 at our institution. The background data and survival times were compared between 32 patients whose primary lesions were located in the cecum or the ascending colon(right-side group)and 81 patients whose primary lesions were located in the descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum(left-side group). No significant differences in various clinicopathological variables were observed between the 2 groups. The 5-year overall and relapse-free survival rates after hepatectomy were 62.1% for the right-side group vs 49.2% for the left-side group(p=0.55)and 37.1% for the right-side group vs 33.4%for the left-sided group(p=0.76), respectively. In conclusion, colorectal liver metastasis should be resected regardless of the primary tumor location.
