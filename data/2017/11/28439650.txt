Objectives:To review the gadoxetic acid disodium (EOB)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging features of cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CoCC) of the liver and compare them with those of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).Methods:EOB-enhanced MR images of 19 patients with CoCC, 23 with ICC, and 51 with HCC were retrospectively evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the characteristic MR features of CoCC with histopathological-imaging correlation.Results:Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that dot-/band-shaped internal enhancement during the arterial and portal phases (P Conclusions:EOB-enhanced MR features of CoCC largely differ from those of HCC but are similar to those of ICC. However, the finding of thicker arterial ring enhancement with dot-/band-like internal enhancement could help differentiate CoCC from ICC.Key points:• Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR features of cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CoCC) resembled those of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). • Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR features of CoCC largely differed from those of hepatocellular carcinoma. • Dot-/band-like internal enhancement of CoCC may be helpful for differentiating from ICC. • Arterial ring enhancement of CoCC was larger than that of ICC.
