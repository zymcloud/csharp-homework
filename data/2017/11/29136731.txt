Objective: To explore the safety and feasibility of associating diaphragm resection and liver-diaphragmatic metastasis lesions resection for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Methods: Retrospectively analysis 83 cases(98 times) of advanced ovarian cancer with liver-diaphragmatic metastasis between January 2012 and December 2016 at Department of Liver Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital.The patients were aged from 19 to 75 years.Surgical procedure included metastatic lesions resection(43 times) and stripping(55 times). Operation status, post-operative complications, pathology results and follow-up of the patients were analyzed. Results: Fifteen patients received twice surgical treatment and 68 patients received one time surgical treatment. Postoperative hemorrhage in chest and between liver and diaphragm was not occurred in all cases.Dyspnea and low oxygen saturation were occurred in two cases of stripping patients and 1 case of metastatic lesions resection patients.Results of CT examination indicated that there was medium to large amount of ascites in right chests.The symptoms were relieved after placing thoracic closed drainage.Other patients were recovered smoothly.All patients were diagnosed as ovarian cancer by pathological examination. Conclusion: Associating diaphragm resection is safe and feasible for liver-diaphragmatic metastasis lesions from ovarian cancer.
