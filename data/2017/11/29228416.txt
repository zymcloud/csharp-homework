Objective:Chronic alcohol abuse represents a risk factor for oral diseases, in particular, oral cancer. Periodontal disease has been showed to be involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and liver steatosis. The role of chronic alcohol consumption on periodontitis is still controversial. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of chronic alcohol abuse on oral health.Patients and methods:Twenty-three alcohol use disorders (AUD) patients and twenty-three healthy social drinkers underwent an oral examination by trained oral clinicians in order to evaluate oral and dental health. A questionnaire assessing oral hygiene was administered together with the evaluation of DMFT (decayed, missing, filled teeth), SLI (Silness-LoÃ« plaque index) and CPI (community periodontal index of treatment needs) scores.Results:Alcoholic patients showed significantly lower oral hygiene scores compared to controls. Alcoholic patients showed significantly poorer scores at DMFT, SLI and CPI tests. Moreover, among alcoholics, smokers showed a significantly poorer oral health than non-smokers.Conclusions:Chronic alcohol abuse increases the risk of dental and periodontal diseases. Smoking represents a significant co-factor. The practice of basic oral hygiene and the access to professional dental care should be encouraged among AUD patients in order to reduce oral diseases.
