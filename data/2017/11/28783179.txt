Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mainly through cirrhosis induction, spurring research for a deeper understanding of HCV versus host interactions in cirrhosis. The present study investigated crosstalks between HCV infection and UNC5A, a netrin-1 dependence receptor that is inactivated in cancer. UNC5A and HCV parameters were monitored in patients samples (n=550) as well as in in vitro. In patients, UNC5A mRNA expression is significantly decreased in clinical HCV(+) specimens irrespective of the viral genotype, but not in (HBV)(+) liver biopsies, as compared to uninfected samples. UNC5A mRNA is downregulated in F2 (3-fold; P=0.009), in F3 (10-fold, P=0.0004) and more dramatically so in F4/cirrhosis (44-fold; P
