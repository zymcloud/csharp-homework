Aim:To assess the prevalence of arterial phase (AP) ring-enhancing small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); detail additional MRI features that enable HCC diagnosis; and examine arterial timing as one possible cause of this appearance.Materials and methods:Patients undergoing HCC screening with both computed tomography (CT) and MRI within 40 days were examined at a single institution over a 7- year time period ending in 2013. From this initial group, small (1-3 cm), (AP) ring-enhancing HCC on MRI were studied.Results:From the initial group of 64 patients with 129 HCC, 20 patients with 78 HCCs had a small diameter with 32 (41%) having an AP ring at MRI. The mean age of this latter group was 63-years old, with the average tumour diameter of 1.9 cm. Histopathology and secondary imaging supported a diagnosis of HCC in 20 (100%) patients and 31 (97%) lesions. Most of the ringed lesions had early AP timing.Conclusion:This study revealed a high prevalence (41%) of small, AP ring HCC with MRI. The use of other MRI sequences adds support in making the proper diagnosis with this appearance. Early AP timing may help create this pattern.
