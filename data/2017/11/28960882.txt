Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR)C and NLRX family proteins play a key role in the innate immune response. The relationship between these proteins and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study investigated the prognostic significance of NLRC and NLRX family protein levels in HCC patients. Data from 360 HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas database and 231 patients in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis and a Cox regression model were used to determine median survival time (MST) and overall and recurrence-free survival by calculating the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). High NOD2 and low NLRX1 expression in tumor tissue was associated with short MST (P = 0.012 and 0.014, respectively). A joint-effects analysis of NOD2 and NLRX1 combined revealed that groups III and IV had reduced risk of death from HCC as compared to group I (adjusted P = 0.001, adjusted HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.16-0.61 and adjusted P = 0.043, adjusted HR = 0.63, 95%CI = 0.41-0.99, respectively). NOD2 and NLRX1 expression levels are potential prognostic markers in HCC following hepatectomy.
