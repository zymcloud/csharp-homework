A 78-year-old woman underwent partial hepatectomy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC).After surgery, she was further treated with radiofrequency ablation(RFA)and transcatheter arterial embolization(TAE)for the intrahepatic reccurence of HCC.Thirty months after surgery, her tumor marker levels increased and computed tomography (CT)revealed an intrahepatic mass and right renal tumor which extended into the renal vein.We therefore suspected a reccurence of HCC and right renal cell carcinoma which extended into the renal vein, and thus performed right nephrectomy before again performing TAE to treat the reccurence of HCC.The pathological findings showed HCC metastasis in the kidney. Nephrectomy should be performed as soon as possible in patients with a renal vein tumor thrombus in order to prevent the occurrence of a pulmonary embolism.We herein describe a very rare oncologic emergency case and review the relevant literature.
