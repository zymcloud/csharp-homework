Background:Her2 is a well-known member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) superfamily, a group of transmembrane receptors that mediate effects of proliferation and survival and thus play an important role in tumorigenesis. EGFRs can translocate to the nucleus and may mediate DNA repair and cell cycle arrest.Objectives:The aim of this study was to characterize hepatocellular Her2 expression in different liver diseases.Materials and methods:Her2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 674 liver biopsies.Results:Hepatocytes often revealed a nuclear and cytoplasmic Her2 expression in different liver diseases with the strongest association to alcoholic steatohepatitis. The histologic parameters of hepatocellular ballooning and the presence of Mallory-Denk bodies strongly correlated with Her2 positivity. Interestingly, in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) nuclear Her2 expression was frequently observed. Furthermore, Her2 positive hepatocytes showed a loss of estrogen receptor expression and increased expression of p21, a cell cycle regulator, and pSTAT3, a downstream effector of nuclear Her2.Conclusions:Nuclear Her2 expression in hepatocytes with further metabolic and cell cycle alterations may imply a so far unknown mechanism of a stress response. So far, the effects on disease course and a possible role of nuclear Her2 in progression to HCC are unclear and the subject of future research.
