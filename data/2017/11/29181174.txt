Platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab represents the first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The most common adverse events associated with cetuximab are infusion reactions and skin reactions, and a risk of venous thromboembolic events has also recently been reported in association with cetuximab. It is well known that thrombosis is a common complication of malignancy, and represents the second most frequent cause of mortality in cancer patients. The present study reports the case of a 79-year-old man who presented with lung and liver metastases from tongue squamous cell carcinoma, for which platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab was administered. After 1 cycle, the patient showed rapid growth of a left ventricular (LV) thrombus, despite ongoing antiplatelet therapy for an old myocardial infarction. Anticoagulant therapy was administered to treat the LV thrombus, which resolved within 1 week. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first reported case of rapidly occurring LV thrombus associated with platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab. Platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab may be associated with a higher risk of embolic thrombus.
