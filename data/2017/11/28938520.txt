Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer. The Warburg effect is an important way by which HCC adapts to a hypoxic environment. The aim of the present study was to determine whether and how galangin reverses the Warburg effect in HCC cells. We treated three HCC cell lines, HepG2, Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 with galangin for 24h, respectively. Cell proliferation was measured with MTT assay. Glucose uptake, lactate production and the oxygen consumption were measured. Pyruvate kinase activities were detected by measuring the consumption of NADH, and glycolytic pathway-related proteins were measured by Western blotting. The results showed that galangin suppressed proliferation of HCC cells, decreased glucose absorption and lactate production of HCC. In addition, galangin also gave rise to increased oxygen consumption in all three HCC cell lines. After treatment with galangin, the activity of pyruvate kinase was up-regulated and the expression levels of glycolytic pathway-related proteins were changed. These results suggest that galangin suppresses the Warburg effect in HCC cells, indicating that galangin might be a potential therapeutic agent for HCC.
