The patient was a 65-year-old man who had been previously diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B, but the patient had discontinued treatment while in his thirties. The patient was admitted to the emergency department after losing consciousness due to abdominal pain. Emergency contrast CT was performed in the shock state, and the diagnosis was hemorrhagic shock due to rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Emergency TAE was performed, and hemostasis was successful due to left hepatic arterial embolism. The tumor was confined to the liver lateral area and it was judged to be resectable curatively, upon state restoration. Ten days after TAE, lateral segmentectomy of the liver was performed. Pathological findings indicated moderately differentiated HCC, mostly necrotic and partially viable. He was discharged on 11POD. On 69POD, the patient reexperienced sudden abdominal pain after lunch. The abdominal pain continued while emergency contrast CT was performed at the time of visit in the shock state. Recurrence of multiple dissemination via high-absorption ascites was found around the largest tumor nest with lower left diaphragm diameter of 15cm, and it was judged that the HCC disseminated recurrence had ruptured. Emergency TAE was performed again, and hemostasis was successful by embolization of the left gastric artery and lower left diaphragm artery. Subsequently, tumor growth slowed after initiating oral administration of sorafenib, and the patient is alive 8 months after re-TAE.
