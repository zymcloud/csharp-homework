Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) affects almost 25,000 women annually and is the fifth most common malignancy in women in North America. A combination of surgery and cytotoxic chemotherapy may produce a favorable clinical response. The platinum-paclitaxel combination regimen is the chemotherapy gold-standard for advanced ovarian cancer, and carboplatin is one of the agents in this combination therapy. However, the majority of patients eventually experience a relapse due to the development of platinum resistance. FUSE binding protein 1 (FBP1) has been identified as an anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative oncoprotein that is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. Its high expression is also associated with carboplatin resistance. In the present study, it was identified that the expression of FBP1 was significantly higher in EOC tissues than in normal epithelial ovarian or in epithelial ovarian adenoma tissue. FBP1 expression was significantly correlated with the grade of epithelial ovarian cancer. Carboplatin inhibited the expression of FBP1 in epithelial ovarian cancer cells and the knockdown of FBP1 enhanced the inhibition of cell viability and migration by carboplatin. In addition to FBP1, carboplatin also inhibited the expression of β-catenin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. Furthermore, the expression of β-catenin and MMP-9 were lower in FBP1 knockdown cells compared with control EOC cells. FBP1 may thus serve a role in the regulation of the expression of β-catenin and MMP-9; the inhibition of β-catenin and MMP-9 by carboplatin may be mediated through the inhibition of FBP1. The inhibition of FBP1 expression by carboplatin may be a mechanism in the treatment of EOC by carboplatin.
