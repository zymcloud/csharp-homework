Background:The persistent scarcity of donors has prompted liver transplantation teams to find solutions for increasing graft availability. We report our experience of liver transplantations performed with grafts from older donors, specifically over 70 and 80 years old.Patients and methods:We analyzed our prospectively maintained single-center database from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2014, with 380 liver transplantations performed in 354 patients. Six groups were composed according to donor age: Results:Donors 80 years of age. Patient survival was not significantly different between the groups. In multivariate analysis, factors predicting graft loss were transaminase peak, retransplantation and cold ischemia time but not donor age.Conclusions:Older donors >70 and >80 years of age could provide excellent liver grafts.
