We report a case of bilobar multiple hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)with peritoneal dissemination successfullytreated by dual treatment with reductive surgeryplus percutaneous isolated hepatic perfusion(PIHP). A 73-year-old man had sudden abdominal pain and was diagnosed bilobar multiple HCC through some examinations. The abdominal CT scan demonstrated onlya peritoneal dissemination under the liver. We performed partial hepatectomyof the lateral segment and the Spiegel lobe, and resected a peritoneal dissemination. Subsequently, we underwent PIHP twice. The tumor marker was normalized, and CT images demonstrated complete response according to the RECIST. Dual treatment is considered to be a unique therapeutic modalityfor severe advanced HCC.
