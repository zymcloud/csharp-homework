The gut microbiota has recently been recognized as a major environmental factor in the pathophysiology of many human diseases. The anatomical and function connection existing between gut and liver provides the theoretical basis to assume the liver is a major target for gut microbes. In the last decades, numerous studies reported an altered composition of gut microbiota in patients with liver cirrhosis and a progressively marked dysbiosis with worsening of the liver disease. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, the deadliest complication of liver cirrhosis, is widely variable among cirrhotic patients, thus suggesting a complexity of genetic and environmental factors implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Gut microbiota is now emerging as a plausible candidate to explain this variability. In this manuscript we review the human and the experimental evidence supporting the potential implication of gut microbiota in the promotion, progression and complication of liver disease.
