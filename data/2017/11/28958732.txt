Background:Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) liver metastases still remains a difficult challenge and the effectiveness of resection for SCC liver metastases is unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze long-term outcomes of surgically treated patients with SCC liver metastases.Methods:The clinicopathological characteristics, overall survival (OS), and recurrence free survival (RFS) of all patients with SCC liver metastases resected between 1998 and 2015, were analyzed.Results:Among 28 patients who met inclusion criteria, there were 19 patients with anal cancer metastases (68%), 2 (7%) with cervix cancer metastases, 2 (7%) with tonsil cancer metastases, 2 (7%) with lung cancer metastases, 2 (7%) with primary unknown cancer metastases and 1 (4%) with vulvar cancer metastases. Four (14%) patients underwent major hepatectomy. There were no liver insufficiency cases or 90-day mortality. Cumulative 3- and 5-year OS rates were 52% and 47%. Cumulative 1- and 3-year RFS rates were 50% and 25%.Conclusions:Long-term outcomes after resection of SCC liver metastases compare favorably with those of colorectal or neuroendocrine liver metastases. Liver resection can be an effective treatment option for SCC liver metastases in appropriately selected patients after systemic therapy.
