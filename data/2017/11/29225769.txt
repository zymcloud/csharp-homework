We present the rapid-prototyping of type I collagen micropatterns on poly-dimethylsiloxane substrates for the biomimetic confinement of cells using the combination of a surface oxidation treatment and 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane silanisation followed by glutaraldehyde crosslinking. The aim of surface treatment is to stabilise microcontact printing transfer of this natural extracellular matrix protein that usually wears out easily from poly-dimethylsiloxane, which is not suitable for biomimetic cell culture platforms and lab-on-chip applications. A low-cost CD-DVD laser was used to etch biomimetic micropatterns into acrylic sheets that were in turn replicated to poly-dimethylsiloxane slabs with the desired features. These stamps were finally inked with type I collagen for microcontact printing transfer on the culture substrates in a simple manner. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) and rat primary hepatocytes, which do not adhere to bare poly-dimethylsiloxane, were successfully seeded and showed optimal adhesion and survival on simple protein micropatterns with a hepatic cord geometry in order to validate our technique. HepG2 cells also proliferated on the stamps. Soft and stiff poly-dimethylsiloxane layers were also tested to demonstrate that our cost-effective process is compatible with biomimetic organ-on-chip technology integrating tunable stiffness with a potential application to drug testing probes development where such cells are commonly used.
