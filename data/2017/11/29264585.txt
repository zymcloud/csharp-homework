Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) has gradually developed because of rapid hypertrophy of the future liver remnant volume (FLR) in spite of high morbidity. To minimize the patient's postoperative pain and morbidity including wound complication caused by two consecutive major abdominal operations, we adopted a totally laparoscopic approach and used a composite mesh graft. Also, to maximize the oncologic efficacy, we adopted the "anterior approach" technique. A 44-year-old woman with large hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in her right lobe was transferred to our hospital for surgical treatment. Preoperatively predicted FLR by a CT scan was 21% and type II portal vein anomaly was detected. A totally laparoscopic approach was planned. During the first stage operation, right anterior and posterior portal veins were meticulously dissected and tied. After parenchymal transection by the "anterior approach" technique, two glissonian pedicles of the right liver were individually isolated. A composite mesh graft was used to prevent severe adhesion on both liver partition surfaces. During the second-stage operation, 9 days after the first stage operation, the two isolated glissonian pedicles were initially transected. After full mobilization of the right lobe, the right hepatic vein was also transected. The right lobe was removed through the Pfannenstiel incision. She was discharged 7 days after the second stage operation. Her postoperative course was uneventful and there was no HCC recurrence for 15 months after hepatectomy. A totally laparoscopic ALPPS procedure can be a feasible technique that ensures patient safety and oncologic superiority, even in patients with complicated anatomical variation.
