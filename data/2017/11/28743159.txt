Background:Cancer survivors transfused with blood products before reliable screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at risk for infection. This study examined the impact of HCV on neurocognitive function and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among adult survivors of childhood cancer.Methods:Neurocognitive testing was conducted for 836 adult survivors of childhood cancer (mean age, 35 years [standard deviation, 7.4 years]; time since diagnosis, 29 years [standard deviation, 6.2 years]) who received blood products before universal HCV screening. No differences were observed between confirmed HCV-seropositive survivors (n = 79) and HCV-seronegative survivors (n = 757) in the primary diagnosis or neurotoxic therapies. Multivariate regression models were used to compare functional outcomes between seropositive and seronegative survivors.Results:Compared with seronegative survivors, seropositive survivors demonstrated lower performance on measures of attention (P < .001), processing speed (P = .008), long-term verbal memory (P = .01), and executive function (P = .001). After adjustments for sex, age at diagnosis, and treatment exposures, seropositive survivors had a higher prevalence of impairment in processing speed (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.6) and executive functioning (PR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6). Differences were not associated with the treatment of HCV or the presence of liver cirrhosis. Seropositive survivors reported worse general HRQOL (PR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), which was associated with the presence of liver cirrhosis (P = .001).Conclusions:Survivors of childhood cancer with a history of HCV infection are at risk for neurocognitive impairment and reduced HRQOL beyond the known risks associated with neurotoxic cancer therapies.
