We report a case of colorectal cancer with peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis that achieved R0 resection by preoperative chemotherapy and CRS plus HIPEC. A 33-year-old man presented with a complaint of abdominal bloating. After further examination, he was diagnosed with transverse colon cancer with peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis. After 9 courses of preoperative XELOX plus cetuximab and 4 courses of preoperative XELIRI plus bevacizumab, he underwent transverse colon resection, peritoneal resection, and HIPEC(MMC 20mg/4,000mL physiological saline, 40mins). There was little histological evidence of peritoneal dissemination around the region of the primary tumor. Moreover, no tumor cells were found in other peritoneal disseminations or in the liver metastasis. As a result, he was able to undergo curative resection. Colorectal cancer with peritoneal dissemination still has a poor prognosis, but combination therapy with chemotherapy and CRS plus HIPEC is expected to improve prognosis.
