An 81-year-old woman was followed up for hepatitis C from 1994. Sheh ad a previous history of hypertension and appendicitis. In October 2014, the patient underwent subsegmentectomy(S8)and cholecystectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)(T2N0M0, Stage II ). From December 2015, the patient had taken ledipasvir-sofosbuvir orally for hepatitis C virus (HCV). In January 2016, we confirmed HCV-RNA shade transformation. In September 2016, enhanced CT showed a mass in theright lower quadrant of her abdomen. Shehad a hard 3 cm mass in thesameplaceon physical exam. PET-CT showed no significant abnormality except for the mass in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen. Therefore, we identified the differential diagnosis as a lymph node metastasis of HCC, an abdominal wall primary tumor, or a malignant lymphoma. We resected theinguinal malignant lymphoma to confirm thediagnosis. Examination of tissuefrom theinguinal malignant lymphoma indicated diffuselargeB -cell lymphoma. We report an interesting case of an inguinal malignant lymphoma in a patient with chronic HCV who had experienced hepatectomy.
