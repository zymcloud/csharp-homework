Gallbladder carcinoma producing alpha-fetoprotein(AFP)is rare.We report a case of AFP producing carcinoma of the gallbladder with huge metastatic hepatic tumor.A 81-year-old female with a hepatitis B virus(HBV)had a fever and right hypochondralgia.Abdominal CT showed an enlarged gallbladder with gallbladder stones, a huge tumor in the right lobe of liver, and swelling paraaortic lymph nodes.Acute cholecystitis was treated by percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD).The hepatic tumor was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma for HBV carrier and the high level of AFP and PIVKA- II .We performed right lobectomy, cholecystectomy and the resection of paraaortic lymph nodes.In the resected gallbladder, the papillary tumor was detected.Histopathological diagnosis was moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder.The liver tumor and paraaortic lymph nodes were metastases of the gallbladder carcinoma.The both of gallbladder and liver tumor immunohistochemically stained positive to AFP.It was difficult to diagnose the hepatic tumor because of HBV carrier, the high level of AFP and the unnoticed gallbladder tumor.Gallbladder carcinoma with the high level of AFP might have relation to liver metastases.
