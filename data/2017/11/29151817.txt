Background:MicroRNAs are considered as potential regulators in various biological pathways and contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. MicroRNA-214-3p (miR-214-3p) was proved to be correlated with various cancers in recent studies. However, the biological functions of miR-214-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its association with the prognosis of HCC after liver transplantation are still unevaluated. Here we intended to elucidate the functional implication of miR-214-3p in regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis and its potential prediction of clinical prognosis of HCC patients.Methods:Expressions of miR-214-3p in 98 HCC patients and three HCC cell lines were detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to explore the association of miR-214-3p expression and clinicopathological characteristics. The effects of miR-214-3p on cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by proliferation and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The direct target gene of miR-214-3p was also detected by luciferase reporter assay.Results:The effects of miR-214-3p on cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by proliferation and flow cytometry assay, respectively. The direct target gene of miR-214-3p was also detected by luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that miR-214-3p expression was downregulated in primary HCC samples compared with normal liver tissues, and was decreased in HCC recurrence species compared with non-recurrence controls (P = 0.001). Low miR-214-3p level was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (Log rank P = 0.003) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (Log rank P = 0.007). Moreover, miR-214-3p precursor transfection resulted in decreased cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and enhanced cell apoptosis in HepG2 and HUH-7 cells. Further investigation showed that miR-214-3p could regulate its target gene maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) by directly binding to MELK-3'-UTR.Conclusions:miR-214-3p suppresses HCC progression by directly down-regulating MELK expression, indicating a potential therapeutic target for the treatment and prognosis of HCC patients.
