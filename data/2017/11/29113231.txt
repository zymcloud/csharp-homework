MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve an important role in tumorigenesis and development. Although a low expression of miR-125a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported, the clinical significance remains unknown. In the current study, the data of Gene Expression Omnibus datasets was analyzed and significantly low expression of miR-125a in HCC was verified. Furthermore, the expression and clinical significance of miR-125a was investigated in 27 normal liver and 98 HCC tissue samples using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results demonstrated that the level of miR-125a expression was lower in HCC biopsies compared with that in normal liver tissues. Survival analysis established that miR-125a expression was negatively associated with the prognosis of HCC. Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that patients with HCC with lowmiR-125a and Ki67-positive expression have shorter overall, and disease-free survival times. Altogether, the results of the current study provide the first evidence that reducedmiR-125a expression is associated with HCC progression and poor prognosis in patients, suggesting that miR-125a may have potential prognostic value as a tumor biomarker for patients with HCC.
