Background:In patients with lung metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it remains uncertain how a better survival outcome can be predicted after metastasectomy. This study aims to identify clinical factors that may be used to guide patient selection for such a therapeutic modality. A total of 28 patients who received pulmonary metastasectomy for HCC between 1993 and 2012 were identified. All relevant clinical factors were extracted from medical records up to September 2015. Patients were classified into high- and low-risk groups according to survival outcome after metastasectomy. All pertinent clinical factors were analyzed for correlation with survival outcome.Summary:The overall survival of 28 patients after pulmonary metastasectomy was studied first. The survival curve was biphasic and reached a plateau at 40 months after metastasectomy. The results indicate the presence of 2 groups of patients with a different survival outcome. Among all clinical parameters, remission status in the liver before pulmonary metastasectomy and distant metastasis-free interval between the last treatment of HCC and the occurrence of lung metastasis were found to be significantly associated with excellent survival outcome after pulmonary metastasectomy (p = 0.019 and 0.007 by Fisher exact test, and p = 0.002 and 0.0002 by Cox regression analysis).
