As one of main obstacles in the treatment and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), multidrug resistance (MDR) is usually associated with the overexpression of the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) which is responsible for reducing the intracellular concentration of chemotherapeutic agents. In current work, we discovered the novel role of miR-491-3p in ABCB1-mediated multidrug resistance in HCC and revealed the underlying mechanism in which miR-491-3p downregulated the expression of ABCB1 and its transcription factor Sp3 by directly targeting their 3'-UTR. Moreover, overexpressing ABCB1 or Sp3 reversed the sensitivity to chemotherapeutics in Hep3B cells induced by miR-491-3p, confirming miR-491-3p/Sp3/ABCB1 regulatory loop plays an important role in enhancing the drugs sensitivity of HCC. Meanwhile, the discovery of that the expression level of miR-491-3p was inversely correlated with that of ABCB1 and Sp3 in HCC cell lines and clinical samples pointed out the possibility of miR-491-3p in clinical use. In summary, our results reveal a pivotal role of miR-491-3p in the regulation of MDR in HCC, and suggest the potential application of miR-491-3p as a therapeutic strategy for modulating MDR in cancer cells.
