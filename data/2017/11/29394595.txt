Case 1: An 80-year-old man was diagnosed with cecal cancer plus multiple liver metastases and peritoneal disseminations. He underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor to prevent bowel obstruction. Initially, hepatic arterial infusion(HAI) plus cetuximab(Cmab)was administered to reduce the size of the metastatic tumors and prevent liver failure. A partial response(PR)was observed in the liver metastases after 12 courses of treatment and S-1 plus oxaliplatin(SOX)plus bevacizumab was started. Case 2: A 44-year-old man was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer with multiple liver, lung and bone metastases, and with obstructive jaundice and cholangitis due to severe liver hilum lymph node metastases. His performance status(PS)score was 3 because of severe liver damage. Initially, he underwent endoscopic nasobiliary drainage for obstructive jaundice, and HAI plus Cmab was started to prevent liver dysfunction and to control all metastases. A PR in the metastatic liver tumors was observed after 18 courses. His PS increased to 1 and he was treated with mFOLFOX6 plus Cmab. HAI plus Cmab might be a treatment option for patients who have RAS-wild type tumors with severe liver dysfunction due to multiple liver metastases; HAI is intended to have few side effects and has a high local control rate.
