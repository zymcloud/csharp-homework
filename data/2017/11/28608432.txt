Background and objectives:For tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava (IVC) complicated with kidney cancer, we built a surgical team to achieve (1) en bloc tumor resection; (2) xeno-pericardial patch IVC repair; and (3) minimum organ damages. We reviewed outcome of the case series to verify rationale of this approach.Methods:A consecutive series of 12 patients having the IVC tumor thrombus by renal cell carcinoma in the last 3 years was enrolled. Minimum kidney ischemia was induced in five cases (Procedure I), whereas liver and kidney ischemia was induced in five cases (Procedure II). Mild hypothermic extracorporeal circulation was used in two cases (Procedure III).Results:There was no mortality or severe morbidities related to the surgery. Postoperative recovery was most prompt by the Procedure I. Liver and kidney ischemic time was longer in the Procedure III than the Procedure II, whereas organ function was not substantially impaired in either series. The resected IVC margin was free from the cancer in all cases, while local recurrence was not seen in any cases.Conclusions:En bloc resection with xeno-pericardial patch repair of the IVC was successfully performed in the tumor thrombus complicated with kidney cancer with minimum organ damage.
