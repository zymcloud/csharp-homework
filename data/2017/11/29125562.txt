A new nortriterpenoid, 19(R)-hydroxyl-wuweizidilactone H (1), and a sesquiterpene, (6R)-β-chamigrenic acid (2), together with one known nortriterpenoid, wuweizidilactone H (3), and three known hepatoprotective lignans, micrantherin A (4), gomisin M₂ (5) and schizandrin (6) were isolated from the fruit of Schisandra chinensis. Their structures were elucidated by UV, IR, HRESIMS, NMR spectra and X-ray analysis. Among them, the absolute configuration of 2 was confirmed for the first time. In vitro assays, compounds 4-6 (10 μM) exhibited hepatoprotective activities (survival rate: 44%, 43% and 44%) against damage induced by N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP) in human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells.
