Background:Recent advances in technology and accumulation of surgical experience have expanded the indications for laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). However, compared to open liver resection (OLR), the feasibility of laparoscopic anatomical liver resection for centrally located tumor (CLT) has not been clearly established. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic anatomical major liver resection for CLT.Methods:From April 2011 to March 2016, 20 cases of anatomical LLR and 86 cases of OLR for CLTs such as central hepatectomy (CH) and right anterior sectionectomy (RAS) were performed at a single institution. We performed one-to-one propensity score matching and analyzed short-term outcomes between the LLR (n = 20) and OLR (n = 20) groups.Results:Among 20 cases in the LLR group, two cases underwent open conversion due to common bile duct injury and anatomical distortion, respectively. There were no statistically significant difference between the LLR and OLR groups regarding clamping time of the Pringle maneuver (p = 0.502), blood loss (p = 0.746), surgical margin (p = 0.198), or length of hospital stay (p = 0.110). However, surgical time was significantly longer in the LLR group than in the OLR group (388 vs 268 min; p Conclusion:Total anatomical LLR can be performed safely in selected CLT patients by experienced surgeons. Laparoscopic CH or RAS appears feasible with non-inferior perioperative outcomes compared to OLR.
