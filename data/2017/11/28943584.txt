A 35-year-old male patient who showed sustained virological response (SVR) following treatment for hepatitis C virus infection developed liver cancer. The lesion was identified by imaging studies, with atypical findings suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma. Partial hepatectomy was performed and the histopathological diagnosis was cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CLC). Only a few cases of CLC have been described in young patients who achieved SVR. Hepatologists should recognize the potential development of CLC even in young patients who achieve SVR, and the need for a close follow-up by imaging studies. In addition, true characteristics and cell origin of CLC were discussed in this report.
