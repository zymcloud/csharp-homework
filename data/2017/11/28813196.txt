Objective:The objective of our study was to evaluate the influence of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (OBC)-induced hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity detected on contrast-enhanced CT scans on response of liver metastasis. We chose to study hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity on the basis of the assumption that hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity may indicate the presence of chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS).Materials and methods:For this retrospective study, 104 patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (male-female ratio, 66:38; age range, 20-80 years) who had undergone OBC and serial CT studies were consecutively registered. Two blinded imagers independently scored CT images using a 5-point scale to determine the severity of newly developed hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity after OBC. Subsequently, two radiologists evaluated tumor response to OBC using a 4-point ordinal scale. We performed generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis using cumulative logits to account for the effect of hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity severity on the cumulative tumor response probability.Results:The interobserver agreements for the severity of hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity were excellent (Îº = 0.825). GEE analyses showed that the severity of post-OBC hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity, number of chemotherapy sessions, and presence of other organ metastases were significant predictors of tumor response; these three factors also showed significance in the final GEE model (p < 0.0001 for severity of hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity for both readers; p = 0.011 and 0.010 for the number of chemotherapy sessions for readers 1 and 2; p = 0.046 and 0.012 for the presence of other organ metastases for readers 1 and 2).Conclusion:Hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity detected on contrast-enhanced CT of patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer who have undergone OBC may indicate the presence of SOS, and the more severe the SOS, the worse the tumor response of hepatic metastasis to oxaliplatin is expected to be.
