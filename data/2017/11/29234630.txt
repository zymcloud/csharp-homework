Background:Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an advanced technique of external beam radiation therapy that delivers large ablative doses of radiation. In the past decade, many cancer centers have adopted SBRT as one mode of radically treating small-sized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), based on encouraging clinical outcomes. SBRT thus seems reasonable as first-line treatment of inoperable HCC confined to the liver. However, most of the clinical studies to date have been retrospective in nature, with key issues still under investigation.Summary:The above-mentioned publications were subjected to scrutiny, fueling discussions at the 7th Asia-Pacific Primary Liver Cancer Expert (APPLE 2016) Meeting on various clinical variables, such as indications for SBRT, therapeutic outcomes, treatment-related toxicities, doses prescribed, and specific techniques. The consensus reached should be of interest to all professionals active in the treatment of HCC, especially radiation oncologists.Key messages:SBRT is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with small-sized HCC, offering substantial local control, improved overall survival, and low toxicity.
