Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a natural active component from licorice, which is broadly used in traditional Chinese medicine. Lots of glycyrrhetinic acid receptors (GA-R) are proved to locate on the surface of liver cells. Many reports about the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment were dependent on GA modified carriers. However, the reality of GA-R in HCC cells was not clear. In this paper, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA) was labeled with fluorescence (FITC) by chemical synthesis. Together with the binding effect of fluorescence labeled glycyrrhetinic acid (FITC-GA), the competitive action of 18β-GA with GA-R was investigated in HCC cells. The results showed that in HepG2 cells, 18β-GA and FITC-GA presented similar cytotoxicity. The specific binding saturation of GA showed the dissociation constant (Kd) was 7.457±2.122pmol/L and the maximum binding counts (Bmax) was 2.385±0.175pmol/2.5×106 cells, respectively. FITC-GA bound to cytomembrane specifically and 18β-GA competed to bind the sites significantly in HepG2 cells. Therefore, there is binding effect between fluorescence labeled GA and GA-R. The GA-R on HCC cells is confirmed as expected, which provides a useful reference of active target modified by GA and a novel approach for receptors and ligands study.
