Lymph node metastasis has a poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). We report a case of HCC with lymph node metastasis successfully treated by multidisciplinary treatment. An 81-year-old woman who was followed up for liver cirrhosis received a diagnosis of HCC, which was detected by CT as a solitary tumor 20mm in diameter in the couinaud segment 7 of the liver. She underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE)twice for HCC because of her advanced age and no intention to undergo hepatectomy. Some 12 months later, local recurrence was managed by repeat TACE and paraaortic lymph node metastasis by surgical resection. The patient received radiotherapy for mediastinal nodal disease 6 months after the resection. She remains alive and well without no evidence of disease 84 months after the initial treatment. This case and a review of the literature suggest that multidisciplinary treatment with TACE, surgical resection and radiotherapy may provide a survival benefit for selected patients with HCC with isolated lymph node metastasis.
