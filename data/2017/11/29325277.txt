Objective: To investigate the effect of Fuzheng Huayu capsules on the survival rate of patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of the patients with various types of liver cirrhosis who were hospitalized in Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008. The data collected for these patients included their basic information, diagnosis and treatment, and results of laboratory examination. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the effect of Fuzheng Huayu capsules on the survival rate of patients with liver cancer. The starting point of observation was the first day of the patient's admission and the ending point of follow-up observation was the date of death or the end of follow-up April 1, 2014. The cut-off value was obtained if the patient did not experience any outcome event (death) at the end of follow-up. With reference to the outcome, the time when the outcome occurred, and the cut-off value, the life-table method was used to calculate survival rates and survival curves were plotted. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to calculate the arithmetic mean of survival time and median survival time, and the log-rank test was used to compare the survival data. Results: A total of 430 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled, among whom 191 died and 239 survived or were censored. The average constituent ratio of death was 55.6% and the average constituent ratio of survival was 44.4%. The life-table method showed that the half-, 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 70%, 64%, 58%, and 48%, respectively. The median survival time was 112.1 weeks for the patients who did not take Fuzheng Huayu capsules and 351.6 weeks for those who did, and there was a significant difference in survival rate between the two groups (P = 0.000). Among 313 patients who had an etiology of hepatitis B, 164 did not take Fuzheng Huayu capsules and had a median survival time of 195.9 weeks and a 5-year survival rate of 44%, and 149 took Fuzheng Huayu capsules and had a median survival time of 336.9 weeks and a 5-year survival rate of 59%; there was a significant difference in survival rate between the two groups (P = 0.038). Among 117 patients who did not have hepatitis B, 68 did not take Fuzheng Huayu capsules and had a median survival time of 78.1 weeks and a 5-year survival rate of 32%, and 49 took Fuzheng Huayu capsules and had a median survival time of 277.4 weeks and a 5-year survival rate of 53%; there was a significant difference in survival rate between the two groups (P = 0.013). Among 92 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis, 47 did not take Fuzheng Huayu capsules and had a 5-year survival rate of 65%, and 45 took Fuzheng Huayu capsules and had a 5-year survival rate of 82%; both groups of patients had a median survival of 440 weeks; there was a significant difference in survival rate between the two groups (P = 0.027). Among 338 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, 185 did not take Fuzheng Huayu capsules and had a median survival time of 60.3 weeks and a 5-year survival rate of 33%, and 153 took Fuzheng Huayu capsules and had a median survival time of 267.7 weeks and a 5-year survival rate of 51%; there was a significant difference in survival rate between the two groups (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Fuzheng Huayu capsules can improve the prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis and increase their survival rates and have good long-term efficacy.
