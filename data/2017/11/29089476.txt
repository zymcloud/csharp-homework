BACKGROUND Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV X protein (HBx) plays a crucial role in the development of HCC. Moreover, many tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins exert diverse biological functions in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, as a novel member of this family, the specific effect of TRIM52 is still largely obscure. In the present study, we investigated the expression and function of TRIM52 in HBV-associated HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) was performed to detect the HBV DNA levels in the peripheral blood of HCC patients. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression of TRIM52, HBx, and NF-κB p65. HBx-pcDNA3.1 and TRIM52-shRNA were used to induce HBx ectopic expression and TRIM52 silencing, respectively. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) was used to block the activation of NF-κB. Cell proliferation was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. RESULTS TRIM52 expression was up-regulated together with HBx in HBV-associated HCC tissues. Ectopic expression of HBx elevated TRIM52 expression in HepG2 cells. TRIM52 silencing repressed the proliferation of HepG2.2.15 cells. Moreover, NF-κB p65 expression was increased in HCC cell lines. Blocking NF-κB activation with PDTC suppressed TRIM52 expression and attenuated the viability of HepG2.2.15 cells. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that TRIM52 can promote cell proliferation and HBx may regulate TRIM52 expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway in HBV-associated HCC.
