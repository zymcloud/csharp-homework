β-mangostin is a dietary xanthone that has been reported to have the anticancer properties in some human cancer cell types. However, the antimetastatic effect and molecular mechanism of β-mangostin action in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remain unknown. In this study, we found that β-mangostin did not induce cytotoxicity in human HCC cells (SK-Hep-1, Huh-7 and HA22T/VGH cells). β-mangostin could inhibit migration and invasion of human HCC cells. Meanwhile, β-mangostin significantly decreased the protein activities and expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 via increasing the activation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, MEK4 and JNK1/2 signaling pathways. Furthermore, using specific inhibitor for ERK1/2 (PD98059) and JNK1/2 (JNKII) significantly restored the expression of MMP-2/-9 and invasion by β-mangostin treatment in Huh-7 cells. In addition, β-mangostin effectively restored the protein levels and transcription activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in siERK or siJNK-transfected Huh-7 cells, concomitantly with promotion on cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these findings are the first to demonstrate the antimetastatic activity of β-mangostin against human HCC cells, which may act as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC.
