Aim:The aim of this study is to explain effect and mechanism of Sophoridine to suppress Hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and vivo.Methods:In vitro experiment, the HepG2 cells were divided into 5 groups: 0μg/mL Sophoridine treated group (0 μg/mL group); 10μg/mL matrine treated group (10μg/mL group); 20μg/mL matrine treated group (20μg/mL group) and 10μg/mL Paclitaxel treated group (Positive drug group). Measuring the cell proliferation of difference groups by MTS assay; evaluating cell apoptosis of difference by flow cytometry; the cell invasion and migration abilities of difference HepG2 cells were measured by transwell and wound healing testing; measuring the relative proteins expression in difference groups. In vovo experiment, the nude mice were divided into 5 groups: 0μg/mL, 5μg/mL, 10μg/mL, 20μg/mL and Positive drug groups, after executing, taking the tumor tissue from nude mice of difference groups, measuring the tumor volume and weight; evaluating the PTEN protein expression in tumor tissue by Immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results:In the cell experiments, Compared with 0μg/mL group, cell proliferation rates were significantly reduced, cell aopotosis were significantly increased and invasion and wound healing abilities were significantly decreased in marine treated groups with dose-dependent (PConclusion:Sophoridine had anti-cance effects to suppress HepG2 activities by regulation PTEN/PI3K/AKT, Caspase-3/-9 and MMP-2/-9 signaling pathway.
