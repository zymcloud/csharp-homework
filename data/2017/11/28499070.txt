It is unclear whether the achievement of virologic response modifies the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differently in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Our aim was to compare the risk of HCC between patients with CHB and CHC who achieved virological response. We analysed data from patients with CHB treated with entecavir (n=2000) or CHC treated with peg-interferon and ribavirin (n=733) at a tertiary hospital from 2004 to 2011. Virological response was defined as serum HBV DNA.99). In conclusion, patients with CHB treated with entecavir were associated with a higher risk of HCC compared to patients with CHC treated with peg-interferon and ribavirin after achieving virological response. However, the risk of HCC did not differ between the two cohorts if the patients had cirrhosis at baseline, even if virological response was achieved.
