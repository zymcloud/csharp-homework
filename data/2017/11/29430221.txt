Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is frequently associated with various extrahepatic manifestations, such as autoimmune features and immune complex deposit diseases. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is one such extrahepatic manifestation of HCV infection. Recently, direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have proved to be highly effective and safe for the eradication of HCV. Herein, we report a case of OLP accompanied by HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that disappeared after liver transplantation and achievement of sustained virological response following interferon (IFN)-free treatment with ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF). The 50-year-old patient developed erosive OLP during IFN therapy, with hyperthyroidism at 53 years of age and HCC at 55 years. He received immunosuppressive drugs and IFN-free DAA treatment after liver transplantation at 60 years of age, which led to disappearance of the symptoms of OLP. The patient was treated safely and effectively with LDV/SOF, although it is not known whether the disappearance of OLP resulted from the eradication of HCV or the immunosuppressive therapy.
