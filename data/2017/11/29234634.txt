Introduction:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a leading cause for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Sri Lanka. Diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, and liver inflammation are known to increase the risk of HCC. The present study evaluates serum ferritin levels in a cohort of patients with non-viral HCC (nvHCC).Methodology:Consecutive patients with nvHCC presenting to the Colombo North Liver transplant Service, Ragama, from January 2012 to July 2013 were investigated. All were negative for hepatitis B and C. At registration, 5 mL of serum was separated into plain tubes, stored at -80°C and analysed for ferritin using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlation between the serum ferritin and patient risk factors, liver status, and tumour characteristics were analysed.Results:There were 93 patients with nvHCC (median age 65 [12-82] years; 82 [88.2%] males). The median ferritin level was 246.2 μg/L, and 38 (40.86%) patients had elevated ferritin. Non-diabetics (median 363.5 mg/L, p = 0.003) and alcohol abusers (median 261.2 mg/L, p = 0.018) had higher ferritin levels. On multiple-variable analysis, being non-diabetic (p = 0.013) and alcoholic (p = 0.046) was significantly associated with high serum ferritin. No association was found with body mass index, tumour stage, size, macrovascular invasion, number of nodules, alpha-fetoprotein, bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and survival.Conclusion:In patients with nvHCC, serum ferritin levels are higher in non-diabetics and alcoholics.
