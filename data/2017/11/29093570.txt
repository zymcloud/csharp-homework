Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and experiences postoperative relapse extremely easy, which is the major cause of the high mortality rate. The Notch signaling pathway is expected to become a new target for the biological treatment of HCC. We searched databases for studies that evaluated the expression of Notch receptors and/or ligands in human HCC tissue. The search yielded 15 studies that enrolled 1643 patients. Compared with non-HCC tissues, Notch 1 was associated with a higher expression level (odds risk 1.59, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 7.45), as well as Notch 3 (2.63, 0.69 to 10.02), Notch 4 (1.33, 0.74 to 2.38) and Jagged 1 (1.47, 0.23 to 9.53); however, Notch 2 showed the opposite result (0.60, 0.30 to 1.20). Larger tumor size (>5 cm), metastasis positive, and micro vascular invasion positive were features that were associated with over-expression in Notch 1 according to the clinicopathological features. The expression levels of Notch 1, 3, 4 and Jagged 1 were associated with higher expression in HCC tissues, while Notch 2 had the opposite result. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017055782).
