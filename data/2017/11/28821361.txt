Background:The oncological impact of surgical complications has been studied in visceral and pancreatic cancer.Aim:To investigate the impact of complications on tumour recurrence after resections for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.Methods:We have retrospectively analysed 105 consecutive resections performed at the Royal Free London Hospital from 1998 to 2014, and studied the long-term outcome of nil-minor (<3) versus major (≥3) Clavien-Dindo complications (CD) on disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:The series accounted for 41 (39%) pancreaticoduodenectomies, two (1.9%) central, 48 (45.7%) distal pancreatectomies, eight (7.6%) enucleations, four (3.8%) total pancreatectomies. Sixteen (15.2%) were extended to adjacent organs, 13 (12.3%) to minor liver resections. Postoperative complications presented in 43 (40.1%) patients; CD grade 1 or 2 in 23 (21.9%), grades ≥3 in 20 (19%). Among 25 (23.8%) pancreatic fistulas, 14 (13.3%) were grades B or C. Thirty-four (32.4%) patients developed exocrine, and 31 (29.5%) endocrine insufficiency. Seven patients died during a median 27 (0-175) months follow up. Thirty-day mortality was 0.9%. OS was 94.1% at 5 years. Thirty tumours recurred within 11.7 (0.8-141.5) months. DFS was 44% at 5 years. At univariate analysis, high-grade complications were not associated with shorter DFS (p = 0.744). At multivariate analysis, no parameter was independent predictor for DFS or OS. The comparison of nil-minor versus major complications showed no DFS difference (p = 0.253).Conclusion:From our series, major complications after P-NETs resection are not associated to different disease recurrence; hence do not require different follow up or adjuvant regimens.
