Background:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased over the past decades in China. Current screening methods of HCC such as detection of α-fetoprotein (AFP) combined with liver ultrasonography remain unsatisfactory. Many HCC patients have already missed the optimal treatment period when diagnosed. Our study aimed to evaluate the value of Glypican 3 (GPC3) and Golgi protein 73 (GP73) in the detection of HCC.Methods:Thirty-nine patients with HCC and 31 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled. The level of serum GPC3 and GP73 were determined by ELISA. The expression of GPC3 mRNA and GP73 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and liver tissues were also measured with qRT-PCR. Then, receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to detect the sensitivity and specificity of serum GPC3 and GP73 in the diagnosis of HCC.Results:The levels of serum GPC3 and GP73 in the HCC group were significantly higher than in the cirrhosis group (p 9.3 μg/L and GP73 > 77.68 ng/mL had a risk of HCC of 92.31%. The HCC diagnosis ROC curve analysis indicated that when setting the GPC3 cutoff value > 9.3 μg/L, AUC = 0.956. The sensitivity and specificity of GPC3 were 89.74% and 96.77%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 97.2%, negative predictive value of 88.2%, + LR of 27.82 and - LR of 0.11. When setting GP73 cutoff value > 77.68 ng/mL, AUC = 0.937. The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 were 92.31% and 83.87%, respectively, with positive predictive value of 87.8%, negative predictive value of 89.7%, + LR of 5.72 and - LR of 0.092. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was found between GPC3 and GP73 AUC in ROC curves, indicating that these two biomarkers were equivalent in the prediction of HCC.Conclusions:The expression of serum GPC3 and GP73 was significantly higher in the HCC patients compared with the cirrhosis patients. GPC3 and GP73 might be effective non-invasive diagnostic indicators of HCC.
