Objective To establish a hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model in nude mice which could stably express gene and be monitored dynamically. Methods We first constructed the lentiviral particles containing luciferase (Luc) and near-infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP) and puromycin resistance gene, and then transduced them into the HepG2 hepatoma cells. The cell line stably expressing Luc and iRFP genes were screened and inoculated into nude mice to establish xenograft tumor model. Tumor growth was monitored using in vivo imaging system. HE staining and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the pathological features and tumorigenic ability. Results HepG2 cells stably expressing iRFP and Luc were obtained; with the engineered cell line, xenograft model was successfully established with the features of proper tumor developing time and high rate of tumor formation as well as typical pathological features as showed by HE staining and immunohistochemistry. Conclusion Hepatocellular carcinoma model in nude mice with the features of stable gene expression and dynamical monitoring has been established successfully with the HepG2-iRFP-Luc cell line.
