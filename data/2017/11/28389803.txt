Background:Liver re-resection plays a paramount role in treatment of patients with posthepatectomy hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. Laparoscopic liver resection has been a feasible alternative to open surgery. However, whether laparoscopic liver re-resection for posthepatectomy HCC recurrence is better than open liver re-resection remains unknown.Method:From January 2008 to December 2015, 30 patients with recurrent HCC after prior liver resection underwent laparoscopic liver re-resection in our center. To minimize any confounding factors, a propensity score matching study using a patient ratio of 1:1 was conducted to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of patients who underwent laparoscopic or open liver re-resection.Result:With the open surgery group compared laparoscopic group, operative time was 207.50 versus 200.5 min (p = 0.903), blood loss was 400 versus 100 ml (p = 0.000196), blood transfusion rate was 43.3 versus 0.0% (p = 0.000046), complication rates were 30.0 versus 6.7% (p = 0.01), and hospital stay was 13.5 versus 9.5 days (p = 0.000008). The median follow-up was 35 months. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year disease-free survival rates were 79.0, 51.0, and 31.9%, versus 78.3, 57.4, and 43.0%, respectively (p = 0.474). The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year overall survival rates were 89.4, 75, and 67.5%, versus 96.7, 85.0, and 74.4%, respectively (p = 0.413).Conclusion:Laparoscopic liver re-resection for patients with posthepatectomy HCC recurrence provided comparable perioperative and oncological outcomes as open liver re-resection and can be a safe alternative to open procedure.
