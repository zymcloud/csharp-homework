Background:Splenosis is a benign and relatively uncommon condition caused by trauma or splenectomy or other procedures involving splenic tissue. It is usually asymptomatic, and often diagnosed accidentally, especially misdiagnosed as malignant tumor.Methods:A 54-year-old man with prior history of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and underwent splenectomy for traumatic splenic rupture following a traffic accident 23 years previously was admitted to our hospital and found a hepatic mass in the right upper quadrant during an imaging examination. The diagnosis of his was not clear and finally he agreed to receive a surgical treatment.Results:During the operation, we found a mass in the right posterior lobe of the liver and a hard nodule on the right side of the diaphragm, both were completely resected, and postoperative histopathologic examination revealed that all excised tissues were proved to have histological structure typical for the spleen.Conclusions:The occurrence of intrahepatic splenosis is rare with only few cases previously reported in the literature. It is a benign disease and sometimes difficult to distinguish from diseases of the liver. The need for positive surgical resection of splenosis is still controversial.
