Backgrounds/aims:Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1) acts as a tumor suppressor and is silenced by promoter methylation in various malignancies. The relationship between the CDO1 methylation status and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis was evaluated.Methods:Using a HCC cell line (SNU423), an in vitro demethylation study was performed to confirm whether promoter methylation causes CDO1 down-regulation. The SNU423 cells transfected with the CDO1 cell function was compared to that of na√Øve cells. An in vivo study using immunohistochemical staining of HCC specimens that were collected from patients who underwent curative liver resection was also performed.Results:CDO1 was activated after demethylation treatment in the HCC specimens. Moreover, tumor cell proliferation, colony-forming, migration, and invasion activities significantly decreased after CDO1 transfection (p<0.05). The percentage of tumors that were larger than 5 cm was higher in patients who had a lower expression of CDO1 (p=0.030). Vascular invasion and histological grade were independent prognostic factors for poor overall and recurrence-free survival. The degree of CDO1 expression was not an independent prognostic factor in this study's population.Conclusions:These results suggested that methylation down-regulated CDO1 expression in the HCC cells. CDO1 methylation may be a potentially valuable diagnostic biomarker for HCC.
