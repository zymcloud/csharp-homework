Background:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasing cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. NAFLD-HCC often occurs in noncirrhotic liver raising important surveillance issues.Aim:To determine the temporal trends for prevalence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of NAFLD-HCC in patients undergoing liver resection.Methods:Consecutive patients with histologically confirmed HCC who underwent liver resection over a 20-year period (1995-2014). NAFLD was diagnosed based on past or present exposure to obesity or diabetes without other causes of chronic liver disease.Results:A total of 323 HCC patients were included, 12% with NAFLD. From 1995-1999 to 2010-2014, the prevalence of NAFLD-HCC increased from 2.6% to 19.5%, respectively, P = .003, and followed the temporal trends in the prevalence of metabolic risk factors (28% vs 52%, P = .017), while hepatitis C-HCC decreased (from 43.6% to 19.5%, P = .003). NAFLD-HCC occurred more frequently in the absence of bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis (63% of cases, P Conclusion:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease increased substantially over the past 20 years among resectable HCCs. It is now the leading cause of HCC occuring without/or with only minimal fibrosis. NAFLD patients are older, with larger tumours while survival and recurrence rates are as severe as in other aetiologies.
