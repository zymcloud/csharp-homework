Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a non-cytopathic virus that causes acute and chronic inflammatory liver diseases, often leading to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although many studies for the roles of HBV on pathogenesis of the liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatic inflammation, cirrhosis, and HCC, have been reported, the mechanisms are not fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria have the protective mechanisms to restore their damaged function by intrinsic or extrinsic stresses, but their chronic dysfunctions are associated with the pathogenesis of the various diseases. Furthermore, HBV can affect intra- or extracellular homeostasis through induction of ER and mitochondrial dysfunctions, leading to liver injury. Therefore, the mechanism by which HBV induces ER or mitochondrial stresses may be a therapeutic target for treatment of liver diseases.
