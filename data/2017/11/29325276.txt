Objective: To investigate the effect of antiviral therapy on the progression of liver cirrhosis and related predictive factors through a retrospective analysis of patients with compensated hepatitis C cirrhosis. Methods: The patients with compensated hepatitis C cirrhosis who were treated in our hospital from 2004 to 2015 were divided into sustained virologic response (SVR) group, non-SVR (NSVR) group, and untreated group. The baseline features of patients with or without liver cirrhosis were compared to identify the predictive factors for the progression of liver cirrhosis. The changes in platelet count, spleen sizes, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Child-Turotte-Pugh (CTP) score were analyzed, and the incidence rate of liver cancer was compared between groups. A one-way analysis of variance, the Kruskal-wallis H test, the two-independent-sample t test, the chi-square test, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis based on data type. Results: A total of 89 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis were enrolled, among whom 42 received the antiviral treatment with interferon and ribavirin (30 were treated with pegylated interferon-α and 12 were treated with ordinary interferon) and 47 did not receive any antiviral therapy. Among the patients who received the antiviral treatment with interferon and ribavirin, 20 achieved SVR and 22 did not achieve SVR. Compared with baseline values, platelet count in the SVR group and the NSVR group was increased by (44.93 ± 32.66)×10(9)/L and (9.73 ± 28.83)×10(9)/L, respectively, and platelet count in the untreated group was reduced by (19.76 ± 54.5)×10(9)/L; the three groups had a significant change in platelet count (F = 14.731, P < 0.001). Spleen size was reduced by 0.91 ± 1.09 cm in the SVR group and increased by 0.20±0.84 cm and 1.11 ± 1.69 cm in the NSVR group and the untreated group, respectively; the three groups had a significant change in spleen size (F = 14.943, P < 0.001). The three groups had no significant changes in MELD, SOFA, and CTP scores (P > 0.05). One patient (5.00%) in the SVR group, 5 (22.73%) in the NSVR group, and 6 (12.77%) in the untreated group progressed to liver cancer (χ (2) = 13.787, P = 0.001). The univariate analysis showed that SVR, HCV RNA, total bilirubin, and albumin were predictive factors for disease progression, and the multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that SVR and total bilirubin were predictive factors for disease progression. Conclusion: Interferon combined with ribavirin has a marked clinical effect in the treatment of compensated hepatitis C cirrhosis with good short- and long-term efficacy.
