Background and aim:Because of the rarity of invasive treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients on hemodialysis (HD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the risks associated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in such patients remain uncertain. We used a nationwide database to investigate in-hospital mortality and hemorrhagic complications following RFA in patients on HD for ESRD.Methods:Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, we enrolled patients on HD for ESRD who underwent RFA for HCC. For each patient, we randomly selected up to four non-dialyzed patients using a matched-pair sampling method based on patient age, sex, treatment hospital, and treatment year. In-hospital mortality and hemorrhagic complications were compared between dialyzed and non-dialyzed patients following RFA.Results:We compared matched-pair samples of 437 dialyzed and 1345 non-dialyzed patients. In patients on HD for ESRD, mortality was significantly lower in those aged â‰¤70 years than in older patients (P = 0.02). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in dialyzed ESRD patients than in non-dialyzed patients (1.1% vs 0.15%, respectively; odds ratio = 7.77, P Conclusions:In-hospital mortality following RFA was higher in dialyzed ESRD patients than in non-dialyzed patients. The indications for RFA in dialysis-dependent patients should be considered carefully. Patient age may be a useful indicator when considering RFA for HCC in patients on HD for ESRD.
