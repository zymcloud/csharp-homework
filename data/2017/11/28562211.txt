Purpose To construct a nomogram with the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade to assess the long-term outcomes of patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was waived. We studied 622 treatment-naïve patients with HCC according to the Milan criteria who subsequently underwent RFA from 2002 to 2013. Baseline characteristics were collected to identify the risk factors for determination of poor overall survival after RFA. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model based on significant prognostic factors of overall survival was used to construct the nomogram. Results After a median follow-up time of 35.7 months, 190 patients had died. The cumulative 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 63.1% and 48.7%, respectively. Stratified according to ALBI grade, the cumulative 5- and 10-year survival rates were 80.0% and 67.9% for patients with grade 1, respectively, and 48.6% and 35.1% for those with grades 2-3, respectively (P © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
