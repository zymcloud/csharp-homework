Purpose:To compare effectiveness of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with microwave ablation (MWA; TACE-MWA) with TACE alone for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors ≤5 cm.Materials and methods:We reviewed data of 244 patients treated for HCC by TACE-MWA or TACE from June 2014 to December 2015. Median follow-up period was 505 days (TACE-MWA group: 485 days; TACE group: 542 days). Patients were propensity score matched (1:2 ratio); outcomes of TACE-MWA and TACE groups were compared. Primary endpoints were tumor responses, including tumor necrosis rates after initial treatment, tumor responses at 6 months [per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)], and time to tumor progression (TTP). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and re-intervention times.Results:After initial treatments, tumor necrosis rates were higher in the TACE-MWA group (n = 48; 92.1% [58/63]) than the TACE group (n = 96; 46.3% [56/121]; P Conclusions:Compared with TACE, TACE-MWA leads to better responses for HCC tumors ≤5 cm.
