Irisin is a newly identified myokine that may be cancer-associated, and its impact on liver cancer is unclear. To understand the roles of irisin in liver cancer, we investigated its effect in HepG2 and SMCC7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and the underlying mechanisms. We determined irisin levels in liver tissues and serum samples obtained from patients by using real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Irisin levels in cancerous livers were significantly upregulated compared with those in control livers, but serum irisin levels remained unchanged. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of different concentrations of human recombinant modified and active (glycosylated) irisin (IM) or human recombinant nonmodified irisin (INM) on cell migration, proliferation, viability, and invasiveness. CCK8, transwell, and scratching assays demonstrated that irisin significantly increased cell proliferation, invasion, and migration through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Irisin-induced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were blocked by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). Irisin also decreased the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in HepG2 cells. These data indicate that increased irisin levels may have protective roles in liver cancer cells through partial activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which may facilitate liver cancer progression and decrease the sensitivity to chemotherapy.
