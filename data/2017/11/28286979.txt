Background Computed tomography (CT) is used routinely for the preoperative detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) metastases. When small indeterminate focal liver lesions are detected that are too small to characterize (TSTC) on CT, additional imaging is usually needed, resulting in a potential delay in obtaining a complete diagnostic work-up. Purpose To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound (US) of the liver performed in direct conjunction to CT in the preoperative investigation among patients with newly diagnosed CRC when indeterminate liver lesions were found on CT. Material and Methods Preoperative investigations with CT and consecutive US where CT had shown at least one focal liver lesion in 74 patients diagnosed with CRC between June 2009 and February 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Either histopathological findings or a combination of imaging and clinical follow-up one to three years after surgery was used as the reference. Results Liver metastases were diagnosed with CT/US in 13 out of 74 patients (17.6%). In one patient, a liver cyst was preoperatively regarded as liver metastasis by a combined CT/US. The sensitivity and specificity for the CT with consecutive US procedure was 100% (13/13) and 98.4% (60/61). Conclusion US performed in conjunction with CT in patients with indeterminate focal liver lesions on CT is an accurate work-up for detection of liver metastases in patients with newly diagnosed CRC. Although our results are promising, they cannot be considered safely generalizable to all hospitals.
