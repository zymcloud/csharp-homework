Purpose:MET exon 14 deletion (METex14 del) mutations represent a novel class of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) driver mutations. We evaluated glesatinib, a spectrum-selective MET inhibitor exhibiting a type II binding mode, in METex14 del-positive nonclinical models and NSCLC patients and assessed its ability to overcome resistance to type I MET inhibitors.Experimental Design: As most MET inhibitors in clinical development bind the active site with a type I binding mode, we investigated mechanisms of acquired resistance to each MET inhibitor class utilizing in vitro and in vivo models and in glesatinib clinical trials.Results: Glesatinib inhibited MET signaling, demonstrated marked regression of METex14 del-driven patient-derived xenografts, and demonstrated a durable RECIST partial response in a METex14 del mutation-positive patient enrolled on a glesatinib clinical trial. Prolonged treatment of nonclinical models with selected MET inhibitors resulted in differences in resistance kinetics and mutations within the MET activation loop (i.e., D1228N, Y1230C/H) that conferred resistance to type I MET inhibitors, but remained sensitive to glesatinib. In vivo models exhibiting METex14 del/A-loop double mutations and resistance to type I inhibitors exhibited a marked response to glesatinib. Finally, a METex14 del mutation-positive NSCLC patient who responded to crizotinib but later relapsed, demonstrated a mixed response to glesatinib including reduction in size of a MET Y1230H mutation-positive liver metastasis and concurrent loss of detection of this mutation in plasma DNA.Conclusions: Together, these data demonstrate that glesatinib exhibits a distinct mechanism of target inhibition and can overcome resistance to type I MET inhibitors.
