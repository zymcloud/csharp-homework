Besides liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with many extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs). HCV exhibits lymphotropism that is responsible for various EHM. An important characteristic of HCV is escape from the immune system, which enables it to produce chronic infections and autoimmune disorders along with accumulation of circulating immune complexes. These EHMs have large spectrum, because they affect many organs such as heart, lungs, kidney, brain, thyroid, and skin. HCV-related cardiac and pulmonary manifestations include myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, cardiovascular diseases (i.e., Stroke, ischemic heart disease), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and interstitial lung diseases. This review discusses etiology and pathogenesis of HCV-associated cardiac and pulmonary manifestations and how different genes, immune system, indirectly linked factors (mixed cryoglobulinemia), liver cirrhosis, and antiviral treatment are involved in HCV-related heart and lung diseases, however, their exact mechanism is not clear.
