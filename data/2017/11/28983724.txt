Background/aim:Assessment of liver function is essential for management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade has been reported as a useful tool for assessing hepatic reserve in patients with HCC. The objective of this study was to determine whether ALBI grade could be used to predict the overall survival of very early-stage HCC patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RF ablation).Methods:A cohort of 368 patients with very early-stage HCC treated with RF ablation was retrospectively analyzed. The overall survival and recurrence-free survival were calculated in groups classified by ALBI grade and Child-Pugh score.Results:Overall survival of patients with ALBI grade 1 was better than that of patients with ALBI grade 2 (5-year survival rate 88.5 vs. 73.8%, P Conclusions:Among patients with very early-stage HCC treated with RF ablation, ALBI grade was a good stratifying biomarker. ALBI grade was better tool for assessing liver function than Child-Pugh score for very early-stage HCC treated with RF ablation.
