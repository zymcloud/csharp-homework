Orthotopic liver transplantation is the best option for patients with carefully selected unresectable disease because of underlying liver dysfunction. The 5-year survival rate after orthotopic liver transplantation for early detected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high, and a similar or even higher rate is reported in those with radiologically undetected HCC. This study evaluated and compared the histologic features of pretransplant radiologically undetected (14 patients, 25 tumors) versus detected (36 patients, 45 tumors) HCCs. Tumor size, tumor differentiation, number of unpaired arteries, mitotic count per 10 high-power fields, CD34 immunostain to assess microvessel density, and Ki67 immunostain were compared with the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System score, which was retrospectively assigned to each tumor in both groups. The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System score was significantly higher in the HCC detected group (P
