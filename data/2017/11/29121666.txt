SOX9 has been previously shown to be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other types of cancer. However, prognostic studies so far involved rather small cohorts or lack external validation and experimental data. In this study, we firstly determined the histological expression pattern of SOX9 in human HCC by immunohistochemistry (n = 84) and evaluated its prognostic value. External cohorts of publicly available datasets were used to validate its prognostic relevance in HCC (n = 359) and other types of cancer including breast (n = 3951), ovarian (n = 1306), lung (n = 1926) and gastric cancer (n = 876). Functional SOX9 knock-down studies using siRNA and cancer stem cell models were generated in a panel of liver and breast cancer cell lines. High level of SOX9 was associated with poor survival even after adjustment for other prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (HR = 2.103, 95%CI = 1.064 to 4.156, p = 0.021). SOX9 prevailed a poor prognostic factor in all cancer validation cohorts (p
