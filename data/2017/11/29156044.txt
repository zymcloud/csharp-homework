Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation becomes a challenging issue with increasing use of immunosuppressive agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy for varied medical conditions, including cancer. The spectrum of HBV reactivation in the setting of immunosuppression may vary from asymptomatic reactivation to liver failure leading to death. HBV reactivation can hamper the course of planned therapies and diminish the effects of therapies; thus, it adversely affects the prognosis of the original disease and the survival of the patients. There is mounting evidence that HBV reactivation can be prevented and managed if patients are screened to determine their risk for HBV reactivation and are treated prophylactically before therapy with immunosuppressive agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy is initiated. In this article, we review the diagnostic criteria and clinical outcomes of HBV reactivation, discuss how immunosuppressive therapy may influence the risk of HBV reactivation, and outline strategies to prevent HBV reactivation.
