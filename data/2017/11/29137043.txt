Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is common in patients with cirrhosis undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This study had 3-fold aims: to assess risk factors for PVT; to determine the efficacy of anticoagulant therapy; to investigate the impact of PVT on clinical outcomes in TIPS-treated cirrhosis.Between June 2012 and February 2016, 126 TIPS-treated patients with cirrhosis were enrolled and studied prospectively. Enrolled patients were screened for PVT before TIPS and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-TIPS. All patients received warfarin (1.5-3.0 mg/day) or aspirin (100 mg/day) or clopidogrel (75 mg/day) post-TIPS. Results of patients with and without PVT (baseline and de novo) were compared.White blood cell (WBC) counts (odds ratio (OR): 0.430, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.251-0.739, P = .002) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score (OR: 2.377, 95% CI: 1.045-5.409, P = .039) were significant baseline predictors for PVT in TIPS-treated patients with cirrhosis. Warfarin resulted in markedly greater rates of complete recanalization than aspirin or clopidogrel (P
