Previous study has identified the aberrant expression of LINC00657, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), in human breast cancer. However, the expression pattern, biological function and underlying mechanism of LINC00657 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain obscure. The expression levels of LINC00657 in HCC tissues and cell lines were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. CCK-8 assay, cell colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis, Transwell assay were performed to determine whether LINC00657 could affect HCC progression. Luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the target of LINC00657. Expressions of the relevant proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Herein, we found that LINC00657 was downregulated in HCC tissue specimens as well as in malignant HCC cell lines. LINC00657 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells, while LINC00657 depletion promoted both cell viability and cell invasion in vitro. We also found that LINC00657 could inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Further experiments demonstrated that down-regulated LINC00657 increased the expression of miR-106a-5p. miR-106a-5p decreased the abundances of PTEN protein, while had no impact on PTEN mRNA. Moreover, we identified that both LINC00657 and PTEN mRNA were targets of miR-106a-5p by using dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our results provide the new evidence supporting the tumor-suppressive role of LINC00657 in HCC, suggesting that LINC00657 might play a role in HCC and can be a novel therapeutic target for treating HCC.
