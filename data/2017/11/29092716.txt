Since the beginning of 2017, Chinese Journal of Cancer has published a series of important questions in cancer research and clinical oncology, which sparkle diverse thoughts, interesting communications, and potential collaborations among researchers all over the world. In this article, 9 more questions are presented as followed. Question 67. How could we overcome the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma against chemotherapeutics? Question 68. Is pursuit of non-covalent small-molecule binders of RAS proteins viable as a strategy of cancer drug discovery? Question 69. In what oligomeric structures do RAS proteins signal? Question 70. How can we achieve non-invasive early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer? Question 71. Does genetic information influence the volatolome enabling diagnosis of lung cancer with genetic mutations via cell headspace or breath analysis? Question 72. Is heavy ion beam radiotherapy effective to kill cancer stem cells? Question 73. Is there any diversity among different types of cancer in terms of sensitivity to heavy ion beam radiotherapy? Question 74. Can targeted alpha-particle therapy augment the effect of carbon ion radiotherapy on malignancies? Question 75. How does chromosomal instability drive tumor progression?
