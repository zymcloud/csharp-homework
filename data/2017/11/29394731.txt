A 61-year-old man untreated with hepatitis C virus presented to our hospital.He was diagnosed advanced hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)with portal vein tumor thrombosis(PVTT).The hazy tumor was located in the left lobe, and the tumor thrombus extended into the left portal vein.The patient received stereotactic body radiotherapy(SBRT, 48 Gy/4 Fr)for PVTT. The extended left lobectomy with thrombectomy was performed 12 days after SBRT.Resected specimen was diagnosed histopathologically as a poorly differentiated HCC, vp1, and no viable tumor cells in the tumor thrombosis.The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy was started 1 month after the operation.He remains free of recurrence 5 years after the hepatectomy.Multidisciplinary therapy including preoperative SBRT was feasible and might be a treatment option for HCC with PVTT.
