Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection plays a crucial role and is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in China. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key players in hepatic steatosis and carcinogenesis. We found that down-regulation of miR-384 expression was a common event in HCC, especially HBV-related HCC. However, the possible function of miR-384 in HBV-related HCC remains unclear. The oncogene pleiotrophin (PTN) was a target of miR-384. HBx inhibited miR-384, increasing PTN expression. The PTN receptor N-syndecan was highly expressed in HCC. PTN induced by HBx acted as a growth factor via N-syndecan on hepatocytes and further promoted cell proliferation, metastasis and lipogenesis. PTN up-regulated sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) through the N-syndecan/PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway and the expression of lipogenic genes, including fatty acid synthesis (FAS). PTN-mediated de novo lipid synthesis played an important role in HCC proliferation and metastasis. PI3K/AKT and an mTORC1 inhibitor diminished PTN-induced proliferation, metastasis and lipogenesis. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the dysregulation of miR-384 could play a crucial role in HBV related to HCC, and the target gene of miR-384, PTN, represents a new potential therapeutic target for the prevention of hepatic steatosis and further progression to HCC after chronic HBV infection.
