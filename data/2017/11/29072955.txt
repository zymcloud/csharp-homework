Objective:The purpose of this study is to discuss the imaging modalities and response criteria used for assessing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response to 90Y radioembolization, as well as the imaging appearances of treated tumors.Conclusion:An understanding of the appearance of HCC after 90Y radioembolization is crucial for accurate evaluation of treatment response. Residual tumor necrosis and enhancement are essential for assessing response. Multiparametric MRI, including DWI and perfusion imaging, plays an emerging role in response assessment and outcome prediction.
