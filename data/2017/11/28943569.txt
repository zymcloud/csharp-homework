Cholangiolocellular carcinoma is a minor primary cancerous tumor of the liver and its coexistence with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the liver is rare. We herein report a case of concurrent cholangiolocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the liver, in addition to a rectal G1 neuroendocrine tumor, a so-called carcinoid. The intrahepatic tumors showed a different uptake in the 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) findings. In addition to conventional dynamic contrast-enhanced CT, we concluded that FDG PET/CT could therefore be a helpful modality to identify the properties of both cholangiolocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
