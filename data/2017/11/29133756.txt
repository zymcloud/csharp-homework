Background:Overexpression and constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 have been suggested in the tumorigenesis of many human cancers, including multiple carcinomas, melanoma, and lymphoma. The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in lobectomy specimens is usually straightforward, but distinguishing cirrhosis from well-differentiated HCC can be challenging in core biopsies. Our aims were to investigate the expression level of STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) in HCC and cirrhosis, and the application of STAT3 in the differential diagnosis of HCC and cirrhosis.Methods:Sixty cases were divided into three groups: patients with HCC only (Group 1), HCC and cirrhosis (Group 2), and cirrhosis only (Group 3). Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically for STAT3, pSTAT3, and CD163. The values obtained from the tissue sections of each group were compared in statistical analysis.Results:STAT3 showed a high level in HCC and was a significant marker for differentiating HCC from cirrhosis (P Conclusions:STAT3 staining differs significantly in HCC and cirrhosis. The findings reinforce the role of STAT3 in the tumorigenesis of HCC and provide a useful marker to differentiate HCC from cirrhosis in challenging liver biopsies.
