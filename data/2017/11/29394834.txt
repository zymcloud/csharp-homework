Celiac artery compression syndrome(CACS)is a rare disorder characterized by postprandial intestinal angina caused by insufficient blood supply to the gastrointestinal organs. In this syndrome, the root of the celiac artery is compressed and narrowed by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm during expiration, sometimes causing difficulties in trans-arterial intervention. We report here a case that trans-hepatic arterial intervention was able to performed by splenic bypass. A 74- year-old man with multiple hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)was performed the angiography, and diagnosed as CACS due to celiac artery root obstruction. The median arcuate ligament was incised in order to introduce trans-arterial intervention, but sufficient resumption of blood flow in the root of celiac artery could not be obtained, so bypass surgery was added from left common iliac artery to splenic artery with grafted right saphenous vein. One month later, trans hepatic arterial intervention is performed via graft, and treatment of HCC is ongoing. Splenic artery left common iliac artery bypass surgery was also considered to be an option for cases in which the resurgence of the blood flow in the root of the celiac artery was not obtained even in the median arcuate ligament dissection for CACS.
