Objective:This research focuses on the influence of linc-ITGB1 on the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma and further explores its underlying mechanism.Patients and methods:A total of 70 hepatocellular carcinoma patients were chosen for our study. RT-qPCR was used for detecting the expression level of linc-ITGB1 in their cancer tissues. Moreover, the expression level of linc-ITGB1 was also detected in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, whether linc-ITGB1 could affect the migrated and invaded ability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was determined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. We further explored the potential mechanism by RT-qPCR and Western blot assay.Results:Linc-ITGB1 expression level in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was remarkably higher than that in adjacent tissues. Moreover, migrated and invaded ability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells was inhibited through knockdown of linc-ITGB1. Further study revealed that silenced linc-ITGB1 inhibited the expression of ZEB1 and then suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which was important during the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, the inhibition of cell invasion by silenced linc-ITGB1 could be rescued through overexpression of ZEB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusions:The results indicate that linc-ITGB1, a novel oncogene in tumorigenesis, could promote the metastasis and EMT via ZEB1, which may offer a possible therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma.
