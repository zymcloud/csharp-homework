Aim:To identify chromosomal copy number aberrations (CNAs) in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and analyze whether they are correlated with patient prognosis.Methods:One hundred and twenty patients with early-stage HCC were enrolled in our study, with the collection of formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens and clinicopathological data. Tumor areas were marked by certified pathologists on a hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide, and cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues underwent extraction of DNA, which was analyzed with the Affymetrix OncoScan platform to assess CNAs and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Ten individuals with nonmalignant disease were used as the control group. Another cohort consisting of 40 patients with stage I/II HCC were enrolled to analyze gene expression and to correlate findings with the OncoScan data.Results:Copy number amplifications occurred at chromosomes 1q21.1-q44 and 8q12.3-24.3 and deletions were found at 4q13.1-q35.2, 8p 23.2-21.1, 16q23.3-24.3, and 17p13.3-12, while LOH commonly occurred at 1p32.3, 3p21.31, 8p23.2-21.1, 16q22.1-24.3, and 17p 13.3-11 in early-stage HCC. Using Cox regression analysis, we also found that a higher percentage of genome change (≥ 60%) was an independent factor for worse prognosis in early-stage HCC (P = 0.031). Among the 875 genes in the OncoScan GeneChip, six were independent predictors of worse disease-free survival, of which three were amplified (MYC, ELAC2, and SYK) and three were deleted (GAK, MECOM, and WRN). Further, patients with HCC who exhibited ≥ 3 CNAs involving these six genes have worse outcomes compared to those who had < 3 CNAs (P < 0.001). Similarly, Asian patients with stage I HCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas harboring CNAs with these genes were also predicted to have poorer outcomes.Conclusion:Patients with early-stage HCC and increased genome change or CNAs involving MYC, ELAC2, SYK, GAK, MECOM, or WRN are at risk for poorer outcome after resection.
