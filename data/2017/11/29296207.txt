Long non-coding RNA PTENP1, the pseudogene of PTEN tumor suppressor, was previously reported to be a tumour suppressor in some cancer types. However, the precise effects mediated by PTENP1 transcripts within intricate regulatory networks involving molecular interactions with PTEN and tumorigenicity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive. Here, we identify the critical biological functions of PTENP1 and discuss whether PTENP1 could directly interact with miR-193a-3p to affect the progression of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that PTENP1 level in the HCC tissues was significantly lower compared with those in the adjacent normal tissues. And PTENP1 was able to repress cell invasion, metastasis, and proliferation capacity in HCC cell lines. The overexpression of PTENP1 inhibited HCC growth both in vitro and in vivo. There were a binding sequence and direct interaction between PTENP1 and miR-193a-3p. PTENP1 as an endogenous sponge interacted with miR-193a-3p, leading to regulate the downstream PTEN/Akt pathway. These results suggested that PTENP1 with its suppression effect might serve as novel biomarkers and potent therapeutic strategies in HCC.
