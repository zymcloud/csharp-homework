MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are crucial molecules that act as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes in human cancer progression. The dysregulation of miRNA expression has been detected in liver cancer. The present study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms by which miR‑214 affects liver cancer cell proliferation. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression of miR‑214 in liver cancer cell lines and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine whether Wnt3a is a target gene of miR‑214. Cell Counting kit‑8 and cell cycle analysis were used to explore the effects of miR‑214 on liver cancer cell proliferation. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect protein expression levels. Wnt3a knockdown was used to determine the function of Wnt3a in liver cancer cell proliferation. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of human miR‑214 were reduced in HCC tissues and liver cancer cell lines compared with in control tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR‑214 and Wnt3a silencing each inhibited liver cancer cell growth. Conversely, inhibition of miR‑214 promoted liver cancer cell growth. The present study indicated that miR‑214 acts as a tumor suppressor and may be considered a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of liver cancer.
