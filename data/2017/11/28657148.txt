Recent studies have demonstrated a potential link between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are few studies evaluating mtDNA content as a noninvasive marker of chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB). In this study, we conducted a case-control study to determine mtDNA content in peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) samples from 76 CHB cases na√Øve to antivirus therapy and 96 healthy controls, and then evaluated the association between mtDNA content and baseline serum concentration of HBV markers. Consequently, CHB cases had significantly higher mtDNA content than healthy controls (1052.85 vs 618.98, P
