Background and aim:The aim of this study is to confirm the efficacy of multipolar ablation with a new simulator system, three-dimensional (3-D) sim-Navigator, for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma by assessing relapse-free survival and shape of the ablation volume under clinical conditions.Methods:All participants provided written, informed consent, and study protocols were approved by the institutional ethics committee. Twenty-seven patients with 27 nodules were treated by no-touch ablation using the new simulator system. Another 21 patients with 21 nodules treated without the simulator system were enrolled as controls. Tumor progression and shape of ablation volume were assessed. Predictors of tumor progression were assessed by Cox proportional hazard model.Results:No significant differences in clinical characteristics were seen between groups. Mean sphericity was 0.48 ± 0.07 with 3-D sim-Navigator and 0.37 ± 0.07 without 3-D sim-Navigator (P Conclusions:Ideal ablation area was acquired by this simulation and navigation system in clinics. This system improved local tumor progression by facilitating appropriate insertion of multiple electrodes.
