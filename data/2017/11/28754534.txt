Background:We have previously reported favorable response and survival rates using drug-eluting beads loaded with doxorubicin (DEBDOX) for unresectable hepatic metastases. This study investigates the quality of life (QoL) impact of DEBDOX for the treatment of unresectable hepatic metastases from melanoma.Methods:A multi-center, prospective, non-controlled clinical trial was reviewed. QoL was assessed at baseline and after each treatment, and doxorubicin-specific effects were assessed after each treatment.Results:Twenty patients received 61 DEBDOX treatments. After each treatment, at least 83% of patients reported "little" to "none" doxorubicin-related symptoms. For the 8 FACT-Hep subscales, QoL scores were unchanged through 3 treatments for 18 of 24 total time points by ANOVA, with a small-to-moderate ES change through the last treatment in 36 of 40 time points.Conclusions:Hepatic arterial therapy with DEBDOX is safe with minimal QOL changes in treating unresectable liver-dominant melanoma metastasis.Clinical trial:NCT01010984.
