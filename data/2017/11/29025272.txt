Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known as fifth common malignancies and third common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The identification of various mechanisms which are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis contributes in finding a variety of cellular and molecular targets for HCC diagnosis, prevention and therapy. Among various identified targets in HCC pathogenesis, Gankyrin is a crucial oncoprotein that is up-regulated in HCC and plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of the HCC. Oncogenic role of Gankyrin has been found to stem from inhibition of two ubiquitous tumour suppressor proteins, retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and P53, and also modulation of several vital cellular signalling pathways including Wnt/β-Catenin, NF-κB, STAT3/Akt, IL-1β/IRAK-1 and RhoA/ROCK. As a result, Gankyrin can be considered as a potential candidate for diagnosis and treatment of HCC. In this review, we summarized the physiological function and the significant role of Gankyrin as an important therapeutic target in HCC.
