Background:Human chemokine like factor (CKLF)-like MAL and related proteins for vesicle trafficking transmembrane, domain-containing member 5 (CMTM5) has been shown to involved and may function as a tumour suppressor in tumorigenesis. The current study aimed to investigate the expression and function of CMTM5 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:CMTM5 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry, and its clinical significance was analysed in 76 HCC specimens. The role and molecular mechanisms of CMTM5 in cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion were examined in vitro and in vivo.Results:CMTM5 expression was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues as well as cell lines. The expression of CMTM5 was absent in 77.6% of HCC tissues compared with 3.9% in normal liver tissues. Low CMTM5 expression was significantly correlated with poor overall survival in patients with HCC (P = 0.009). Restoring CMTM5 expression in Huh7 cells significantly inhibited cell growth, promoted cell apoptosis, and reduced cell metastatic and invasion ability compared with mock transfected cells in vitro. Overexpression of CMTM5 also suppressed xenograft tumour growth in vivo in a HCC xenograft model. Reduced cell growth and metastasis ability mediated by CMTM5 overexpression was associated with downregulation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream Bcl2, cyclinD1, cyclinE, MMP2 and MMP9 expressions, and an upregulation of p21, Bax, Bad, cleaved caspase3 expressions.Conclusions:Our data suggest that CMTM5 might function as a tumour suppressor in human HCC, and represent a valuable potential therapeutic target for HCC.
