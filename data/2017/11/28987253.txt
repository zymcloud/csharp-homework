Genotype 3 hepatitis C infection is the second most common genotype worldwide and accounts for most infections in Southeast Asia. It is a particularly ominous genotype because it has been linked to increased mortality, specifically increased late-stage liver events, accelerated development of hepatic fibrosis, and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. As new treatment regimens for hepatitis C have been emerging, treatment of genotype 3 often requires longer treatment duration with decreased response rates as compared with other genotypes.
