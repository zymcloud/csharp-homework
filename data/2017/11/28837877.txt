M2 macrophages play critical roles in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and they are associated with poor outcomes. TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to be critically important to cancer cell dissemination in HCC. However, the relationship between stromal-like HCC cells and M2 macrophages formation is not clear. Here, we interrogated the molecular link between mesenchymal-like HCC cells and the formation of M2 macrophages. We demonstrated that mesenchymal-like HCC cells secrete connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) to polarized macrophages. Reciprocally, Chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) from M2 macrophages promotes HCC progression. Furthermore, CTGF and CCL18 were increased significantly in HCC compared to adjacent normal liver tissues. In summary, our study discovered a positive feedback loop between CTGF and CCL18 in HCC metastasis. Targeting CTGF or CCL18 might provide beneficial effects for the clinical treatment of HCC.
