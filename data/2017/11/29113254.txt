Liver cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among human malignancies. Four and a half LIM domains 1 (FHL1), as a tumor suppressor gene, is frequently downregulated in multiple types of human cancer. However, the role and specific mechanisms of FHL1 as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer are poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the role and associated mechanisms of FHL1 in human liver cancer. The level of FHL1 mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue specimens and cell lines derived from the human liver was determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The association between FHL1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with liver cancer was analyzed. Western blotting, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to study the expression association of FHL1 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in human liver cancer and to explore the regulatory mechanism of FHL1 downregulation. Colony formation and migration assays were performed while FHL1 was overexpressed in Hep3B cells. The results showed that the expression of FHL1 mRNA in tumor tissue decreased, exhibiting a significant difference compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissue (P
