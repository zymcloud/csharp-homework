The aim of this study was to clarify the prognosis of cases with recurrent colorectal cancer that underwent curative resection in order to determine index for recurrent colorectal cancer treatment. Of the cases that exhibited recurrence after undergoing curative resection for primary colorectal cancer at our hospital between 1993 and 2013, this study targeted the 109 cases for which curative resection was possible. The sites of recurrence were the liver(58 cases), the lungs(27 cases), the peritoneum (11 cases), local sites(9 cases), lymph nodes(8 cases), and the anastomotic sites(6 cases). Of these, 10 cases exhibited metastasis to 2 organs. The median survival time after metastasectomy was 75.3 months, and the 5-year survival rate was 53.8%. The primary lesion histological type being a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma/mucinous carcinoma, degree of progression upon initial onset being Stage III b or greater, and disease-free interval being less than 2 years were associated with poorpr ognosis. Specifically, histological type and disease-free interval were found to be independent factors that correlated with prognosis. Meanwhile, no differences were observed for prognosis related to the number of recurrent organs, the number of recurrent nodules, or the number of times curative resection was performed after recurrence. While the histological type and disease-free interval determine prognosis in cases with recurrent colorectal cancer performed curative resection, it appears that if curative resection is possible, aggressive resection should be pursued even for cases of multiple or repeated recurrence.
