Backgrounds/aims:To achieve complete anatomic hepatectomy in a large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatic transection through an anterior approach is required. Liver hanging maneuver (LHM) is a useful procedure for transection of an adequately cut plane in anatomical liver resection. It may reduce intraoperative bleeding and transection time.Methods:We examined records of 27 patients with large HCC (over 10 cm in size) who underwent anatomic hepatic resection with LHM (n=11, between 2001 and 2007) or without LHM (n=16, between 2000 and 2003). The two groups were retrospectively compared in terms of patient demographics, preoperative hepatic function, surgical records, and post-hepatectomy outcome.Results:Although transection time was not significantly different between the two groups, the amount of intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in the LHM group than that in the non-LHM group (1,269±1,407 ml vs. 2,197±1,281 ml, p=0.039). Related blood transfusion or total operation time in the LHM group tended to be lower than those in the non-LHM group, although differences between the two groups were not statistically significant (p<1.0). Prevalence of total complications in the LHM group tended to be lower than that in the LHM group (36% vs. 88%, p=0.011). However, prevalence of hepatectomy-related complications or length of hospital stay was not significantly different between the two groups.Conclusions:LHM can reduce intraoperative blood loss. It is useful for transecting adequately cut plane in a hepatectomy for a large HCC. However, postoperative outcomes are not improved by LHM compared to those by non-LHM.
