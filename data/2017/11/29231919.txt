Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease in the developed world (15% to 40% of the adult population). Introduction of lifestyle changes including dietary intervention and increased physical activity is most often the first-line treatment and is intended to support not only the treatment of liver disease, but also for diseases associated with obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and dyslipidemia. In addition to well-known metformin, there are new classes of antidiabetic drugs, including GLP-1analog, SGLT-2 antagonist, pioglitazon. In addition, statins, vitamin E and pentoxyfiline are also recommended. In the absence of improvement of liver enzymes during the 6 months of treatment, liver biopsy should be considered. Simple hepatic steatosis (NAFL) is mild, but steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis chance the prognosis and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is higher.
