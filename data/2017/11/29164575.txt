Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are novel proposed non-coding RNAs, and play critical roles in tumorigenesis. However, the clinical significance, biological role and molecular mechanism of ncRNAs in HCC still remain largely elusive. The aim of this study was to uncover the clinical value and biological role of XLOC_010235 (XLOC), which has been demonstrated as an oncogene in gastric cancer, in HCC.Patients and methods:Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) was conducted to measure the level of XLOC in HCC tissues and cell lines. The relationship between XLOC expression and clinicopathological features of HCC patients was analyzed. Then loss-of-function assays were conducted to determine the biological effect of XLOC in HCC cells.Results:Our investigations revealed that XLOC was increased in HCC tissues and cell lines, and high level of XLOC was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Additionally, silenced XLOC significantly inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis and facilitated cell migration of HCC in vitro.Conclusions:Our findings advance our understanding of the role of XLOC as an oncogene in HCC, which may help in the development of new therapeutics.
