The patient was a woman in her 50's. She went to the hospitalfor epigastric discomfort. Numerous hypovascular tumors spreading almost to the entire liver were detected via abdominal CT. We diagnosed the tumors as unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC). Chemotherapy with gemcitabine(GEM)and S-1 was given. The tumors shrunk markedly, and stable disease status was maintained for 2 years and 4 months. Thereafter, the regimen was changed to GEM plus cisplatin (CDDP)because of progressive disease, which was then uncontrolled. Although proton beam therapy and radiofrequency ablation were subsequently performed, multiple lesions appeared in the liver, and metastasis was also observed shortly in the left lung. Right hepatic trisegmentectomy and thoracoscopic left lung partial resection were performed in 2 stages. Histopathological findings showed morphological hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)as well as positive immunostaining with CEA, CK7, and CK19. The final diagnosis was combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. The patient is without recurrence for 9 months following operation, and long-term survivalfor 4 years and 6 months has been obtained.
