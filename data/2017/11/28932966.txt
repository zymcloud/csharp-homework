Purpose:We report our institutional observations of ten patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (seven and three were Child-Pugh class A and B, respectively) who received compassionate regorafenib therapy between June 2016 and January 2017. These patients did not fit the rigid criteria of a clinical trial and represented the use of regorafenib in an everyday clinic situation.Methods:Regorafenib (160 mg P.O. daily) was administered to patients on a 4-week cycle (3 weeks on, 1 week off) until disease progression (assessed using mRECIST criteria) or discontinuation secondary to toxicity (assessed using CTCAE criteria). Relevant clinical data were abstracted from patient medical records and reviewed retrospectively.Results:The median duration of patient treatment was 6.6 weeks, and the median time to disease progression was 12.5 weeks. Most common treatment emergent adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, and hand-foot skin reaction. Elevated AST and ALT were the most commonly observed laboratory-assessed adverse events, which reached grade 3 status in the Child-Pugh class B patients only. We observed intolerance to regorafenib treatment in one patient who had previously received a liver transplant. We also saw lithium toxicity in one patient receiving long-term lithium treatment, suggesting a potential and unexpected drug-drug interaction with regorafenib.Conclusions:Taken together, our observations indicate that regorafenib is beneficial in the treatment of patients with advanced HCC who progressed on or demonstrated intolerance to sorafenib therapy; however, careful selection and close monitoring of patients is necessary to maximize the benefit while minimizing the toxicities of regorafenib treatment.
