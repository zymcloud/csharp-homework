Objective:To characterize the transcriptome profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells treated with peptide 9R-P201 for further functional verification and HCC drug development.Results:1557 mRNAs (1125 upregulated and 432 downregulated) and 881 lncRNAs (640 upregulated and 241 downregulated) with significant differential expression were identified using RNA-seq. The qRT-PCR results showed that the differential expression of several mRNAs and lncRNAs coincided with the RNA-seq results. Differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs presented a significant difference in genomic characteristics but no preference under 9R-P201 treatment compared with control. The GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses showed that differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs remarkably enriched in cancer-related biological processes and signaling pathways. Finally, we screened out 33 TFs, 273 lncRNAs and 94 target genes with high degree interaction which were remarkably associated with the tumorigenesis and progression of cancers using betweenness centrality analysis.Conclusion:These findings offer novel insights into the mechanism of 9R-P201 in HepG2 cells and provide new opportunities for the future 9R-P201-based drug development and the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
