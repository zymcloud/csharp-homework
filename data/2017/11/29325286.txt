The Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway, which has been confirmed to play an important role in organ volume control, stem cell function, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Recent research findings show that the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway is closely associated with the development and progression of primary liver cancer, and inhibition of the activity of this pathway may be a new method for the treatment of liver cancer. This article reviews the research advances in the role of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway in primary liver cancer.
