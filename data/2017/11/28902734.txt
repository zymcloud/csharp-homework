A 66-year-old man with history of prostate carcinoma underwent Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT for surveillance of rising prostate-specific antigen. Intense tracer uptake was noted in segments 2, 7, and 8 of the liver. The lesions were not FDG avid on F-FDG PET/CT. Further characterization with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with Gd-EOB (Primovist) contrast revealed ill-defined arterially enhancing lesions with central washout in the venous phase. CT-guided core biopsy was performed, and histopathology confirmed well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
