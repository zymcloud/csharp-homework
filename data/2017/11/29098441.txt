Systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still challenging. A biomodulatory therapy approach targeting the communicative infrastructure of HCC, including metronomic low-dose chemotherapy with capecitabine, pioglitazone and rofecoxib, has been evaluated in patients with non-curative HCC. Altogether 38 patients were evaluable in this one-arm, multicenter phase II trial. The primary endpoint, median progression-free survival was 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.6-3.79) for all evaluable patients and 8.4 months (95% CI: 0-18.13) for patients â‰¥ 6 weeks on protocol. Median overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months (95% CI: 4.08-9.31) and 9.4 months (95% CI: 4.82-13.97), respectively. Most common adverse events were edemas grade 3, which were commonly related to the advanced stage, with 66% of the patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. Exploratory data analyses showed significant impact of ECOG performance status grade 0 versus 1 and CLIP score 0/1 versus > 1 on OS, 9.8 months (95% CI: 4.24-15.35) versus 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.03-4.36; P = 0.002), and 9.8 months (95% CI: 3.23-16.37) versus 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.14-5.66; P = 0.009), respectively. Preceding tumor surgery had significant beneficial impact on survival, as well as maximal tumor diameter of
