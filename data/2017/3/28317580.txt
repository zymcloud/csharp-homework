Background:Liver metastasis is the leading cause of lethal colorectal cancer (CRC). For patients with early stage CRC, metachronous liver metastasis is the primary risk for poor prognosis. Accordingly, identification of prospective biomarkers for metachronous liver metastasis would be invaluable in evaluating patients' clinical outcomes and developing personal treatment therapy.Methods:Here we investigated the role of transducin (Î²)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) in predicting liver metastasis for early stage CRC. To accomplish this goal, a multi-center retrospective study was performed which included three stages: exploration stage (43 patients), identification stage (162 patients) and validation stage (38 patients). TBL1XR1 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining and RT-qPCR. The prognostic significance of TBL1XR1 in both stage IV CRC patients and early stage CRC patients were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate analysis, respectively.Results:For stage IV CRC patients, TBL1XR1 expression was correlated with the number of liver metastases (P = 0.036), and high levels of TBL1XR1 in liver metastases indicated poor overall survival (P = 0.028). Moreover, high expressions of TBL1XR1 can serve as a predictor for liver metastasis in early stage CRC patients (P = 0.003).Conclusions:TBL1XR1 is a promising biomarker for predicting liver metastasis in early stage CRC patients.
