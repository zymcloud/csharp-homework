Purpose:Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, is a recommended treatment option available for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-C stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to evaluate the performance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) for predicting tumour progression during sorafenib treatment.Methods:We formed a retrospective cohort comprising patients treated with sorafenib for at least 30 days and undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT within 1 month before treatment. For statistical analyses, the tumour-to-liver standardised uptake value (SUV) ratio (TLR) of the most hypermetabolic lesion was measured.Results:Among a total of 35 patients, two obtained partial remission, and 11 showed stable disease after the first response evaluation. Patients with a TLR ≥ 2.9 (n = 17) had a median overall survival (OS) of 3.7 months after sorafenib treatment, whereas patients with a TLR Conclusion:Pretreatment tumour metabolic activity assessed by 18F-FDG PET is an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with BCLC-C stage HCC receiving sorafenib monotherapy, although it may not predict tumour response to the treatment.
