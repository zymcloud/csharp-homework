Objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and is the third highest cause of malignancy-related death. Because of its typically late diagnosis, median survival is approximately 6 to 20 months, with 5-year survival of Materials and methods:From December 1988 to January 2017, we performed 552 liver transplants at Baskent University. In candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma, our expanded criteria for liver transplant is applied regardless of tumor size and number, includes those without major vascular invasion and without distant metastasis, and those with negative cytology (if the patient has ascites). Since 1994, of 61 liver transplants for hepatocellular carcinoma, 36 patients received transplants according to our expanded criteria.Results:Of 36 expanded-criteria patients, 11 were children and 25 were adults. Sixteen patients (4 pediatric, 12 adult) were within our expanded criteria both radiologically and pathologically before transplant. The other 20 patients (7 pediatric, 13 adult) were within Milan criteria radiologically before transplant; however, after liver transplant, when pathologic specimens were evaluated, patients were found to be within our center's expanded criteria. During follow-up, 9/36 patients (25%) had hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence. In pediatric patients, 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 90%; in adults, 5-year survival was 58.7% and 10-year survival was 49.7%. Overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 71.7% and 62.7%.Conclusions:Liver transplant is safe and effective in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in combination with interventional radiology procedures, regardless of tumor size and number, without major vascular invasion and distant metastasis.
