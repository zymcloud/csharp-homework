Background:Chemotherapy is the standard treatment for liver metastases of gastric cancer (LMGC). Hepatectomy for LMGC reportedly has a 5-year survival rate of 13-37 %; however, its significance has not been established. At our hospital, hepatectomy is performed for patients with three or fewer metastases diagnosed using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To identify the ideal patient subpopulation for resection, we retrospectively analyzed treatment outcomes in patients with LMGC who underwent hepatectomy.Methods:Clinicopathological factors affecting survival were explored using univariate and multivariate analyses in 28 patients who underwent hepatectomy for LMGC diagnosed using contrast-enhanced MRI between December 2004 and October 2014.Results:The study included 23 men and 5 women with a median age of 72 years. Metastases were synchronous in 15 patients and metachronous in 13 patients. The median overall survival time was 49 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 32 %. Univariate analysis revealed that overall survival time was shorter in the presence of the following factors: age â‰¥70 years (p = 0.030), synchronous liver metastases (p = 0.017), and presence of postoperative complications (p = 0.042). In patients with metachronous liver metastases, the post-resection 5-year survival rate was 59 %.Conclusions:The 5-year survival rate was 32 % in patients who underwent hepatectomy for LMGC according to our criteria, suggesting that hepatectomy is an important treatment if indications are on the basis of contrast-enhanced MRI. Therefore, active resection should be considered, particularly for patients with metachronous liver metastases.
