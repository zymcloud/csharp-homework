Evidence reveals that microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis. In the present study, we identified an essential role for miR-922 in the development of HCC. We found that miR-922 was significantly upregulated in HCC cells and clinical tissues. Gain and loss of function studies indicated that miR-922 significantly promoted HCC cell proliferation. We subsequently identified that cylindromatosis (CYLD) was a target gene of miR-922. Moreover, miR-922 decreased CYLD expression, subsequently upregulating the expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1, while downregulating p-Rb expression. Furthermore, knockdown of CYLD expression by siRNA partially counteracted the tumor suppressive effect of the inhibitor of miR‑922, miR‑922-in. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-922 plays a key role in the promotion of HCC cell proliferation, and strongly suggest that exogenous miR-922 may have therapeutic value for treating HCC.
