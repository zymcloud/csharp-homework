The deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) is frequently associated with a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the expression and possible role of miR-199a-5p in HCC. The expression of miR-199a-5p was measured by quantitative RT-PCR in HCC. The effect of miR-199a-5p was evaluated by cell viability and colony formation assays in HCC cell lines and tumor cell growth assay in xenograft nude mice. Quantitative real time PCR results showed that miR-199a-5p was down-regulated in 77.9 % (67/86) of HCC tissues compared with adjacent nontumor tissues. MiR-199a-5p mimic reduced cell viability and colony formation by induction of cell arrest in HCC cell lines and inhibited tumor cell growth in xenograft nude mice, but miR-199a-5p inhibitor increased cell viability and colony formation in HCC cell lines and tumor cell growth in xenograft nude mice. Furthermore, CLTC was defined as a potential direct target of miR-199a-5p by MiRanda and TargetScan predictions. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay results showed that CLTC was a direct target of miR-199a-5p. The use of miR-199a-5p mimic or inhibitor could decrease or increase CLTC protein levels in HCC cell lines. We conclude that the frequently down-regulated miR-199a-5p can regulate CLTC and might function as a tumor suppressor in HCC. Therefore, miR-199a-5p may serve as a useful therapeutic agent for miRNA-based HCC therapy.
