Aim:To screen clinically relevant microRNAs (miRNAs) silenced by DNA methylation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Knockdown of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) using siRNAs and miRNA profiling in HCC cell lines were performed to identify DNA hypermethylation-mediated miRNA downregulation. Confirmation using individual quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays was then performed followed by DNA methylation quantification at the promoter of the miRNA genes. Quantification of DNA methylation and miRNA expression was then performed in primary HCC tumor samples and related with clinicopathological variables.Results:miRNA profiling after DNMT knockdown in HCC cell lines revealed upregulation of miR-23, miR-25 and miR-183. After qRT-PCR confirmation and CpG island methylation quantification of these miRNAs in cell lines, further analysis in primary HCC specimens showed that hsa-miR-183 is hypermethylated in 30% of HCC (n = 40). Expression of mature miR-183 showed an inverse correlation with DNA methylation levels. In HCC cells, DNMT knockdown and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment reduced methylation and stimulated expression of miR-183. In HCC patients, hypermethylation at hsa-miR-183 promoter significantly correlates with poor survival (log-rank test P = 0.03). DNA methylation analysis in healthy liver, benign liver tumors (hepatocellular adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia) and their corresponding adjacent tissues showed absence of hypermethylation supporting the notion that aberrant methylation at hsa-miR-183 is specific for the malignant transformation of hepatocytes.Conclusion:Our data indicate that hypermethylation of hsa-miR-183 is a frequent event in HCC and potentially useful as a novel surrogate diagnostic and prognostic marker.
