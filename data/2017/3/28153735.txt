The chief chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin had common bad effects such as nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity and bone marrow depression. This led us to develop a new potential anticancer drug based on nickel metal ion that may be less toxic. Nickel(II) diacetyl monoxime-2-pyridyl hydrazone complex cytoprotective effect, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity and anticancer activities were studied. In vitro, the complex showed SOD-like activity of 86.62%. It was capable to kill 90.2% of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells and to protect 92.48% of human RBCs. In vivo, the complex lowered the tumor burden markedly in a concentration-dependent manner. Noticeably, solid tumor growth was suppressed; tumor volume and weight were reduced and mice life span was lengthened. The hematological indices were improved, catalase activity was re-elevated and malondialdehyde (MDA) level was reversed towards normal. Nucleic acids, cholesterol, triglycerides, liver enzymes, urea and creatinine contents were reduced to near normal ranges. Glutathione (GSH), SOD, albumin and total protein levels were increased. In conclusion, our results revealed that the complex has the ability to suppress Ehrlich solid tumor growth in mice with minimal side effects. This may possibly via its redox activity. Surprisingly, nickel complex antitumor activities were more potent than those of cisplatin.
