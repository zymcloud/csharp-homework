Solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing several human papillomavirus (HPV)-related malignancies, including cervical and anal cancers. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the initial prevalence and risk factors for high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) cervical infections in liver transplant recipients, as well as their concordance with anal infections. A total of 50 female patients were enrolled in the Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery at the Medical University of Warsaw (center with >1600 liver transplantations). The initial prevalence of cervical HR-HPV infection was 10.0% (5/50). The only significant risk factor for cervical HR-HPV infection was ≥4 lifetime sexual partners (P=.037). Statistical tendencies toward higher prevalence of cervical HR-HPV infections were found for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV, P=.082) and with model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≤8 (P=.064). Cervical cytology was abnormal in 10 patients, including three with HR-HPV. Out of 12 patients with available data on anal HR-HPV, one had concordant HPV 16 infection. In conclusion, the initial prevalence of high-risk HPV infection is relatively low, except for patients with ≥4 previous sexual partners and potentially in those with HBV and/or low MELD score.
