In this study, we demonstrated a novel polyelectrolyte microparticle, doxorubicin(DOX)-superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-chondroitin sulfate (CS)/chitosan (CHI)microparticles (MPs), as a drug delivery system for hepatic cancer treatment. We also investigated the properties of these microparticles through composition determination, formulation tests, in vitro study, and in vivo study. The results showed that our DOX-SPIO-CS/CHI MPs had an average diameter of 1.43±0.54μm and exhibited a spherical shape. The encapsulation efficiency of this drug carrier was approximately 31±8.07%, according to our spectroscopic determination. The results of release profile test revealed the sustained-release behavior of DOX-SPIO-CS/CHI MPs, which released 51.5% of DOX within 48h of the testing period. According to the results of a cell viability assay and an animal study, the DOX-SPIO-CS/CHI MPs exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than did free DOX when it was administered to Hep G2 and Huh-6 human liver cancer cell lines in vitro and to nude mice of Hep G2/Huh-6-bearing mice model in vivo.
