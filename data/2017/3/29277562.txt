Purpose of the study:Co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 are the members of B7 family, which stimulate the T lymphocytes in response to the malignant colon polyps. However, the expression of these molecules is depressed in cancers. In the present study, the transcription levels of CD80 and CD86 genes in the colon polyps (Precancerous lesions) and its association with the clinical features were examined.Patients and methods:Forty-nine biopsies samples from patients with the colorectal polyps and 10 healthy subjects were collected by the colonoscopy. Questionnaires including clinical and demographic data were filled for all cases. Using Real-time PCR, the mucosal mRNA expression levels of CD80 and CD86 genes were quantified.Results:Adenoma and hyperplastic polyps were reported in 69.3 and 30.7 percent of 49 patients, respectively. Unlike hyperplastic polyps, the expression of CD86 was increased in adenoma polyps compared to controls (RQ=2.75 vs. 0.837, respectively). The data from CD80 showed noticeable reduction about 0.31 and 0.11 in adenoma and hyperplastic polyps, respectively, in response to control group (RQ=0.729). Also, analyzing colon and rectum polyps depicted a marked increment in CD86 level, in contrast to CD80.Conclusion:Examining the mRNA expression levels of CD80 and CD86 genes between colon polyps with the rectal polyps shows that the enhanced level of CD86 in adenoma samples could be considered as a valuable biomarker for distinguishing the adenoma from hyperplastic polyps and the masses located in the colon from the rectum.
