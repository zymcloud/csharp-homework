Background and aim:Liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are associated with viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Whether differences exist in postoperative de novo carcinogenesis from established cirrhosis according to viral etiology remains unclear.Methods:Data from 313 LC patients with viral hepatitis (HBV-LC, n = 108 and HCV-LC, n = 205) who underwent curative-intent hepatectomy for HCC were retrospectively collected. Clinicopathological characteristics, cumulative recurrence, chronological change of recurrence rate, and predictors of recurrence were analyzed.Results:Baseline patient characteristics were different among patients with HBV versus HCV as HCC-LC patients had a lower albumin, higher alanine transaminase, and higher incidence of tumor multicentricity (all P Conclusion:HCV-related LC was associated with a higher postoperative de novo carcinogenesis than HBV-related LC. Establishment of different treatment algorithms as well as follow-up surveillance protocols stratified by viral etiology may be warranted.
