Objective:To investigate the efficacy and safety of transarterial embolization (TAE) using embolization microspheres in the treatment of non-hypervascular malignant liver tumors.Methods:Patients with malignant non-hypervascular liver tumors, who were treated with TAE using embolization microspheres, were selected and analyzed retrospectively. The technical success rate, tumor response, and complications were assessed.Results:Six patients were included in the study: 1 patient each with hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, hepatic metastasis after resection of common bile duct carcinoma, liver metastasis from colon cancer, liver metastasis from esophageal cancer, and liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer. The technical success rate was 100%. At 1 and 3 months after TAE, tumor local reactions were seen in 6/6 and 2/6 patients, respectively, and the tumor necrosis rates were 48%-73% and 22%-68%, respectively. The main complications were those related to the embolization syndrome, including 1 case of liver abscess and 1 case of severe pain on the first day after embolization.Conclusion:TAE with embolization microspheres is safe and effective in non-hypervascular liver tumors. It is a feasible option for palliative therapy of these tumors.
