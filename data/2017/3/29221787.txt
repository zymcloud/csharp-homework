Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are among the most serious health conditions affecting about 600 million people worldwide leading to a number of severe liver diseases. Due to the lack of warning signs or mild symptoms during the early stage of the infection, a molecular signature associated with disease progression would be useful. Based on our recent paper where candidate biomarkers were determined through topological and modularity analysis of protein interaction networks (PINs), this study was focused on the evaluation of MIF, TNFRSF1A, FAS and TMSB4X as diagnostic biomarkers in chronic HBV and HCV infections. The aim was to establish a molecular profile, by combining those markers, that would discriminate the different stages during the progression of chronic hepatitis. One hundred and fifteen patients infected with HBV or HCV categorized into three groups: non-cirrhotic, cirrhotic and with HCC, and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of the aforementioned factors were measured by ELISA. TNFRSF1A serum levels appeared statistically significantly increased in all patient groups compared to control group with a p-value of
