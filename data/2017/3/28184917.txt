Following the publication of this article, we realize that there were some errors in the manuscript. Details of the experiments describing the gene silencing of RUNX3 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) were erroneously included in this paper, and all references to siRNA should have been deleted from the manuscript prior to publication. In the subsection entitled 'Cell lines and cell culture' on page 2577, the left‑hand column, the text should have indicated that the human HCC cell lines Hep3B and Huh7 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA), whereas HLF cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Lastly, an error was made in describing the calculation of the IC50 values, which did not correlate with the data shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, the subsection entitled 'Ectopic RUNX3 protein expression suppresses cell growth...' should have been entitled 'Ectopic RUNX3 protein expression increases 5‑FU and CDDP sensitivity', and the text herein should have read as follows: We analyzed the effects of RUNX3 on chemosensitivity in the RUNX3‑ or CAT (mock)‑transfected Hep3B and Huh7 cells. RUNX3 expression enhanced 5‑FU sensitivity in both cell lines; the cell viability with 5‑FU (100 nM) decreased from 66.3±4.6 to 34.3±5.0%, and from 71.0±4.7% to 27.0±5.5% in the Hep3B and Huh7 cells, respectively (Fig. 2A). RUNX3 expression also enhanced CDDP sensitivity in both cell lines; the cell viability with CDDP (100 nM) decreased from 58.7±2.6% to 25.7±4.9%, and from 67.7±4.1% to 25.7±7.5% in the Hep3B and Huh7 cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). We sincerely apologize for these errors and oversights, which have not affected any of the overall conclusions reported in the study, and regret any inconvenience they may have caused.
