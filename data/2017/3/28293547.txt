Purpose:To investigate the specific role of immune responses induced by lentogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) for its antitumor effect.Materials and methods:NDV LaSota strain was used to infect the following human cells: non-small cell lung carcinoma (A549), glioblastoma (U87MG and T98G), mammary gland adenocarcinoma (MCF7 and MDA-MB-453), hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7), transformed embryonic kidney cells (HEK293), primary monocytes, lung fibroblast (HF19), skin fibroblast (NB1RGB) and rat astroglia (RCR-1) at 0.001 multiplicity of infection. NDV-induced cytotoxicity and expression of proinflammatory cytokines were analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.Results:Tumor cells (A549, U87MG, T98G, Huh7, MDA-MB-453, and MCF7) showed viability of Conclusion:Our findings suggest a new perspective regarding the role of IFN-Î» and IL-6 in the mechanism of tumor selectivity and oncolysis of NDV.
