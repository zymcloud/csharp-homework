Interleukin-32α (IL-32α) was reported to exhibit pluripotent pro-inflammatory properties. Recent studies indicate that it promotes the migration and invasion of cancers. We detected the expression of IL-32 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and investigated its role in tumor angiogenesis and invasion. IL-32α expression in HCC was evaluated by real-time PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Secreted serum IL-32α and VEGF concentrations were detected using a custom-made sandwich ELISA. Furthermore, IL-32α was knocked down in HCC cell lines using siRNA and the cell migration and invasion abilities were assessed. IHC staining showed that IL32α-positive particles were mainly located in the cytoplasm of cancer cells, and it was significantly upregulated in the tumor tissues compared with that in peritumoral tissues. Notably, IL-32α was strongly expressed in perivascular areas. The mean serum concentration of IL-32α in HCC patients was significantly higher than that in the control group (571.45±102.28 vs. 144.60±51.172 pg/ml; P
