Background:Current literature is lacking level 1 evidence for surgical and oncologic outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing laparoscopic versus open hepatectomy. Aim was to compare feasibility, safety, and surgical and oncologic efficiency of laparoscopic versus open liver resection (OLR) in management of solitary small (Methods:Patients were randomly assigned to either OLR group (25 patients) or laparoscopic liver resection (LRR) group (LRR: 25 patients). All were treated with curative intent aiming at achieving R0 resection using radiofrequency-assisted technique.Results:LLR had significantly less operative time (120.32 ± 21.58 versus 146.80 ± 16.59 minutes, P Conclusion:LLR is superior to the OLR with significantly shorter duration of hospital stay and does not compromise the oncological outcomes.
