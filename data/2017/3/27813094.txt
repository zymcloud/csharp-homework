Background and objectives:To analyze overall survival (OS) rates for the three curative treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.Methods:Cohort study based on data from a multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) dedicated to HCC. From 2006 to 2013, we included every patient with newly diagnosed HCC, for whom curative treatment (liver transplantation (LT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), surgical resection (SR)) was decided upon.Results:We included 387 consecutive patients. LT was decided in 136 cases, RFA in 131 cases, SR in 120 cases. Sixty-six percent of patients received the planned treatment. Five-year OS on an ITT basis were: 35% for the LT-group, 32% for the RFA-group, 34% for the SR-group (P = 0.77). In multivariate analyses, the main negative prognostic factors were not following the MDT decision (HR: 0.39, CI95% [0.27-0.54], P Conclusion:On an ITT basis, OS was similar whatever the type of curative treatment chosen in MDT. Negative prognostic factors were not following the MDT decision, elevated alpha-fetoprotein, being outside the Milan criteria. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:330-336. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
