Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women and the fourth leading cause of death from cancer. The most common sites of metastasis are the pelvic lymph nodes, vagina, and the pelvic sidewalls. Distant metastases are uncommon but can involve the bone, lung, and liver. Characteristics associated with increased rate of distant metastasis include bulky tumor, endometrial extension, lymph node involvement, and advanced disease. We report the case of a woman with stage II cervical carcinoma, who presented with dysphagia due to cervical cancer metastases to the mediastinum.
