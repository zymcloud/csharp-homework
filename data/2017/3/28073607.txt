Purpose:To compare survival outcomes of small solitary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) treated with thermal ablation vs resection in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cohort.Materials and methods:SEER data (November 2014 submission) were searched for histologic diagnoses of HCC and stage T1 disease (≤ 5-cm solitary tumor without vascular invasion). Comparison was made between thermal ablation and resection as the primary treatment. Overall and disease-specific survival were compared by log-rank tests (stratified for presence of fibrosis) and Cox regression (with tumor size and presence of fibrosis covariates).Results:Of 264 patients with ≤ 2-cm HCCs, 185 underwent thermal ablation and 79 underwent resection. Patients undergoing ablation had higher Ishak scores (P = .0002). There was no difference in survival (observed P = .698, disease-specific P = .446). Of 544 patients with 2.1-4-cm HCCs, 335 underwent thermal ablation and 209 underwent resection. Patients undergoing ablation were more likely to have higher Ishak scores (P Conclusions:There was no difference in overall or disease-specific survival between surgical resection and thermal ablation for T1 HCCs ≤ 4 cm after adjusting for the presence of histologic fibrosis and tumor size in the SEER cohort. Significant benefit was observed with surgery for tumors measuring 4.1-5 cm.
