Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of most common malignant cancers and is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. The prognosis and survival of patients are closely related to the degree of tumor metastasis. The mechanism of HCC metastasis is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of C-reaction protein in promoting migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro. We estimated that CRP is overexpressed in liver cancer tissues and that it promotes invasion and metastasis of HCC in vitro. In the present study, we employed iTRAQ-based mass spectrometry to analyze the HepG2 secretory proteins of CRP siRNA-treated cells and negative control siRNA-treated cells. We identified 109 differentially expressed proteins after silencing CRP, of which 45 were upregulated and 64 were downregulated. Some of the differentially expressed proteins were confirmed by western blot analysis and real-time quantitative PCR. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of CRP substantially abrogates HIF-1Î± expression levels, the luciferase activity of HIF-1Î± and ERK and Akt phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. The present study provides a novel mechanism by which CRP promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Inhibition of CRP suppressed migration, invasion and healing of hepatoma carcinoma cells by decreasing HIF-1Î± activity and CTSD.
