Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported to be highly insensitive to conventional chemotherapy. In the current study, the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (4x44 K) was used in order to identify the differentially expressed genes between HCC and adjacent tissues, and the top 22 differentially expressed genes were confirmed through reverse transcriptionâ€‘quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Among the identified differences in gene expression, expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 12A (TNFRSF12A) was markedly higher in HCC tissue than in adjacent tissue. Previous studies have suggested that TNFRSF12A may serve a role in tumor growth and metastasis, thus in the current study, TNFRSF12A was knocked down in the SMMC7721 cell line through siRNA. This demonstrated that cells exhibited reduced reproductive and metastatic capacity ex vivo. Thus, the results of the current study suggest that TNFRSF12A may be a candidate therapeutic target for cancer including HCC, and additional genes that exhibited significantly different expression from normal adjacent tissues require further study.
