A series of novel 4H-benzo[h]chromenes 4, 6-11, 13, 14; 7H-benzo[h]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidines 15-18, 20, and 14H-benzo[h]chromeno[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine derivatives 19a-e, 24 was prepared. The structures of the synthesized compounds were characterized on the basis of their spectral data. Some of the target compounds were examined for their antiproliferative activity against three cell lines; breast carcinoma (MCF-7), human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2). The cytotoxic behavior has been tested using MTT assay and the inhibitory activity was referenced to three standard anticancer drugs: vinblastine, colchicine and doxorubicin. The bioassays demonstrated that some of the new compounds exerted remarkable inhibitory effects as compared to the standard drugs on the growth of the three tested human tumor cell lines. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) study highlights that the antitumor activity of the target compounds was significantly affected by the lipophilicity of the substituent at 2- or 3- and fused rings at the 2,3-positions.
SAR study; benzochromene; benzochromenopyrimidine; benzochromenotriazolopyrimidine antitumor activities.
