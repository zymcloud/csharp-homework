Aim:Surveillance is recommended for patients with risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) such as viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis (LC). Although populations are at higher risk in Asia, surveillance rates have not been evaluated in those countries. Therefore, we aimed to examine surveillance rates for HCC and to compare predictors for surveillance among each type of liver disease in Japan.Methods:We carried out an observational study using the medical claims data of Japan. A total of 4713 patients who were diagnosed with LC, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were followed for 12 months. We described surveillance rates in patients with HBV or HCV infection or non-viral LC and evaluated potential predictors for follow-up surveillance among them by using multivariable logistic regression analysis, in which we set explanatory variables as sex, age, medical facility, HBV or HCV infection, and LC.Results:The HCC surveillance rate during follow-up was 42.3% among patients with chronic viral hepatitis, 56.5% with viral cirrhosis and 26.0%, with non-viral LC. Significant predictors for follow-up surveillance were presence of LC and hospital visits. Hepatitis B virus-infected patients aged Conclusions:Follow-up surveillance for HCC was not adequately carried out among patients at risk for HCC in Japan, despite of recommendation in guidelines. In future, methodological research might be needed to increase surveillance rates for HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis or those who received treatment at a clinic.
