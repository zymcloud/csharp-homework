The most effective diagnostic tool for the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is determining the differentiation grade of their tumors. However liver biopsies, which are currently the most effective way of determining tumor differentiation grade, have several limitations. The present study was designed to select serum characteristic metabolites that correlate with the differentiation grades of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC, and so could be used in the clinic as a non-invasive method of differentiating patients with different grades of HCC. A total of 58 patients with HBV-related HCC were included in the present study, and divided into three groups according to their tumor differentiation grade. A further 20 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis and 19 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze endogenous metabolites. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to examine the data using MZmine 2.0 software. The 14 metabolites that were highly correlated with specific differentiation grades of HCC were then selected for additional study. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate their clinical value. In total, 5 metabolites were finally identified, including lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0), oleamide, monoglyceride (0:0/15:0/0:0), lysophosphatidylcholine (18:0) and lysophosphatidylcholine [22:5(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)]. All these metabolites exhibited an excellent ability to distinguish different types of HCC with various differentiation grades and the area under the curve of these metabolites was up to 0.942, showing promising clinical value.
