The present study has been designed to determine the effect of folate modulation (deficiency/supplementation) with aging on the promoter methylation of tumor suppressor and proto-oncogenes to understand the underlying mechanism of epigenetic alterations. Folate deficiency was induced for 3 and 5 months in weanling, young and adult groups, and after 3 months of folate deficiency, they were repleted with physiological folate (2 mg/kg diet) and folate oversupplementation (8 mg/kg diet) for another 2 months. The methylation facet in the present study revealed that the combined effect of folate deficiency and aging decreased the methylation index. Folate deficiency with age resulted in the up-regulation of proto-oncogenes (C-MYC and C-JUN) and cell cycle regulator gene Cyclin E as a result of promoter hypomethylation. However, in case of tumor suppressor genes (p53, p15ink4b and p16ink4a), the expression levels were found to be decreased at transcriptional level due to promoter hypermethylation. Upon repletion with physiological folate and folate oversupplementation, we found down-regulation of proto-oncogenes and up-regulation of tumor suppressor genes as a result of promoter hypermethylation and hypomethylation, respectively. Deregulation of these important genes due to folate deficiency may contribute toward the pathogenesis at cellular level.
