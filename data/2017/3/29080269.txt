Recent studies show that variants in some interferon genes together with interferon receptor genes are associated with the outcome of infectious diseases. We examined the association between the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease and the functional polymorphisms within IFNL4, IFNLR1, IFNA1, IFNA2, IFNA5 and IFNAR2 genes (14 loci in all) in a Han Chinese population. A total of 3128 people participated and were divided into 5 groups: healthy controls, natural clearance, chronic hepatitis B(CHB), liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Significant associations were observed for 4 variants in IFNAR2, IFNLR1 with HBV infection, and IFNLR1-rs4649203 was associated with HBV recovery. Moreover, we demonstrated the clear relevance of 5 polymorphisms in IFNA1, IFNA2, IFNL4 with HCC. Three SNPs in IFNL4 gene may be important susceptible factors for the progression of HBV-related liver disease by trend chi-square test. The IFNL4 haplotype conformed by rs12971396_G, rs8113007_T and rs7248668A was more frequent in HCC than CHB and LC group. Three polymorphisms in the 5' region of the IFNL4 gene are associated with the progression of HBV-related liver disease. IFNA1- rs1831583 and IFNA2- rs649053 are associated with the development of HCC. IFNLR1- rs4649203, rs7525481 are predictors for HBV infection, and rs4649203 is a predictor of spontaneous clearance. IFNAR2 -rs1051393, rs12233338 may be predictive markers of HBV infection in the Chinese population.
