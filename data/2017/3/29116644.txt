Ruptured hepatocellular (rHCC) is a rare but life-threatening presentation that often requires acute intervention. In this systematic review we identified 67 eligible studies reporting on 4941 patients with rHCC. Here we present the treatment approaches for the management of rHCC both in the acute setting with regards to management of hemorrhage, as well long-term with regards to oncological treatment.
