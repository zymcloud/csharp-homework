The current treatment modalities for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are discussed in this review. Hepatocellular carcinoma arises in up to 90% of cirrhotic patients, mainly due to chronic viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse. Nearly two-thirds of all patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are diagnosed at advanced stages, thus causing problems with treatment. Regardless of the stage of the disease, interventional radiology offers both curative and palliative treatment options in the management of this disease. Selecting the most appropriate treatment requires an initial staging assessment and detailed clinical and radiologic workup. Treatment allocation is based on liver function, size and number of tumors, macrovascular invasion, and extrahepatic spread of disease.
