Objective:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a multidisciplinary approach in patients' selection with advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) for different therapeutic strategies.Methods:Patients referred at our institution between 2009 and 2012 for AOC were included. Primary multidisciplinary evaluation was performed in all patients. Different strategies included: 1. patients referred to primary neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval surgery (IDS) (group A); 2. patients considered for surgical exploration. After surgical exploration, patients were either considered for primary debulking (PDS; group B), or NACT (group C).Results:A total of 363 patients were included. Of 38 patients (10.5%) in group A, 24 (63%) had sovradiaphragmatic/multiple liver metastases; 14 (37%) were excluded for PDS for anestehesiologic/medical reasons. Of 325 (89.5%) considered for surgical exploration, 295 (91%; group B) had primary surgery with debulking intent (N: 277) and were cytoreduced to no macroscopic disease (R0: N:200; 68%) o minimal RD<5mm (R1: N:77; 26%) or palliative intent (N:18; 6%); 30 (9%; group C) were referred for NACT. Of those, 27 (90%) underwent IDS, 3 had progressive disease. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) was different between the groups: OS: Group A: 34months; Group B: 59months; Group C: 29months; p<0.001. PFS: Group A: 10months; Group B; 21months; Group C: 12months; p<0.001.Conclusions:A multidisciplinary approach to patients referred to a tertiary center with AOC allows optimization of the treatment strategy, based on patients' characteristics (age, performance/nutritional status, comorbidities, functional status) and tumor diffusion (evaluated pre- and intraoperatively).
