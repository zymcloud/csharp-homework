Protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B negatively regulates the insulin and leptin signaling pathways, and, thus, the clinical application of PTP1B inhibitors to the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity is expected. During our studies on PTP1B inhibitors, two furanosesterterpenes and a C21 furanoterpene were obtained as new types of PTP1B inhibitors from two Indonesian marine sponges. (7E, 12E, 20Z, 18S)-Variabilin (1) and (12E, 20Z, 18S)-8-hydroxyvariabilin (2) from Ircinia sp. and furospongin-1 (3) from Spongia sp. inhibited PTP1B activity with IC50 values of 1.5, 7.1, and 9.9μM, respectively. The inhibitory activity of compound 1 against T-cell PTP (TCPTP) was approximately 2-fold that against PTP1B, whereas the vaccinia H-1-related phosphatase (VHR) inhibitory effects of 1 were 4-fold weaker than that of its PTP1B inhibitory activity. Compounds 1-3 at 50μM did not show cytotoxicity against two human cancer cell lines, hepatoma Huh-7 and bladder carcinoma EJ-1. Compound 1 did not enhance the phosphorylation level of Akt, a key downstream effector of the cascade, in Huh-7 cells.
