Apatinib is a novel and highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. Previous studies have suggested that apatinib is safe and effective in some solid tumors. We report one case with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), who received apatinib combined with transhepatic arterial chemotherapy and embolization (TACE), and chemotherapy respectively. TACE was administered three times once a month, using lipiodol 10ml, oxaliplatin 150mg, and tegafur 1g. The dose of apatinib was 500 mg/d from day 4 to 24. After TACE, the patient received chemotherapy of regimen FOLFOX4, oxaliplatin intravenously at 85 mg/m2 on day 1, calcium levofolinate 200 mg/m2 on day 1 and 2, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenously and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenously pumped for 22h on day 1 and 2, cycled every two weeks for seven cycles. He took concurrently apatinib with a dose of 500mg daily from 1 to 10 days per cycle. He was confirmed as partial response (PR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) decreased from 60500 ng/ml to 12.7 ng/ml, and the progression free survival (PFS) time was more than eight months. It indicated that apatinib may be a superior choice for HCC patients.
