Some biliary diseases mimic pancreatic diseases pathologically as well as pathogenetically. Such diseases can be called "biliary diseases with pancreatic counterparts". Biliary intraepithelial neoplasm (BilIN), intraductal papillary neoplasm of bile ducts (IPNB), hepatobiliary mucinous cystic neoplasm (hMCN), and IgG4-inflammatory pseudotumor represent the biliary counterparts of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm (PanIN), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of pancreas (IPMN), pancreatic MCN, and mass forming type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), respectively. BilIN and PanIN represent pre-invasive intraepithelial stages of nodular sclerosing cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, respectively. IPNB and IPMN are grossly visible, predominant papillary, intraductal neoplasms that may progress to invasive carcinoma. Morphologically similar MCNs with subepithelial ovarian-like stroma occur in both the hepatobiliary system as well as the pancreas. IgG4-inflammatory pseudotumor, usually of the lymphoplasmacytic type, and mass forming type 1 AIP represent IgG4-related disease in the biliary tree and pancreas respectively. The biliary tract, which is associated with the peribiliary glands, including the pancreatic acini, can be regarded as an incomplete pancreas, so several diseases mimicking pancreatic diseases may be expected to occur in the biliary tract (biliary diseases with pancreatic counterparts).
Biliary intraepithelial neoplasm; Biliary tract; IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumor; Intraductal papillary neoplasm; Mucinous cystic neoplasm; Peribiliary glands.
