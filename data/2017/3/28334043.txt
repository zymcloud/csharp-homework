Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related human mortalities. Over-activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is important for HCC tumorigenesis and progression. The current study assessed the potential anti-HCC activity by a novel mTOR kinase inhibitor, CC-223. We demonstrate that CC-223, at nM concentrations, induced profound cytotoxic and anti-proliferative activities against established HCC cell lines (HepG2, KYN-2 and Huh-7) and primary human HCC cells. Meanwhile, CC-223 activated caspase-3/-9 and apoptosis in the above HCC cells. CC-223 concurrently blocked mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation, and its cytotoxicity against HCC cells was much more potent than the traditional mTORC1 inhibitors (RAD001 and rapamycin). Further studies demonstrated that CC-223 disrupted mitochondrial function, and induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. On the other hand, ROS scavengers and mPTP blockers (cyclosporin A or sanglifehrin A) largely attenuated CC-223-induced HepG2 cell apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that oral administration of CC-223 dramatically inhibited growth of HepG2 xenografts in severe combined immuno-deficient (SCID) mice. mTORC1/2 activation was also blocked in xenografts with CC-223 administration. Together, CC-223 simultaneously blocks mTORC1/2 and efficiently inhibits human HCC cells.
