Background and objectives:Most conventional staging systems were formulated concerning the tumor burden rather than the severity of liver fibrosis, which plays a central role in tumor promotion. The aim of this study was to formulate a prognostic nomogram comprehensively considering these two aspects for HCC after hepatectomy.Methods:The prognostic significances of the four indicators namely laminin, hyaluronic acid, human procollagen type-III, and collagen type-IV that reflect liver fibrosis were explored in two independent cohorts. A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis. The predictive accuracy of the nomogram was measured by concordance index (C-index) and calibration. The decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical benefit of the nomogram.Results:Preoperative serum laminin level is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC patients after resection. The C-indices of the nomogram in the training and validation cohorts were 0.779 and 0.719, respectively. The calibration showed optimal agreement between the prediction by nomogram and actual observation. Moreover, the C-indices and DCA revealed that the nomogram provided better clinical benefit compared with the BCLC stage, CLIP score, and AJCC 7th edition.Conclusions:The prognostic nomogram constructed on laminin represents a superior predictive model.
