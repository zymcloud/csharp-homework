Although prior studies showed that patients with cirrhosis have a lower risk of developing liver metastases, appropriate workup of incidental liver masses in cirrhotic liver is important for a correct diagnosis. Here we present a case of newly diagnosed liver cirrhosis with multifocal hepatic lesions, which was initially categorized as a LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) 5 lesions. Scintigraphy with 111In-pentetreotide (Octreoscan) indicated a suspected thyroid nodule, later confirmed to represent medullary thyroid carcinoma lesion. The most relevant imaging finding of this rare form of thyroid malignancy is reviewed in this presentation.
LI-RADS; cirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma; medullary thyroid cancer; octreoscan.
