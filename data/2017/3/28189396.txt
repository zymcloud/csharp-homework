Background:Liver cancer ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in man worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent malignant neoplasm of the liver. The sensitivity of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as an HCC diagnostic marker for HCC diagnosis is 39-65%, and one-third patients with HCC are missed using AFP. New biomarkers are needed to diagnose HCC at an earlier stage and to individualize treatment strategies. Hepatocellular carcinoma suppressor 1 (HCCS1) is a newly identified liver tumor suppressor gene.Objective:Our study evaluated the diagnostic value of serum HCCS1 promoter methylation in patients with HCC associated with hepatitis B.Methods:We determined the methylation status of serum HCCS1 promoter in 120 patients with HCC, 146 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 27 healthy controls (HCs) by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). Evaluation of a cohort with 63 patients with HCC and 44 patients with CHB was set as a validation dataset.Results:The frequency of HCCS1 promoter methylation in patients with HCC was significantly higher than that in patients with CHB (PConclusion:HCCS1 has potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with HCC.
