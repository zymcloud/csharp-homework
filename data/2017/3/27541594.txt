Background:Identification of patients with advanced HCC-deriving preferential benefit from sorafenib is desirable, and treatment-related adverse events are potential clinical biomarkers.Methods:Survival and toxicity data for patients with HCC treated with sorafenib at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust from 11/09 to 02/15 were collected retrospectively.Results:Eighty-five eligible patients were identified. The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicities were hypertension (HTN, 45 %), fatigue (8 %), and hand-foot syndrome (HFS, 8 %). Any-grade HFS and/or worsening HTN (HFS/HTN) were experienced by 58 % of patients. Estimated median progression-free and overall survival (OS) were 4.6 (95 % CI 2.8-5.2) and 6.5 (95 % CI 4.9-8.01) months, respectively. Child-Pugh score (p value Conclusion(s):The development of toxicities specific to sorafenib is associated with prolonged survival in a UK-based HCC patient series; prospective assessment of their significance is required.
