Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic and lymphotropic virus with the capabilities of tumorigenesis. We present an HCV-infected patient affected with B-cell lymphomas after suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient exhibited curative effects for lymphomas after treatment with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, which is shown clearly with a positron emission tomography scanner.
