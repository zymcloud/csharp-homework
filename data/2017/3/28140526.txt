The physiological consequences of the Fontan circulation impose risk for hepatic dysfunction and may culminate in hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Consensus regarding appropriate surveillance modalities to diagnose liver disease in Fontan patients is lacking, in part due to the relative lack of strong evidence and prospective studies in this patient population. The goal of this paper is to critically review the current evidence and provide recommendations for the surveillance of hepatic complications in the post-Fontan patient population.
