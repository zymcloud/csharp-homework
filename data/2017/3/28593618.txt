It was widely known that retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) functions as a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor that initiates innate antiviral immunity by detecting exogenous viral RNAs. However, recent studies showed that RIG-I participates in other various cellular activities by sensing endogenous RNAs under different circumstances. For example, RIG-I facilitates the therapy resistance and expansion of breast cancer cells and promotes T cell-independent B cell activation through interferon signaling activation by recognizing non-coding RNAs and endogenous retroviruses in certain situations. While in hepatocellular carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, RIG-I acts as a tumor suppressor through either augmenting STAT1 activation by competitively binding STAT1 against its negative regulator SHP1 or inhibiting AKT-mTOR signaling pathway by directly interacting with Src respectively. These new findings suggest that RIG-I plays more diverse roles in various cellular life activities, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, than previously known. Taken together, the function of RIG-I exceeds far beyond that of a pattern recognition receptor.
