Background:Long-term antiviral therapy has resulted in viral suppression and biochemical response in chronic hepatitis B, although the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma has not been abolished. The Page-B score could be useful to estimate the probability of HCC.Aims:To analyze the effectiveness and safety of entecavir or tenofovir for more than 4 years and the usefulness of Page-B score in the real-world setting.Methods:Analysis of Caucasian chronic hepatitis B subjects treated with entecavir or tenofovir from the prospective, multicenter database CIBERHEP.Results:A total of 611 patients were enrolled: 187 received entecavir and 424 tenofovir. Most were men, mean age 50 years, 32% cirrhotic and 16.5% HBeAg-positive. Mean follow-up was 55 (entecavir) and 49 (tenofovir) months. >90% achieved HBV DNA Conclusions:Entecavir and tenofovir achieved high biochemical and virological response. Renal function remained stable with both drugs. A Page-B cut-off â‰¥10 selected all patients at risk of HCC development.
