Chronic hepatitits B virus remains a public health challenge, infecting more than 240 million people globally and causing 600,000 deaths per year from end-stage liver disease and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Current antiviral therapeutic agents are highly effective at blocking viral replication, but discontinuation of therapy prior to loss of hepatitis B surface antigen generally leads to relapse. New modalities that target host factors of viral persistence such as immune response pathway inhibition hold promise. Other experimental approaches may target virally related persistence factors, including covalently closed circular DNA. All these approaches will require creative new means of assessing proof of biology and proof of mechanism, particularly in the relevant compartment of liver tissue. Furthermore, it is likely to require combinations of modalities in defined patient populations to achieve optimal response. A precompetitive consortium approach may enable companies, regulators, and academic researchers to share best practices and evaluate preclinical and clinical pathways for these novel approaches.
