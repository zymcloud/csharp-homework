3,5-Dimethyl-7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-7-one (DMFC) is a coumarin derivative with anti-cancer activity against human hepatoma cells, but the mechanisms underlying DMFC function in cancer suppression is unknown. In this study, we aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying DMFC anti-cancer activity and determining whether DMFC is effective in suppression of drug-resistant human hepatocellular carcinoma. We show here that DMFC effectively suppresses both the parent and the multidrug-resistant hepatoma cell growth in vitro and DMFC suppresses hepatoma cell growth at least in part through inducing tumor cell apoptosis. In the molecular level, we observed that DMFC treatment decreases Bcl-2 level by a post-transcriptional mechanism and activates Bim transcription to increase Bim mRNA and protein level in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that DMFC-induced Bim interrupts interactions between Bcl-2 and Bax and between Mcl-1 and Bak, resulting in dissociation of Bax from Bcl-2 and Bak from Mcl-1 and subsequent activation of both Bax and Bak. Activation of Bax and Bak leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release. Consistent with its potent apoptosis-inducing activity, DMFC exhibited potent activity against the multidrug-resistant hepatoma xenograft growth in vivo. Therefore, we determine that DMFC suppresses hepatoma growth through decreasing Bcl-2 and increasing Bim to induce tumor cell apoptosis and hold great promise for further development as a therapeutic agent to treat chemoresistant hepatoma.
