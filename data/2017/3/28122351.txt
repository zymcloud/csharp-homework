Aberrant chromobox (CBX) family protein expression has been reported in a variety of human malignancies. However, the role of CBX6 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and patient prognosis remains unknown. In this study, we found that CBX6 was frequently up-regulated in HCC clinical samples and HCC cell lines and that CBX6 expression was significantly correlated with larger tumor sizes (≥ 5 cm, p = 0.011) and multiple tumors (n ≥ 2, p = 0.018). Survival analyses indicated that patients with higher CBX6 expression levels had significantly shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with lower CBX6 expression levels, and multivariate analyses confirmed that increased CBX6 expression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for HCC patients. Functional study demonstrated that CBX6 profoundly promoted HCC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, and mechanistic investigation revealed that the S100A9/NF-κB/MAPK pathway was essential for mediating CBX6 function. In conclusion, our results represent the first evidence that CBX6 contributes to tumor progression and indicate that the protein may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC and as a therapeutic target in the treatment of the disease.
