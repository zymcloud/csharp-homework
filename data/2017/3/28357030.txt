Aim:To identify predictive factors associated with long-term patient and graft survival (> 15 years) in liver transplant recipients.Methods:Medical charts of all de novo adult liver transplant recipients (n = 140) who were transplanted in Hamburg between 1997 and 1999 were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 155 transplantations were identified in this time period (15 re-transplantations). Twenty-six orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients were early lost to follow-up due to moving to other places within 1 year after transplantation. All remaining 114 patients were included in the analysis. The following recipient factors were analysed: Age, sex, underlying liver disease, pre-OLT body mass index (BMI), and levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, creatinine and gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT), as well as warm and cold ischemia times. Furthermore, the following donor factors were assessed: Age, BMI, cold ischemia time and warm ischemia time. All surviving patients were followed until December 2014. We divided patients into groups according to their underlying diagnosis: (1) hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 5, 4%); (2) alcohol toxic liver disease (n = 25, 22.0%); (3) primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 6, 5%); (4) autoimmune liver diseases (n = 7, 6%); (5) hepatitis C virus cirrhosis (n = 15, 13%); (6) hepatitis B virus cirrhosis (n = 21, 19%); and (7) other (n = 35, 31%). The group "other" included rare diagnoses, such as acute liver failure, unknown liver failure, stenosis and thrombosis of the arteria hepatica, polycystic liver disease, Morbus Osler and Caroli disease.Results:The majority of patients were male (n = 70, 61%). Age and BMI at the time point of transplantation ranged from 16 years to 69 years (median: 53 years) and from 15 kg/m2 to 33 kg/m2 (median: 24), respectively. Sixty-six OLT recipients (58%) experienced a follow-up of 15 years after transplantation. Recipient's age (P = 0.009) and BMI (P = 0.029) were identified as risk factors for death by χ2-test. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed BMI or age above the median as predictors of decreased long-term survival (P = 0.008 and P = 0.020). Hepatitis B as underlying disease showed a trend for improved long-term survival (P = 0.049, χ2-test, P = 0.055; Kaplan-Meier analysis, Log rank). Pre-transplant bilirubin, creatinine, ALT and gamma-GT levels were not associated with survival in these patients of the pre-era of the model of end stage liver disease.Conclusion:The recipients' age and BMI were predictors of long-term survival after OLT, as well as hepatitis B as underlying disease. In contrast, donors' age and BMI were not associated with decreased survival. These findings indicate that recipient factors especially have a high impact on long-term outcome after liver transplantation.
