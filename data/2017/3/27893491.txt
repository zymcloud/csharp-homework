Background and aim:Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common complication after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is the first clinical study to evaluate the role of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) with TACE in HCC for the prevention of thromboembolism complications (PVT).Patients and methods:This study was carried out on 40 patients with HCC requiring TACE who presented to the Tropical Medicine Department, Tanta University and Interventional Radiology Department of Ain-Shams University Hospitals starting from April 2015. Patients were divided in two groups: group I included 20 patients with HCC treated by TACE only. Group II included 20 patients with HCC treated by TACE and an adjuvant dose of LMWH. Radiological assessment of efficacy of procedure and detection of PVT as a complication was performed using ultrasound abdomen and pelvis and triphasic spiral computed tomography with contrast.Results:This study was carried out on 40 patients with HCC requiring TACE who presented to the Tropical Medicine Department of Tanta University and Interventional Radiology Department of Ain-Shams University Hospitals. The incidence of PVT after TACE was higher in group I than group II, with seven cases in group I and only one case in group II.Conclusion:LMWH with TACE in HCC is strongly recommended for prevention of thromboembolism complications (PVT). However, larger randomized-controlled studies are needed to confirm these obvious findings.
