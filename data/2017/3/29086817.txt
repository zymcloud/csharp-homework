Background:Thiazoles and 1,3,4-thiadiazoles have been reported to possess various pharmacological activities.Results:A novel series of thiazoles carrying 1,3,4-thiadiazole core were designed and prepared via the reaction of the 2-(4-methyl-2-phenylthiazole-5-carbonyl)-N-phenylhydrazinecarbo-thioamide with the appropriate hydrazonoyl chlorides. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed based on elemental and spectral analysis as well as their alternative syntheses. The cytotoxic potency of the newly synthesized thiadiazoles was evaluated by their growth inhibitory potency in liver HepG2 cancer cell line. Also, the structure activity relationship was studied.Conclusions:All the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity against liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) using MTT assay. The results revealed that the compounds 12d, 12c, 6g, 18b, 6c, and 6f (IC50 = 0.82, 0.91, 1.06, 1.25, 1.29 and 1.88 µM, respectively) had good antitumor activity against liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) when compared with the standard drug Doxorubicin (IC50 = 0.72 µM). Graphical abstract A facile synthesis and anticancer activity of some novel thiazoles carrying 1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety.
