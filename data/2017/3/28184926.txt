Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has frequent incidence and the third highest mortality rate among cancers in the world. This study aimed to clarify the roles of miR-217 and metadherin (MTDH) in HCC. First, we identified that miR-217 expression was downregulated and MTDH expression was upregulated in the HCC tissues. Functional studies revealed that miR-217 negatively regulated MTDH expression via binding to the 3'-untranslated region of MTDH mRNA in the HCC cells. In our further studies, the miR-217 overexpression resulted in downregulation of MTDH expression in HCC cells. The miR-217 overexpression in HCC cells suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion inducing apoptosis. Taken together, our study provides the initial evidence that the increase of MTDH expression is associated with the decrease of miR-217 expression in HCC. This study also suggests that miR-217 inhibits malignant progression of HCC in vitro and may be used for miRNA-based therapy, possibly via directly targeting MTDH.
