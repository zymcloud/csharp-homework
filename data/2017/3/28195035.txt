Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pre-S2 mutant represents an HBV oncoprotein that is accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and manifests as type II ground glass hepatocytes (GGHs). Pre-S2 mutant can induce ER stress and initiate multiple ER stress-dependent or -independent cellular signal pathways, leading to growth advantage of type II GGH. Importantly, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathways are consistently activated throughout the liver tumorigenesis in pre-S2 mutant transgenic mice and in human HCC tissues, leading to hepatocyte proliferation, metabolic disorders, and HCC tumorigenesis. In this review, we summarize the pre-S2 mutant-induced mTOR signal pathways and its implications in HBV-related HCC tumorigenesis. Clinically, the presence of pre-S2 mutant exhibits a high resistance to antiviral treatment and carries a high risk of HCC development in patients with chronic HBV infection. Targeting at pre-S2 mutant-induced mTOR signal pathways may thus provide potential strategies for the prevention or therapy of HBV-associated HCC.
