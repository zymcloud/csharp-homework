Purpose:To compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with that of multiphase computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of tumor response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:Fifty patients (41 men, 9 women; mean age, 53 years±12.5 [SD]) with a total of 70 HCCs (mean size, 5cm±3 [SD]) were evaluated. Post-TACE therapeutic assessment of HCC was done at 4 weeks. Patients with TACE done earlier and reporting with suspicion for recurrence were also included. Patients with hepatic masses seen on ultrasound were enrolled and subjected to CEUS, multiphase CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hyperenhancing area at the tumor site on arterial phase of CEUS/multiphase CT/MRI was termed as residual disease (RD), the patterns of which were described on CEUS. Diagnostic accuracies of CEUS and MPCT were compared to that of MRI that was used as the reference standard.Results:CEUS detected RD in 43/70 HCCs (61%). RD had a heterogeneous pattern in 22/43 HCCs (51%). Sensitivities of CEUS and multiphase CT were 94% (34/36; 95% CI: 81-99%) and 50% (18/36; 95% CI: 33-67%) respectively. Significant difference in sensitivity was found between CEUS and multiphase CT (P=0.0001). CEUS and multiphase CT had 100% specificity (95% CI: 83-100%).Conclusion:CEUS is a useful technique for detecting RD in HCC after TACE. For long term surveillance, CEUS should be complemented with multiphase CT/MRI for a comprehensive evaluation.
