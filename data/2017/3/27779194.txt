Objectives:This study was performed to evaluate long-term outcome of indeterminate nodules detected on cirrhotic liver and to develop risk prediction model for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression of indeterminate nodules on hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhotic liver.Methods:Indeterminate nodules up to 2 cm with uncertain malignant potential detected on computed tomography of cirrhotic liver during HCC surveillance were analyzed retrospectively. HCC risk prediction model of indeterminate nodules in HBV-related cirrhotic liver was deduced based on result of Cox regression analysis.Results:A total of 494 indeterminate nodules were included. Independent risk factors of HCC progression were old age, arterial enhancement, large nodule size, low serum albumin level, high serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) level, and prior HCC history in all included subjects. In subjects with chronic hepatitis B, old age (year; hazard ratio (HR)=1.06; P1 cm; HR=7.34; PConclusions:We developed a useful and accurate risk score model for predicting HCC progression of indeterminate nodules detected on HBV-related cirrhotic liver.
