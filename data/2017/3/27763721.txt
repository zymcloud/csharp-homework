Liver cancer is a major global health problem being the sixth most common cancer and the third cause of cancer-related death, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) representing more than 90% of primary liver cancers. Mounting evidence suggests that, compared with their normal counterparts, many types of cancer cell have increased levels of ROS. Therefore, cancer cells need to combat high levels of ROS, especially at early stages of tumor development. Recent studies have revealed that ROS-mediated regulation of redox-sensitive proteins (redox sensors) is involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of many human diseases, including cancer. Unraveling the altered functions of redox sensors and the underlying mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis is critical for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. For this reason, redox proteomics has been developed for the high-throughput screening of redox sensors, which will benefit the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCC. In this review, we will briefly introduce several novel redox proteomics techniques that are currently available to study various oxidative modifications in hepatocarcinogenesis and summarize the most important discoveries in the study of redox processes related to the development and progression of HCC.
