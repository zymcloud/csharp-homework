The incidence of skin, most HPV-related, liver, and lung cancers can be reduced through primary prevention. Morbidity from breast and testicular cancers can be reduced through secondary prevention. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that predict engagement in primary and secondary prevention behaviors for these cancers. We investigated the roles of knowledge of cancer prevention, perceived importance of cancer prevention, and self-efficacy to engage in prevention steps in order to predict college students' actual engagement in cancer prevention behaviors (CPB). Participants were 315 undergraduates who completed an online survey to assess these constructs. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to model knowledge, self-efficacy, and perceived importance as predictors of CPB for a range of cancers. Self-efficacy predicted CPB similarly across all cancers such that having a higher level of self-efficacy to prevent the cancer predicted having engaged in more CPB. Increase in knowledge predicted an increase in the frequency of CPB for skin and HPV-related cancers. Perceived importance of prevention predicted skin cancer CPB. These findings can be used to tailor cancer prevention programs for undergraduates to achieve greatest impact.
