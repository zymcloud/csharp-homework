Purpose:To identify gene mutations in tumors undergoing transarterial embolization and explore the relationship between gene mutations and tumor response to embolization.Materials and methods:This was a retrospective review that included 17 patients with primary or metastatic liver tumors treated with embolization and had specimens analyzed for a 341-gene panel next-generation sequence assay. Pathologic conditions included hepatocellular, carcinoid, pancreatic neuroendocrine, melanoma, medullary thyroid, and liver acinar-cell carcinoma. Disease, procedure data, and tumor response data were collected. Dimensionality reduction was performed by using principal component analysis. A linear support vector machine was used to learn a prediction rule and identify the genes most predictive of objective tumor response (partial or complete) per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors. Cross-validation was used to test the prediction on the holdout set. Permutation testing was used to determine statistical significance of prediction accuracy. Recursive feature elimination was used to identify the most predictive genes.Results:At 4 months after embolization, 9 tumors showed a response and 8 did not. Using the top two principal components, prediction accuracy of the gene mutation signature was 70% (±11%), which was statistically significant (P Conclusions:This study identifies gene mutations in tumors treated with transarterial embolization. A gene-mutation signature obtained from the mutation data suggests that upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may be associated with sensitivity to embolization.
