High mortality rates in ovarian and liver cancer are largely a result of resistance to currently used chemotherapy. Here, we investigated genotoxic and pro-oxidant effects of metformin (MET) and epothilone A (A) in combination with respect to apoptosis in HepG2 and SKOV-3 cancer cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was studied using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluoresein diacetate, and samples were analyzed for the presence and absence of the N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Expression of genes involved in programmed cell death, oxidative and alkylating DNA damage was measured. Probes were analyzed in the presence of Akt or nuclear factor-ÎºB inhibitor. Compared to either drug alone, combination of epothilone A and metformin was more potent; decreased Akt level; and elevated percentage of apoptotic cells, induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and elevated the sub-G1 cell population by increasing the mRNA level of caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and H2AX. The anticancer effect of the drug combination was partially reversed by NAC supplementation, suggesting that ROS generation is required to induce apoptosis. The present study demonstrates that novel combination such as epothilone A and MET show promise in expanding ovarian and liver cancer therapy.
