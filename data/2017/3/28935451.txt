Background:Western guidelines recommend resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in so-called ideal cirrhotic patients with a Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0-A tumour. This study compares short-term outcomes following resection between patients defined as ideal and nonideal according to the BCLC guidelines.Methods:This prospective single-centre open study (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02145013) included all cirrhotic patients with HCC referred for resection from 2014 to 2016. Mortality, morbidity, unresolved liver decompensation, and readmission were measured.Results:The study population included 65 consecutive patients: 32 (49%) ideal and 33 (51%) nonideal. Ideal and nonideal groups did not differ in mortality (3% vs. 6%; p = 0.57), morbidity (53% vs. 73%; p = 0.10), or unresolved liver decompensation (6% vs. 15%; p = 0.23) at 90 days. The readmission rate was higher in the nonideal (21%) than in the ideal group (3%; p = 0.02).Conclusion:Straying from the current guidelines for resection in a selected subset of nonideal patients doubled the number of resections performed for treating HCC, with satisfactory short-term outcomes. These results argue for the expansion of the acknowledged BCLC guidelines.
