Background and objectives:Gastric cancer in young patients is rare. We analyzed the clinicopathological features and prognosis of early-onset gastric carcinoma.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed patients with gastric adenocarcinoma aged ≤45 years and >45 years at our institution over a 17-year period. Clinicopathological features were compared and survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:A total of 121 patients with gastric carcinoma aged ≤45 years were identified. The young group (YG) had a higher incidence of stage III/IV disease (86.8% vs. 57.9%, P < 0.001), poorly-differentiated carcinoma (95.9% vs. 74.4%, P < 0.001), and signet-cell type tumor (88.4% vs. 32.2%, P < 0.001) relative to the older group (OG). The majority of tumors were in the middle third of the stomach in both groups (P = 0.108). Three-year survival in the YG was 87.1%, 32.2%, and 6.9% in stage I/II, III, and IV disease, respectively. Surgical intervention in young patients with advanced carcinoma was not associated with improved survival. Although median survival was shorter in the YG compared to the OG (11.7 vs. 41.0 months, P < 0.001), stage-specific survival was similar.Conclusion:Early-onset gastric cancer demonstrates advanced stage of disease, and a high incidence of poorly-differentiated and signet-cell type carcinoma. Overall survival is poor with no added benefit to surgical intervention in advanced disease.
