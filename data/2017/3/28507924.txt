Background and Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. Knowledge and adherence to HCC surveillance guidelines has been associated with earlier detection. We sought to evaluate characteristics and outcomes following HCC diagnosis in patients screened for HCC in a large academic liver center versus patients diagnosed and referred from the community. Methods: We reviewed the records of patients diagnosed with HCC in the liver center of an academic institution from January 1999 till December 2013. Patients were classified into two groups: patients followed in our hepatology clinic and patients with HCC recently referred to our center. Univariate analysis was performed using chi-squared test and multivariate analysis was performed using SPSS 22.0. Results: The records of 410 patients were reviewed, and included 77.3% of patients referred from the community and 22.7% of patients followed in our clinic. In the clinic group, 75.6% were identified with one nodule at initial diagnosis, compared to 65.6% in the referral group. Patients in the referral group were more likely to present with tumors â‰¥5 cm at diagnosis, with 28.7% compared to 5.4% in the clinic group (p < 0.0001). Patients referred from the community were also less likely to undergo transplant, with 32.2% as compared to 48.4% of the clinic group (p < 0.004). Conclusion: Patients with chronic liver disease managed in an academic liver center present in the early stage of HCC diagnosis and are more likely to meet the Milan criteria and undergo transplant. Early referral to a specialized transplant center, if feasible, where a multidisciplinary approach is utilized might be essential in the management of chronic liver disease.
