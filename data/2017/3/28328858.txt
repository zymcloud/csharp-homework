Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and the incidence is increasing as a result of growing hepatitis B and C virus infections. Primary clear cell carcinoma of the liver (PCCCL) is a rare subgroup of primary HCC, which has low metastatic potential and infrequently reported in literature. Retroperitoneal and intrahepatic metastasis of PCCCL has not been reported previously.Case summary:Here, we present a 55-year-old male with retroperitoneal and intrahepatic metastasis of PCCCL who is managed with surgical method and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) at our institution. When the patient is followed up in 16 months after surgery and TACE, he is alive without any extrahepatic metastasis and abnomal liver function.Conclusion:We concluded that surgical resection of retroperitoneal metastasis and TACE of the intrahepatic tumors provided an appropriate strategy for the patient with unresectable PCCCL accompanied with extra-hepatic metastasis.
