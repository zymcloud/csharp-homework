Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of all cases of primary liver cancer, and the majority of patients with HCC are deprived of effective curative methods. Osthole is a Chinese herbal medicine which has been reported to possess various pharmacological functions, including hepatocellular protection. In the present study, we investigated the anticancer activity of osthole using HCC cell lines. We found that osthole inhibited HCC cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest, triggered DNA damage and suppressed migration in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that osthole not only contributed to cell cycle G2/M phase arrest via downregulation of Cdc2 and cyclin B1 levels, but also induced DNA damage via an increase in ERCC1 expression. In addition, osthole inhibited the migration of HCC cell lines by significantly downregulating MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Finally, we demonstrated that osthole inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via increasing the expression of epithelial biomarkers E-cadherin and Î²-catenin, and significantly decreasing mesenchymal N-cadherin and vimentin protein expression. These results suggest that osthole may have potential chemotherapeutic activity against HCC.
