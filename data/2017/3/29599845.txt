Pedunculated hepatocellular carcinoma (P-HCC) is a rare type of HCC, defined as a carcinoma protruding from the liver with or without a pedicle with a low degree of liver invasion. The present study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of blood supply of P-HCC prior to and following transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment. Angiographic findings prior to and following TACE treatment in 39 patients with P-HCC were analyzed retrospectively. Angiography performed at the first TACE session revealed 70 tumor-feeding arteries collectively in all patients, including 31/70 (44.0%) extrahepatic parasitic arteries in 23/39 patients (59.0%). The intrahepatic arteries served as the main blood supply to P-HCC in all patients. Extrahepatic collateral blood supplies to P-HCCs were significantly associated with larger tumor diameter (χ2=164.000, P<0.001), but not tumor location (χ2=7.358, P=0.061). Following repeated TACE treatment, all angiographies revealed a total of 131 tumor feeding arteries collectively in all patients, including intrahepatic arteries (54/131) and extrahepatic collateral arteries (78/131) in 31 patients (79.5%). Compared with angiographies performed at the initial TACE treatment, these results also demonstrated an increase in the number of extrahepatic collateral arteries, which produced 47 new blood vessels (χ2=4.278, P=0.039). P-HCC tumor lesions readily acquired a parasitic blood supply from adjacent vessels following repeated TACE. Intrahepatic arteries functioned as the main blood supply for P-HCC, whereas extrahepatic collateral arteries were complementary to P-HCC, regardless of whether the patient was pre- or post-TACE. Extrahepatic collateral supplies to P-HCCs that originated from adjacent vessels were rich, were closely associated with tumor size, and were prone to be newly established following repeated TACE.
