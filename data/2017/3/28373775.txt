Aim:To analyze cytokine levels and to identify their association with outcome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with radiotherapy (RT).Methods:Patients with HCC who were treated with RT were eligible for this prospective study. Blood samples were collected before and after RT, and serum cytokine levels including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α were analyzed.Results:Between 2008 and 2009, 51 patients were enrolled in this study. Baseline IL-6 level was high in patients with a history of pre-RT treatment. Median survival was 13.9 mo with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a significant factor (P = 0.020). Median failure-free survival (FFS) for infield, outfield-intrahepatic and extrahepatic failures were 23.3, 11.5 and 12.0 mo, respectively. Sex and baseline IL-6 level were associated with infield FFS, and baseline IL-10 level was correlated with outfield-intrahepatic FFS. For extrahepatic FFS, AFP was significant (P = 0.034). Patients with a baseline IL-6 level of ≥ 9.7 pg/mL showed worse infield FFS (P = 0.005), and this significance was observed only in treatment-non-naïve patients (P = 0.022).Conclusion:In addition to AFP, cytokines seem useful in predicting infield and outfield-intrahepatic failure. Serum cytokines could be useful biomarkers for predicting RT outcome in HCC.
