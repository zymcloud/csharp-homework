Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-X protein (HBx) plays critical role in inducing the malignant transformation of liver cells. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) expression is closely related to hepatocarcinogenesis. We report that Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-myc expression positively associated with AFP(+)/HBV(+) hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) tissues, and the expression of the stemness markers CD44, CD133 and EpCAM was significantly higher in AFP(+)/HBV(+) HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues or AFP (-)/HBV(-) HCC tissues. AFP expression turned on prior to expression of Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-myc, and the stemness markers CD44, CD133 and EpCAM in the normal human liver L-02 cell line or CHL cell lines upon transfection with MCV-HBx vectors. Stem-like cells generated more tumour colonies compared to primary cells, and xenografts induced tumourigenesis in nude mice. Expression of reprogramming-related proteins was significantly enhanced in HLE cells while transfected with pcDNA3.1-afp vectors. The specific PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 inhibited the effects of pcDNA3.1-afp vectors. AFP-siRNA vectors were able to inhibit tumour colony formation and reprogramming-related gene expression. Altogether, HBx stimulates AFP expression to induce natural reprogramming of liver cells, and AFP plays a critical role in promoting the initiation of HCC progenitor/stem cells. AFP may be a potential novel biotarget for combating HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
