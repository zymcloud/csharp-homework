Background:Refractory ascites is a serious post-hepatectomy complication in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In order to avoid this complication, surgeons should preserve as much liver parenchyma as possible in performing hepatectomy in such patients. However, we still occasionally encounter refractory ascites even after limited or small hepatectomy. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for post-hepatectomy refractory ascites in cirrhotic patients, focusing on limited or small hepatectomy.Patients and methods:The data of 73 cirrhotic patients with HCC who underwent limited or small hepatectomy were analyzed. Limited or small hepatectomy was defined as hepatectomy equal to or of less than subsegmentectomy. We compared the clinicopathological factors between patients with and without postoperative refractory ascites.Results:Fourteen cirrhotic patients suffered postoperative refractory ascites. Total cholesterol, duration of operation, duration of Pringle maneuver, resection of segment VII, intraoperative blood loss, and intraoperative blood transfusion were found to be significant risk factors for postoperative refractory ascites in univariate analyses. Multivariate analysis revealed that resection of segment VII was an independent risk factor.Conclusion:Resection of segment VII necessitates extensive dissection of the right triangular or coronary ligaments, which could explain that it was an independent risk factor for post-hepatectomy refractory ascites. Surgeons should avoid extensive dissection of these ligaments in order to avoid this detrimental complication.
