Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) plays an important role in many cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study is to investigate the association of the DR4 polymorphisms C626G (Thr209Arg, rs20575) and A683C (Glu228Ala, rs20576) with the occurrence of HCC in Egyptian patients chronically infected with HCV. The study included 80 patients with HCV-related HCC (group 1) and 80 patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis (group 2) who are naïve to treatment. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. Genotyping of TRAIL receptor DR4 polymorphism C626G rs20575 and A683C rs20576 SNP was done by Real-Time PCR using taqman probes technology. The mean age of HCC patients was 57.6 ± 8.4 years with 62 patients (77.5%) were males. While group 2 mean age was 49.5 ± 10.29 years with 50% were males. The frequency distribution of rs20575 genotypes showed a statistically significant difference between the two studied groups (P = 0.02), the carriers of the C allele were 2.01 times more likely to develop HCC than the carriers of the G allele (P = 0.003), while no significant difference in rs20576 genotypes distribution was found between the studied groups (P = 0.680). On combining the carriers of C allele of rs20575 and the carriers of A allele of rs20576, a significant difference was detected (P > 0.001) with 2.85 higher risk of HCC development in patients who carried both genetic risk alleles simultaneously. The significant difference in DR4 polymorphisms among HCC and cirrhotic patients suggests their role as potential risk factors of HCC development.
