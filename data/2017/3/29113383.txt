Background:The serum microRNAs have been reported as potential biomarkers for hepatitis virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, their role in aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-related HCC to has not yet been evaluated.Materials and methods:We conducted a case-control study, including 366 HCC cases and 662 controls without any evidence of tumors, to identify and assess diagnostic and prognostic potential of serum microRNAs for AFB1-related HCC. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to elucidate diagnostic performance, and to compare the microRNAs with Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) at a cutoff of 20 ng/mL (AFP20) and 400 ng/mL (AFP400).Results:We found 8 differentially expressed microRNAs via the microRNA array analysis; however, only microRNA-4651 was further identified to detect AFB1-positive HCC but not AFB1-negative HCC. For AFB1-positive HCC, microRNA-4651 showed higher accuracy and sensitivity than AFP400 (AUC, 0.85 vs. 0.72; Sensitivity, 78.1% vs. 43.0%). Compared to AFP20, microRNA-4651 exhibited higher potential in identifying small-size (0.68 vs. 0.84 for AUC and 36.7% vs. 75.5% for sensitivity, respectively) and early-stage HCC (0.69 vs. 0.84 for AUC and 38.7% vs. 75.7% for sensitivity, respectively). Additionally, miR-4651 was also associated with HCC prognosis (hazard risk value, 2.67 for overall survival and 3.62 for tumor recurrence analysis).Conclusions:These data suggest that serum microRNA-4651 may be a useful marker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis, especially AFB1-positive cases.
