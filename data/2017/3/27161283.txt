Aim:To clarify the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of de novo hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using serial gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.Methods:The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. After review of 1007 MRI examinations in 240 patients with chronic liver disease, 17 newly developed hypervascular HCCs in 16 patients detected by follow-up from initial MRI examination without hepatocellular nodules were evaluated. The clinical and MRI findings such as previous treatment history for HCC, period to hypervascular HCC onset, presence or absence of hypovascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase before hypervascularization, and intralesional fat component were recorded or evaluated. Statistical evaluations included Fisher's exact test, Ï‡2 -test, and Mann-Whitney U-test.Results:In 17 HCCs, 12 (71%) were de novo hypervascular HCC without showing hypovascular hypointense nodule on hepatobiliary phase before hypervascularization (de novo group) and 5 (29%) were hypervascularized HCC developed during multistep hepatocarcinogenesis (multistep group). The incidence of previous treatment history for HCC in the de novo group (91%) was significantly higher than that in the multistep group (20%) (P = 0.013). The duration to hypervascular HCC onset from initial examination was shorter in the de novo group (mean, 291 days) than in the multistep group (mean, 509 days) (P = 0.035). The incidence of fat-containing lesion in the de novo group (0%) was lower than that in the multistep group (40%) (P = 0.074).Conclusion:De novo hypervascular HCC is characterized by rapid growth, patients with previous treatment history for HCC, and lack of intralesional fat, compared to hypervascular HCC with multistep progression.
