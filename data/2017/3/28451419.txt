Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the principal primary liver tumor, representing the third largest cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. The actual reference standard systemic treatment for advanced HCC is represented by sorafenib, a multi-targeted orally active small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Sorafenib has exhibited a good general safety profile in multiple clinical trials. However, adverse drug-associated events are common, occasionally severe, and special attention should be paid to cardiovascular adverse events, particularly in patients with risk factors or known heart disease. In the present study, the case of a patient with no known cardiovascular risk factors affected by highly enhancing advanced HCC in cirrhotic liver, who died during successful sorafenib monotherapy, is reported.
