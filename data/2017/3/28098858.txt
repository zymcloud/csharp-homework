MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play critical roles in tumor progression including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, the underlying mechanisms need further investigation. Previous study reported that loss of miR-345 expression indicated a poor prognosis of HCC patients. This study evaluated whether loss of miR-345 could promote the tumor metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) of HCC by targeting interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1)-mediated mTOR/STAT3/AKT signaling. Underexpression of miR-345 was identified in 65 cases of human HCC compared to matched tumor-adjacent tissues by qRT-PCR. Moreover, we found that reduced expression of mi-345 was observed in HCC cell lines. The restoration of miR-345 inhibited cell migration and invasion in HCCLM3 cells, while its loss facilitated the cell mobility of HepG2 cells. Furthermore, miR-345 over-expression reduced lung metastases of HCC cells in nude mice. Notably, miR-345 overexpression prohibited, while its knockdown enhanced the EMT process of HCC cell lines in vitro. Bioinformatics software predicted that IRF1 was a direct target of miR-345. We then observed the negative regulation of miR-345 on IRF1 protein expression and the direct binding between them was further verified by dual-luciferase assays in HCC cells. In addition, over-expression of IRF1 mRNA was inversely correlated with the level of miR-345 in HCC specimens. Restoration of IRF1 resulted in promoted EMT and cell mobility in miR-345 overexpressing HCCLM3 cells. It was found that mTOR/STAT3/AKT pathway and its downstream targets including Slug, Snail and Twist may be involved in IRF1 mediated EMT process. In conclusion, miR-345 acts as an inhibitor of EMT process in HCC cells by targeting IRF1 and this study highlights the potential effects of miR-345 on prognosis and treatment of HCC.
