Although enantioselective accumulation of chiral pesticide has been reported in organisms, the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the effects of chiral pesticide metalaxyl on CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2B2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A were investigated in human hepatoma HepG2, rat hepatic H4IIE, chicken hepatic LMH and grass carp hepatic L8824 cells. Moreover, the residual concentrations and enantiomeric ratios (ERs) of metalaxyl were also detected in the medium. The results showed the responses of these CYP450s to metalaxyl were enzyme-dependent and species-dependent in the four cells. CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP2B1 were induced in HepG2 cells, CYP2A1 and CYP2B1 were induced in H4IIE cells, CYP1A1 and CYP2B1 were induced in LMH cells, and CYP2B1 was induced in L8824 cells. The enantioselective residual of metalaxyl was detected in the medium and found to be species-specific. HepG2, H4IIE and LMH cells were inclined to attenuate S-metalaxyl and lead to decrease of ER of metalaxyl, while L8824 cells were inclined to remove R-metalaxyl and resulted in an inverse shift of ER. These findings suggest an enantioselective metabolism of metalaxyl in various species which is not only related with CYP450s and CYP450 enzyme-specific, but also species-specific.
