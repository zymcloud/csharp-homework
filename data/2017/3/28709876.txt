Background:Surgical resection is an established therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. However, controversies exist when CRC liver and lung metastases (CLLMs) are found concomitantly or when recurrence develops after either liver or lung resection. No predictive score model is available to risk stratify these patients in preparation for surgery, and cure has not yet been reported.Patients and methods:All consecutive patients who had undergone surgery for CLLMs at our institution during a 20-year period were reviewed. Our policy was to propose sequential surgery of both sites with perioperative chemotherapy, if the strategy was potentially curative. Overall survival, disease-free survival, and cure were evaluated.Results:Sequential resection was performed in 150 patients with CLLMs. The median number of liver and lung metastases resected was 3 and 1, respectively. The median follow-up period was 59 months (range, 7-274 months). The median, 5-year, and 10-year overall survival was 76 months, 60%, and 35% respectively. CRC that was metastatic at the initial diagnosis (P = .012), a prelung resection carcinoembryonic antigen level > 100 ng/mL (P = .014), a prelung resection cancer antigen 19-9 level > 37 U/mL (P = .034), and an interval between liver and lung resection of < 24 months (P = .024) were independent poor prognostic factors for survival. The 5-year survival was significantly different for patients with ≤ 2 and ≥ 3 risk factors (77.3% vs. 26.5%). Of 75 patients with ≥ 5 years of follow-up data available from the first metastasis resection, 15 (20%) with disease-free survival ≥ 5 years were considered cured. The use of targeted therapy was the only independent predictor of cure.Conclusion:Curative-intent surgery provides good long-term survival and offers a chance of cure in select patients. Patients with ≤ 2 risk factors are good candidates for sequential resection.
