Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invasion and metastasis are mediated by a complicated signal transduction network and downstream cytoskeletal and adhesion molecules. In this study, a microarray-based analysis revealed a dramatic increase in filamin C (FLNC), which is commonly expressed in muscle rather than in liver cells, in the two metastatic HCC cell lines MHCC97L and HCCLM3. Clinicopathological studies showed that increased FLNC expression was associated with microvascular invasion and poor prognosis. Specific hypomethylation was identified within the FLNC promoter region in HCC cell lines and patient tumor samples, which might contribute to the ectopic overexpression of FLNC. FLNC downregulation inhibited cell migration and impaired cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Mechanistic studies suggested that FLNC interacts with mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and that FLNC downregulation inhibited MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activation. Xenographic tumor transplantation experiments in nude mice further confirmed the role of FLNC in HCC progression and metastasis. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which the cytoskeletal protein FLNC enhances the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway during tumorigenesis.
