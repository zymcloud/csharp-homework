Background & aims:The strongest genetic risk factors in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are encoded in the HLA complex. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have been reported in up to 94% of PSC patients, but their clinical significance and immunogenetic basis are ill defined. We aimed to characterize clinical and genetic associations of ANCA in PSC.Methods:Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were analysed with indirect immunofluorescence in 241 Norwegian PSC patients. HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed in the patients and in 368 healthy controls. Data on perinuclear ANCA (pANCA) and HLA-DRB1 were available from 274 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients without known liver disease.Results:Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were found in 193 (80%) of the PSC patients, with pANCA in 169 (70%). ANCA-positive patients were younger than ANCA negative at diagnosis of PSC and had a lower frequency of biliary cancer (9% vs 19%, P=.047). There were no differences between PSC patients with and without inflammatory bowel disease. Genetically, the strong PSC risk factors HLA-B*08 (frequency in healthy 13%) and DRB1*03 (14%) were more prevalent in ANCA-positive than -negative patients (43% vs 25%, P=.0012 and 43% vs 25%, P=.0015 respectively). The results were similar when restricting the analysis to pANCA-positive patients. In UC patients without liver disease, HLA-DRB1*03 was more prevalent in pANCA-positive compared with -negative patients (P=.03).Conclusions:Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies identified PSC patients with particular clinical and genetic characteristics, suggesting that ANCA may mark a clinically relevant pathogenetic subgroup in the PSC-UC disease spectrum.
