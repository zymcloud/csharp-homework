Staurosporine, which is an inhibitor of a broad spectrum of protein kinases, has shown cytotoxicity on several human cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we examined whether and how this compound has an inhibitory action on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in vitro using HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to detect protein-protein interactions. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to silence the expression of targeted protein. We found that staurosporine significantly decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in HepG2 cancer cells, along with the decreased expressions of PDK1 protein and Akt phosphorylation. Staurosporine was also found to enhance Omi/HtrA2 release from mitochondria. Furthermore, Omi/HtrA2 directly bound to PDK1. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Omi/HtrA2 restored protein levels of PDK1 and protected HepG2 cancer cells from staurosporine-induced cell death. In addition, staurosporine was found to activate autophagy. However, inhibition of autophagy exacerbated cell death under concomitant treatment with staurosporine. Taken together, our results indicate that staurosporine induced cytotoxicity response by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through Omi/HtrA2-mediated PDK1 degradation, and the process provides a novel mechanism by which staurosporine produces its therapeutic effects.
