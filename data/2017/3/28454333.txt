A component purified from Strongylocentrotus nudus eggs on a diethylaminoethyl cellulose-52 chromatography column and eluted using a NaCl solution gradient (SEP-S), is a homogeneous polysaccharide of α-D-glucan with a reduced molecular weight of 9.33×105 Da, compared with that of S. nudus egg polysaccharide (SEP). In an in vivo antitumor assay of histocompatibility-22 hepatocellular carcinoma in tumor-bearing mice, the inhibitory rates at SEP-S doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day were 38.8, 50.7 and 70.3%, respectively. In addition, the spleen and thymus indices and the percentages of cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased, and the activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes was notably enhanced, suggesting that the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity is mediated by boosting the immune system. In vitro experiments also demonstrated that splenocyte proliferation induced by SEP-S was inhibited by the toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 monoclonal antibodies. These data indicate that SEP-S is a polysaccharide component possessing high anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity and may be a potential immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of liver cancer.
