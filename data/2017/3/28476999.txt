Chondroitin (Chn) sulphate composed of N-acetyl galactoseamine units was chosen to target doxorubicin (DOX) to asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) overexpressed in HepG2 cells of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two different ways of targeting the drug to the receptors were compared with each other; (i) by polyelectrolyte complex formation of DOX and Chn (DC), (ii) by loading the drug in gelatin nanoparticles (NPs) and then coating them by Chn. The characteristics of DC complexes were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and CHN analysis. The complexes and Chn coated NPs were characterised for their particles size, zeta potential, drug loading and release efficiency. The morphology of NPs was studied by transmission electron microscopy. The cytotoxicity of DC complex and Chn coated NPs were compared on HepG2 cells by MTT assay. The results showed that the cytotoxicity of both Chn coated gelatin NPs and DC complexes were significantly increased in comparison with free DOX. However, the presence of Chn did not have significant effect on the cytotoxicity of DOX loaded NPs. It was concluded that polyelectrolyte complex of DC could successfully target the drug to the hepatic ASGPRs and may be a simple promising way for targeted drug delivery in HCC.
