Combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare disease. We investigated the clinicopathological features of cHCC-CC and compared the longterm outcomes following liver transplantation (LT) and hepatic resection (HR). We identified 32 LT patients with cHCC-CC through an institutional database search. The HR control group (n = 100) was selected through propensity score-matching. The incidence of cHCC-CC among all adult LT patients was 1.0%. Mean patient age was 53.4 ± 6.7 years, and 26 patients were male. Thirty patients had hepatitis B virus infection. All patients of cHCC-CC were diagnosed incidentally in the explanted livers. Mean tumor diameter was 2.5 ± 1.3 cm, and 28 patients had single tumors. Tumor stage was stage I in 23 and II in 9. Concurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was detected in 12 patients with stage I in 5 and II in 7. Mean tumor diameter was 1.9 ± 1.2 cm, and 5 had single tumors. Tumor recurrence and survival rates were 15.6% and 84.4% at 1 year and 32.2% and 65.8% at 5 years, respectively. Patients with very early stage cHCC-CC (1 or 2 tumors ≤ 2.0 cm) showed 13.3% tumor recurrence and 93.3% patient survival rates at 5 years, which were significantly improved than those with advanced tumors (P = 0.002). Tumor recurrence and survival rates did not differ significantly between the LT and HR control groups (P = 0.22 and P = 0.91, respectively); however, postrecurrence patient survival did (P = 0.016). In conclusion, cHCC-CC is rarely diagnosed following LT, and one-third of such patients have concurrent HCC. The longterm posttransplant prognosis was similar following LT and HR. Very early cHCC-CC resulted in favorable posttransplant prognosis, thus this selection condition can be prudently considered for LT indication. Liver Transplantation 23 330-341 2017 AASLD.
