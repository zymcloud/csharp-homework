The aim of our study was to construct an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-conjugated liposome-hollow silica hybrid nanovehicle for targeted delivery and controlled release of arsenic trioxide (ATO), whose anti-solid tumor effect was hampered by poor pharmacokinetics and dose-limited toxicity. Hydrophobic interactions were used to attach intact lipid membrane to the surface of chlorodimethyloctadecylsilane-modified hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles. The prepared nanovehicles (RGD-LP-CHMSN) were characterized for uniform structure (silica core of ∼140nm in diameter and liposomal shell of ∼6nm), comparable drug loading efficiency (6.76%), desirable stability and strengthened controlled release. In vitro, RGD-LP-CHMSN showed good biocompatibility and low toxicity on HepG2, MCF-7 and LO2 cells. The targeted delivery of ATO by nanocarriers (RGD-LP-CHMSN-ATO) was demonstrated by an enhanced cellular uptake and a reduced half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value. In pharmacokinetic studies, the RGD-LP-CHMSN-ATO group, compared to the free ATO group, prolonged the half time (t1/2β) by 1.7 times and increased the area under curve (AUC) by 2.4 times. In addition, in a H22 tumor-xenograft mouse model, nanovehicles improved the targeting efficiency and anticancer potential of ATO. In conclusion, the strategy of constructing a nanocarrier with targeted delivery and controlled release characteristics is prospective to enhance the antitumor effect of ATO.
