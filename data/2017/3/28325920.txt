Histological molecular classification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is clinically important for predicting the prognosis. However, a reliable serum marker has not been established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum Wisteria Floribunda agglutinin-positive sialylated mucin 1 (WFA-sialylated MUC1), which is a novel biliary marker, as a marker of HCC with hepatic progenitor cell (HPC)/biliary features and of prognosis. A total of 144 consecutive patients who underwent complete radiofrequency ablation of primary HCC were enrolled. A serum WFA-sialylated MUC1 level of 900 μL/mL was determined as the optimal cutoff value for prediction of immunohistochemical staining for HPC/biliary features [sialylated MUC1 and cytokeratin 19 (CK19)]. Positive staining rate of sialylated MUC1 and CK19 was significantly higher in patients with WFA-sialylated MUC1 ≥900 than those with WFA-sialylated MUC1
