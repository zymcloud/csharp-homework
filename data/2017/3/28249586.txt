Background:Chronic HBV infection is a major cause of Cirrhosis and an important risk factor to develop hepatocellular carcinoma. The study is conducted to find out the changes in the lipid metabolism of HBV-cirrhosis patients.Methods:In the present study, serum lipid profiles of patients with HBV-cirrhosis were assessed by utilizing micro-lab and gas chromatography, while risk factors for transmission of HBV-cirrhosis studied through the standard questionnaire.Results:The epidemiological and etiological risk factors strongly associated with HBV-cirrhosis patients compared to controls, included as family history, shave from the barber, blood transfusion (without proper screening), mutual sharing of household contents, positive surgery history, and dental treatment. The HBV-cirrhosis patients have significantly lower level (p Conclusion:Present study concluded that hypolipidemia observed in HBV-cirrhosis patients, MELD were found to be independent predictors of survival and alteration in fatty acid composition, possibly due to impairment in fatty acid metabolism by enzymatic elongation and desaturation.
