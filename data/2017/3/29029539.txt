Background & aims:Intrahepatic arterio-portal fistula is an uncommon etiology of portal hypertension, which presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and outcomes of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding caused by arterio-portal fistula using different therapeutic approaches.Methods:Medical records of 451 consecutive patients with arterio-portal fistula were reviewed from January 1, 2009, to July 15, 2016, and patients suffered variceal bleeding were eligible for the study.Results:Among 57 patients with arterio-portal fistula, hepatocellular carcinoma was existed in 61.4% patients. A combination of radiological intervention and endoscopic treatment was performed in 8 (14.0%) patients; the remainder were treated using radiological intervention alone (n = 20, 35.1%), endoscopic treatment alone (n = 18, 31.6%), or without any intervention (n = 11, 19.3%). No patient died in the combination group, while 20 patients in the single-treatment group and 6 in the untreated group died during follow-up. A significant difference in the survival rate was found between the combination group and the other two groups. Treatment selection between combination and untreated groups was the only parameter significantly associated with survival (p = 0.002).Conclusions:For patients diagnosed with arterio-portal fistula, combination treatment is the most optimal strategy in managing variceal bleeding, especially in patient with severe type of fistula.
