Objective: To analyze the basic characteristics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and further explore the major factors affecting the prognosis of HCC patients. Methods: A total of 800 HCC patients were randomly selected from the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Their clinical and follow-up information was obtained from medical record. Univariate analysis of variance, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to analyze the patients' age at diagnosis and survival time, etc. Results: The average age of diagnosis was 55.04 years among all the 800 HCC patients, and the sex ratio of male to female was 4.48. The infection rates of HBV and HCV were 78.6% (629/800) and 5.8% (46/800), respectively. The smoking rate was 41.0% (328/800) and the alcohol consumption rate was 38.5% (328/800). 259 (32.4%) patients underwent radical treatments with liver resection as major therapy, and 541 (67.6%) patients adopted non-radical treatments with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) as major therapy. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of the HCC patients were 73.2%, 53.7% and 42.4%, respectively. The risk factors for prognosis included alcohol abuse and treatment methods. The HR of alcohol abuse was 1.326 (95%CI: 1.058 to 1.661) and HR of treatment methods was 3.301 (95% CI: 2.483 to 4.387). Conclusions: Men account for the majority of HCC patients, and most patients have a lower age at diagnosis and adopt non-radical treatments. The exposure rates of HBV infection and alcohol abuse of HCC patients are significantly higher than those of general population. The major risk factors affecting prognosis and survival are treatments and alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse and HBV may have synergistic effects on the survival of HCC patients.
