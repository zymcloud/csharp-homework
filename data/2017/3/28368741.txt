Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths with 750,000 newly diagnosed cases each year. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy constitute the main treatment modalities for HCC, but liver cirrhosis and damage often occur. Molecular targeted drugs have been recently developed to treat HCC. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) autocrine signaling is closely related to the growth, progression, and metastasis of HCC, making the VEGF/VEGFR axis an ideal target for the development of molecular targeted agents. Here, we report the effects of the novel anti-VEGF humanized monoclonal antibody BD0801 on the growth of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo as well as the underlying mechanisms. BD0801 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2, SMMC-7721, and Bel7402 cells in vitro, accompanied with an induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. BD0801 potently suppressed AKT, Erk1/2, and retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation, while increasing p21 and decreasing cyclin D1 protein levels. BD0801 significantly inhibited growth in mouse tumor xenografts and induced cell apoptosis of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 tumor xenografts. Furthermore, BD0801 effectively reduced the vascular density and tumor tissue microvessel density (MVD). Similarly, BD0801 decreased AKT, Erk1/2, and Rb phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression whereas it increased p21 protein expression in mouse HCC tumor xenografts. Importantly, BD0801 showed a better effect than Bevacizumab (Bev) on the inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that BD0801 is a potent anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody for the treatment of HCC.
