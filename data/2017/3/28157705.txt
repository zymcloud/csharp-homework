Golgi protein 73 (GP73) has been suggested as a serum marker for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, this has been challenged in recent years. In the present study, we found that the serum GP73 increased in HCC patients with cirrhosis but not in those without cirrhosis. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis demonstrated that serum GP73 had poor performance for differentiating HCC patients from cirrhosis patients. In addition, the immunohistochemistry revealed that aberrant expression of GP73 was primarily observed in cirrhotic and tumor liver tissues from both cirrhosis and HCC patients, but rarely in non-cirrhotic liver tissues from HCC patients without cirrhosis. Moreover, serum Alpha-fetoprotein in HCC patients with cirrhosis decreased sharply after resection of tumor tissue, while the serum GP73 remained stable. These data indicated that the background of cirrhosis was related to the elevation of serum GP73 in HCC patients. In conclusion, serum GP73 is not a suitable diagnostic marker for HCC.
