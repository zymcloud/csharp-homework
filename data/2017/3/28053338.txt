The concept of macroautophagy was established in 1963, soon after the discovery of lysosomes in rat liver. Over the 50 years since, studies of liver autophagy have produced many important findings. The liver is rich in lysosomes and possesses high levels of metabolic-stress-induced autophagy, which is precisely regulated by concentrations of hormones and amino acids. Liver autophagy provides starved cells with amino acids, glucose and free fatty acids for use in energy production and synthesis of new macromolecules, and also controls the quality and quantity of organelles such as mitochondria. Although the efforts of early investigators contributed markedly to our current knowledge of autophagy, the identification of autophagy-related genes represented a revolutionary breakthrough in our understanding of the physiological roles of autophagy in the liver. A growing body of evidence has shown that liver autophagy contributes to basic hepatic functions, including glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and β-oxidation, through selective turnover of specific cargos controlled by a series of transcription factors. In this Review, we outline the history of liver autophagy study, and then describe the roles of autophagy in hepatic metabolism under healthy and disease conditions, including the involvement of autophagy in α1-antitrypsin deficiency, NAFLD, hepatocellular carcinoma and viral hepatitis.
