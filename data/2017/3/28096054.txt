Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia), characterized by impaired glucose homeostasis and chronic risk of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) and carcinoma (HCC), is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC). We have previously shown that G6pc-/- mice receiving gene transfer mediated by rAAV-G6PC, a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector expressing G6Pase-α, and expressing 3-63% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity maintain glucose homeostasis and do not develop HCA/HCC. However, the threshold of hepatic G6Pase-α activity required to prevent tumor formation remained unknown. In this study, we constructed rAAV-co-G6PC, a rAAV vector expressing a codon-optimized (co) G6Pase-α and showed that rAAV-co-G6PC was more efficacious than rAAV-G6PC in directing hepatic G6Pase-α expression. Over an 88-week study, we showed that both rAAV-G6PC- and rAAV-co-G6PC-treated G6pc-/- mice expressing 3-33% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity (AAV mice) maintained glucose homeostasis, lacked HCA/HCC, and were protected against age-related obesity and insulin resistance. Of the eleven rAAV-G6PC/rAAV-co-G6PC-treated G6pc-/- mice harboring 0.9-2.4% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity (AAV-low mice), 3 expressing 0.9-1.3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity developed HCA/HCC, while 8 did not (AAV-low-NT). Finally, we showed that the AAV-low-NT mice exhibited a phenotype indistinguishable from that of AAV mice expressing ≥3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity. The results establish the threshold of hepatic G6Pase-α activity required to prevent HCA/HCC and show that GSD-Ia mice harboring
