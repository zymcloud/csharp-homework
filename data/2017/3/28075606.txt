Objective:The purpose of this article is to review the use of dual-energy CT (DECT) in the assessment of gynecologic cancer.Conclusion:DECT has the potential to improve diagnostic performance, may improve the ability to differentiate between simple cystic lesions and primary ovarian cancer, and may also improve the detection of musculoskeletal and liver metastases. Additional studies will be needed to determine the direction of future developments and the degree to which DECT will affect the imaging and management of gynecologic cancer.
