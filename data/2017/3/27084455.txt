Aim:Recent reports have indicated that aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), a cancer-related oxidoreductase, was upregulated in some chronic liver diseases. However, few studies have reported AKR1B10 expression in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. The aim of the present study was to analyze AKR1B10 expression and its relevance on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic HBV infection.Methods:Expression of AKR1B10 in the liver of 119 chronic HBV-infected patients was assessed and quantified immunohistochemically. A multivariate Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratios of AKR1B10 expression for HCC development. The cumulative incidences of HCC were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:Expression of AKR1B10 in the study cohort ranged from 0% to 84%. During the median follow-up time (6.2 years), 13 patients developed HCC. Multivariate analysis revealed that high AKR1B10 expression (â‰¥15%) was an independent risk factor for HCC (hazard ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-38.6; P Conclusion:Chronic HBV-infected patients with high hepatic AKR1B10 expression had an increased risk of HCC development. This suggests that AKR1B10 upregulation might play a role in the early stages of HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis.
