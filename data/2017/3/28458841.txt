Adrenohepatic fusion is a relatively common condition that has been reported in the literature and explained as a result of normal aging. However, the presence of a neoplastic process in the adrenohepatic fusion is relatively uncommon. A 48-year-old male presented with RUQ abdominal pain with findings of a huge liver mass with adrenohepatic fusion in the computed tomography scan. Histopathological studies revealed a mixed, although distinctly separated, adrenocortical carcinoma and a hepatocellular carcinoma within an adrenoheaptic fusion.
