Objective:We sought to develop a "Model Of Recurrence After Liver transplant" (MORAL) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Background:The Milan criteria are used to allocate livers to patients with HCC requiring liver transplantation (LT) but do not include objective measures of tumor biology. Biological markers including the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) have been associated with recurrence risk.Methods:Prospective cohort study of adults undergoing LT for HCC between January 2001 and December 2012.Results:A total of 339 patients were included. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, 3 preoperatively available factors were independent predictors of worse recurrence-free survival (RFS), namely, an NLR â‰¥ 5 (P 200 (P 3 cm (P 3 cm (P 3 (P = 0.048, HR: 1.8). The pre- and post-MORAL were superior to Milan at predicting recurrence with c-statistics of 0.82 and 0.87, compared with 0.63, respectively. We then combined the scores to produce a combo-MORAL, with a c-statistic of 0.91 for predicting recurrence.Conclusions:The MORAL score provides a simple, highly accurate tool for predicting recurrence and risk-stratification pre- and postoperatively.
