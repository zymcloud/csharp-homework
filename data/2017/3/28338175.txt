Objective:Liver cancer is a common malignant tumor in the digestive system. Curcumin is a kind of phenolic pigment, which is extracted from herbage and has a plenty of physiological roles in anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-tumor. In our study, human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cell lines were selected and treated with curcumin to detect its effects on the apoptosis and AMPK signaling pathway.Materials and methods:Human liver cancer cell strain SMMC-7721 was cultured and treated with different curcumin concentrations for different times followed by measuring the changes of cell proliferation activity and cycle by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. Protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3 were tested by Western blot, and the activation level of AMPK was also detected.Results:Different concentrations of curcumin could inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner. After 48 h inhibition by curcumin with a concentration of 40 mmol/L, the inhibitory effect was more obvious with statistically significant (pConclusions:Curcumin decreased the proliferation activity of tumor cells, increased the cell quantities in G1 stage and decreased the cell numbers in S stage in human liver cancer SMMC-7721 cells. The Bcl-2 and Survivin proteins were downregulated and Bax protein was upregulated; furthermore, the AMPK signaling pathway was activated.
