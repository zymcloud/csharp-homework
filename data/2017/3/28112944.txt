This study was aimed to identify blood-based biomarkers to predict a sustained complete response (CR) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using targeted proteomics. Consecutive patients with HCC who had undergone TACE were prospectively enrolled (training (n = 100) and validation set (n = 80)). Serum samples were obtained before and 6 months after TACE. Treatment responses were evaluated using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). In the training set, the MRM-MS assay identified five marker candidate proteins (LRG1, APCS, BCHE, C7, and FCN3). When this five-marker panel was combined with the best-performing clinical variables (tumor number, baseline PIVKA, and baseline AFP), the resulting ensemble model had the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) value in predicting a sustained CR after TACE in the training and validation sets (0.881 and 0.813, respectively). Furthermore, the ensemble model was an independent predictor of rapid progression (hazard ratio (HR), 2.889; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.612-5.178; P value
