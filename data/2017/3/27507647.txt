Background & aim:Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is caused by hepatic venous outflow obstruction. This work aimed at analyzing characteristics and factors associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with primary BCS.Methods:A total of 348 Egyptian BCS patients were included. They were presented to the Budd-Chiari Study Group of Ain Shams University Hospital. BCS was confirmed using abdominal Doppler US. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR venography and/or multislice computed tomography (CT) were performed to confirm all diagnoses and to assess vascular anatomy. Hepatic focal lesions detected during the study period (2005-2011) were evaluated using serum alpha foetoprotein (AFP) level, imaging features and histopathological examination.Results:Diagnosis of HCC was confirmed in 15/348 patients (4.3%). Imaging studies showed that 60% had multiple hepatic focal lesions ranging from 2 to 6.3 cm in size. The median level of serum AFP in BCS with HCC was 300 ng/mL vs 11 ng/mL in those without HCC (P24.5 ng/mL for serum AFP showed sensitivity 80%, specificity 97.9%, positive predictive value 93.18% and negative predictive value 99.1% for detection of HCC in BCS patients. Male gender, older age, cigarette smoking, serum AFP (>24.5 ng/mL) and shrunken liver by ultrasonography were independent factors associated with HCC development.Conclusion:Male gender, older age and cigarette smoking are independent risk factors for development of HCC in BCS. Serum AFP is a good screening test in BCS.
