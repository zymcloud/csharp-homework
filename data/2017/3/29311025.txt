In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), miR-340 plays a vital role in the regulation of tumor occurrence and deterioration, while DcR3 gene is involved in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. This study analyzed miR-340 in the serum of patients with HCC and healthy controls. Then, miR-340, DcR3, TGF-β1 and Smad2 expression were measured in HCC tissues and adjacent parts. Relationship between miR-340 and DcR3 was verified. Effects of miR-340 on human HepG2 cell proliferation and apoptosis were explored. miR-340, DcR3, TGF-β1, Smad2 mRNA and protein expression were also determined after miR-340 transfection. Compared with the control, miR-340 was significantly lower in the serum of the HCC patients (p
