NIMA-related kinase 2 (Nek2) is often upregulated in human cancer and is important in regulating the cell cycle and gene expression, and maintaining centrosomal structure and function. The present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern, clinical significance, and biological function of Nek2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). mRNA and protein levels of Nek2 were examined in HCC and corresponding normal liver tissues. The MTT and soft agar colony formation assays, and flow cytometry were employed to assess the roles of Nek2 in cell proliferation and growth. In addition, western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression of cell cycle- and proliferation-related proteins. The results revealed that Nek2 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. The clinical significance of Nek2 expression was also analyzed. Inhibiting Nek2 expression by siRNA suppressed cell proliferation, growth, and colony formation in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 cells, induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase by retarding the S-phase, and promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, Nek2 depletion downregulated β-catenin expression in HepG2 cells and diminished expression of Myc proto-oncogene protein (c-Myc), cyclins D1, B1, and E and cyclin-dependent kinase 1, whilst increasing protein levels of p27. This demonstrates that overexpression of Nek2 is associated with the malignant evolution of HCC. Targeting Nek2 may inhibit HCC cell growth and proliferation through the regulation of β-catenin by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and therefore may be developed as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat HCC.
