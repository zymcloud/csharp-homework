Background:Esophageal cancer is the 11th most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States. It is aggressive in nature and has an ability to spread rapidly through direct extension, lymphatic spread, or hematogenously. With an estimated incidence of 1%, cutaneous metastases from esophageal cancer are extremely rare.Case presentation:In this case study and review, we describe a case of recurrent esophageal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma presenting as multiple, rapidly progressing and tender subcutaneous nodules. A 69-year-old male with history of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus treated with concurrent chemoradiation, presented to his oncologist with complaints of a large, painful nodule at the nape of his neck approximately two years after completing treatment. On further examination, he was noted to have multiple, well circumscribed, solid, tender nodules on his abdominal wall along with a painful nodule on the pulp of his index finger. Histopathology from all sites revealed skin infiltration by high-grade invasive basaloid subtype of squamous cell carcinoma, similar to patient's prior known and treated primary esophageal cancer. Further imaging work up showed extensive metastatic disease involving lung, liver, and brain.Conclusion:Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma rarely metastasize to the skin. Subcutaneous nodules can be the first presentation of recurrent disease. The lesions are commonly confused with skin infections and treated inappropriately with antibiotics, leading to delay in diagnosis of recurrent disease. Early biopsy of suspicious lesions should be performed, especially in patients with history of cancer, such that prompt diagnosis and treatment can occur to maximize patient outcomes.
