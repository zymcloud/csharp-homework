Background:Thromboelastography has called into question the coagulopathy seen following partial hepatectomy. However the coagulation profile in cirrhotic livers has not been studied. Our objective was to determine the coagulation profile following partial hepatectomy in normal and cirrhotic livers.Methods:Patients undergoing liver resection were prospectively enrolled in the study. The prothrombin time and international normalized ratio, as well as the thromboelastogram, were obtained preoperatively, post-operatively, and on post-operative days 1, 3, and 5.Results:22 noncirrhotic and 11 cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection were enrolled. Postoperatively the thromboelastogram demonstrated a hypercoagulable profile in 64%, 33%, 39% and 36% of patients on post-operative days 0, 1, 3 and 5 respectively. There was no difference between patients with cirrhosis and those without underlying liver disease.Conclusion:Patients appear to have a similar coagulation profile after liver resection regardless of underlying cirrhosis with many having a hypercoagulable profile.
