Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a disease of increasing interest, as its prevalence is on the rise. NAFLD has been linked to metabolic syndrome, which is becoming more common due to the Western diet. Because NAFLD can lead to cirrhosis and related complications including hepatocellular carcinoma, the increasing prevalence is concerning, and medical therapy aimed at treating NAFLD is of great interest. Researchers studying the effects of medical therapy on NAFLD use dietary mouse models. The two main types of mouse model diets are the methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet and the Western-like diet (WD). Although both induce NAFLD, the mechanisms are very different. We reviewed several studies conducted within the last 5 years that used MCD diet or WD mouse models in order to mimic this disease in a way most similar to humans. The MCD diet inconsistently induces NAFLD and fibrosis and does not completely induce metabolic syndrome. Thus, the clinical significance of the MCD diet is questionable. In contrast, WD mouse models consisting of high fat, cholesterol, and a combination of high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, fructose, or glucose not only lead to metabolic syndrome but also induce NAFLD with fibrosis, making these choices most suitable for research.
