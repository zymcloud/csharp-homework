Inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) of the liver is a rare, benign lesion of unclear etiology, which may be misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, secondary tumor or abscess, because of its non-specific clinical, biochemical and radiologic findings. We present the case of a 48-old-year male in whom diagnosis of liver IPT was suspected by contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and confirmed by fine-needle liver biopsy. The diagnosis is in contrast to most of the literature reports in which the diagnosis was made only based on a surgical specimen.Learning points:The inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) of the liver is a rare benign disease that may be misdiagnosed as a malignant primary or secondary tumor.The diagnosis of IPT may be improved by the use of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and the fine-needle liver biopsy without surgical intervention.The therapy of IPT may be monitored by ultrasonography (US) and CEUS.
