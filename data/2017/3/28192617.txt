Background and objectives:This study aimed to evaluate the impact of huge (≥10 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to the recurrence pattern and the prognosis after hepatectomy.Methods:574 patients who underwent hepatectomy by 17 surgeons (Open 536 and Laparoscopic 38) for HCC without major vascular invasion from 1990 to 2013 at single institute were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Huge tumor, age, HCV, multiple tumors and microscopic portal invasion are independent risk factors for overall survival (OS), and huge tumor, ICGR15 ≥16%, multiple tumors, moderate/poor histology, microscopic portal invasion and a positive pathological margin are risk factors for relapse-free survival (RFS). The 5-year OS and RFS of patients with huge HCC (n = 53) (42.9 and 14.2%) were significantly worse than those of patients with HCC Conclusions:Huge HCC (≥10 cm) is an independent risk factor due to a high risk for initial extra-hepatic recurrence. Future systemic adjuvant therapy is needed for these patients. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:324-329. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
