Background:Forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1, also known as HFH1), a member of the forkhead transcription factor family, has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in multiple tumors and is thought to be an indicator of poor clinical outcomes.Methods:A meta-analysis using qualified relevant literature was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of FOXQ1 in various malignant solid tumors. A search of electronic databases was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies published from 1966 to July 30, 2016, and the studies were identified by further evaluation. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for analyses were assessed to investigate the association between FOXQ1 expression and overall survival (OS) of patients with malignant solid tumors.Results:A total of 1,520 patients from six studies (seven cohorts) with multiple malignant solid tumors were included. For OS, high FOXQ1 expression could significantly predict worse outcome with the pooled HR of 1.38 (95% CI: 1.17-1.59; P<0.001). The subgroup analysis suggested that the elevated levels of FOXQ1 appear to be associated with worse OS in hepatocellular carcinoma (HR =1.34; 95% CI: 1.11-1.57; P<0.001) and other cancers (HR =1.62; 95% CI: 1.09-2.14; P<0.001).Conclusion:This meta-analysis indicated that the high expression of FOXQ1 is associated with an adverse OS in malignant solid tumors, suggesting that FOXQ1 may be a predictor of poor prognosis for the development of malignant solid tumors.
