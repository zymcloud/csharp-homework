Background:This multi-institutional study aimed to assess the benefits of anterior approach for right hepatectomy with hanging maneuver (ARH-HM) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with conventional right hepatectomy (CRH).Methods:From January 2000 to December 2012, 306 patients with HCC ≥5 cm were divided into two groups: ARH-HM (n = 104) and CRH (n = 202).Results:After one-to-one propensity score-matched analysis, 72 ARH-HM and 72 CRH patients presented comparable background factors. Patients in the ARH-HM group demonstrated significantly less intraoperative blood loss (480 vs. 1,242 g, P Conclusion:In comparison with CRH, ARH-HM for large HCC can provide better overall survival rates with a decrease in intraoperative blood loss and transfusion rates. Survival impact was evident especially in patients with HCC ≥10 cm.
