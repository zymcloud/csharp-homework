Background:Liver cancer is the fifth cause of cancer-related deaths in Japan. The BioBank Japan (BBJ) project included 200,000 patients with 47 diseases and samples; their clinical information can be used for further studies.Methods:Patients diagnosed with liver cancer (n = 1733; 1316 men, 417 women) were included. Histology, patient characteristics, clinical characteristics, and causes of death were collected. Cumulative and relative survival rates for liver cancer were calculated.Results:Of the 1354 patients with available liver cancer histology, 91.9% had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Compared with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, greater proportions of the male patients in this cohort were daily alcohol consumers (26%), and a greater proportion of the men was overweight/obesity (22%). Although Japan is the only Asian country with a predominance of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC, the prevalence of HCV infection (44%) was lower than that in a previous study. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year cumulative survival rates were 57%, 47%, and 25% in men, respectively, and 49%, 41%, and 27% in women, respectively.Conclusions:The present results provide an overview of the patients with liver cancer in the BBJ project. We are planning further analyses combined with various high-throughput 'omics' technologies.
