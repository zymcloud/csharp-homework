BACKGROUND The concepts of sequential transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and portal venous embolization (PVE) were proposed to prevent the detrimental tumor growth-inducing effect of PVE and to facilitate growth of further future liver remnant (FLR). This study aimed to investigate the effect of sequential TACE and PVE on liver damage and the therapeutic effect in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model. MATERIAL AND METHODS Rabbits bearing VX2 liver tumors were randomly divided into TACE+PVE, TACE, PVE, and Sham groups. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 6 h, 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days were measured by ELISA assay. Tumor diameter on day 7 was measured and the tumor sections with cleaved caspase-3 was stained and observed. RESULTS Plasma ALT, AST, and ALP levels were significantly increased at the first hours after the interventions. The TACE group had higher increases than the TACE+PVE and PVE alone groups. ALT, AST, and ALP levels decreased on day 7 and presented a trend to return to the baseline level. The TACE+PVE group showed stronger tumor-inhibiting effect than the TACE and PVE alone groups and also induced the highest level of tumor cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS The liver damage caused by TACE+PVE is mild and recoverable. TACE+PVE showed stronger tumor-inhibiting effect than in the TACE and PVE group and also induced the highest level of tumor cell apoptosis.
