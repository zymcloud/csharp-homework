Background & aims:The natural outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as well as the progression of the liver disease are highly variable and depend primarily on an efficient immune response. As toll-like receptors seven (TLR7) and eight (TLR8) are important effectors of the innate immunity, this study aims to evaluate the association between TLR7 and TLR8 polymorphisms and the HCV infection outcomes in Moroccan subjects.Methods:In this case-control study, 643 subjects including 293 mild chronic hepatitis patients, 119 with advanced liver disease (AdLD), 93 with HCV spontaneous clearance and 138 healthy controls were genotyped using TaqMan SNPs assays.Results:Patients carrying TLR7 rs179008-A allele were more likely to clear the virus spontaneously (P = .0001 for women, and P Conclusions:Our results suggest that variations in TLR7 and TLR8 genes modulate the clearance and progression of HCV infection with different magnitudes between sexes. Our results refine, therefore, our understanding of the sex-specific differences observed regarding the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis.
