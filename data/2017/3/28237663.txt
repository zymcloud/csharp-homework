Sorafenib was the only small-molecule drug approved by FDA for treatment of the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent study indicated that YM155 was a promising agent for HCC cells with high survivin expression, however, the antitumor activity needs to be further improved. Based on molecular docking and rational design method, a series of multi-substituted benzyl acridone derivatives were designed and synthesized. MTT assay indicated that some of the synthesized compounds displayed better antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells than YM155. Later study indicated that the representive compound 8u may directly interact with survivin protein and induce HepG2 cells apoptosis, which is different from YM155. In addition, ADME property was predicted in silico, and it performed well. Moreover, in vivo preliminary experiments showed that 8u may be a good lead compound in the treatment of HCC.
