Background:Staging is vital in guiding therapeutic approach in patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study's goal is to compare paradigms in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) and Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) systems, and evaluate the use of both in a local context, comparing their prognostic ability and therapeutic efficacy in the management of HCC.Methods:Seven hundred and sixty-six patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were identified and staged according to BCLC and HKLC. Both system's performances were compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC), bootstrap concordance-index (c-index), and through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of patients who came under HKLC stages 1, 2, and 3 and the individual BCLC stages. Independent prognostic factors of survival were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:According to AIC and c-index, HKLC (AIC = 5,711, c-index = 0.74) has equivalent prognosticating value as BCLC (AIC = 5,764, c-index = 0.72). Through Kaplan-Meier curves, we determined that more aggressive treatments resulted in better outcomes. Particularly for patients under BCLC stage C, patients who followed the HKLC system's recommended treatments performed markedly better.Conclusions:In our patient population, the HKLC system is comparable to the BCLC system in prognosticating patients, but is suggested to have better performance in guiding treatment.
