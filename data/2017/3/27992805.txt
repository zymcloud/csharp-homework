We have used albumin (BSA) bound to gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as active vectors to target liver cells. Our incentive to develop an original model of living liver cancer sprang from the ethical drawbacks that hindered the assessment of the selective character and the therapeutic capacity of these nano-biosystems in cancer patients. Ex vivo-perfused liver specimens were obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma patients similarly to the surgical technique of transplantation. Albumin bound to GNPs was inoculated intra-arterially onto the resulting specimen and determined the specific delivery of the nano-bioconjugate into the malignant tissue by means of the capillary bed. The extent of necrosis was considerable following laser therapy and at the same time surrounding parenchyma was not seriously affected. The selective photothermal ablation of the malignant liver tissue was obtained after the selective accumulation of BSA bound to GNPs into tumor cells following ex-vivo intra-vascular perfusion.
