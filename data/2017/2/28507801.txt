A combined blockade of V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) and PD-1 is a promising new cancer treatment option, which was efficient in murine tumor models and is currently tested in first phase I studies. Here, we analyzed the VISTA expression in a large and well-characterized gastric cancer (GC) cohort on 464 therapy-naive GC samples and 14 corresponding liver metastases using immunohistochemistry. Staining results were correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics, genetic alterations and survival. VISTA expression in tumor cells was detected in 41 GCs (8.8%) and 2 corresponding liver metastases (14.3%). Moreover, VISTA expression in immune cells was observed in 388 GCs (83.6%) and 6 liver metastases (42.9%). VISTA expression was associated with the Laur√©n phenotype, tumor localization, Epstein-Barr virus infection, KRAS- and PIK3CA-mutational status and PD-L1 expression. There was no significant correlation with patient outcome. Moreover, a change of VISTA expression in immune cells during tumor progression was observed. The co-incidence of VISTA and PD-L1 expression indicates a dual immune evasion mechanism of GC tumor cells and makes GC an interesting target for novel combined immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments.
