Background:Recently, miR-22 is identified as a tumor-suppressing microRNA in many human cancers. CD147 is a novel cancer-associated biomarker that plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumor. However, the involvement of miR-22 in CD147 regulation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and metastasis has not been investigated.Methods:We measured miR-22 expression level in 34 paired of HCC and matched normal tissues, HCC cell lines by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Invasion assay, MTT proliferation assay and wound-healing assay were performed to test the invasion and proliferation of HCC cell after overexpression of miR-22. The effect of miR-22 on HCC in vivo was validated by murine xenograft model. The relationship of miR-22 and its target gene CD147 was also investigated.Results:We found that the expression of miR-22 in HCC tissues and cell lines were much lower than that in normal control, respectively. The expression of miR-22 was inversely correlated with HCC metastatic ability. Moreover, overexpression of miR-22 could significantly inhibit the HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and decrease HCC tumor growth in vivo. Finally, we found that miR-22 interacted with CD147 and decreased its expression, via a specific target site within the CD147 3'UTR by luciferase reporter assay. The expression of CD147 was inversely correlated with miR-22 expression in HCC tissues.Conclusion:Our results suggested that miR-22 was downexpressed in HCC and inhibited HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion through downregulating cancer-associated gene CD147 which may provide a new bio-target for HCC therapy.
