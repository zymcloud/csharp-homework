Liver is a major contributor of protein production physiologically. The aberrant state of protein synthesis leads to tumor progression. Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eEF1A1) is a major member of the eukaryotic elongation factor family that regulates protein synthesis. Although eEF1A1 plays an essential role in controlling the cell fate, its clinical significance in tumor development and progression has not been reported. Here, we aimed to uncover the expression and prognostic significance of eEF1A1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our data indicated that eEF1A1 expression was elevated in HCC cell lines and clinical samples at both the mRNA and protein levels. Immunohistochemistry revealed that eEF1A1 expression was upregulated in HCC samples compared with corresponding non-tumorous tissues. In 50 HCC cases with portal vein embolus, higher eEF1A1 immunoreactivity was detected in tumor metastases compared with the primary lesions. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that increased eEF1A1 expression was closely associated with unfavorable post-surgical overall and disease-free survival in 453 HCC patients. Moreover, multivariate analysis indicated eEF1A1 as an independent predictor for overall and disease-free survival. Collectively, our study suggests eEF1A1 as a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.
