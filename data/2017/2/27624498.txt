Purpose:This study aimed to compare the short-term efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with epirubicin-loaded superabsorbent polymer embolics (SAP) and conventional TACE in TACE-naïve patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Fifty consecutive patients (mean age, 72.8 years; hepatitis C, 46%; BCLC-A or B, 52% or 48%) treated with TACE with SAP during 2013-2015 and 55 consecutive patients (mean age, 71.8 years; hepatitis C, 40%; BCLC-A or B, 51% or 49%) treated with conventional TACE during 2011-2013 were evaluated. Safety evaluations were based on CTCAE ver. 4.0. Short-term efficacies, i.e., at 1 month after TACE, were assessed using the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria. Overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Short-term response markers were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:There was no significant difference in the incidence of any grade of adverse events. The objective response rates were 50% and 62% in patients treated with TACE with SAP and with conventional TACE, respectively (P = 0.358). The overall survival rates were not significantly different (P = 0.810); the 1-year survival rates and the median survival time of the patients treated with TACE with SAP and with conventional TACE were 76% and 74%, and 18 months and 21 months, respectively. Overall survival was related to the short-term response. An alpha-fetoprotein level Conclusions:For TACE-naïve patients, TACE with SAP and conventional TACE had comparable safety and short-term efficacies.
