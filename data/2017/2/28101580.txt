The representative halophyte Calystegia soldanella (L) Roem. et Schult is a perennial vine herb that grows in coastal dunes throughout South Korea as well as in other regions around the world. This plant has long been used as an edible and medicinal herb to cure rheumatic arthritis, sore throat, dropsy, and scurvy. Some studies have also shown that this plant species exhibits various biological activities. However, there are few studies on cytotoxicity induced by C. soldanella treatment in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In this study, we investigated the viability of HepG2 cells following treatment with crude extracts and four solvent-partitioned fractions of C. soldanella. Of the crude extract and four solvent fractions tested, treatment with the 85% aqueous methanol (aq. MeOH) fraction resulted in the greatest inhibition of HepG2 cell proliferation. Flow cytometry showed that the 85% aq. MeOH fraction induced a G0/G1 and S phase arrest of the cell cycle progression. The 85% aq. MeOH fraction arrested HepG2 cells at the G0/G1 phase in a concentration-dependent manner, and resulted in decreased expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, CDK4, CDK6, p21, and p27. Additionally, the 85% aq. MeOH fraction treatment also arrested HepG2 cells in the S phase, with decreased expression of cyclin A, CDK2, and CDC25A. Also, treatment with this fraction reduced the expression of retinoblastoma (RB) protein and the transcription factor E2F. These results suggest that the 85% aq. MeOH fraction exhibits potential anticancer activity in HepG2 cells by inducing G0/G1 and S phase arrest of the cell cycle.
