Background:Hepatocholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC) is a rare liver tumour for which no data on chemosensitivity exist. The aims of this multicentre study were to evaluate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and prognostic factors in cHCC-ICC treated by gemcitabine plus platinum as first-line.Methods:Unresectable cHCC-ICC treated by gemcitabine plus platinum-based chemotherapy between 2008 and 2017 were retrospectively analysed. Diagnosis was based on histology or, in case of ICC or HCC histology, on discordant computerised tomography scan enhancement patterns associated with discordant serum tumour marker elevation suggesting the alternative tumour. OS and PFS were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method and prognostic factors by Log-rank test and Cox model.Results:Among 30 patients included, cHCC-ICC was histologically proven in 22 (73.3%). 18 (60%) received gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX), 9 (30%) GEMOX plus bevacizumab, and 3 (10%) gemcitabine plus cisplatin. RECIST criteria were reported in 28 patients: 8 (28.6%) showed partial response, 14 (50%) stable disease, and 6 (21.4%) tumour progression at first evaluation. Median PFS and OS were 9.0 and 16.2 months, respectively. Serum bilirubin ⩾30 μmol l-1 (P=0.001) and positive serology for HBV and/or HCV (P=0.014) were independent poor prognostic factors for OS.Conclusions:Gemcitabine plus platinum-based chemotherapy is effective as first-line for advanced cHCC-ICC.
