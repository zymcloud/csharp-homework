The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its role in promoting HCC metastasis. The expression level of LGR5 in liver tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues were detected adopting immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot assays. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the correlation between LGR5 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. In addition, we assessed the relationship between LGR5 and two epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin and N-cadherin) in HCC tissues and cell lines. Our results showed that the expression of LGR5 was significantly higher in liver tumor tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues. Moreover, up-regulated LGR5 was associated with larger tumor diameter (>5cm, P=0.001), higher TNM stage (P=0.021), increased recurrence (P=0.023) and growing metastasis (P=0.030). Besides, we found that the expression level of LGR5 was correlated with E-cadherin and N-cadherin. In conclusion, up-regulated LGR5 in HCC patients is associated with malignant clinicopathological characteristics. LGR5 may promote HCC metastasis through inducting EMT process, and thus can be regarded as a candidate biomarker for prognosis and as a target in therapy.
