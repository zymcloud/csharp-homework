The expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the functions and contributions of lncRNAs remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a critical role of SNHG6-003 in HCC. We found that five SNHG6 transcripts were differentially expressed in HCC tissues while only the SNHG6-003 had an oncogenic function. Ectopic expression of SNHG6-003 in HCC cells promoted cell proliferation and induced drug resistance, whereas SNHG6-003 knockdown promoted apoptosis. Moreover, SNHG6-003 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), effectively becoming sponge for miR-26a/b and thereby modulating the expression of transforming growth factor-Î²-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). Importantly, expression analysis revealed that both SNHG6-003 and TAK1 were upregulated in human cancers, exhibiting a co-expression pattern. In HCC patients, high expression of SNHG6-003 closely correlated with tumor progression and shorter survival. Thus, targeting the ceRNA network involving SNHG6-003 may be used as a treatment strategy against HCC.
