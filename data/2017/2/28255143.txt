Intra-cardiac extension of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an uncommon but serious condition related to poor prognosis. We report a 57-year-old male diagnosed with HCC with intra-cardiac extension into the right atrium at presentation. There were no symptoms related to cardiac involvement and intra-cardiac extension was incidentally noted on radiological imaging. He was offered palliative treatment and succumbed to his disease within 50 days of first diagnosis.
