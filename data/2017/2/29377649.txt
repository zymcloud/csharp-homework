Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are suitable candidates for the delivery of various anti-cancer drugs. However, currently insufficient tumor-permeability and non-specific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system limits the application of SLNs. Here, we developed novel pH-sensitive cationic polyoxyethylene (PEGylated) SLNs (PEG-SLNs+) that could accumulate long-term at various tumor sites to enhance the therapeutic efficiency of camptothecin (CPT). These CPT-loaded PEG-SLNs+ (CPT-PEG-SLNs+) were spherical nanoparticles, with small size (∼52.3±1.7 nm), positive charge (∼34.3±3.5 mV) and high entrapment efficiency (∼99.4±1.7%). Drug release profile indicated the overall released amount of CPT from CPT-PEG-SLNs+ at pH 5.5 was 20.2% more than at pH 7.4, suggesting CPT-PEG-SLNs+ were a pH-sensitive SLNs. This PEG-SLNs+ could be efficiently uptaken into cells to inhibit the proliferation of CL1-5 cells (IC50 = 0.37 ±0.21 ug/ml) or HCC36 cells (IC50 = 0.16±0.43 ug/ml). In living animal, our PEG-SLNs+ could accumulate long-term (for more than 120 hours) in various types of tumor, including human lung carcinoma (NCI-H358, CRL5802, CL1-5), human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC36), and CPT-PEG-SLNs+ could efficiently enhance the therapeutic efficiency of CPT to suppress the growth of the HCC36 or CL1-5 tumors. Therefore, Successful development of these pH-sensitive PEGylated cationic SLNs may provide a selective and efficient drug delivery system for cancer therapy.
