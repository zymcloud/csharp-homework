Background:Recent evidence suggested that associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy with a partial split could effectively induce the same degree of future liver remnant hypertrophy as a complete split in non-cirrhotic and non-cholestatic livers with better postoperative safety profiles. Our aim was to evaluate if the same phenomenon could be applied to hepatitis-related chronic liver diseases.Methods:In the study, 25 patients who underwent associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy from October 2013 to January 2016 for hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed. Partial-associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (n = 12) was defined as 50-80% of the transection surface split and complete-associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (n = 13) was split down to inferior vena cava. Perioperative outcomes stratified by split completeness were evaluated.Results:There was no significant difference in operating times and blood loss for stage I and II operations between complete-associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy and partial-associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy. All patients underwent stage II operation without any inter-stage complications. Complete split induced greater future liver remnant hypertrophy than partial split (hypertrophy rate: 31.2 vs 17.5 mL/day, P = .022) with more pronounced effect in chronic hepatitis (P = .007) than cirrhosis (P = .283). Complete-associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy was more likely to attain a future liver remnant/estimated standard liver volume ratio >35% within 10 days (76.9% vs 33.3%, P = .024) and proceed to stage II within 14 days after stage I (100% vs 58.4%, P = .009). The overall postoperative morbidity (â‰¥grade 3a) after stage II was 16% (complete versus partial split: 7.7% vs 25%, P = .238) and hospital mortality after stage II was 8% (complete versus partial split: 0% vs 16.7%, P = .125).Conclusion:Complete-associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy induced more rapid future liver remnant hypertrophy than partial-associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy without increased perioperative risk in chronic liver diseases.
