Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the main causes of liver cirrhosis worldwide. The long-term impact of HCV infection is highly variable, ranging from minimal histological changes to extensive fibrosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. The development of HCV drugs has increased dramatically in recent years, even in special populations such as chronic kidney disease patients. Classical treatment of chronic hepatitis C was based on the administration of interferon and ribavirin for 24-48 weeks, which was associated with a poor viral response and a high rate of side effects, especially in patients with a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. The current high availability of the new direct-acting antivirals renders the classification of these agents for this special population necessary. The Spanish Association of the Liver and the Kidney has produced a position statement on the treatment of HCV infection in chronic kidney disease patients since the evidence to guide this treatment is scant and what evidence does exist is weak. The recommendations are based on the results of clinical trials and controlled studies conducted to date, with data published hitherto by the authors of these studies. Since the indications for treatment have been evaluated by other societies or are dependent on internal clinical protocols, the main goal of this position statement is to assist in decision-making when choosing a therapeutic option.
