Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of adult liver cancer and accounts for approximately 90% of all cases of primary liver cancer annually. Rhotekin (RTKN), which functions as a cancer promoter, can be frequently detected in many human cancers, including gastric cancer, colorectal carcinoma and bladder carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RTKN in HCC. Using HCC cells and tissues from patients with liver cancer, we demonstrated that RTKN was significantly increased in HCC. To examine the effect of RTKN on HCC, RTKN overexpressed or silenced HepG2 and Hep3B cells were constructed. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. The results showed that RTKN can function as an oncogene and promote the proliferation, while inhibiting apoptosis, of HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Furthermore, we identified that RTKN is a direct gene target of miR-152. miR-152 can reverse the growth promoting effect of RTKN on HCC cells through G2/M phase arrest and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signal inhibition. In conclusion, our research identified that miRNA-152 can inhibit tumor cell growth by targeting RTKN in HCC.
