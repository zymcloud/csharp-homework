The combination of hepatic artery infusion (HAI) of irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin with intravenous cetuximab has safely achieved prolonged survival in colorectal cancer patients with extensive liver metastases and prior treatment. Systemic exposure to the drugs or their main metabolites was determined during the first course of chronomodulated triplet HAI in 11 patients and related to toxicities after one or three courses. Consistent trends were found between the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values of irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38; a bioactive metabolite), total oxaliplatin and platinum ultrafiltrate (P-UF), on the one hand, and subsequent leukopenia severity, on the other hand. Moreover, the maximum plasma concentration (C max) and the AUC of P-UF significantly predicted grades of diarrhoea (p = 0.004 and 0.017, respectively) and anaemia (p = 0.001 and 0.008, respectively) after the first course. Systemic drug exposure helps explain both the adverse events and the low rate of extrahepatic progression-a usual drawback of HAI chemotherapy-thus supporting upfront testing of the regimen. Systems optimization of chronomodulated HAI delivery could further reduce adverse events.
