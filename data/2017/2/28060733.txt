Increasing evidence supports that microRNA (miRNA) plays a significant functional role in cancer progression by directly regulating respective targets. In this study, the expression levels of miR-105-1 and its target gene were analyzed using genes microarray and hierarchical clustering analysis followed by validation with quantitative RT-PCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal liver tissues. We examined the expression of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1), the potential target gene of miR-105-1, following the transfection of miR-105-1 mimics or inhibitors. Our results showed that miR-105-1 was downregulated in HCC tissues when compared with normal liver tissues and patients with lower miR-105-1 expression had shorter overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Moreover, NCOA1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-105-1. Furthermore, concomitant high expression of NCOA1 and low expression of miR-105-1 correlated with a shorter median OS and PFS in HCC patients. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that NCOA1 is a direct target of miR-105-1 suggesting that NCOA1 and miR-105-1 may have potential prognostic value and may be useful as tumor biomarkers for the diagnosis of HCC patients.
