Little information is available on the impact of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy on changes in liver fibrosis and steatosis. Liver stiffness (LS) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) values were evaluated using transient elastography. The study subjects were 214 elderly patients infected with HCV genotype 1b who received 24-week daclatasvir and asunaprevir dual therapy. All patients of this retrospective study had no hepatocellular carcinoma before and during DAA therapy. LS and CAP were assessed before treatment (baseline), at end of treatment (EOT), and at 24, 48, 72 weeks (W) after EOT. The rate of sustained viral response (SVR) by daclatasvir and asunaprevir therapy was 91%. LS values for the entire group correlated with Fib-4 index at baseline (r = 0.565, P
