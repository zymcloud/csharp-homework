The effects of harmaline on the viability and apoptosis of human liver carcinoma were investigated in vitro. HepG2 cells were treated with harmaline (0-10 ÂµM), and the proliferation and apoptosis of HepG2 cells were investigated using an MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The protein expression of cellular tumor antigen p53 (p53), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (Fas), Fas ligand (FasL) and caspase-8 was subsequently measured using western blotting. In addition, an ELISA was used to analyze caspase-8/3 activity. Harmaline significantly increased p53, p21, Fas and FasL protein expression in HepG2 cells. Additionally, treatment with harmaline significantly increased the expression of caspase-8 and caspase-8/3 activity. The results from the present study suggest that harmaline suppresses the viability, but induces the apoptosis, of human liver carcinoma cells through upregulation of the p53/p21 and Fas/FasL signaling pathways.
