Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies of cancers and its prognosis remains dismal due to the paucity of effective therapeutic targets. Up-regulation of glutathione-s-transferase A 4 (GSTA4) is associated with poor prognosis of HCC, but its functional mechanism in HCC remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of GSTA4 in tumor growth and metastasis of HCC and found that GSTA4 was frequently up-regulated in HCC tissues. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, GSTA4 was demonstrated to significantly regulate cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, GSTA4 overexpressing significantly promoted the tumorigenicity and metastasis of HCC cells in nude mice models bearing human HCC, whereas silencing endogenous GSTA4 caused an opposite outcome. Moreover, we demonstrated that GSTA4 enhanced HCC aggressiveness by activating protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. In multivariate analysis, our results GSTA4 overexpression promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and might represent a novel therapeutic target for its treatment.
