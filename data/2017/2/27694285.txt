Liver diseases are the fourth leading cause of mortality among adults in the United States. Patients with chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis have significantly higher risks of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With a dismal five-year survival rate of 11%, HCC is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Regardless of the underlying cause, late presentation and a lack of effective therapy are the major impediments for successful treatment of HCC. Therefore, there is a considerable interest in developing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of chronic liver diseases at the early stages. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small cell subpopulation in a tumor, exhibit unlimited self-renewal and differentiation capacity. These cells are believed to play pivotal roles in the initiation, growth, metastasis, and drug-resistance of tumors. In this review, we will briefly discuss pivotal roles of the CSC marker doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) in hepatic tumorigenesis. Recent evidence suggests that anti-DCLK1 strategies hold promising clinical potential for the treatment of cancers of the liver, pancreas, and colon.
