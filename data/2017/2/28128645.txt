Intra-arterial injection of 131I Lipiodol is an effective treatment option for primary hepatocellular carcinoma as it delivers high radiation dose to liver tumor tissue with minimal accumulation in adjacent normal tissue. The present article demonstrates design, fabrication, and utilization of a semiautomated radiosynthesis module for preparation of 131I labeled Lipiodol. The radiolabeling method was standardized for preparation of patient dose of 131I labeled Lipiodol radiochemical yield (RCY); radiochemical purity (RCP) and pharmaceutical purity of the product were determined using optimized procedures. Sterile and apyrogenic 131I labeled Lipiodol in >60% RCY could be prepared with >95% RCP. Preclinical evaluation in animals indicated retention of more than 90% of activity at 24 hours postportal vein injection. This is the first report demonstrating potential application of simple user friendly and safe semiautomated system for routine production of 131I labeled Lipiodol, which is adaptable at centralized hospital radiopharmacies. The described prototype module can be modified as per demand for preparation of other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals.
