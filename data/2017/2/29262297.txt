Anticonvulsant drugs are used to treat a wide range of non-epileptic conditions, including chronic pain. The aim of the present experiments was to examine analgesic activity of three new 3,3-diphenyl-propionamides, which had previously demonstrated anticonvulsant activity in the MES (maximal electroshock seizure), scPTZ (subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole) and/or 6Hz (psychomotor seizure) tests in mice. Antinociceptive activity was examined in mouse models of acute pain (the hot plate test) and tonic pain (the formalin test) in mice. Antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic activity was estimated in the oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and in the streptozotocin-induced model of painful diabetic neuropathy in mice. Considering the drug safety evaluation, the influence on locomotor activity was checked. Moreover, using in vitro methods, selected compound was tested for potential hepatotoxicity on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and for metabolic stability. To determine the plausible mechanism of anticonvulsant and antinociceptive action, in vitro binding and functional assays were carried out. Among tested molecules two of them JOA 122 (3p) and JOA 123 (3q) revealed significant antinociceptive activity in the model of tonic pain - the formalin test and neuropathic pain models - the oxaliplatin and streptozotocin-induced peripheral neuropathy. In the binding studies JOA 122 (3p) revealed the high affinity to voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1.2), as well as for 5-HT1A receptors. Metabolism studies in mouse liver microsomes showed a low metabolic stability of this compound.
