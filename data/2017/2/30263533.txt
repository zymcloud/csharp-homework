This study aimed to investigate the effects of ethanol extract of astringent persimmon on antioxidant activity, cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity, and mRNA expression of cholesterol metabolism-related genes in human hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cells). In the results, DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity showed that the different types cultivars of astringent persimmon was similar to Vitamin C as positive control. However, there are not significant differences among samples. In addition, our results showed that cholesterol amounts and HMG-CoA reductase activity were inhibited by astringent persimmon in HepG2 cells. Further, treatment with astringent persimmon upregulated the expression of LDL receptor and SREBP-2, and also increased the level of HDL-associated ABCA1. Taken together, our results indicate that astringent persimmon regulate cholesterol accumulation by inhibiting the oxidative stress and controlling the levels of LDL & HDLassociated gene.
