Background:Sorafenib is the drug of choice in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Beneficial effects are limited by mechanisms of chemoresistance, which include downregulation and/or impaired function of plasma membrane transporters accounting for drug uptake. The organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) plays a major role in sorafenib uptake and decreased expression in HCC has been associated with poorer response.Methods:The multicenter retrospective TRANSFER study involved tumor biopsies from 39 patients with advanced HCC and sorafenib therapy for â‰¥4 wk. Endpoint was the relationship between clinicopathological features and immunohistological result. Immunostaining was performed using specific primary anti-OCT1-head and anti-OCT1-tail antibodies. Tumors were classified according to a simplified staining score as absent, weak, moderate or strong, taking into account the localization of the staining at the plasma membrane as positive or negative.Results:Results confirmed OCT1 downregulation in half of the cases investigated (10% absent, 38% weak). However, only one third of tumors expressing OCT1 displayed plasma membrane location (15% vs. 36% cytosolic expression). When comparing HCC with and without OCT1 expression, no different sorafenib response was found. When tumors expressing OCT1 at the plasma membrane were considered separately, a marked longer survival was found (Log Rank p
