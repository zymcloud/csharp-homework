Purpose:To investigate the long-term outcome and prognostic factors of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT).Methods:From 2004 to 2014, 15 patients with 23 hepatic recurrent HCCs after LT underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA. There were 14 males and 1 female aged 54.3 ± 9.5 years old (37-78 years old). The average tumour size was 3.3 ± 1.2 cm (1.7-6.0 cm). Seven patients had a single HCC and eight had 2-4 HCCs. Regular follow-up after RFA was performed to assess local response rates and long-term survival rates. Survival results were generated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and a multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox regression model.Results:The technical success rate was 95.7% (22/23 tumours). The minor complication rate was 7.7% (2/26 sessions), and there were no major complications. The follow-up period was 27.4 ± 18.9 months (12-116 months). The local progression rate and intrahepatic new lesion rate were 13.0% (3/23 tumours) and 53.3% (8/15 patients), respectively. Extrahepatic metastasis was found in four patients (26.7%). The 1-, 3- and 5-year estimated overall survival rates were 71.8%, 35.9% and 26.9%, respectively. Additionally, the multivariate analysis revealed that serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) before RFA, tumour number and extrahepatic metastasis were significantly related to overall survival after RFA.Conclusion:Ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA of recurrent HCC after LT had a high technical success rate and local control. However, RFA cannot decrease the frequency of new tumours or extrahepatic metastasis. The AFP level and tumour number before RFA should be considered to predict the outcome.
