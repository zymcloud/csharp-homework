Objective: To clarify the clinicopathologic features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients survived more than 10 years after radical hepatectomy. Methods: Two hundreds and fifty-two patients who underwent curative resection for HCC between January 1999 and March 2006 at Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University were included.There were 217 male cases and 35 female cases aging from 17 to 82 years with median age of (53.8±10.5)years. Followed by March 31 2016, clinicopathologic factors in 10-year survivors and patients who died within 10 years were compared by χ(2) test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards model and the prognostic factors affecting survival were identified. Results: All patients were followed-up for 4.0 to 205.7 months with median time of 53.4 months. The 10-year overall survival rate was 26%, there were 62 cases(26.2%) who survived for more than 10 years after initial hepatectomy. In survival >10-year group, the paitents with ALT<40 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase<64 U/L, albumin≥35 g/L, without liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, Child-Pugh grade A, no blood transfusion, AFP≤20 μg/L, tumor size ≤5.0 cm, single tumor, high differentiation, TNM stage Ⅰ and TACE negative after resection were more than the patients in survival <10-year group (P<0.05). In multivariate analysis, Child-Pugh grade A, the tumor size ≤5.0 cm and TACE negative after resection were favorable independent factors associated with 10-year survival (P<0.05). Conclusion: Based on the results of the study, Child-Pugh grade A, tumor size ≤5.0 cm and TACE negative after resection at initial hepatectomy might be biologically favorable conditions for patients surviving more than 10 years.
