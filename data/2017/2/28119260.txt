Background:Hepatic lymphoma (HL) is categorized as primary and secondary hepatic lymphoma (PHL and SHL). This disorder can present as hepatic mass or mass-like lesion. Chemotherapy often is the first line treatment for patients with HL. Thus, an accurate pre-management histological diagnosis is essential to potentially improve clinical outcomes. The present study was to explore the prevalence of HL in ultrasound guided liver biopsies for hepatic mass or mass-like lesions, to investigate HL associated clinicopathological features, to raise the awareness of early recognition and proper diagnosis of this entity, and to assess specimen adequacy in needle core biopsy.Methods:Twenty-one cases of HL were enrolled. Clinical and pathological characteristics were evaluated, quality of biopsies was assessed and pertinent literature was reviewed.Results:HL was diagnosed in 0.94% of 2242 liver biopsy cases with ambiguous clinical presentation, laboratory tests and image studies. There were two cases of PHL (0.09%), and nineteen cases of SHL (0.85%). Histopathologically, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most common type, followed by B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Additionally, three lymphocytic infiltration patterns were documented microscopically. The nodular infiltration was the most common type.Conclusions:HL is a rare entity and histopathology along with ancillary tests remains the only way to make the diagnosis. Clinicians' awareness of this entity and early liver biopsy are essential in patient management.
