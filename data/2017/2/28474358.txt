Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) are related to metabolism and cell cycle regulation. However, the corresponding mechanism is not clear in HCC. High BRCA1 direct pathway was constructed with 11 molecules from E2F1 feedback-interactive network in HCC by GRNInfer based on 39 Pearson mutual positive corelation CC â‰¥0.25 molecules with E2F1. Integration of GRNInfer with GO, KEGG, BioCarta, GNF_U133A, UNIGENE_EST, Disease, GenMAPP databases by DAVID and MAS 3.0, E2F1 feedback-interactive BRCA1 indirect mitochondrion to cytosol pathway was identified as upstream LAPTM4B activation, feedback UNG, downstream BCAT1-HIST1H2AD-TK1 reflecting protein, and DNA binding with enrichment of small molecule metabolism; The corresponding BRCA1 indirect membrane to cytosol pathway as upstream CCNB2-NUSAP1 activation, feedback TTK-HIST1H2BJ-CENPF, downstream MCM4-TK1 reflecting ATP, and microtubule binding with enrichment of CD4+T-related cell cycle regulation in HCC. Therefore, we propose that E2F1 interactive with BRCA1 pathway induces HCC two different small molecule metabolism or cell cycle regulation via mitochondrion or CD4+T to cytosol. Knowledge analysis demonstrates our E2F1 feedback-interactive BRCA1 pathway wide disease distribution and reflects a novel common one of tumor and cancer.
