Background/aim:Borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) have a less aggressive behavior than invasive epithelial ovarian tumors. Still some patients relapse or succumb to disease. Molecular markers that reliably predict prognosis are lacking. Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein (IMP3) has been suggested as a prognostic marker in colorectal, hepatocellular, and ovarian clear-cell carcinomas.Materials and methods:We analyzed the expression of IMP3 by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 140 BOT and its association with histopathological features.Results:We found no association of IMP3 expression with patients' age, FIGO stage, microinvasion, and presence of implants. In contrast, IMP3 expression correlated to mucinous subtype of BOTs (42.2% vs. 9.5% among other subtypes) (pConclusion:Expression of IMP3 in BOT is associated with the mucinous subtype and may serve as an early indicator for the development of malignant features.
