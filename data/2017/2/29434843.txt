Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. The highly invasive nature of HCC leads to poor prognosis in patients with malignant HCC. AMPK-related protein kinase 5 (ARK5) is a key mediator of migratory activity in human cancer cells. However, the role of ARK5 in invasion and metastasis of HCC cells remains unclear. The present study attempted to determine whether ARK5 is involved in invasion and migration via regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Wound healing and Transwell Matrigel invasion assays were utilized to detect the ability of the epithelial Huh7 and mesenchymal SNU387 HCC cells to migrate and invade. Next, the expression of ARK5 and EMT markers, E-cadherin and vimentin, were examined by western blot analysis. Inhibition of ARK5 was able to significantly reduce the ability HCC cells to invade and metastasize. Furthermore, the knockdown of ARK5 was able to reverse the process of EMT in HCC cells. These data suggested that ARK5 may serve an important role in regulating EMT in HCC cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that ARK5 is a potential molecular target for the development of novel HCC therapeutics, which focus on cell invasion and EMT regulation.
