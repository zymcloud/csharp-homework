Metallothionein is cysteine-rich low molecular mass protein. The involvement of MT in many physiological and pathophysiological processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, and the detoxification of heavy metals suggested participation of this protein in carcinogenesis and tumor therapy. Depending on the type of tissue and classification of carcinoma various it was observed relation between MT expression and tumor type, stage, grade, poor prognosis and body resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. MT in tumor cell plays important role in defense mechanism against the effect of radiation by inhibiting the processes that lead to the apoptosis. A number of studies have shown an increased expression of MT in various human tumors of larynx, pancreas, kidney, uterus and breast, whereas lower MT expression was detected in liver tumors. Variable MT expression was detected in case of thyroid, prostate, lung, stomach and central nervous system tumors. Also MT plays crucial role in the cytostatics treatment. MT can bind cis-platinum compounds and removes them from the cells, which may lead to multidrug resistance. However, the same functions of MT protect against the negative effects of chemotherapeutic treatment. It is especially important in case of heart cells. Analysis of MT expression in tumor cells may be useful in choosing method of treatment. It is difficult to determine whether increased expression of MT is only a inducing factor of the development of the carcinogenesis, its malignances and multidrug resistance, or it is a factor inhibiting the induction and development of cancer.
