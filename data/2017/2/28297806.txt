Nonalcoholic fatty fiver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease in clinical practice. It develops from simple fatty liver, nonalcoholic fatty hepatitis to liver fibrosis which may develop liver cirrhosis and result in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) eventually. Although studies show that many cell signaling pathways, genes and cell factors are involved in the progression and development of NAFLD related HCC, the exact mechanism underling the pathogenesis of NAFLD-HCC remains poorly understand. Here in this review, we give a summary of the recent findings at home and abroad that describe the epidemiology and pathogenesis of NAFLD associated HCC.
Carcinoma, hepatocellular; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
