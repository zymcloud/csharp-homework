Objective:The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical features in patients with unilateral sinus disease.Method:A retrospective review of 2 480 patients who had undergone sinus surgery was performed. The clinical data were gathered and analyzed to investigate the features of the unilateral sinus disease. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed.Result:1 350 patients (54.4%) who had bilateral sinus disease were all diagnosed as chronic rhinosinusitis pathologically confirmed after surgery. Unilateral sinus disease was identified in 1 130 patients (45.6%) and the disease entities were categorized as chronic rhinosinusitis (589 patients, 52.1%), fungal rhinosinusitis (312 patients, 27.6%), inverted papilloma (95 patients, 8.4%), sinus cyst (78 patients, 6.9%), malignant tumor (34 patients, 3%), osteoma including osteodysplasia fibrosa (11 patients, 1%) and others (11 patients, 1%) . Among the patients of malignant tumor, there were 13 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 6 cases of malignant lymphoma, 4 cases of sarcoma, 4 cases of melanoma, 3 cases of adenocystic carcinoma, 1 case of verrucous carcinoma, 1 case of metastases from liver, 1 case of plasmacytoma,and 1 case of hemangiopericytoma. The number of fungal rhinosinusitis patient increased year by year. The common major presenting symptom for fungal rhinosinusitis was headache (46.8%) and bloody discharge (31.1%). Male accounted for a large part of both inverted papilloma and malignant tumor patients, both of which CT findings that correlated with the presence was the absorption and destruction of the sinus wall. Thirty-one cases (32.6%) of inverted papilloma patients recurred. Bloody discharge (58.8%) was major symptom of the malignant tumor.Conclusion:There were almost a half of unilateral sinus diseases that were not common chronic rhinosinusitis, in which the incidence of fungal rhinosinusitis, inverted papilloma, squamous cell carcinoma and other kinds of benign and malignant tumor was high. A careful history taking and endoscopic examination play a key role as well as imaging examination in identifying unilateral sinus disease, which is important for reaching a correct diagnosis and treatment.
