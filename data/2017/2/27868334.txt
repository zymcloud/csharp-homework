Essentials An international collaboration provides a consensus for clinical definitions. This concerns thrombotic microangiopathies and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The consensus defines diagnosis, disease monitoring and response to treatment. Requirements for ADAMTS-13 are given.Summary:Background Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) are two important acute conditions to diagnose. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a broad pathophysiologic process that leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and involves capillary and small-vessel platelet aggregates. The most common cause is disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may be differentiated by abnormal coagulation. Clinically, a number of conditions present with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, including cancer, infection, transplantation, drug use, autoimmune disease, and pre-eclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome in pregnancy. Despite overlapping clinical presentations, TTP and HUS have distinct pathophysiologies and treatment pathways. Objectives To present a consensus document from an International Working Group on TTP and associated thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Methods The International Working Group has proposed definitions and terminology based on published information and consensus-based recommendations. Conclusion The consensus aims to aid clinical decisions, but also future studies and trials, utilizing standardized definitions. It presents a classification of the causes of TMA, and criteria for clinical response, remission and relapse of congenital and immune-mediated TTP.
