Background:Atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are premalignant conditions for gastric cancer. Their reversibility by Helicobacter pylori eradication remains controversial.Aim:To evaluate the reversibility of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia by H. pylori eradication with long-term follow-up.Methods:598 subjects were prospectively enrolled and followed for up to 10 years. They were categorised as H. pylori-negative (n = 65), H. pylori non-eradicated (n = 91), and H. pylori-eradicated (n = 442). Histological assessment was performed for antrum and corpus by Sydney classification.Results:Histological follow-up was performed regularly at 1, 2, 3-4 and ≥5 years, with mean follow-up of 1.07 ± 0.21, 2.29 ± 0.83, 3.93 ± 1.02, and 6.45 ± 1.28 years, respectively. Atrophic gastritis in antrum and corpus gradually and significantly (both P < .05 for all timepoints) improved only in the H. pylori-eradicated group compared to that at baseline. Significant difference in atrophic gastritis between H. pylori-eradicated and H. pylori-negative groups disappeared from 1-year follow-up. Similarly, intestinal metaplasia in antrum and corpus improved significantly (both P < .05 for all timepoints) only in the H. pylori-eradicated group in comparison with that at baseline. Significant difference in intestinal metaplasia between H. pylori-eradicated and H. pylori-negative groups disappeared from ≥5 years of follow-up in the antrum and from 3 years of follow-up in the corpus.Conclusion:H. pylori eradication may be a preventative strategy for intestinal-type gastric cancer by regression of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.
