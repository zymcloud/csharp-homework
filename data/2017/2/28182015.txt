DNA replication is a central procedure of cell proliferation, whereas aberrant DNA replication is indicated to be a driving force of oncogenesis. Minichromosome maintenance complex component 7 (MCM7) plays an essential role in initiating DNA replication. To investigate the potential oncogenic properties and prognostic value of MCM7 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we conducted immunohistochemistry staining of MCM7 in 153 HCC samples and found that MCM7 high expression level was associated with worse overall survival (OS) of HCC patients. Mechanistically, knockdown of MCM7 significantly inhibited cellular proliferation in vitro and HCC tumorigenicity in vivo. Cyclin D1 was proved to be regulated by MCM7-MAPK signaling pathway. Clinically, high expression of both MCM7 and cyclin D1 exhibited a relatively high sensitivity and specificity to predict worse outcome of HCC patients. Taken together, our results suggest that MCM7-cyclin D1 pathway may participate in cancer progression and serve as a biomarker for prognosis in HCC.
