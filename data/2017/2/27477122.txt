Aim:There is merging evidence suggesting that the miR-146a polymorphism might be associated with susceptibility to digestive system cancer. However, previous published studies have failed to achieve a definitive conclusion. To address this issue, an updated meta-analysis was performed.Methods:A comprehensive electronic search was conducted using the following source to identify the eligible studies: PubMed, Embase, China BioMedicine, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Odds ratios and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was used in the quantitative synthesis.Results:The database search identified 1344 eligible studies, of which 32 (comprising 12,541 cases and 15,925 controls) were included. The results indicate that the miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of digestive system cancer in heterozygote comparison (GC vs. CC: OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.30, P=0.02), and recessive model (GG vs. GC+CC: OR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.17, P=0.006). Subgroup analysis by cancer site revealed increased risk in gastric cancer above heterozygote comparison (GG vs. GC: OR=1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.25, P=0.02), and recessive model (GG vs. GC+CC: OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.26, P=0.006). Similarly, increased cancer risk was observed in hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with homozygote comparison (GG vs. CC: OR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.42, P=0.02), heterozygote comparison (GC vs. CC: OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.02-1.29, P=0.02), and dominant model (GG+GC vs. CC: OR=1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.29, P=0.009). When stratified by ethnicity and quality score, increased cancer risks were also observed among Asians, Caucasians and high quality studies subgroup.Conclusion:The current study revealed that miR-146a G/C genetic polymorphism was more likely to be associated with digestive system cancer risk.
