Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases in clinical practice, and the spectrum of NAFLD includes nonalcoholic simple fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver cirrhosis. Some patients may even progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. At present, the gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD is liver biopsy, but since this is an invasive examination and has high costs, its application is limited in clinical practice. More and more studies have focused on noninvasive diagnostic methods for NAFLD, including serological markers, fatty liver predictive model, and imaging examinations. Emerging diagnostic techniques, including genomics, proteomics, glycomics, and metabolomics, also play an important role in the diagnosis of NAFLD.
