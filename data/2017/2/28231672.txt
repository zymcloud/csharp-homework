Objective: To explore the causes of cancer deaths and cause-eliminated-life-expectancy among residents of Tianjin. Methods: Data from the death registry system of Tianjin residents in 2015 were collected and cancers were grouped according to the classification of Global Burden of Disease. Specific cancer crude death rate and cause eliminated life expectancy (CELE) were calculated. Results: In 2015, 17 641 Tianjin residents died of cancer, with the crude death rate as 171.79 per 100 thousand and the standardized rate according to the Chinese population in 2000 as 86.32 per 100 thousand. The cancer deaths among men was 10 165, with crude death rate of 197.39 per 100 thousand and standardized rate was 95.41 per 100 thousand. While among females the cancer deaths was 7 476, with crude death rate as 146.04 per 100 thousand and standardized rate as 76.65 per 100 thousand. The top five leading deaths on cancers among men were lung, liver, stomach, "colon, rectum and anal" , pancreas, while lung, breast, liver, "colon, rectum and anal" , stomach were in women. The life expectancy increased 3.53 and 2.88 years among men and women respectively after the exclusion of cancer deaths. When lung cancer death was excluded, the life expectancy increased 1.25 and 0.97 years respectively among men and women. Lung cancer was the main reason of life expectancy lost than cancer of other locations. Conclusion: Cancers, with lung cancer in particular, were the major diseases causing death and life expectancy lost in the Tianjin residents which called for urgent effective intervention programs to develop.
