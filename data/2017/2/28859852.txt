Aim:To compare the long-term therapeutic outcomes of repeated radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with that of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in patients with local tumour progression (LTP) after initial RFA treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Between July 2006 and February 2012, 713 patients underwent RFA for single HCC as a first-line treatment. Fifty-eight patients who showed LTP as initial tumour recurrence post-RFA treatment were included. Patients were treated with either repeated RFA (n=33) or TACE (n=25). TACE was performed as an alternative therapeutic option when repeated RFA was not feasible based on the planning ultrasonography. Recurrence-free and overall survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors for outcomes were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Both groups did not show significant differences in terms of baseline characteristics, with the exception being the proportion of subphrenic tumours (p=0.031). The RFA and TACE groups did not differ significantly in their 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates (17% versus 10.7% and 72.7% versus 51.9%, respectively, with all p-values >0.05). In addition, multivariate analyses revealed that type of treatment was not associated with recurrence-free or overall survival in patients with post-RFA LTP.Conclusion:TACE is an effective treatment, comparable to repeated RFA, in patients with LTP after initial RFA when repeated RFA is not feasible.
