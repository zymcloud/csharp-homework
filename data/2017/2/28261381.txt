It is widely accepted that the indications for hepatectomy in colorectal cancer liver metastases and liver metastases of neuro-endocrine tumors result in relatively better prognoses, whereas, the indications and prognoses of hepatectomy for non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases (NCNNLM) remain controversial owing to the limited number of cases and the heterogeneity of the primary diseases. There have been many publications on NCNNLM; however, its background heterogeneity makes it difficult to reach a specific conclusion. This heterogeneous disease group should be discussed in the order from its general to specific aspect. The present review paper describes the general prognosis and risk factors associated with NCNNLM while specifically focusing on the liver metastases of each primary disease. A multidisciplinary approach that takes into consideration appropriate timing for hepatectomy combined with chemotherapy may prolong survival and/or contribute to the improvement of the quality of life while giving respite from systemic chemotherapy.
