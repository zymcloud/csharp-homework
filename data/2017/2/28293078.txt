It has been reported that the serum level of vitamin D3 (VitD3) could affect the natural course of chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) and the response to treatment with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin. Although several mechanisms for the favorable effects of VitD3 supplementation were reported, the total effect of VitD3 supplementation remains unclear. Previously, we reported that supplementation with 1(OH)VitD3 could enhance the Th1 response inducing not only a favorable immune response for viral eradication but also HCC control. Recently, the main treatment of CH-C should be direct acting antivirals (DAAs) without Peg-IFN. Peg-IFN is a strong immune-modulator. Therefore, an immunological analysis should be carried out to understand the effect of VitD3 after treatment of DAAs without Peg-IFN. The induction of a favorable immune response by adding VitD3 might be able to suppress the hepatocarcinogenesis after achieving SVR, especially in children and elderly patients with severe fibrosis lacking sufficient amounts of VitD3.
