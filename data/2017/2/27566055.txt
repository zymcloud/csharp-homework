Background and aims:Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) has been proposed as an alternative management strategy for acute cholecystitis caused by malignant cystic duct obstruction in patients for whom surgery is not an option. This study aimed to compare the results of EUS-GBD with those of percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) for palliative management of malignant cystic duct obstruction with acute cholecystitis or symptomatic gallbladder hydrops.Methods:Between November 2013 and November 2015, 14 patients with acute cholecystitis or symptomatic gallbladder hydrops as a result of malignant cystic duct obstruction underwent EUS-GBD with covered metal stents. Nineteen patients with acute cholecystitis as a result of malignant cystic duct obstruction who received PTGBD served as a control group. Patients' medical records were reviewed retrospectively.Results:The technical and clinical success rates of EUS-GBD were 85.7% (12/14) and 91.7% (11/12) and of PTGBD were 100% (19/19) and 86.4% (17/19), respectively. The groups had similar adverse event rates (28.5% and 21.1%, respectively). The average duration of stent patency in patients with EUS-GBD was 130.3 Â± 35.3 days, and no patient required an additional procedure before death. In 6 of 17 patients (35.3%) with clinically successful PTGBD, the catheter was not removed until the end stage of life.Conclusions:EUS-GBD is a feasible, safe, and effective modality for the treatment of malignant cystic duct obstruction in patients who are not indicated for surgery. It enables improved long-term quality of life in patients with advanced-stage cancer.
