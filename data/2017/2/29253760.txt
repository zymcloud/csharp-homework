Artemisia capillaris Thunberg (AC) has been widely used to treat various diseases including hepatitis and is known to affect many cellular events such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. Herein a potent ethyl acetate fraction (AC68) was newly extracted from AC, and was assessed for its anti-cancer efficacy in progression and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AC68 dose-dependently inhibited the growth and proliferation of two HCC cell lines. The AC68-induced apoptosis was observed by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and decreased survivin, XIAP, and MCL-1 expression via mitochondria membrane potential change, as well as elevated numbers of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. AC68 was also found to suppress invasion and migration of HCC cells. Moreover, it inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. In vivo study showed that AC68 significantly inhibited tumor growth in HCC mouse xenograft model, and induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of cleaved caspase-3. The expression of PCNA was decreased by the treatment of AC68. Taken together, our data demonstrated that AC68 not only induced apoptosis but also inhibited cell growth, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cells by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway. We suggest that AC68 may be a potent chemotherapeutic candidate for the treatment of HCC.
