Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified natural killer (NK) cells represent a promising immunotherapeutic modality for cancer treatment. However, their potential utilities have not been explored in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Glypian-3 (GPC3) is a rational immunotherapeutic target for HCC. In this study, we developed GPC3-specific NK cells and explored their potential in the treatment of HCC. The NK-92/9.28.z cell line was established by engineering NK-92, a highly cytotoxic NK cell line with second-generation GPC3-specific CAR. Exposure of GPC3+ HCC cells to this engineered cell line resulted in significant in vitro cytotoxicity and cytokine production. In addition, soluble GPC3 and TGF-Î² did not significantly inhibit the cytotoxicity of NK-92/9.28.z cells in vitro, and no significant difference in anti-tumor activities was observed in hypoxic (1%) conditions. Potent anti-tumor activities of NK-92/9.28.z cells were observed in multiple HCC xenografts with both high and low GPC3 expression, but not in those without GPC3 expression. Obvious infiltration of NK-92/9.28.z cells, decreased tumor proliferation, and increased tumor apoptosis were observed in the GPC3+ HCC xenografts. Similarly, efficient retargeting on primary NK cells was achieved. These results justified clinical translation of this GPC3-specific, NK cell-based therapeutic as a novel treatment option for patients with GPC3+ HCC.
