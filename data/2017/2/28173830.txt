Background:Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma usually develops in the setting of cirrhosis or chronic inflammation. Major risk factors for developing hepatocellular carcinoma are chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection, alcoholic cirrhosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The most frequent locations for hepatocellular carcinoma to metastasize are the lungs, portal vein, bones, and regional lymph nodes.Case presentation:A 41-year-old Sri Lankan man presented with progressive abdominal distension and on examination was found to have a palpable irregular mass in the left lobe of his liver with moderate ascites. His ascitic fluid was an exudate without malignant cells. An ultrasound scan and contrast-enhanced computed tomography of his abdomen showed a large contrast-enhancing lesion in the left lobe of his liver without features of cirrhosis. Laparoscopic assessment revealed peritoneal and omental deposits. Histology of the biopsies taken from the liver lesion, omental deposits, and peritoneal deposits supported a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. His liver biochemistry was normal and hepatitis serology was negative. He is abstinent from alcohol and did not have metabolic syndrome.Conclusions:It is rare for a young patient to develop hepatocellular carcinoma with a normal liver without chronic hepatitis B or C infection, or any other risk factors. Intraperitoneal metastasis of non-ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma is also very rare. Here we report a rare case of a 41-year-old man with a large hepatocellular carcinoma in a non-cirrhotic liver without chronic hepatitis who presented with peritoneal and omental metastasis.
