Aim:This study aimed to investigate the factors predicting overall response and overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing balloon-occluded transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (B-TACE).Methods:Sixty-six patients treated with B-TACE at a Japanese tertiary referral hospital between January 2011 and August 2015 were included in this retrospective cohort study.Results:The overall response was classified as complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 35 (53.0%), 7 (10.6%), 13 (19.7%), and 11 (16.7%) patients, respectively. The response rate was 63.6%, and the disease control rate was 83.3%. The number of tumors (hazard ratio [HR], 4.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-15.7; P = 0.021) and Î±-fetoprotein level (HR, 11.40; 95% CI, 2.75-46.9; P Conclusion:Balloon-occluded transcatheter arterial chemoembolization may exert a good antitumor effect and result in good overall survival in select hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
