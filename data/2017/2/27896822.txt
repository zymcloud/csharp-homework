Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV genotype 4 is found widely in the Middle East, Egypt and Africa, and has also spread into Europe. There are limited data available regarding the use of direct-acting antiviral agents in HCV genotype 4-infected patients with cirrhosis.Aim:To evaluate in the phase III, open-label, single-arm PLUTO study the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of simeprevir (HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor) plus sofosbuvir (HCV nucleotide-analogue NS5B polymerase inhibitor) in treatment-naïve and (peg)interferon ± ribavirin-experienced HCV genotype 4-infected patients, with or without compensated cirrhosis.Methods:Adult patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection received simeprevir 150 mg once-daily and sofosbuvir 400 mg once-daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). Safety was also assessed.Results:Forty patients received treatment; the majority were male (73%) and treatment-experienced (68%). Overall, 7/40 (18%) patients had compensated cirrhosis. All patients achieved SVR12 [100% (Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence interval: 91-100%)]. Adverse events, all Grade 1 or 2, were reported in 20/40 (50%) patients. No serious adverse events were reported and no patients discontinued study treatment. Grade 3 treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were noted in 2/40 (5%) patients.Conclusions:Treatment with simeprevir plus sofosbuvir for 12 weeks resulted in SVR12 rates of 100% in treatment-naïve and -experienced patients with HCV genotype 4 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis, and was well tolerated.
