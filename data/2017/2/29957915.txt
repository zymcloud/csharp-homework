Objective:To investigate the efficacy of Ciji Hua'ai Baosheng formula (CHBF) on microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) expression in serum and tumor tissue of mice receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of H(22) hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Sixty Kunming mice were injected subcutaneously with H(22) hepatoma carcinoma cell suspensions into the right anterior armpit. Seven days later, all transplanted tumor were formed and the mice were intraperitoneally injected 200 mg/kg Cytoxan (CTX) to establish the models of tumor-bearing mouse chemotherapy, then they were randomly divided into model group, continuing CTX chemotherapy group (CTX group), and three CHBF (117, 58.5 and 29.25 g/kg) groups. After ten days of treatments, histology was observed, contents of VEGF, KDR and bFGF in serum and tumor tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), VEGF and bFGF protein expression and MVD tagged by CD34 were detected by immunohistochemistry.Results:MVD in CHBF (117, 58.5 g/kg) and CTX groups was significantly lower than that in model group (P Conclusion:CHBF can effectively reduce the expression of VEGF, KDR and bFGF in serum and tumor tissue, and decrease MVD and delay tumor progression.
