Talin-1 is a known oncogene-associated protein. In this study, we set out to determine its role and mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. We found Talin-1 to be highly expressed in HCC cells relative to non-cancer liver epithelial cells and to promote tumor growth and metastasis. We used Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray analysis with HCC cells and HCC cells in which Talin-1 was knocked down using shRNA to identify transcripts regulated by Talin-1. Of the 40,000 tested genes, 3099 were differentially expressed after Talin-1 knockdown; expression of 1924 genes was increased, while expression of 2175 was decreased. Gene ontology (GO) profiling indicated that Talin-1 promotes many HCC progression-related activities, including ion transport and membrane depolarization, cell growth, and cell adhesion. We also characterized the network of gene transcripts regulated by Talin-1 and their role in promoting HCC progression. Our findings confirm the role of Talin-1 in carcinogenesis and provided a set of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCC.
