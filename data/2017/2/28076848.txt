Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with main portal vein tumor thrombus have a median survival time of only about 4 months. We therefore compared the safety and efficacy of endovascular brachytherapy (EVBT) and sequential three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-DCRT). From a cohort of 176 patients, we treated 123 with EVBT using iodine-125 seed strands (group A) and the remaining 53 with sequential 3-DCRT (group B). Overall survival, progression free survival and stent patency characteristics were compared between the two groups. Our analysis demonstrated a median survival of 11.7 ± 1.2 months in group A versus 9.5 ± 1.8 months in group B (p = 0.002). The median progression free survival was 5.3 ± 0.7 months in groupA versus 4.4 ± 0.4 months in group B (p = 0.010). The median stent patency period was 10.3 ± 1.1 months in group A versus 8.7 ± 0.7 months in group B (p = 0.003). Therefore, as compared to sequential 3-DCRT, EVBT combined with portal vein stenting and TACE improved overall survival of HCC patients with main portal vein tumor thrombus.
