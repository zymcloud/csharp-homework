Objective:To describe the epidemiological, analytical and histological characteristics and clinical course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers with negative HBe antigen.Material and methods:Observational, retrospective cohort study of HBV carriers with negative HBe antigen (2005-2012), with no other causes of liver disease.Results:One hundred and thirty-eight patients were included, with mean age 40.5±12.2 years; 54% were women, and 38% were of foreign origin; the number of foreign patients significantly increased (P® or liver biopsy: 55.4% normal histology and 6.1% cirrhosis. Just over three quarters of patients (77.77%) were inactive carriers. Treatment was required in 15.5% of patients (20% because of cirrhosis and 80% HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B). Five patients cleared HBsAg (annual rate .94%), all of whom presented HBV-DNA <2,000IU/ml at diagnosis. Five patients developed complications (3.6%), 4 of them hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), of which only 2 had cirrhosis. There was 1 HBV-related death (.72%).Conclusion:Among HBV carriers with negative HBe antigen, inactive HBs-Ag carriers are predominant. HBV-DNA gradually decreases in the first few years after diagnosis. Morbidity and mortality are low, especially if glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) is normal and HBV-DNA levels are low at diagnosis. Treatment is needed in a considerable number of patients. HCC is the most frequent complication, even in the absence of cirrhosis.
