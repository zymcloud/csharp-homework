Accurate characterization of cirrhotic nodules and early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are of vital importance. Currently, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are standard modalities for the investigation of new nodules found at surveillance ultrasonography (US). This article describes the successful integration of contrast material-enhanced US into a multimodality approach for diagnosis of HCC and its benefits in this population. The application of contrast-enhanced US immediately following surveillance US allows for prompt dynamic contrast-enhanced evaluation, removing the need for further imaging of benign lesions. Contrast-enhanced US also provides dynamic real-time assessment of tumor vascularity so that contrast enhancement can be identified regardless of its timing or duration, allowing for detection of arterial hypervascularity and portal venous washout. The purely intravascular nature of US contrast agents is valuable as the rapid washout of nonhepatocyte malignancies is highly contributory to their differentiation from HCC. The authors believe contrast-enhanced US provides complementary information to CT and MR imaging in the characterization of nodules in high-risk patients.
