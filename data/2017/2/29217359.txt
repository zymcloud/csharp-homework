Background:Health burdens of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are emerging quickly in the world, including in Taiwan. Surgical resection has been recognized as the first-line treatment for early tumors. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic risk factors for mortality and recurrence rate in Taiwan, which has a high prevalence of chronic viral hepatitis.Methods:A total of 397 HCC patients receiving tumor resection were consecutively examined in central Taiwan from 2008 to 2014. A hospital-based patient cohort was designed to collect serological markers to further assess liver function. We modified the Kaplan-Meier method according to the competing death risks for comparing recurrence and used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression to adjust for significant risk factors.Results:In addition to advanced fibrosis, tumor size ≥5 cm was significantly associated with higher mortality within the 5-year period when compared with Conclusion:Tumor size ≥5 cm might be a good predicting factor for death and early recurrence when considering death as a competing risk.
