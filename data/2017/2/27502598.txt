Purpose:For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the superiority of anatomical resection (AR) over non-anatomical resection (NR) is still controversial. In this study, we assessed the potential benefits of AR for HCC.Methods:We enrolled 173 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy in our hospital from August 2003 to May 2013 and compared the outcomes for the AR group (n = 125) with those for the NR group (n = 48).Results:The median observational period was 790 days. The 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 92.1 and 85.8 %, respectively; the 1- and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 78.2 and 63.0 %, respectively. The AR and NR groups did not significantly differ in the OS or DFS. However, the 2-year DFS was significantly better for the AR group than the NR group among HCV patients (68.2 vs. 32.2 %; P = 0.004) and patients with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) within the normal range (Conclusions:If a patient is HCV-negative, has low AFP, low total bilirubin, or a tumor diameter of 2-5 cm, AR is recommended.
