Predictors of treatment efficacy with ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir as direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen for HCV infection are still unclear. Retreatment efficacy of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir for failures to prior DAA regimens, including NS5A inhibitors, are also unknown because resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in NS5A have been shown to persist up to the long-term of post-treatment. One hundred seventy-five patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, without decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, were evaluated SVR12 by ledipasvir 90 mg plus sofosbuvir 400 mg once-daily for 12 weeks. Overall, SVR12 were 92%, based on intention to treat analysis. In failures to daclatasvir plus asunaprevir, SVR12 were 71%. The study using ultra-deep sequencing showed that ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir was effective to one case of failures to daclatasvir plus asunaprevir with multidrug RAVs (triple mutation in NS3-D168/NS5A-L31/NS5A-Y93). Multivariate analysis identified FIB4 index (
