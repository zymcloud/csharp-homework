Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key regulators in oxygen homeostasis. Their stabilization and activity are regulated by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)-1, -2, -3 and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). This study investigated the relation between these oxygen sensors and the clinical behaviors and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tissue microarray and RT-PCR analysis of tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues revealed that mRNA and protein levels of both PHD3 and FIH were lower within tumors. The lower expression of PHD3 in tumor was associated with larger tumor size, incomplete tumor encapsulation, vascular invasion and higher Ki-67 LI (p
