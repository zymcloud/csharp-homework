Background:An impaired HBsAg-secretion can increase HBV oncogenic-properties. Here, we investigate genetic-determinants in HBsAg correlated with HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and their impact on HBsAg-secretion and cell-proliferation.Methods:This study included 128 chronically HBV-infected patients: 23 with HCC (73.9% D; 26.1% A HBV-genotype), and 105 without cirrhosis/HCC (72.4% D, 27.6% A) as reference-group. The impact of mutations on HBsAg-secretion was assessed by measuring the ratio [secreted/intracellular HBsAg] until day 5 post-transfection. The impact of mutations on cell-cycle advancement was assessed by flow-cytometry.Results:Two HBsAg mutations significantly correlated with HCC: P203Q (17.4% [4/23] in HCC vs 1.0% [1/105] in non-HCC, P=0.004); S210R (34.8% [8/23] in HCC vs 3.8% [4/105] in non-HCC, P Conclusions:Specific mutations in HBsAg C-terminus significantly correlate with HBV-induced HCC. They hamper HBsAg-secretion and are associated with increased cellular proliferation, supporting their involvement in HCC-development. The identification of viral genetic markers associated with HCC is critical to identify patients at higher HCC-risk that may deserve intensive liver monitoring, and/or early anti-HBV therapy.
