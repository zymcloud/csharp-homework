Previous work has suggested that ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) have regenerative antioxidant properties, which have motivated researchers to consider CNPs as therapeutic agents for treating a number of diseases, including cancer. Recent studies have shown CNPs to be toxic to cancer cells, to inhibit invasion and sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy. In addition, several hydrophilic polymers have been used to coat the CNP surface in order to enhance its properties of extensive biocompatibility and systemic nontoxicity to normal cells and tissues. However, the results of previous studies were based on high CNP doses (10 μg/mL or more), and these doses may cause serious side effects in clinical applications. The impact of low CNP doses on tumor cells remains unknown. In this study, we report experiments indicating that CNPs-AL- polyethylene glycol (PEG)600, a type of surface-modified CNP that is more stable and less toxic than traditional CNPs could promote proliferation of hepatoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, further research showed that a low dose (0.01 μg/mL) of CNPs-AL-PEG600 could reduce hepatoma cell apoptosis and activate AKT/ERK signaling pathways. These results may provide information that is important for using CNPs-AL-PEG600 as a therapeutic agent in clinical cancer treatments.
