AGBL2 has been reported to catalyze Î±-tubulin detyrosination, by which it promotes tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, its potential role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been revealed yet.

In a large cohort of clinical HCC tissues, high expression of AGBL2 was positively associated with tumor size, tumor multiplicity and advanced clinical stage (p
