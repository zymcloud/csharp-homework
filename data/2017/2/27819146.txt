Monopolar spindle1 (Mps1, also known as TTK) is the core component of the spindle assembly checkpoint, which functions to ensure proper distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. Mps1 is hardly detectable in normal organs except the testis and placenta. However, high levels of Mps1 are found in many types of human malignancies, including glioblastoma, thyroid carcinoma, breast cancer, and other cancers. Several Mps1 inhibitors can inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and exhibit demonstrable survival benefits. Mps1 can be utilized as a new immunogenic epitope, which is able to induce potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity against cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Some clinical trials have validated its safety, immunogenicity and clinical response. Thus, Mps1 may be a novel target for cancer therapy. Mps1 is differentially expressed between normal and malignant tissues, indicating its potential as a molecular biomarker for diagnosis. Meanwhile, the discovery that it clearly correlates with recurrence and survival time suggests it may serve as an independent prognostic biomarker as well.
