A 60-year-old man presented with odynophagia after bronchial artery infusion chemotherapy for pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed an esophageal ulcer in the middle thoracic esophagus. An esophageal biopsy demonstrated no malignancy. However, the symptoms had not improved after a month. EGD was performed again and showed a white cord lump at the bottom of the same esophageal ulcer identified before, showing no improving tendency. A repeated biopsy of the lump revealed actinomycosis, and the symptoms were improved by the oral administration of ampicillin. We herein report a case in which esophageal actinomycosis with a unique morphology of refractory esophageal ulcer was rapidly improved by the administration of antibiotics.
Esophageal actinomycosis; Esophageal ulcer; Refractory ulcer.
