Ethnopharmacological relevance:Licochalcone A (LCA) is a characteristic chalcone that is found in licorice, which is a traditional medicinal plant. In traditional medicine, LCA possesses many potential biological activities, including anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities.Aim of the study:To determine the antioxidant activity of LCA and, on this basis, to investigate the role of its anticancer activity.Materials and methods:To validate the antioxidant activity of LCA, the proteins SOD, CAT and GPx1 were analyzed using western blotting and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assays. Oxidative free radicals are associated with cancer cells. Therefore, the anticancer activity of LCA was also evaluated. To assess the anticancer activity, cell viability assays were performed and apoptosis was evaluated. In addition, MAPK-related proteins were analyzed using western blotting.Results:The experimental data showed that the EC50 of LCA is 58.79±0.05μg/mL and 46.29±0.05μg/mL under the two conditions tested, with or without PBS. In addition, LCA at a concentration of approximately 2-8μg/mL can induce the expression of SOD, CAT and GPx1 proteins. Further, LCA inhibits the growth of HepG2 cells through cell proliferation arrest and the subsequent induction of apoptosis, and LCA attenuated the p38/JNK/ERK signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusion:The results showed that LCA suppresses the oxidation of cells and markedly inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. These findings confirm the traditional use of LCA in folk medicine.
