Aim:To evaluate the efficacy of the newly proposed albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade for therapy selection, clinical features of patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were elucidated.Methods:From 2000 to 2015, 1101 patients with HCC (Results:Median tumor size was 1.7 cm (interquartile range, 1.4-2.2 cm) and single tumors were found in 802 cases (72.8%) (tumor-node-metastasis stage of the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan I : II : III = 536:454:111). In the LD-A group, the number of cases with ALBI-grade 1, 2, and 3 were 294, 224, and 1, respectively, while those in the LD-B group were 47, 490, and 12, respectively. In the LD-C group, 19 and 14 patients were ALBI-2 and -3, respectively. Akaike Information Criterion values for CP, LD-grade, and ALBI-grade were 6015.4, 5988.8, and 5990.7, respectively. However, there was no significant difference regarding prognosis between LD-A/B (n = 228) and C (n = 31) (median survival time, 4.8 vs. 3.9 years, P = 0.0818) in CP-B, whereas a significant difference was observed regarding prognosis for ALBI-1/2 (n = 232) and ALBI-3 (n = 27) (median survival time, 4.8 vs. 2.7 years, P = 0.0168).Conclusion:Albumin-bilirubin grade showed an assessment ability similar to that of LD-grade. Furthermore, there was a small improvement in prognosis following RFA in patients with an ALBI-grade of 3. Although only two serological parameters, albumin and total bilirubin, are used, assessment with ALBI-grade may be more useful than with LD-grade for avoiding a non-beneficial RFA procedure.
