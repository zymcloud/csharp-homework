Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection can add to the severity of hepatitis and the risks of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Whether chronic HCV infection decreases antibody response to hepatitis B vaccination is still controversial. We evaluate the influence of HCV infection on antibody response to hepatitis B vaccination by a systematic review of published works with a meta-analysis of clinical trials. The random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird with heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were used in this study. The end-point of interest was the rate of patients showing seroconversion of antibody responses at completion of hepatitis B vaccination schedule among patients with chronic HCV infection versus healthy controls. We identified 11 studies involving 704 patients with HCV and 812 controls. Our results show a significant decrease in antibody seroconversion rates among patients with HCV versus healthy controls (pooled odds ratio = 0.17 [95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.28]). The P-value was 0.21 for our test of study heterogeneity. Stratified analysis in subgroups of interest and sensitivity analysis did not meaningfully change our results. Our meta-analysis showed patients with hepatitis C infection have a statistically significant lower rate of seroconversion in comparison to healthy controls, both in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Chronic HCV infection can decrease the immune response to a standard schedule of hepatitis B vaccination. Further studies are needed to investigate the optimum vaccination schedule for patients with chronic HCV infection.
