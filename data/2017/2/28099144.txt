Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high recurrence rate, and patients exhibit poor survival mainly because intrahepatic metastasis is common. We previously reported that let-7c down-regulation is significantly associated with poor differentiation level in HCC. In the present study, we demonstrate that miR-199a-5p and let-7c are frequently down-regulated in HCC cells and tissues, and low expression of miR-199a-5p is correlated with tumor size, liver envelope invasion. Furthermore, miR-199a-5p and let-7c cooperatively inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion in vitro. MAP4K3 is identified as the direct target of miR-199a-5p and let-7c and this regulation is further confirmed by luciferase reporter assays and Western blotting. In addition, MAP4K3 functions as a metastasis promoter since the results demonstrate that MAP4K3 could promote HCC cell migration and invasion. We also find that miR-199a-5p and let-7c increase the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib.Conclusions:We report that miR-199a-5p and let-7c cooperatively and efficiently inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion by targeting the metastasis promoter MAP4K3 and MAP4K3-mediated drug sensitization, suggesting that the use of miRNAs and sorafenib in combination therapy may be a powerful approach to the treatment of HCC.
