We studied the lipoprotein profiles of human hepatic cells at various stages of differentiation. The production of three major classes of lipoproteins, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), was detected in three well-differentiated human hepatoma cell lines and primary human hepatocytes; however, these lipoproteins were not detected in the culture medium in which undifferentiated hepatoma cell lines were grown. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), ApoB100, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) were markedly lower in the undifferentiated hepatoma cell lines than in the well-differentiated hepatoma cell lines and primary hepatocytes. These results indicate that apolipoprotein synthesis, and triglyceride-transport by MTP might be rate-limiting steps in lipoprotein production in mature hepatic cells.
