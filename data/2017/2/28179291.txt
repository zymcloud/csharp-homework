Aim:The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), astragaloside IV (AS-IV) and curcumin on tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic nude-mouse model of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have previously shown the usefulness of orthotopic models of human cancer for evaluation of the efficacy of TCM.Materials and methods:Nude mice with orthotopic HepG2 HCC were treated with vehicle control (0.01 ml/g normal saline), cisplatinum (2 mg/kg), AS-IV (20 mg/kg), curcumin (100 mg/kg) or AS-IV plus curcumin (20 mg/kg + 100 mg/kg). Tumor inhibition in each group was evaluated by tumor weight at autopsy. The effect of AS-IV and curcumin on tumor angiogenesis was assessed by CD34 staining and expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), thrombosis-related factor tissue factor (TF) and coagulation factor VII (FVII), as well as microRNAs miR-122 and miR-221.Results:AS-IV and curcumin alone and in combination significantly reduced mean tumor weight compared to vehicle control (pConclusion:The present study indicates future clinical potential of combination therapy with AS-IV and curcumin for HCC.
