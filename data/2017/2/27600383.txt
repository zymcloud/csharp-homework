Purpose:To determine whether pathologic colorectal tumor KRAS mutation status is correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) by imaging after selective internal radiation therapy with Yttrium-90 (SIRT Y90) for metastatic colorectal cancer in the liver (mCRC).Materials and methods:This was an IRB approved, HIPAA compliant retrospective cohort study. Consecutive patients with unresectable mCRC with documented KRAS mutation status treated at a single center from 2002 to 2013 with SIRT Y90 were investigated. Treatment response was compared between KRAS wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) using an anatomic tumor response criteria based on RECIST 1.0. Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox regression analysis were used to measure progression-free survival (PFS) and to assess independent prognostic factors for PFS.Results:82 of 186 patients met review criteria. 33 (40.2%) patients were identified as KRAS mut. PFS was longer in KRAS wt (median 166 days [95% CI 96-258 days]) vs. mut (median 91 days [95% CI 79-104 days], p = 0.002). KRAS mut patients were 1.48 times more likely to progress at first follow-up imaging than wt (95% CI 1.06-2.08, p = 0.024). Univariate analysis identified high pre-SIRT Y90 INR, KRAS wt, any use of anti-EGFR therapy, and post-SIRT Y90 chemotherapy as prognostic factors for longer PFS. In multivariate analysis, only KRAS wt was an independent prognostic factor for longer PFS (RR: 1.80 [95% CI 1.08-2.99], p = 0.024).Conclusion:Longer PFS is associated with KRAS wt vs. mut following SIRT Y90.
