Recent advances have been made in the development of microcatheters, and have contributed to super-selective catheterization. One new tool is the triple co-axial (triaxial) system, which consists of a small microcatheter, large microcatheter, and 4- or 5-Fr. catheter. This system may be applied to complex interventions. We herein introduce the technique for and advantages of the triaxial system.
