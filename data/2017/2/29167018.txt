Background:Statins have been reported to reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The effect of perioperative statin use on the prognosis of HCC patients undergoing liver resection remains unclear.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 643 patients who underwent curative liver resection for HCC. Patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody were classified as the non-B non-C HCC subgroup (n = 204). Perioperative statin users were defined as patients preoperatively receiving statin medications and maintaining > 28 cumulative defined daily doses after liver resection. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) according to statin use were analyzed in the overall HCC cohort or in the non-B non-C HCC subgroup.Results:Among a total of 643 (HCC) patients, 43 patients (6.7%) received perioperative statin medications. In statin users, the proportion of non-B non-C HCC patients was significantly higher than in nonstatin users. Statin users had a high prevalence of obesity and diabetes, as well as dyslipidemia. The liver function of statin users was better than that of nonstatin users. The multivariate survival analysis revealed that use of statins was significantly associated with improvement of RFS (hazard ratio [HR], .42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.71; P = .001), but not with OS (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.30-1.27; P = .19). In the subgroup analysis of the non-B non-C HCC cohort, statin use was significantly associated with improvement of RFS (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22-0.99; P = .04).Conclusion:Perioperative statin use was associated with an improvement of RFS in HCC patients undergoing curative liver resection.
