Purpose:To identify computational and qualitative features derived from dual-phase cone-beam CT that predict short-term response in patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 43 patients with 59 HCCs. Six features were extracted, including intensity of tumor enhancement on both phases and characteristics of the corona on the washout phase. Short-term response was evaluated by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors on follow-up imaging, and extracted features were correlated to response using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Univariate and multivariate analyses did not reveal a correlation between absolute and relative tumor enhancement characteristics on either phase with response (arterial P = .21; washout P = .40; âˆ† P = .90). On multivariate analysis of qualitative characteristics, the presence of a diffuse corona was an independent predictor of incomplete response (P = .038) and decreased the odds ratio of objective response by half regardless of tumor size.Conclusions:Computational features extracted from contrast-enhanced dual-phase cone-beam CT are not prognostic of response to transarterial chemoembolization in patients with HCC. HCCs that demonstrate a diffuse, patchy corona have reduced odds of achieving complete response after transarterial chemoembolization and should be considered for additional treatment with an alternative modality.
