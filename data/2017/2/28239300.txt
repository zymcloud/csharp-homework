Background:MicroRNAs are 22-24 nt non-coding RNAs that bind to the 3' UTR of target mRNAs, thereby inducing mRNA degradation or inhibiting mRNA translation. Due to their implication in the regulation of post-transcriptional processes, the role of miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been extensively studied. However, the function of miR-7 in HCC remains to be demonstrated.Methods:50 paired HCC tissues and matched peritumor tissues from patients were collected. The mRNA level of miR-7 was detected by qRT-PCR. The protein level of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF-4) was determined by western blot. Cell proliferation and invasive ability were measured using MTT and transwell invasion assay, respectively.Results:We demonstrated that miR-7 was downregulated in 50 HCC tissues and the low expression of miR-7 was significantly correlate with tumour size. Moreover, overexpression of miR-7 significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. Over 100 target genes of miR-7 were predicted by Targetscan, and KLF-4 was indicated as the most promising candidate. Luciferase report assay showed that KLF-4 could be silenced by miR-7, so as to restore the impairment of cell proliferation and invasion in HCC cells.Conclusions:In summary, we revealed a role of miR-7-KLF-4 axis in HCC cells, and the combination of both biomarkers might improve HCC diagnosis.
