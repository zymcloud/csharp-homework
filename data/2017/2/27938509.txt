Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Sorafenib is the only first-line systemic drug for advanced HCC, but it has very limited survival benefits because patients treated with sorafenib either suffer from side effects or show disease progression after initial response. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies for first-line and second-line therapies. The association between sorafenib resistance and glycolysis prompted us to screen several drugs with known antiglycolytic activity to identify those that will sensitize cells to sorafenib. We demonstrate that the combination of glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) and sorafenib drastically inhibits viability of sorafenib-sensitive and -resistant cells. However, the combination of other antiglycolytic drugs like lonidamine, gossypol, 3-bromopyruvate, and imatinib with sorafenib does not show synergistic effect. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the combination of 2DG and sorafenib induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Mechanistic investigation suggests that the cell cycle arrest is due to depletion of cellular ATP that activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which, in turn, inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to induce cell cycle arrest. This study provides strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of the combination of sorafenib and 2DG for HCC.
