Background and aim:In recent years, several novel immunotherapeutic approaches were developed and investigated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We designed this systematic review, to evaluate clinical efficacy of specific immunotherapy in patients with HCC, according to the guidelines of Border of Immune Tolerance Education and Research Network (BITERN) and Cochrane collaboration.Methods:We searched Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, TRIP, DART, OpenGrey, and ProQuest through the 9th of December 2015. One author reviewed and retrieved citations from these seven databases for irrelevant and duplicate studies, and two other authors independently extracted data from the studies and rated their quality. We collated study findings and calculated a weighted treatment effect across studies using Review Manager.Results:We found 12144 references in seven databases of which 21 controlled studies with 1885 HCC patients in different stages were included in this systematic review after the primary and secondary screenings. Overall, patients undergoing specific immunotherapy had significantly higher overall survival than those in control group (HR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.47-0.76, P Conclusions:Results of this systematic review based on the available literature suggest that overall specific immunotherapeutic approaches could be beneficiary for the treatment of patients with HCC. This further supports the current and ongoing evaluations of specific immunotherapies in the field.
