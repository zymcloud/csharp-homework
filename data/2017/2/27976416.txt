Background:The temporal relationship between nucleoside analogue therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and liver cancer development has not been evaluated at a population level.Aim:To investigate the impact of nucleoside analogue prescription on liver cancer incidence in a CHB-prevalent region.Methods:We obtained territory-wide nucleoside analogue prescription data from 1999, when nucleoside analogue was first available in Hong Kong, to 2012 and the population-based liver cancer incidence data from 1990 to 2012. We compared the liver cancer incidences from 1990 to 1998 and 1999 to 2012 with adjustment for local hepatitis B surface antigen seroprevalence.Results:Nucleoside analogue prescription patient headcount increased from 2006 per year in 1999 to 26 411 in 2012. Prescription volume in 2012 was highest among 55-64 years (30.3%), higher than 65-74 years (13.0%) and ≥75 years (5.8%). Age-standardised liver cancer incidence 1999-2012 decreased by 1.88%/year (95% CI 3.34% to 0.42%/year). NA therapy was associated with decline in age-adjusted liver cancer incidence (2.7 per 100 000 persons, P < 0.001, 95% CI 1.4-4.0 per 100 000 persons). Fifty-five to sixty-four years age group had the most significant decline (men: 24.0 per 100 000 persons, P = 0.001, 95% CI 11.4-36.6 per 100 000 persons; women: 8.5 per 100 000 persons, P = 0.009, 95% CI 2.3-14.6 per 100 000 persons). No significant association was noted in age groups 65-74 years and ≥75 years (both P > 0.05).Conclusions:Nucleoside analogue prescription was associated with a reduction of overall liver cancer incidence in a CHB-prevalent region. The lack of association among individuals of ≥65 years was consistent with the low nucleoside analogue prescription volume in elderly patients, mitigating the impact of CHB treatment on liver cancer.
