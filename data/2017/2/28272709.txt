Objective:MicroRNAs (miR) participate in cell proliferation, apoptosis and transformation, as they can regulate gene expression and intracellular signal transduction for various physiological processes. MiR-122 and miR-22 are known to be related with occurrence and progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular cancer (HCC). This study recruited HBV-related HCC patients, whose expression levels of miR-122 and miR-22 were determined to analyze the correlation with clinical and pathological indexes.Patients and methods:HBV-related HCC patients were enrolled, in parallel with patients suffering from benign liver disease and non-HBV-related HCC. Real-time PCR was employed to measure miR-122 and miR-22 expression levels.Results:The relative expression levels of miR-122 and miR-22 in HBV-related HCC patients were 1.26 ± 2.73 and 5.49 ± 3.91, respectively, which were significantly lower than that in benign liver disease or non-HBV-related HCC patients (p 0.05). The miR-122 and miR-22 levels were negatively correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, pathological type, differentiation grade, liver cirrhosis, AFP and HBV DNA, all of which were independent risk factors (p Conclusions:MiR-122 and miR-22 were downregulated in HBV-related HCC patients, and were related with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, pathological type, differentiation grade, liver cirrhosis, AFP and HBV DNA.
