In order to achieve high predictive value of cell chemosensitivity test for clinical efficacy, cancer cells were suggested to be encapsulated and cultured in hydrogel to mimic the natural microenvironment of tumors. However, handling 3D cells/hydrogel culture construct is tedious and cellular response is difficult to be quantitatively analyzed. In the current study, a novel platform for conducting 3D cell culture and analyzing cell viability has been developed towards a high throughput drug screening. Cells encapsulated in the hydrogel were cultured in the microwells of a paper substrate. The substrate was then immersed in the culture medium containing drug for 2 days. At 24 and 48h during the culture course, the paper substrate was placed on the measurement electrodes for conducting the impedance measurement in order to quantify the cell viability in the hydrogel. Cell viability of two human hepatoma cell lines (Huh7 and Hep-G2) was quantitatively investigated under the treatment of two drugs (doxorubicin and etoposide). The results represented by IC50 values revealed that Huh7 cells had a higher drug resistance than Hep-G2 cells and doxorubicin had a higher efficacy than etoposide for treating hepatocellular carcinoma. The current work has demonstrated a high throughput, convenient, and quantitative platform for the investigation of chemosensitivity of cells cultured in the 3D environment.
