Bladder cancer comprises of many well-known variants and divergent histologies, both of urothelial and adenocarcinomatous type. Extrahepatic tumors with features that resemble hepatocellular carcinoma, often referred to as hepatoid adenocarcinomas, have been described in many different organs, and are aggressive and prognostically unfavorable. Hepatoid features of bladder cancer are unusual and rarely reported. We report a unique case of a metastatic lesion to the liver consisting of a urothelial carcinoma with hepatoid features, a tumor that likely falls within the hepatoid adenocarcinoma spectrum. It is an unusual morphological finding in urothelial carcinoma and is important to recognize due to its potential for aggressive behavior, particularly when it involves a liver lesion in which hepatocellular carcinoma may be suspected.
Liver metastasis; urothelial carcinoma.
