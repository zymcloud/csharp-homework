Cancerous human liver cell line has been used to test the hepatic toxicity of indoor dust, showing its organic extract decreases cell viability. However, little is known about its impact on normal human liver cell line. In the present study, we compared the cellular responses between carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and normal cell line (HL-7702) after exposing to 10-640 μg/100 μL organic dust extract for 24 h. The dust extract caused cytotoxicity, oxidative damage, inflammatory response and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP) in both cells. The inhibition of cell viability in HL-7702 cells was stronger than that in HepG2 cells, with HL-7702 cells having lower LC50. Higher production of oxidative stress, more loss of MMP and stronger suppression of antioxidant enzymes mRNA level occurred in HepG2 cells, while mRNA expression and hepcidin secretion were enhanced in HL-7702 cells at 40/100 μL, indicating the dust extract probably perturbed their liver Fe homeostasis. Our data showed considerable differences in cellular responses between normal and cancerous cell lines. To obtain accurate data, normal hepatocytes should be employed as they better match with the in vivo tissue than cancerous cell lines.
