Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a therapeutic procedure often performed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Local complications, though generally uncommon, can arise from arterial ischemia and local cytotoxicity from the chemotherapeutic delivery. We present a case of acute pancreatitis as a rare complication of the TACE procedure along with a review of literature of this uncommon adverse effect.
