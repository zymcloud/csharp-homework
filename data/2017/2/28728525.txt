The objective was to examine gender differences in causes of death using the San Francisco HIV/AIDS and death registries. Data from San Francisco residents diagnosed with HIV/AIDS who died from 1996 to 2013 were analyzed. Age, race/ethnicity, year, and gender-adjusted standardized mortality ratios and Poisson 95% confidence intervals were calculated for underlying causes of death. Among the 6268 deaths, deaths attributed to drug use, mental disorders due to substance use, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, and septicemia were more likely among women than among men. Compared to the California population, women had elevated standardized mortality ratios for drug overdose (25.37), mental disorders due to substance abuse (27.21), cerebrovascular disease (2.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.37), heart disease (2.37), and liver disease (5.54), and these were higher than the standardized mortality ratios for the men in our study. Men, but not women, had elevated standardized mortality ratios for suicide (2.70), undetermined intent (3.88), renal disease (2.29), and non-AIDS cancer (1.68) compared to population rates. Continued efforts to reduce HIV-related illnesses and an increased emphasis on diagnosing and treating preventable causes of death, including substance use, heart disease, and mental health disorders, are needed as part of comprehensive HIV care.
