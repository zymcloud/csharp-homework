The Albumin-to-Alkaline Phosphatase Ratio (AAPR) has been recently revealed as a prognostic index for hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas its role in metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of AAPR in patients with metastatic NPC. We retrospectively reviewed 209 metastatic NPC patients treated with cisplatin-based regimens. Survival data were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards regression methodology. The optimal cutoff level of AAPR for assessing overall survival (OS) was 0.447, which was determined by R software. An AAPR less than 0.447 was significantly associated with a higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (273 vs. 185 U/L, P = 0.004), a higher EBV DNA viral load (5.59×105 vs. 3.49×104 copies/ml, P = 0.001), and more liver and bone metastases (P = 0.005 and P = 0.001, respectively). Additionally, patients with an AAPR < 0.447 had a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 3.269, 95% confidence interval: 1.710-6.248; HR: 2.295, 95% confidence interval: 1.217-4.331, respectively) than those with an AAPR ≥ 0.447. Our study suggested that the AAPR might be a novel prognostic factor in metastatic NPC patients treated with cisplatin-based regimens. However, a prospective study to validate its prognostic value is needed, and the mechanisms underlying the low AAPR and poor survival in metastatic NPC need to be further investigated.
