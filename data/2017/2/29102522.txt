Background and aims:To evaluate the prevalence and the long-term course of gastric precancerous lesions in patients with GML.Patients and methods:In this retrospective single-centre study, we included 179 patients with GML, 70 with gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GDLBCL) and 152 with Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis (HpG), from January 1995 to January 2014. The presence of atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and neoplastic lesion has been assessed at baseline and during follow-up.Results:Atrophic gastritis was more frequent in the GML group whereas there was also a trend for intestinal metaplasia and gastric dysplasia. In patients with GML, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and gastric dysplasia were more frequent in the GML area than in other part of the stomach. During follow-up, the prevalence of atrophic gastritis remained stable overtime whereas intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia tend to increase overtime. In multivariate analysis, the occurrence of dysplasia or carcinoma was associated with the presence of intestinal metaplasia at baseline and male gender.Conclusion:GML is associated with gastric precancerous lesion to a higher extent than GDLBCL and HpG. Those precancerous lesions do not regress despite achievement of complete remission of GML and tend to increase overtime.
