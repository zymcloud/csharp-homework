Background: PRC1, a microtubules(MTs)-associated protein, is essential in the mitosis and cell cycle regulation. It has been recently linked to chemoresistance and tumorigenesis. The current study sought to explore the role of PRC1 on chemoresistance and postoperative prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Methods: PRC1 was transfected into HCC cells to detect its effects of chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil in vitro and in vivo. This study also investigated the impact of PRC1 on 5-FU-induced G2/M phase arrest and the potential molecular mechanism. Surgical specimens from HCC patients were examined immunohistochemically for PRC1 expression. Results: Ectopic expression of PRC1 significantly increased the chemoresistance, promoted the tumor growth and abrogated 5-FU-induced G2/M phase arrest via p21/p27-pRBs pathway. In clinical specimens, high expression of PRC1(immunostaining scoreâ‰¥3) in HCC cells predicted an unfavorable postoperative survival of HCC patients(P=0.019), especially for whom received postoperative chemotherapy(P=0.002). In multivariate Cox analyses, high PRC1 expression significantly predicted an unfavorable postoperative prognosis, not dependent of TNM stage. Conclusion: High PRC1 expression in HCC cells increased chemoresistance, attenuated 5-FU-induced apoptosis, abrogated 5-FU-induced G2/M phase arrest, and predicts an unfavorable survival, especially for the patients who received chemotherapy. PRC1 might be a novel prognostic and predictive marker and therapeutic target for HCC patients.
