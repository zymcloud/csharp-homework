Purpose:To develop the treatment algorithm from multivariate survival analyses (MVA) in patients with Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) C (advanced) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with Trans-arterial Chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Consecutive unresectable and non-tranplantable patients with advanced HCC, who received DEB TACE were studied. A total of 238 patients (mean age, 62.4yrs) was included in the study. Survivals were analyzed according to different parameters from the time of the 1st DEB TACE. Kaplan Meier and Cox Proportional Hazard model were used for survival analysis. The SS was constructed from MVA and named BCLC C HCC Prognostic (BCHP) staging system (SS).Results:Overall median survival (OS) was 16.2 months. In HCC patients with venous thrombosis (VT) of large vein [main portal vein (PV), right or left PV, hepatic vein, inferior vena cava] (22.7%) versus small vein (segmental/subsegmental PV) (9.7%) versus no VT had OSs of 6.4 months versus 20 months versus 22.8 months respectively (pConclusion:On MVA of patients with advanced HCC treated with TACE, significant independent prognostic factors (PFs) of survival were CP class, ECOG PS, single HCC
