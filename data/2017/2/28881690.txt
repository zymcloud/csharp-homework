The safety and efficacy of perioperative antiviral therapy for patients with hepatitis B virus related hepatocellular carcinoma and low serum levels of hepatitis B virus DNA are unknown. This retrospective study compared serum levels of hepatitis B virus DNA, liver function, morbidity, and length of hospital stay between patients who underwent hepatic resection alone and patients who received entecavir therapy before and after resection (n = 44 in each group). Propensity score matching was used to reduce confounding due to baseline differences between the groups. Hepatitis B virus reactivation during follow-up, which lasted a median of 6.1 months, occurred in one patient in the entecavir group (2.3%) and 11 patients in the resection-only group (25%; P = 0.02). Liver function, especially alanine aminotransferase levels, recovered much faster in the entecavir group. This group also showed a slightly lower rate of morbidity (P = 0.081) as well as significantly shorter overall hospital stay (20.1 ± 4.9 vs 24.9 ± 13.2 days; P = 0.028) and postoperative hospital stay (11.4 ± 1.9 vs 16.8 ± 13.1 days; P = 0.008). These results from this pilot study suggest that patients with hepatitis B virus related hepatocellular carcinoma and low levels of hepatitis B virus DNA are at risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation following resection, and that perioperative entecavir therapy can safely and effectively reduce this risk. Such therapy also appears to improve liver function and shorten hospitalization.
