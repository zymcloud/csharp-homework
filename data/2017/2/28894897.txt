Purpose:Grade 3 NENs are aggressive tumours with poor prognosis. PRRT+/- radiosensitising chemotherapy is a potential treatment for disease with high somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression without spatially discordant FDG-avid disease. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of PRRT in G3 NEN.Methods:Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) defined from start of PRRT. Subgroup analysis was performed for patients with Ki-67 ≤ 55% and >55%. Anatomical response (RECIST 1.1) and toxicity 3 months after PRRT was determined. Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) of those with prior progression.Results:28 patients (M = 17; age 16-78 years; Ki-67 ≤ 55% = 22) were reviewed. 17 patients had pancreatic, 5 small bowel, 3 large bowel, 2 bronchial and 1 unknown primary disease. 25/28 had significant FDG-avid disease prior to treatment. Most had 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate (median cumulative activity 24.4 GBq, median 4 cycles). Twenty patients had radiosensitising chemotherapy. 89% were treated for disease progression; 79% after prior chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 29 months. The median PFS was 9 months for all patients. 16 patients died (Ki-67 ≤ 55% = 11; Ki-67 > 55% = 5) with median OS of 19 months. For Ki-67 ≤ 55% (N = 22), the median PFS was 12 months and median OS 46 months. For Ki-67 > 55% (N = 6), the median PFS was 4 months and median OS 7 months. On CT imaging, DCR at 3 months post-PRRT was 74%, 35% (8/23) PR and 39% (9/23) SD. Eleven patients received further PRRT due to recrudescent disease after response. Five patients developed progression of discordant FDG-avid disease and were referred for targeted therapy/chemotherapy. Grade 3 and 4 lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in five and five patients, respectively. No renal or liver toxicity related to treatment was seen.Conclusions:PRRT achieves clinically relevant disease control with acceptable toxicity in G3 NENs.
