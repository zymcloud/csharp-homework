Ubiquitin-like with plant homeodomain and ring finger domains, 1 (UHRF1) is overexpressed in a variety of tumor tissues and is negatively correlated with prognosis of patients with cancers, yet so far, a comprehensive study of UHRF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been conducted. The present study was designed to explore the expression of UHRF1, associated clinical implications, and its possible functions in HCC. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect UHRF1 expression in HCC specimens including cancerous and noncancerous tissues. Associations of UHRF1 expression with demographic and clinicopathologic features in HCC were analyzed, and the effects of RNA interference of UHRF1 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration were investigated in vitro and in vivo. UHRF1 mRNA and protein expression were both upregulated and negatively correlated with prognosis in HCC patients. Furthermore, inhibition of proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression were observed in vitro and in vivo after UHRF1 knockdown, moreover, G2/M arrest was detected in HCC cells. In conclusion, elevated UHRF1 expression contributes to poor prognosis by promoting cell proliferation and metastasis in HCC.
