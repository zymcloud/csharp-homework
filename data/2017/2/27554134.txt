Background and aims:In this French multicentre, open-label study, we analyzed the efficacy, safety and patient-reported outcomes of a boceprevir-based triple therapy in HCV genotype 1 cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT).Methods:Patients received PEG-IFN/ribavirin (RBV) for 48 weeks (W) and boceprevir from W4 to W48 or until LT.Results:Fifty-one patients (80% males, median age: 56 years) were included. Fifty-seven percent had hepatocellular carcinoma and 43% end-stage liver disease. At enrolment, the median MELD score was 9 (range: 6-18); the Child-Pugh score was A in 65%, B in 35% and C in 2%. Therapy was discontinued because of severe adverse events (SAEs) in 39% of cases and virological inefficacy in 24%. 16% of patients had undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR24). LT was performed in 18 patients (35%). HCV RNA was undetectable in 16.6% at LT. Seven patients (14%) died and three deaths were attributed to treatment. SAEs (n=129) were observed in 84% of patients. Twenty-four percent of patients developed severe infections. AlbuminConclusions:The safety of the PEG-IFN/RBV/boceprevir combination is poor in patients awaiting LT, with a high risk of severe infection. Moreover, the limited efficacy confirms the indication for IFN-free combinations in these patients.
