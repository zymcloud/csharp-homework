A 71-year-old female presented with melena and anemia. She had a past medical history of renal cell carcinoma diagnosed six years earlier and treated with left nephrectomy. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy showed no abnormalities. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the third commonest urological malignancy, and approximately 25-50% of patients develop metastatic disease after surgery of the primary tumor. The most common sites of metastasis involve lung, lymph nodes, liver, bone and adrenal glands.
