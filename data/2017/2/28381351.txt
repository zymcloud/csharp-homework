The plant flavonol dihydromyricetin (DHM) was reported to induce apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells. This study was undertaken to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of action of DHM. In the study, DHM down-regulated Akt expression and its phosphorylation at Ser473, up-regulated the levels of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bad, and inhibited the phosphorylation of Bad at Ser136 and Ser112. It also inhibited the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and enhanced the cleavage and activation of caspase-3 as well as the degradation of its downstream target poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our results for the first time suggest that DHM-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells may come about by the inhibition of the Akt/Bad signaling pathway and stimulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Dihydromyricetin may be a promising therapeutic medication for hepatocellular carcinoma.
