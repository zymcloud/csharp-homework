Cancer cells consume more glucose than normal cells, mainly due to their increased rate of glycolysis. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) is an analogue of glucose, and sorafenib is a kinase inhibitor and molecular agent used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to demonstrate whether combining 2DG and sorafenib suppresses tumor cell proliferation and motility more effectively than either drug alone. HLF and PLC/PRF/5 HCC cells were incubated with sorafenib with or without 1 µM 2DG, and subjected to a proliferation assay. A scratch assay was then performed to analyze cell motility following the addition of 2DG and sorafenib in combination, and each agent alone. RNA was isolated and subjected to reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to analyze the expression of cyclin D1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) following the addition of 2DG and sorafenib in combination and each agent alone. Proliferation was markedly suppressed in cells cultured with 1 µM 2DG and 30 µM sorafenib compared with cells cultured with either agent alone (P
