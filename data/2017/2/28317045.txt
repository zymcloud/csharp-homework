The Fibrolamellar variant of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLHCC) is a rare form of liver cancer that presents in the 3rd decade of life, is rarely associated with cirrhosis or chronic Hepatitis B/C virus infection, and usually presents with normal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. FLHCC presenting during pregnancy is extremely rare, with only 4 cases reported. We present a case of FLHCC in pregnancy and discuss the dilemmas in management. A 26 year-old primigravida, 26 weeks of gestation presented with a month's history of obstructive jaundice secondary. Investigations revealed a mass in the left lateral segment of the liver with extension down the left hepatic duct into the common bile duct. Following an emergency caesarean section at 31 weeks, she underwent a left hepatectomy with extrahepatic bile duct excision. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathology showed FLHCC. In conclusion, liver tumors presenting during pregnancy should be managed in a multidisciplinary setup with facilities for neonatal intensive care. Management depends on the presumed pathology, period of gestation and family preferences.
