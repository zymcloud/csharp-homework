Although TNFAIP8 overexpression has been implicated in several human cancers, its clinical significance and biological function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Our study demonstrated that TNFAIP8 overexpression in primary HCC samples correlated with TNM stage, recurrence, poor prognosis and served as an independent favorable prognostic factor. We further showed that TNFAIP8 upregulated cell proliferation, migration, invasion and xenograft tumor growth of HCC cells. In addition, TNFAIP8 overexpression inhibited YAP phosphorylation, increased its nuclear localization and stabilization, leading to upregulation of cyclin proteins, CTGF and cell proliferation. We also found that TNFAIP8 could interact with LATS1 and decreased its phosphorylation. Depletion of LATS1 and YAP by siRNA blocked the biological effects of TNFAIP8. Collectively, the present study provides a novel finding that TNFAIP8 promotes HCC progression through LATS1-YAP signaling pathway. TNFAIP8 may serve as a candidate biomarker for poor prognosis and a target for new therapies.
