Purpose:Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy have lower rates of recurrence compared to those who do not. However, the influences of the pathologic response on surgical complications and survival remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influence of neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer on postoperative morbidity and long-term survival.Methods:This was a comparative study of consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer in two European tertiary hospitals between 2004 and 2014. Patients with and without pathologic complete responses were compared in terms of postoperative morbidity, mortality, and survival.Results:Fifty patients with complete response (ypT0N0) were compared with 141 patients who exhibited non-complete response. No group differences were observed in the postoperative mortality or morbidity rates. The median follow-up time was 57 months (range 1-121). Over this period, 11 (5.8 %) patients, all of whom were in the non-complete response group, exhibited local recurrence. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival were significantly better in the complete response group, 92.5 vs. 75.3 % (p = 0.004) and 89 vs. 73.4 % (p = 0.002), respectively.Conclusions:Postoperative complication rate after laparoscopic total mesorectal excision is not associated with the pathologic response grade to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.
