Purpose:In this study, we aim to compare the effects of prognostic indicators on survival analysis for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) C patients undergoing yttrium-90 radioembolization (Y-90).Methods:A prospectively acquired database (2003-2017) for BCLC C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients that underwent radioembolization with Y-90 was searched. The criteria for BCLC C status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 1 or 2, metastases, and/or portal vein thrombosis (PVT)) were recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed from the date of the first radioembolization with Y-90, censored to curative treatment, to determine median overall survival (OS). Cox regression hazards model was used for multivariate analyses. Significance was set at P Results:547 BCLC C patients treated with radioembolization with Y-90 had a median OS of 10.7 months (range: 9.5-12.9). 43% (233 of 547) patients classified as BCLC C solely by their ECOG PS had a median OS of 19.4 months (14.7-23.7); 57% (314 of 547) patients with PVT/metastases had a median OS of 7.7 months (6.7-8.7). On multivariate analysis, ECOG PS was not found to be a statistically significant prognostic indicator of OS in BCLC C whereas metastases and PVT exhibited hazards ratios (95%CI) of 0.51 (0.38-0.69) and 0.49 (0.38-0.63), respectively (P Conclusion:Patients classified as BCLC C due to ECOG PS 1 demonstrated longer survival when compared to those presenting with PVT, metastases and/or ECOG PS 2. Hence, ECOG PS 1, as an isolated variable, may not be a true indicator of advanced disease.
