Background:Treatment strategies for lymph node (LN) metastasis after liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been studied.Patients and methods:The treatment modes and outcomes in patients with LN metastasis after LT (n=6) for HCC were reviewed.Results:The mean time from LT to LN recurrence was 2.0Â±1.3 years, and the locations of the LNs recurrences included the phrenic (n=2), common hepatic artery (n=2), inferior vena cava (n=1) and gastric (n=1) regions. Treatments included surgery alone (n=3), surgery followed by chemoradiation (n=1), radiation followed by chemotherapy (n=1), and chemotherapy, radiation and sorafenib (n=1). Although the patients receiving non-surgical treatments (n=3) died within 1.2 years, those who underwent surgical removal of the metastatic LNs survived 11.2 years, 4.5 years and 0.8 years, respectively, without any signs of re-recurrence.Conclusion:Surgical resection is the only feasible and potentially curative treatment for LN metastasis after LT for HCC.
