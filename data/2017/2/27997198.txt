Doxorubicin (DOX) delivered in a lipiodol-based emulsion (LIPDOX) or in drug-eluting beads (DEBDOX) is used as palliative treatment in patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo delivery performance of DOX from LIPDOX or DEBDOX in HCC patients using the local and systemic pharmacokinetics of DOX and its main metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol). Urinary excretion of DOX and DOXol and their short-term safety and antitumor effects were also evaluated. In this open, prospective, nonrandomized multicenter study, LIPDOX (n = 13) or DEBDOX (n = 12) were injected into the feeding arteries of the tumor. Local (vena cava/hepatic vein orifice) and systemic (peripheral vein) plasma concentrations of DOX and DOXol were determined in samples obtained up to 6 h and 7 days after treatment. Tumor response was assessed using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The Cmax and AUC0-24 h for DOX were 5.6-fold and 2.4-fold higher in LIPDOX vs DEBDOX recipients, respectively (p < 0.001). After 6 h, the respective mean proportions of the dose remaining in the liver or drug-delivery system (DDS) were 49% for LIPDOX and 88% for DEBDOX. LIPDOX releases DOX faster than DEBDOX in HCC patients and provides more extensive local and systemic exposure (AUC) to DOX and DOXol initially (0-7 days). DEBDOX formulation has a release and distribution of DOX that is more restricted and rate controlled than LIPDOX.
