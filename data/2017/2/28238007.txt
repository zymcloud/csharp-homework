Focal liver reaction (FLR) appears in the hepatobiliary-phase images of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI) following radiotherapy (RT). We investigated the threshold dose (TD) for FLR development in 13 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) with 45 Gy in 15 fractions. FLR volumes (FLRVs) were calculated based on planning CT images by referring to fused hepatobiliary- phase images. We also calculated the TD and the irradiated volumes (IVs) of the liver parenchyma at a given dose of every 5 Gy (IVdose) based on a dose-volume histogram (DVH). The median TD was 35.2 Gy. The median IV20, IV25, IV30, IV35, IV40, and IV45 values were 371.1, 274.8, 233.4, 188.6, 145.8, and 31.0 ml, respectively. The median FLRV was 144.9 ml. There was a significant difference between the FLRV and IV20, IV25, and IV45 (p
