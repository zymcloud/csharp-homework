Eph (Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular carcinoma cell) is the largest subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands are involved in embryonic development and physiological processes. Aberrant expression of Eph/ephrin may contribute to a variety of diseases including cancer. EphB3 is a member of Eph receptors and has been found to play roles in carcinogenesis of some types of human cancer. But, its expression and clinical significance in ovarian serous carcinoma have not been well investigated and are unknown. In this study, a set of ovarian tissues including normal fallopian tube, serous borderline tumor, and serous carcinoma were subjected to immunohistochemistry using a specific polyclonal antibody for EphB3. The relationship between EphB3 expression and clinicopathological parameters was statistically analyzed. EphB3 was strongly expressed in all fallopian tube specimens (19/19, 100%). EphB3 was negatively or weekly expressed in 1 of 17 (5.8%) in borderline tumors and 26 of 50 (52.0%) in serous carcinomas, moderately expressed in 7 of 17 (41.2%) in borderline tumors and 14 of 50 (28%) in serous carcinomas, and strongly expressed in 9 17 (52.9%) in borderline tumors and 10 of 50 (20%) in serous carcinomas. EphB3 expression is significantly reduced in serous carcinomas compared with normal fallopian tubes and borderline tumors (p s = -0.613) and FIGO stage (p = 0.001, rs = -0.464) of serous carcinomas. Our results show EphB3 protein lost in ovarian serous carcinoma and is associated with tumor grade and FIGO stage, which indicate EphB3 protein may play a role in carcinogenesis of ovarian serous carcinoma and may be used as a molecular marker for prognosis.
