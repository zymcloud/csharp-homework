Interactions between hepatocytes and immune cells as well as inflammatory episodes are frequently discussed to play a critical role in the alteration of the individual susceptibility to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (iDILI). To evaluate this hypothesis and to face the urgent need for predictive in vitro models, we established two co-culture systems based on two human cell lines in presence or absence of pro-inflammatory factors (LPS, TNF), i.e. hepatoma HepG2 cells co-cultured with monocytic or macrophage-like THP-1 cells. HepG2 monocultures served as control scenario. Mono- or co-cultures were treated with iDILI reference substances (Troglitazone [TGZ], Trovafloxacin [TVX], Diclofenac [DcL], Ketoconazole [KC]) or their non-iDILI partner compounds (Rosiglitazone, Levofloxacin, Acetylsalicylic Acid, Fluconazole). The liver cell viability was subsequently determined via WST-Assay. An enhanced cytotoxicity (synergy) or a hormetic response compared to the drug effect in the HepG2 monoculture was considered as iDILI positive. TGZ synergized in co-cultures with monocytes without an additional pro-inflammatory stimulus, while DcL and KC showed a hormetic response. All iDILI drugs synergized with TNF in the simple HepG2 monoculture, indicating its relevance as an initiator of iDILI. KC showed a synergy when co-exposed to both, monocytes and LPS, while TVX and DcL showed a synergy under the same conditions with macrophages. All described iDILI responses were not observed with the corresponding non-iDILI partner compounds. Our first results confirm that an inflammatory environment increases the sensitivity of liver cells towards iDILI compounds and point to an involvement of pro-inflammatory factors, especially TNF, in the development of iDILI.
