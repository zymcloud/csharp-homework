As a result of increased prevalence of obesity worldwide, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease. Although most NAFLD cases remain benign, some progress to end-stage liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, treatment should be considered for NAFLD patients who are likely to progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or fibrosis. Thymosin beta 4 (Tβ4), a G-actin sequestering peptide, regulates actin polymerization in mammalian cells. In addition, studies have reported anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing, and anti-fibrotic effects of Tβ4. However, no research has been done to investigate the effects of Tβ4 on NAFLD. Based on the findings above mentioned, we hypothesize that Tβ4 may represent an effective treatment for NAFLD.
