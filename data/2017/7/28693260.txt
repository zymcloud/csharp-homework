Numerous studies have suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) potently affect hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the miRNA expression profiling in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of familial aggregation and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has not been elucidated. In the present study, the plasma miRNA expression profiles of 3 patients with HCC with familial aggregation of HCC and HBV infection and 1 healthy volunteer were examined by microarray analysis, in order to identify relevant miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of HCC with familial aggregation and HBV infection. The results indicated that 26 miRNAs exhibited a â‰¥20-fold increase or decrease in the plasma of patients with HCC, compared with the healthy control (24 upregulated and 2 downregulated). Among these altered miRNAs, 15 of them have been reported in HCC. The other 11 miRNAs have never been reported in HCC. These differentially-expressed miRNAs may be potential molecular markers for HCC pathogenesis and development.
