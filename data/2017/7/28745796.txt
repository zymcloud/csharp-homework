Objective:To study the safety and efficacy of simultaneous completion of colorectal cancer resection and liver metastasis resection by total laparoscopy.Patients and methods:In the observation group, 40 patients with colorectal cancer combined with liver metastasis (CRCLM) were selected to receive total laparoscopic surgery. At the same time, 40 cases were selected for laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer and hepatic resection as control group.Results:The outcomes of the two methods in the treatment of CRCLM were compared. The results showed that the difference in surgery time between the two groups was not statistically significant (p>0.05). The blood loss, drainage tube retention time and anal exhaust recovery time in the observation group were significantly less than those in control group (p<0.05). No significant difference in completion rate was found between the two groups (p>0.05); the prevalence rate of complications in the observation group was significantly lower than that in control group (p<0.05). No significant differences in the median survival period and the survival rate at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after surgery were found between the two groups (p>0.05).Conclusions:The outcomes of total laparoscopy in the treatment of CRCLM are not inferior to open surgery.
