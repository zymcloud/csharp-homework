Percutaneous hepatic interventions are generally safe given the fact that liver closely abuts the abdominal wall and hence it is easily accessible. However, the superior portion of liver, adjacent to the diaphragm, commonly referred as the "hepatic dome", presents unique challenges for interventionists. Percutaneous access to the hepatic dome may be restricted by anatomical factors and special considerations may be required to avoid injury to the surrounding organs. The purpose of this review article is to discuss certain specific maneuvers and techniques that can enhance the success and safety of interventions in the hepatic dome.
