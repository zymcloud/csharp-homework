Objective:Liver cancer is one of the common gastrointestinal cancers. This study was designed to investigate the effect of the cytokine-induced apoptosis inhibitor 1 (CIAPIN1) on hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion.Materials and methods:To establish a low and high expression of CIAPIN1 in hepatoma cell lines, pGPU6/GFP/Neo and CIAPIN1 siRNA vectors were constructed. The growth curve of liver cancer cells with a low and high expression of CIAPIN1 was measured by MTT assay and colony formation in soft. The effect of overexpression and inhibition of CIAPIN1 on the expressions of cell cycle proteins Cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin E were detected by western blot.Results:As compared with the low expression group, the cells in CIAPIN1 high expression group showed a significant decrease in proliferation (p Conclusions:CIAPIN1 played an important role in the proliferation of liver cancer cells through increasing the expressions of cell cycle related proteins Cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4, and Cyclin E.
