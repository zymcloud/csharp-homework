miRNAs are involved in many physiologic and disease processes by virtue of degrading specific mRNAs or inhibiting their translation. miR-148a has been implicated in the control of tumor growth and cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis using in vitro or in vivo gene expression- and silencing-based approaches. Here miR-148a knockout (KO) mice were used to investigate the intrinsic role of miR-148a in liver physiology and hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. miR-148a downregulation was found to be correlated with poor clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Under regular chow diet (RCD) or high fat diet (HFD), miR-148a deletion significantly accelerated DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Mechanistically, miR-148a deletion promotes lipid metabolic disorders in mice. Moreover, restoration of miR-148a reversed these defects. Finally, miR-148a was found to directly inhibit several key regulators of hepatocarcinogenesis and lipid metabolism. These findings reveal crucial roles for miR-148a in the hepatic lipid metabolism and hepatocarcinogenesis. They further identify miR-148a as a potential therapeutic target for certain liver diseases, including cancer.
