Hepatitis B virus X protein plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. We previously showed that the tumor suppressor ARID2 inhibits hepatoma cell cycle progression and tumor growth. Here, we evaluated whether hepatitis B virus X protein was involved in the modulation of ARID2 expression and hepatocarcinogenesis associated with hepatitis B virus infection. ARID2 expression was downregulated in HBV-replicative hepatoma cells, HBV transgenic mice, and HBV-related clinical HCC tissues. The expression levels of HBx were negatively associated with those of ARID2 in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, HBx suppressed ARID2 at transcriptional level. Mechanistically, the promoter region of ARID2 gene inhibited by HBx was located at nt-1040/nt-601 and contained potential ATOH1 binding elements. In addition, ectopic expression of ATOH1 or mutation of ATOH1 binding sites within ARID2 promoter partially abolished HBx-triggered ARID2 transcriptional repression. Functionally, ARID2 abrogated HBx-enhanced migration and proliferation of hepatoma cells, whereas depletion of ATOH1 enhanced tumorigenecity of HCC cells. Therefore, our findings suggested that deregulation of ARID2 by HBx through ATOH1 may be involved in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma development.
