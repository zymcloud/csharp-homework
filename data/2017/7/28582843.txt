Background:Remethylation of homocysteine is catalyzed by B12 dependent methionine synthase (MTR) in all types of cells and by B12 non-dependent betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) in liver and kidney cells. Of many etiologies of cancer, an unexplored area is the variations of genes implicated in methylation reaction.Objective:The study evaluated the association of BHMT (rs3733890) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), followed by in-silico characterization of variations in BHMT gene.Methods:BHMT [rs3733890; c.742G > A, which substitutes an arginine by a glutamine at codon 239 (R239Q)] was screened by Tetra-primer Amplification Refractory Mutation System PCR (T-ARMS-PCR) and confirmed using DNA sequencing. In-silico analysis was conducted using bioinformatics tools.Results:BHMT (rs3733890) showed an insignificant association with both childhood and adult ALL. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 18 nsSNPs are deleterious, 3 SNPs in 3'-UTR (rs59109725, rs116634518 and rs138578732) alter the miRNA-binding site, and 11 CNVs are present in the BHMT gene. As consequence of BHMT (rs3733890) polymorphism the free energy changes from -101210.1 kJ/mol to -200021.8 kJ/mol.Conclusions:BHMT (rs3733890) polymorphism showed no association with ALL. Hence this investigation needs further evaluation in larger sample size and effect of other SNPs, CNVs and miRNA's is required to elucidate the role of BHMT gene in ALL development.
