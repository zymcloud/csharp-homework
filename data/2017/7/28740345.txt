Aim:To investigate the functional role and underlying molecular mechanism of miR-29a in hepatitis B virus (HBV) expression and replication.Methods:The levels of miR-29a and SMARCE1 in HBV-infected HepG2.2.15 cells were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. HBV DNA replication was measured by quantitative PCR and Southern blot analysis. The relative levels of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to detect the viability of HepG2.2.15 cells. The relationship between miR-29a and SMARCE1 were identified by target prediction and luciferase reporter analysis.Results:miR-29a promoted HBV replication and expression, while SMARCE1 repressed HBV replication and expression. Cell viability detection indicated that miR-29a transfection had no adverse effect on the host cells. Moreover, SMARCE1 was identified and validated to be a functional target of miR-29a. Furthermore, restored expression of SMARCE1 could relieve the increased HBV replication and expression caused by miR-29a overexpression.Conclusion:miR-29a promotes HBV replication and expression through regulating SMARCE1. As a potential regulator of HBV replication and expression, miR-29a could be a promising therapeutic target for patients with HBV infection.
