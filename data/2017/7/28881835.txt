The Xeroderma pigmentosum group G (XPG) gene promotes recognition and excision of damaged DNA during the DNA repair process. We conducted a comprehensive search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Chinese Biomedical databases for publications evaluating the association XPG gene rs751402 C>T polymorphism and overall cancer risk. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adopted to assess the strength of the association. A total of 22 publications encompassing 10538 cases and 10511 control subjects were included in the final meta-analysis. We found the polymorphism to be associated with increased cancer risk (TT vs. CC: OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.01-1.38, P = 0.040; CT vs. CC: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.24, P = 0.040; and CT/TT vs. CC: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.002-1.26, P = 0.045). Stratification by cancer type indicated that this polymorphism may increase the risk of gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, which was further confirmed by a false-positive report probability analysis. Genotype-based mRNA expression provides further evidence that this polymorphism is associated with altered XPG mRNA expression. This meta-analysis suggests XPG gene rs751402 C>T polymorphism correlates with overall cancer risk, especially for gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.
