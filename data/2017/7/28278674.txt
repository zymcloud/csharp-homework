Two new metabolites, diorcinolic acid (1) and Î²-d-glucopyranosyl aspergillusene A (8), together with six diphenylethers (2-7), a diketopiperazine (9), a chromone (10) and a xanthone (11) were isolated from the fungus Aspergillus sydowii derived from the marine sponge Stelletta sp. The planar structures and their relative configurations were elucidated by analysing 1D, 2D NMR and HRESIMS data. Compound 8 is the first glycoside of phenolic bisabolane sesquiterpenes. Compounds 1 and 8 exhibited mild cytotoxicity against KB (human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells), HepG2 (human liver cancer cells) and HCT 116 (human colon cancer cells). All compounds were evaluated for antibacterial activity and their abilities to suppress LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production. Compounds 2 and 4-7 showed mild antibacterial activity against human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and fish pathogens Streptococcus iniae and Vibrio ichthyoenteri, and compounds 4 and 7 weakly suppressed NO production.
