Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. A careful multidisciplinary assessment of tumor characteristics, liver function and physical status is required for proper therapeutic management. In recent years, several studies have supported the feasibility and benefit of combined therapy in the treatment of single large HCC, defined as those exceeding 3 cm in size. We present a case of combined treatment using radiofrequency ablation followed by trans-arterial chemoembolization with radiopaque embolic beads. The aim of this technical report was to describe the radiologic findings during combined radiofrequency ablation and radiopaque bead embolization, pointing out the differences and the potential advantages of using radiopaque beads compared with non-radiopaque beads. Furthermore, it is also the first report on using radiopaque beads in combined treatment for HCC.
