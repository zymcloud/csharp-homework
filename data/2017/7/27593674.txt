Aim:Liver-specific signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5-deficient mice (STAT5KO) show lipid accumulation in the liver. We investigated the role of hepatic STAT5 in lipid metabolism in vitro and in vivo.Methods and results:High expression of CD36, one of the receptors for free fatty acids, is associated with a high concentration of hepatic triglyceride (TG) in STAT5KO mice. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, one of the regulatory factors of CD36, was upregulated and microRNA (miR)-20b was downregulated in STAT5KO mice. Reporter assays revealed direct regulation involving miR-20b and the 3'-untranslated region of CD36 mRNA. Treatment with free fatty acids enhanced accumulation of TG in STAT5-deleted hepatoma cells, and this was partially canceled by introduction of siRNA for PPARγ and/or pre-miR-20b through inhibition of CD36 expression. In vivo, STAT5/CD36 double knockout mice displayed hepatic TG was decreased compared to STAT5KO mice and it was also reduced by treatment with PPARγ antagonists, GW9662, and/or pre-miR-20b.Conclusions:Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 plays an important role in hepatic fat metabolism through regulation of CD36, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for liver steatosis.
