Pedunculated hepatocellular carcinoma (P-HCC) is rare type of HCC. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of unresectable P-HCC treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and percutaneous chemotherapeutic agents lipiodol emulsion (CALE) injection. The clinical features and outcomes of 25 patients with unresectable P-HCC treated with TACE plus percutaneous CALE injection were retrospectively reviewed, and factors associated with outcomes were analyzed. Comparison with nonpedunculated unresectable HCC was also performed. Patients underwent a median of 4 TACE sessions and received a median of 2 percutaneous CALE injections. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year actuarial survival rates were 78.9%, 52.6%, 42.1%, and 12.0%, respectively, for patients with P-HCC, and median survival was 27 months (95% confidence interval, 22.6-43.2 months). Patients with P-HCC had better overall survival than those with nonpedunculated HCC (NP-HCC) (P = .002). Vascular invasion and abdominal lymph node metastasis were poor prognostic factors for overall survival in patients with P-HCC. TACE plus percutaneous CALE injection is a safe and effective treatment for unresectable P-HCC. Patients with unresectable P-HCC might have better overall survival than those with NP-HCC after TACE plus percutaneous CALE injection. However, their prognosis remains poor.
