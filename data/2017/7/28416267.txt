Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. HCC develops through a multistep process that involves the local tumor microenvironment, intracellular signaling pathways, and altered metabolic system that allows the cancer proliferation. Understanding the mechanisms of tumor development and progression is critical to developing improved therapies aimed at better survival. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of HCC development and highlights the potential therapeutic targets for treatments.
