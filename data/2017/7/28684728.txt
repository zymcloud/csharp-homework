BACKGROUND Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare, aggressive, malignant cancer composed of sarcoma and sarcoma-like components, and can occur in different organs such as the thyroid gland, bone, skin, breast, pancreas, liver, urinary tract, and lung. Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma accounts for only a small percentage of lung cancers and has histological variants that include pleomorphic carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. CASE REPORT Here, we present a case of sarcomatoid carcinoma in a 63-year-old HIV-positive Hispanic male who presented with back pain, dry cough, and weight loss. A CT scan of his chest showed an ovoid mass in the lower lobe of the left lung, and an MRI of the spine showed a left lateral paraspinal soft tissue mass causing central canal stenosis and mild cord compression. The patient underwent laminectomy and resection of the spinal mass. A transthoracic needle biopsy of the lung and spinal masses had similar histopathology, and were indicative of sarcomatoid carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS We report a rare case of sarcomatoid carcinoma involving both the lung and spinal cord in the same patient. Sarcomatoid carcinomas of the lung have poor prognosis and are aggressive cancers. Moreover, our case also had the co-occurrence of HIV and sarcomatoid carcinoma.
