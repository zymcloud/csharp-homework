Posaconazole is the preferred mold-active azole for prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients with hematological malignancy. Delayed-release tablet and intravenous formulations of posaconazole have recently become available, but clinical data are limited. We sought to examine the real-world pharmacokinetics and prophylactic effectiveness of the new formulations of posaconazole given as prophylaxis for patients with hematological malignancy. A retrospective cohort of all consecutive adult inpatients with hematological malignancy who received â‰¥3 days of tablet or intravenous posaconazole therapy for primary IFI prophylaxis at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1 December 2013 and 31 December 2015 was established. Clinical information was collected and correlated with low posaconazole serum levels (<700 ng/ml). Rates of IFIs and safety events were assessed. A total of 1,321 courses of posaconazole were administered at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center during the study period, of which 343 courses were assessed for prophylactic safety and effectiveness. Seventy-nine patients (23%) had posaconazole serum level measurements available for interpretation. Acute myeloid leukemia was the primary malignancy (62%), with 20% of all patients having previously received a stem cell transplant. The median posaconazole level was 1,380 ng/ml (interquartile range, 864 to 1,860 ng/ml). Low posaconazole levels (<700 ng/ml) were observed for 14 patients (18%). Proven or probable breakthrough IFIs occurred in 8 patients (2%); posaconazole therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was performed for 6 of those patients, all with levels above 700 ng/ml. Overall, 19% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 liver injury, manifesting primarily as hyperbilirubinemia and being correlated with serum levels of >1,830 ng/ml. Although hepatotoxicity in a small percentage of patients is of concern, posaconazole tablets appeared to be generally safe and effective. As all breakthrough IFIs for which TDM was performed occurred in patients with levels of >700 ng/ml, and a posaconazole level of >1,830 ng/ml was correlated with grade 3 or 4 liver toxicity, further studies are needed to assess the role of TDM.
