Genetic association analysis and functional analysis have suggested that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene affects the predisposition to various tumors. In this study, we wanted to explore the association between TERT variants and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in a Han Chinese population via a case-control study of 473 HCC patients and 564 controls. Sequenom Mass-ARRAY platform was applied to determine the genotype of TERT polymorphisms in these subjects. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals that calculated by logistic regression analysis were used to assess the association under the genotype, dominant, recessive, and additive models. The "AA" genotype frequency of TERT rs2242652 in cases was significantly lower than in controls (1.69% versus 3.72%). We found two SNPs were associated with decreased risk of HCC with or without the adjustment for age and gender: rs10069690 under an additive model (adjusted OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.98, P = 0.038); rs2242652 under a dominant model (adjusted OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.95, P = 0.022) and an additive model (adjusted OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.92, P = 0.009). To our knowledge, the present study is the first to show the significant association between TERT polymorphisms and HCC susceptibility in a Han Chinese population from China, which may act as a potential prognostic biomarker in HCC patients.
