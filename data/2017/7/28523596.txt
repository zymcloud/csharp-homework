Purpose:Vismodegib is a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced basal cell carcinoma. Currently, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of vismodegib in patients with hepatic dysfunction are unknown and are the objective of this study.Methods:Patients with advanced solid malignancies and hepatic impairment were enrolled into one of four cohorts: normal [bilirubin (bili) Results:Thirty-one patients were accrued: nine normal, eight mild, eight moderate, and six severe. Four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity of hyperbilirubinemia on study: one in the moderate cohort and three in the severe cohort. Six patients died within 30 days after the last dose of vismodegib. All deaths were attributed to disease progression. Observed maximal and average steady-state concentrations and AUC of vismodegib at steady state (day 8) were similar across cohorts. Average AAG concentrations in patients with hepatic impairment were comparable to those of patients with normal hepatic function.Conclusions:Hepatic impairment does not appear to impact vismodegib PK, and therefore, dose adjustment is not necessary in this special population. The study was influenced by the high number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with advanced cirrhosis; rendering it difficult to draw any causal relationships between vismodegib exposure and the serious adverse events.
