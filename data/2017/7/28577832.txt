Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an emerging effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with acceptable rates of toxicity in appropriately selected patients. Despite often being reserved for patients unsuitable for other local treatments, prospective and retrospective studies have demonstrated excellent long-term control. SBRT may be used as a stand-alone treatment, or as an adjunct to other HCC therapies. Based on available data, SBRT appears to complement existing local liver therapies. Randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies are required to better determine the optimal role of SBRT in HCC treatment.
