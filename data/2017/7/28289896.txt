Purpose:To describe the incidence and outcomes linked with acute kidney injury (AKI) after liver transplantation (LT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:From January 2003 to February 2011, HCC patients undergoing LT were retrospectively enrolled. Patient with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 2 was excluded. AKI was defined and classified according to the AKIN criteria.Results:Of the 566 eligible patients, AKI was found in 109 (19.26%) patients (stage I, 66 cases; stage II, 15 cases; and stage III, 28 cases). Risk factors for AKI were the long anhepatic time (OR = 3.59, P = 0.009) and prolonged duration of systolic blood pressure (SBP) 2 after 1 year post-operation.Conclusions:Post-LT AKI is not an uncommon complication. Intra-operative hemodynamic instability is crucial in the development of post-LT AKI and deserves more attention. Most post-LT AKI is transient and reversible, while the prolonged form may predict a decrease survival.
