Noninvasive assessment of disease activity in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is still unsettled, but essential for the evaluation of disease progression. We here studied the association of total (M65) and caspase-cleaved (M30) serum keratin-18 fragments (n = 204) with histological parameters (n = 106) in heavy drinkers primarily admitted for alcohol withdrawal before and after alcohol detoxification. An age-, sex-, and fibrosis-stage matched NAFLD cohort (n = 30) was used for comparison. The prognostic value of M30 and M65 levels were assessed in an additional prospectively followed-up cohort of 230 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) using competing risk analyses. Among the histological parameters, both M30/65 correlated significantly and better than any other serum marker with apoptosis and liver damage, such as ballooning (r = 0.65; P Conclusion:Our data suggest M30 as highly specific marker of liver apoptosis both in ALD and NAFLD. In addition, hepatocellular apoptosis, as determined by M30 levels, occurs during alcohol withdrawal, and survival data point toward a novel underestimated role of apoptosis in patients with ALD.
