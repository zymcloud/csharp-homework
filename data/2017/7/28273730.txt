Background Arterial dissections during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) procedures are not rare and can limit the successful treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Purpose To evaluate the incidence of arterial dissections during TACE procedures, the rate of spontaneous lumen recovery, and the predictive factors of dissecting stenosis during follow-up. Material and Methods Based on 69,651 TACE procedures from 1997 to 2016, patients who had procedure-related arterial dissections were identified by procedure report search. More than two months after the date of dissection, dissecting stenosis was evaluated using a three-grade scale: subclinical narrowing with diameter loss under 30%, overt stenosis with diameter loss over 30%, and occlusion. Pearson Chi-square and two-sample t-test were used to assess potential prognostic markers for dissecting stenosis. Results Eighty-four arterial dissections directly related to TACE were identified in 83 patients, resulting in an incidence of 0.12% (84/69651). After more than two months, normal or subclinical narrowing, overt stenosis, occlusion, and doubling were seen in 39 (46.4%), 26 (31.0%), 13 (15.5%), and one (1.2%) patients, respectively. No follow-up images were obtained for five (6.0%) patients. On univariate analysis, the dissection ratio (the ratio of the length to the diameter of the dissection) alone was related to dissecting stenosis ( P = 0.035). Conclusion The incidence of iatrogenic dissection during TACE was approximately 0.12%. Less than 50% of the iatrogenic dissections showed normal or subclinical narrowing during follow-up of at least two months. The dissection ratio alone was the predictive factor for dissecting stenosis during follow-up.
