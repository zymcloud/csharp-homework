Background:Sub-lethal heat treatment characterizes a transition zone of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) which explains hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) residual cancer occurrence in this area after RFA treatment. The biochemistry of residual cancer cell recurrence is poorly understood, but long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may have aberrant expression that is associated with diverse cancers. Thus, we measured lncRNA gene expression in sub-lethally heat-treated HCC cells using microarray.Method:Differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA were measured with an Agilent Human lncRNA + mRNA Array V4.0 (4 Ã— 180 K format) containing 41,000 lncRNAs and 34,000 mRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis was used to assess differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA. Seven lncRNA and seven mRNA were validated by qRT-PCR analysis in HCC cells.Results:Genome-wide lncRNA and mRNA expression data in sub-lethal heat-treated SMMC-7721 HCC cells 558 lncRNA and 250 mRNA were significantly up-regulated and 224 lncRNA and 1031 mRNA down-regulated compared to normal cultured SMMC-7721 cells. We demonstrated for the first time that ENST00000570843.1, ENST00000567668.1, ENST00000582249.1, ENST00000450304.1, TCONS_00015544, ENST00000602478.1, TCONS_00001266 and ARC, IL12RB1, HSPA6 were upregulated, whereas STAT3, PRPSAP1, MCU, URB2 were down-regulated in sub-lethally heat-treated HCC cells.Conclusions:lncRNA expression data in sub-lethally heat-treated HCC cells will provide important insights about lncRNAs' contribution to HCC recurrence after RFA treatment.
