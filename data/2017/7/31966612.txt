In current observations, we investigated the clinical immunophenotypes in liver cells to assess the metastasic predisposition in advance hepatocellular carcinoma patients. In method, we harvested the clinically diagnosed data from 8 liver cancer subjects. Definitely, all patients were received standard chemotherapeutics when being confirmed as advanced liver cancer via clinical diagnosis. In parallel, biopsy liver samples were subjected to histopathological and immunoblotting assays. Representatively, clinical laboratory results showed that blood parameters resulted in notable elevations of aminotransferases (ALT, AST), hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), alpha-fetoprotein (APF) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). In addition, immunoassays exhibited significant hepatocellular expressions of Ki-67 (cell proliferation), CD34 (angiogenesis), as well as strong production of CK8, CK10 (metastasis) in liver cells, as revealed in both the immunostaining and Western blotting analyses. Collectively, the present clinical findings elucidate that the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma relates to unregulated cell proliferation and angiogenesis. In particular, current representative immunophenotypes may be served as potential biomarkers for screening metastasis of advanced liver cancer.
