Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma possesses a notable sex difference in incidence, and a protective role of estrogens has been hypothesized.Methods:Using data from 13 cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, we describe the age-specific sex difference in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States during 1992-2013. We used a curve fitting by non-linear regression to quantitatively characterize the age-specific incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma by sex.Results:A total of 44,287 incident cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (33,196 males and 11,091 females) were included, with an overall male-to-female ratio in age-standardized rate of 3.55. The sex ratio was below 2 at ages Conclusions:The age-dependent patterns in the sex difference in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma support the hypothesis of a protective role of estrogens. The underlying reasons for the sex difference in hepatocellular carcinoma remain to be further explored in analytic epidemiological studies.
