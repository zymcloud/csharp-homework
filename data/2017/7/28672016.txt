Purpose:Metabolism and water diffusion may have a relationship or an effect on each other in the same tumor. Knowledge of their relationship could expand the understanding of tumor biology and serve the field of oncologic imaging. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between metabolism and water diffusivity in hepatic tumors using a simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) system with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and to reveal the metabolic and diffusional characteristics of each type of hepatic tumor.Methods:Forty-one patients (mean age 63 ± 13 years, 31 male) with hepatic tumors (18 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], six cholangiocarcinoma [CCC], 10 metastatic tumors, one neuroendocrine malignancy, and six benign lesions) underwent FDG PET/MRI before treatment. Maximum standard uptake (SUVmax) values from FDG PET and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from the diffusion-weighted images were obtained for the tumor and their relationships were examined. We also investigated the difference in SUVmax and ADC for each type of tumor.Results:SUVmax showed a negative correlation with ADC (r = -0.404, p = 0.009). The median of SUVmax was 3.22 in HCC, 6.99 in CCC, 6.30 in metastatic tumors, and 1.82 in benign lesions. The median of ADC was 1.039 × 10-3 mm/s2 in HCC, 1.148 × 10-3 mm/s2 in CCC, 0.876 × 10-3 mm/s2 in metastatic tumors, and 1.323 × 10-3 mm/s2 in benign lesions. SUVmax was higher in metastatic tumors than in benign lesions (p = 0.023). Metastatic tumors had a lower ADC than CCC (p = 0.039) and benign lesions (p = 0.004). HCC had a lower ADC than benign lesions, with a suggestive trend (p = 0.06).Conclusion:Our results indicate that SUVmax is negatively correlated with ADC in hepatic tumors, and each group of tumors has different metabolic and water diffusivity characteristics. Evaluation of hepatic tumors by PET/MRI could be helpful in understanding tumor characteristics.
