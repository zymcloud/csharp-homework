Background/aim:Hepatocellular carcinoma is a substantial healthcare burden with high prevalence and poor prognosis. As such, efforts are continually made to uncover molecules relevant in cancer biology, that are exploitable as targets for therapy. The mitochondrion is the powerhouse of the cell and exhibits altered functionality in the malignant state, including aberrant regulation of apoptosis and cellular respiration. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is a multifunctional mitochondrial protein that demonstrates anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties and plays a key role in liver regeneration.Materials and methods:The present study systematically reviews the available literature on the role of ALR in cancer.Results:Systematic search of PubMed resulted in 12 studies discussing ALR in multiple types of cancer. More specifically, ALR appears to be up-regulated in malignant cells and tissues. Furthermore, treatment of cells with exogenous ALR shows an anti-apoptotic effect while silencing or inhibiting ALR decreases cell and tumor survival.Conclusion:ALR clearly plays a role in cancer biology and demonstrates potential as a therapeutic target.
