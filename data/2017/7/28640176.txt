Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of liver metastasis from ovarian cancer (OC).Methods:A retrospective review was performed on 11 patients (mean age, 53.0 ± 10.1 years) with 22 liver metastases (mean diameter, 2.0 ± 0.8 cm) from OC undergone RFA. Radiofrequency ablation was carried out with Starburst XL electrodes (RITA Medical System, Mountain View, CA) or Cool-tip electrodes (Cool-tip Systems; Valleylab, Boulder, CO). The tumor response, time to progression, and survival after RFA were assessed.Results:Complete ablation was achieved for all lesions. The technique effectiveness was 100%. During the follow-up period, local tumor progression was observed in 1 (4.5%) of 22 lesions. The median time to progression was 8.0 months after RFA. Three patients died because of disease progression after 13, 18, and 24 months, respectively. The mean overall survival time after RFA was 53.1 ± 10.0 months, with the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates of 100%, 61%, and 61%, respectively. No major complications were encountered.Conclusions:Radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment strategy is feasible and effective for selected patients with liver metastasis from OC, providing a high rate of local tumor control.
