Background and objective:Our previous study showed that liver graft injury not only promotes tumor recurrence, but also induces chemoresistance in recurrent HCC after liver transplantation. Recently, we found that the hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier"YQ23" significantly ameliorates hepatic IR injury and prevent tumor recurrence. Here, we intended to explore the novel therapeutic strategy using oxygen carrier "YQ23"to sensitize chemotherapy in HCC.Methods:To investigate the role of YQ23 combined with Cisplatin, the proliferation of HCC cells was examined under combined treatment by MTT and colony formation. To explore the effect of YQ23 on sensitization of Cisplatin based chemotherapy, the orthotopic liver cancer model was established. To characterize the delivery of YQ23 in tumor tissue, the intravital imaging system was applied for longitudinal observation in ectopic liver cancer model. The distribution of YQ23 was examined by IVIS spectrum.Results:YQ23 significantly suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells under Cisplatin treatment in a dose and time dependent manner. Moreover, YQ23 administration significantly sensitized Cisplatin based chemotherapy in orthotopic liver cancer model. Down-regulation of DHFR may be one of the reasons for YQ23 sensitizing Cisplatin based chemotherapy. Real-time intravital imaging showed that YQ23 accumulated in the tumor tissue and maintained as long as 3 days in ectopic liver cancer model. The IVIS spectrum examination showed that YQ23 distributed mainly at liver and bladder within the first 36 hours after administration in orthotopic liver cancer model.Conclusion:YQ23 treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy to sensitize chemotherapy in HCC.
