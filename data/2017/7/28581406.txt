Purpose:To compare the efficacy of stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) versus liver resection for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) â‰¤5 cm with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis.Methods and materials:This retrospective study included 117 patients with small HCCs with 1 or 2 nodules. Eighty-two patients received SABR (SABR group), and 35 patients underwent liver resection (resection group). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. One-to-one matched pairs between the 2 groups were created using propensity score matching to reduce the potential confounding effect of treatment and selection bias.Results:There was no between-group difference in OS and PFS. Before propensity score matching, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 96.3%, 81.8%, and 70.0% in the SABR group and 93.9%, 83.1%, and 64.4% in the resection group, respectively (P=.558). The 1-, 3- and 5-year PFS was 81.4%, 50.2%, and 40.7% in the SABR group and 68.0%, 58.3%, and 40.3% in the resection group, respectively (P=.932). After propensity score matching, 33 paired patients were selected from the SABR and resection groups. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS was 100%, 91.8%, and 74.3% in the SABR group and 96.7%, 89.3%, and 69.2% in the resection group, respectively (P=.405). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year PFS was 84.4%, 59.2%, and 43.9% in the SABR group and 69.0%, 62.4%, and 35.9% in the resection group, respectively (P=.945). There was a similarity of hepatotoxicity between the 2 groups. The SABR group showed fewer complications, such as hepatic hemorrhage, hepatic pain, and weight loss. Acute nausea was significantly more frequent in the SABR group than in the resection group.Conclusion:For patients with small primary HCC with 1 or 2 nodules and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, SABR has local effects that are similar to those with liver resection. Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy has an advantage over resection in being less invasive.
