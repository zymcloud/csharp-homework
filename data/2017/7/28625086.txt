Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure. Moreover, chronic HCV infection is associated with liver steatosis and metabolic disorders. With 130-150 million people chronically infected in the world, HCV infection represents a major public health problem. One hallmark on the virus is its close link with hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Areas covered: HCV is associated with lipoprotein components such as apolipoproteins. These interactions play a key role in the viral life cycle, viral persistence and pathogenesis of liver disease. This review introduces first the role of apolipoproteins in lipoprotein metabolism, then highlights the molecular mechanisms of HCV-lipoprotein interactions and finally discusses their clinical impact. Expert commentary: While the study of virus-host interactions has resulted in a improvement of the understanding of the viral life cycle and the development of highly efficient therapies, major challenges remain: access to therapy is limited and an urgently needed HCV vaccine remains still elusive. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of disease biology is still only partially understood. The investigation of HCV-lipoproteins interactions offers new perspectives for novel therapeutic approaches, contribute to HCV vaccine design and understand virus-induced liver disease and cancer.
