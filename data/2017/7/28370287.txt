Amplification and/or activation of the c-Myc proto-oncogene is one of the leading genetic events along hepatocarcinogenesis. The oncogenic potential of c-Myc has been proven experimentally by the finding that its overexpression in the mouse liver triggers tumor formation. However, the molecular mechanism whereby c-Myc exerts its oncogenic activity in the liver remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) cascade is activated and necessary for c-Myc-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis. Specifically, we found that ablation of Raptor, the unique member of mTORC1, strongly inhibits c-Myc liver tumor formation. Also, the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase/ribosomal protein S6 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E signaling cascades downstream of mTORC1 are required for c-Myc-driven tumorigenesis. Intriguingly, microarray expression analysis revealed up-regulation of multiple amino acid transporters, including solute carrier family 1 member A5 (SLC1A5) and SLC7A6, leading to robust uptake of amino acids, including glutamine, into c-Myc tumor cells. Subsequent functional studies showed that amino acids are critical for activation of mTORC1 as their inhibition suppressed mTORC1 in c-Myc tumor cells. In human hepatocellular carcinoma specimens, levels of c-Myc directly correlate with those of mTORC1 activation as well as of SLC1A5 and SLC7A6.Conclusion:Our current study indicates that an intact mTORC1 axis is required for c-Myc-driven hepatocarcinogenesis; thus, targeting the mTOR pathway or amino acid transporters may be an effective and novel therapeutic option for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with activated c-Myc signaling.
