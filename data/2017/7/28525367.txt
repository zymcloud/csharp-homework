Doxorubicin in combination with other cytotoxic drugs has clinical advantages. However, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity negatively impacts clinical utility and outcomes. Cardiotoxicity can result from increased oxidative stress or from a local cytochrome P450 mediated increase in 20-hydroxy-5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). Oleanolic acid (OA) is a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid with free radical scavenging, cardioprotective, and P450-mediated cyclooxygenase-upregulating properties. We investigated co-delivery of liposomal OA and doxorubicin in a HepG2 model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OA attenuated the cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin without compromising its anticancer activity. Apoptosis assays revealed that co-delivery of DOX and OA produced a synergistic anticancer effect. However, the drugs had antagonistic effects on cardiomyocytes. Female BALB/c nude mice treated with OA- and DOX-loaded liposomes (ODLs) exhibited reduced tumor growth, stable body weight, and stable organ indices. Reduced 20-HETE production suggested ODLs had limited cardiotoxicity. No changes in biochemical or histopathological markers were observed in mice treated with ODLs. Tailored co-delivery of OA and DOX may thus be an effective therapeutic strategy for treating HCC.
