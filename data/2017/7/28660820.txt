First reported two decades ago, isolated incisional recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma is an extremely rare clinical entity. We present two cases of recurrence: one recurring over 10 years after initial resection, and the second presenting with a port site recurrence 3.5 years following laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation. Clinical case presentation, including radiographical, pathological, laboratory and intraoperative images are reported, together with a review of the current literature surrounding this uncommon hepatocellular carcinoma presentation.
