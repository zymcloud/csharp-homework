Background/aims:Both spontaneous hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance and the achievement of sustained virological response (SVR) by anti-viral therapy greatly reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current study aimed to compare the risk of HCC between the two patient groupsMethods: A total of 313 subjects with spontaneous HCV clearance (SC) and 564 age- and sex-matched patients in the treatment-induced SVR group were enrolled for analysis.Results:Nineteen (2.2%) of the 877 patients developed HCC during 6,963 person-years of follow-up. Fourteen (2.5%) SVR patients and 5 (1.6%) SC patients developed HCC (P=0.004). Cox regression analysis of factors predictive of HCC included SVR (versus SC: hazard ratio [HR]/ 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.83/1.27-26.88), diabetes (HR/CI:3.41/1.21-9.58), and age (HR/CI: 1.07/1.01-1.14). Of the 564 SVR patients, eleven (5.9%) of the 187 patients with fibrosis stage 2-4 (F2-4) and 2 (0.9%) of the 226 patients with F01 developed HCC (P=0.01). Compared to SC subjects, only SVR patients with F2-4 (PConclusions:Compared to subjects with spontaneous viral clearance, subjects with antiviral treatment-induced HCV viral clearance remain at high risk for HCC development, especially if they have significant hepatic fibrosis. These results may provide important information for decision-making regarding the prioritization of current direct antiviral agents in resource-limited countries.
