Background: The aim of this study was to describe the natural long-term course of end-stage liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection by measuring survival and complication rates in the era prior to the arrival of new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs. Methods: A retrospective population-based cohort study was designed to establish the follow-up of patients hospitalized for a decompensated cirrhotic event or hepatocellular carcinoma using electronic records from hospital discharge databases from 2009 to 2015. Their survival was compared with a sex, age and non-liver mortality excess matched simulation of the general Spanish population. Results: A total of 253 patients were included in the study. Among those with decompensated cirrhosis (n = 151) the hospital admission rate was 1.88 per patient-year with a mortality rate of 0.16 per patient-year. Mean survival was 4.10 years for patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and 1.75 for non-transplanted hepatocellular carcinoma, compared to 18.39 years for the general population. Conclusion: Our results show the complexity and rapid progression of end-stage liver disease associated with HCV infection. The considerable loss of life expectancy associated with the development of decompensated cirrhosis in patients with chronic HCV infection in the absence of viral clearance through treatment is acutely evident.
