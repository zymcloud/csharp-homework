Tumor-specific hepatic stellate cells (tHSCs) positively participate in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumorigenesis and progression. Our previous studies have shown that tHSCs co-culture with dendritic cells (DCs) induced DIgR2 (dendritic cell-derived immunoglobulin receptor 2) expression. The latter is a member of IgSF inhibitory receptor suppressing DCs-initiated antigen-specific T-cell responses. In the current study, we show that hepatic artery injection of DlgR2 siRNA significantly inhibited in-situ HCC xenograft growth in rat livers. Further, 5-FU-medied inhibition of in-situ HCC growth was dramatically sensitized with DlgR2 silence. DlgR2 siRNA injection indeed downregulated DlgR2 in ex-vivo cultured tumor-derived DCs (tDCs). More importantly, tDCs activity was boosted following DlgR2 siRNA. These cells presented with upregulated CD80, CD86 and MHC-II. Production of interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± was also increased in the DlgR2-silenced tDCs. We propose that DlgR2 knockdown likely boosts the activity of tumor-associated DCs, and inhibits growth of in-situ HCC xenografts.
