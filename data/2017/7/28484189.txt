The differences between the perfusion areas of portal vein and the drainage areas of hepatic vein result in the occurrence of either ischemic or congested areas after liver resection. To elucidate which factors are related to the differences between these areas of segment (S) 6 were therefore investigated. The portal-vein-based and hepatic-vein-based regional planes of S6 were defined using the region-growing and Voronoi tessellation methods in 103 consecutive patients who undergo liver resection. Finally, factors related to the difference between the perfusion and drainage areas of S6 were identified. The S6 regional plane based on the portal was coincident with that of hepatic veins (non-difference group) in 57 patients (55.3%), but was discordant on the ventral side (S6-dominant group) in 43 patients (41.7%) and the dorsal side (S5-dominant group) in 3 patients (3.0%). The presence of a proximal branch of the first portal 6 (S6-dominant group vs. non-difference group, 72.1% vs. 17.0%, p
