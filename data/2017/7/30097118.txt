Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a globally prevalent pathogen and a leading cause of death and morbidity. Traditional therapy with pegylated interferon-<alpha> and ribavirin has had only limited success, with some adverse effects. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are effective in suppressing HCV replication, but are expensive.Purpose:Hypericin has been reported to be a good antiviral agent for inhibiting HCV replication, however, little is known about its mechanisms of action. The aim of this study is to elucidate the mode of action of hypericin in Ava5 human hepatoma cell line (Huh7 derivative) harboring HCV subgenomic replicon RNA.Methods:To determine the non-structure protein 5A (NS5A) mRNA and NS3 protein expression levels, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis were performed, respectively. To investigate how hypericin inhibits HCV replication, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) and chidamide were used for determining histone modification. Furthermore, shRNA was applied to confirm the role of heme oxygenase (HO-1) in HCV repression.Results:Hypericin in experiment were tested and showed no cytotoxicity. Hypericin reduced HO-1 and NS5A in a time- and dose- dependent manner. Chidamide, but not 5-Aza-dc, restored hypericin-induced reduction in HCV NS3 expression and reversed HO-1 expression in Ava5 cells. LY294002 inhibited HCV replication via HO-1 down-regulation. Constitutive expressed p-AKT was not involved in hypericin-induced reduction in HCV replication. In addition, shHO-1 inhibited HCV replication.Conclusion:In conclusion, hypericin inhibits HCV replication via down-regulation of HO-1 expression and deacetylation.
