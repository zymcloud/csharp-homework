Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies around the world. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are greater than 200 nucleotides without protein-coding potential and play critical roles in tumorigenesis, cell differentiation, and cancer metastasis. Colon cancer-associated transcript 2 (CCAT2), a newly identified lncRNA, was shown to be dysregulated in cancers. However, the functional role of CCAT2 in HCC remains questionable. In the present study, we found a significant upregulation of CCAT2 in HCC tissues as compared to non-tumor tissues. Functional assays showed that CCAT2 promotes cell growth in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we found a positive feedback loop between CCAT2 and FOXM1. CCAT2 upregulates FOXM1 expression through interaction with, and suppression of, miR-34a, and FOXM1 activates CCAT2 transcription. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD)-mediated siRNA delivery to specifically target CCAT2. UTMD-mediated siCCAT2 delivery significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Thus, CCAT2-FOXM1 may be a novel target for the treatment of HCC.
