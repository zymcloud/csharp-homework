Purpose:To evaluate incidence and predictive factors for the vascular lake phenomenon (VLP), as well as to compare local and overall tumor response in patients with and without VLP induced during DEB-TACE for HCC.Methods:A total of 200 consecutive patients with 323 HCC nodules underwent first-session DEB-TACE from 2011 to 2014. Patients were divided in two groups, according to the presence of the VLP during DEB-TACE. Pre- and post-treatment imaging studies (CT or MRI) were performed. Primary endpoint was assessment of tumor response, evaluated by mRECIST. Comparison of response rates between the VLP group and the non-VLP group was performed. Secondary endpoints were the determination of incidence rate and predictive factors for the VLP.Results:The VLP was observed in 39/323 (12.1%) of the nodules treated. At multivariate logistic regression analysis, tumor size â‰¥3 cm in diameter (OR 13.95; 95% CI 3.60-54.05), presence of a pseudocapsule (OR 6.67; 95% CI 1.45-30.59) and alpha-fetoprotein levels (OR 1.004; 95% CI 1.000-1.007) remained predictive for the VLP occurrence. On a nodule-based analysis (p Conclusion:VLP is observed in 12% of the patients and happens more frequently in large and encapsulated tumors. It seems to be associated with better local and overall responses in HCC patients who underwent DEB-TACE.
