Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high incidence and mortality worldwide, and its carcinogenesis and progression are influenced by a complex network of gene interactions. A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed to identify gene modules associated with the clinical traits in HCC (n = 214). Among the 13 modules, high correlation was only found between the red module and metastasis risk (classified by the HCC metastasis gene signature) (R2 = -0.74). Moreover, in the red module, 34 network hub genes for metastasis risk were identified, six of which (ABAT, AGXT, ALDH6A1, CYP4A11, DAO and EHHADH) were also hub nodes in the protein-protein interaction network of the module genes. Thus, a total of six hub genes were identified. In validation, all hub genes showed a negative correlation with the four-stage HCC progression (P for trend 1). RNA-sequencing data of 142 HCC samples showed consistent results in the prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that in the samples with any hub gene highly expressed, a total of 24 functional gene sets were enriched, most of which focused on amino acid metabolism and oxidation. In conclusion, co-expression network analysis identified six hub genes in association with HCC metastasis risk and prognosis, which might improve the prognosis by influencing amino acid metabolism and oxidation.
