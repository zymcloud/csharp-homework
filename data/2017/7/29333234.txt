Surgeons have been hesitant to proceed to hepatectomy in elderly patients, due to the higher rate of comorbidities and the reduced reserves. An 81-year-old male with hepatocellular carcinoma in the segment VI of the liver and several major cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic comorbid illnesses was referred to our department for treatment. He underwent transarterial chemoembolization of the liver tumor and afterwards he underwent laparoscopic resection of the hepatic segment VI, with an uneventful postoperative course. This case indicates that laparoscopic liver resections could be applied even to elderly patients with major comorbidities after optimization of their medical status.
