Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta plays an important role in the development and progression of liver cancer. In recent years, the expression of HNF-1β has been reported to be associated with risk for a variety of cancers. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the expression of HNF-1β promotes the malignancy of HCC and its mechanism. We retrospectively investigated the expression of HNF-1β in 90 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and found that the high expression of HNF-1β indicated poor prognosis. We overexpressed HNF-1β in liver cancer cell lines and found the expression of liver progenitor cell markers and stemness were upregulated. The invasion ability and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes were also significantly higher in liver cancer cells overexpressing HNF-1β than in the control group. A mechanistic study suggested the activation of the Notch signalling pathway probably plays a key role downstream of HNF-1β. More importantly, HNF-1β promoted tumourigenesis of HCC cells in vivo. In conclusion, high expression of HNF-1β not only promoted the de-differentiation of HCC cells into liver cancer stem cells through activating the Notch pathway but also enhanced the invasive potential of HCC cells and EMT occurrence, which would contribute to the enhancement of cell migration and invasion.
