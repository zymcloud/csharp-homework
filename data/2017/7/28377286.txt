Background:Liver fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma if not treated in the early stages. The molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis remain unclear.Aim:To identify the molecules involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis and to investigate the potential effect and mechanism of Annexin A2 up-regulation during liver fibrosis progression.Methods:Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis group and the normal control group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining or Masson Trichrome staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were applied to assess the degree of liver damage and fibrosis in rats with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Liver tissue protein profiles were analyzed using iTRAQ and mass spectrometry. RT-PCR and western blotting analyses were employed to validate differentially expressed proteins. Small interfering RNA-based silencing was performed to study the function of Annexin A2.Results:Twelve weeks after CCl4 injection, significant body weight changes and liver injury and liver fibrosis were observed in rats. In addition, 130 proteins were differentially expressed in the liver fibrosis group. Overexpression of Annexin A2 was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Silencing of Annexin A2 expression in HepG2 and LX-2 cells significantly reduced the secretion of von Willebrand factor (vWF).Conclusion:Annexin A2 promotes liver fibrosis by mediating vWF secretion, which can be used to mitigate the progression of liver fibrosis.
