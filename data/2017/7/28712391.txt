Objective To investigate the effects of γδ T cells co-cultured with human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) on the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods Peripheral γδ T cells of healthy volunteers and HCC patients were separated and collected by density gradient centrifugation and flow cytometry. TranswellTM chambers were used to co-culture LX-2 cells and γδ T cells. The concentration of IFN-γ in γδ T cell supernatant was detected by ELISA. The proliferation of HepG2 cells was analyzed by CCK-8 assay, and the invasion ability of HepG2 cells was evaluated by TranswellTM chamber assay. Results After co-cultured with LX-2 cells, the IFN-γ secretion in γδ T cells increased obviously, and the level of IFN-γ was higher in healthy volunteer group than in HCC patient group. The inhibitory effects of γδ T cells on the proliferation and invasion of HepG2 cells were enhanced after the co-culture, and the enhancement of inhibitory abilities was more obvious in healthy volunteer group than in HCC patient group. Conclusion HSC could activate γδ T cells and promote IFN-γ secretion of γδ T cells, thus enhancing the inhibitory effects of γδ T cells on the proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells.
