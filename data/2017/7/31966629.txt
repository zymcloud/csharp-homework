Differentially expressed proteins between HCC TIF and normal interstitial fluid of adjacent nontumor tissues were identified through comparative proteomics approach. Then, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), In-Cell Western technique, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to verify differentially expressed proteins. As a result, through 2-DE, 69 spots were roughly recognized as differentially expressed protein spots, while 44 proteins were identified as differentially expressed spots through MALDI-TOF-MS. Of the identified differential protein spots, 31 were significant according to the bioinformatics analysis results. Proteasome subunit alpha type-1 (PSMA1) expression was down-regulated in HCC TIF. Thus, PSMA1 is considered as a potential biomarker for HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.
