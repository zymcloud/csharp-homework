Objective: To investigate the clinical data of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region through questionnaire survey, explore the association between the risk factors of liver cancer and the onset age of disease in this area and provide evidence for prevention and treatment of liver diseases. Methods: A retrospectively analysis was conducted in 250 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma by using their clinical data collected through questionnaire survey to understand the relationship between gender, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, family history of liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, HBV infection, eating fish history and other factors and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma by univariate and logistic multivariate regression models. Results: Univariate regression analysis showed that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and family history of liver cancer, HBV infection, cirrhosis, smoking, eating fish history were risk factors for the early onset of liver cancer, t=4.150, P<0.05; t=3.752, P<0.05; t=5.676, P<0.05; t=9.731, P<0.05; t=15.824, P<0.001; t=5.724, P<0.05; t=11.662, P<0.01; t=4.472, P<0.05, respectively, but logistic multivariate regression model analysis indicated that smoking, HBV infection were independent risk factors, OR=3.211(95%CI:1.134-4.642), OR=7.31(95%CI: 4.312-21.072). Conclusions: The risk factors affecting the age of liver cancer onset vary with area diet pattern alcohol use did not influenced the age of liver cancer onset, but smoking and HBV infection were the independent risk factors for early onset of liver cancer. It is necessary to strengthen the HBV infection prevention and control and advise people to quit smoking.
