Background:Identifying hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive persons at high risk of early complications can help prioritize treatment decisions. We conducted this study to compare Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CP), MELD, and FIB-4 scores for predicting clinical outcomes and to identify those at low risk of complications.Methods:Within electronically retrieved cohort of HCV-infected veterans, we identified HCV-positive persons and excluded those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), prevalent hepatic decompensation (HD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and those treated for HCV. We calculated incidence rates for HD, HCC, and all-cause mortality at 1, 3, and 5 years after HCV diagnosis. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we determined the optimal cut-off values for each score for these outcomes.Results:Among 21 116 persons evaluated, 89.7% were CP Class-A, 79.9% had MELDConclusions:FIB-4 score is a better predictor of HD and HCC in HCV-positive persons.
