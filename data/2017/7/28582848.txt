Background:Hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) is more common in clinical practice, and has high malignant degree.Objective:This study aims to analyze the curative effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) and its effect on serum markers.Methods:A total of 106 cases of patients with hepatic cell carcinoma treated in our hospital were randomly divided into two groups: observation group and control group. Patients in the observation group (53 cases) received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with radiofrequency ablation therapy, while subjects in the control group (53 cases) received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization therapy. Differences in the overall effect, indicators of inflammation and oxidative stress, tumor activity-related indicators and tumor recurrence-related indicators between these two groups were compared.Results:At one and two weeks after treatment, the number of cases of CR and PR in the observation group was higher than that in the control group, the number of cases of SD was not different from that in the control group, and the number of cases of PD was lower than that in the control group. At two weeks after treatment, differences in serum MDA, SOD, GSH, CRP, TNF-Î± and ESR between the two groups were significant. However, serum EC, VEGF, MMP, AFP, CA199 and GGT content was significantly lower in the observation group than that in the control group.Conclutions:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with radiofrequency ablation therapy can effectively control the growth of liver cancer lesions, reduce the levels of tumor-related serum markers, and inhibit the activity of tumor cells.
