Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the result of the ectopic accumulation of lipids in hepatic cells and is the early stage of liver diseases including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. While some mechanisms of aberrant lipid storage are understood, unbiased phenotypic drug screening holds the potential to identify new therapeutic small molecule mechanisms that reverse lipid accumulation in hepatic cells and prevent disease progression. Immortalized hepatocyte cell lines are often used as in vitro models of hepatocyte function, including in the study of lipid accumulation. However, mechanisms and therapeutic agents studied in these systems suffer from poor translation to primary cells and animal models of disease. Herein, we report an ex vivo high-throughput screening platform using primary mouse hepatocytes with a physiologically relevant lipid-laden phenotype isolated from mice that are administered a choline-methionine deficient diet. This screening platform using primary diseased hepatocytes may help to overcome a major hurdle in liver disease drug discovery and could lead to the development of new therapeutics for hepatosteatosis.
