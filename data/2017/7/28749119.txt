Objective: Exopolysaccharides gained attention as new source for cancer treatment as recent treatments cause side effects and multidrug resistance. Polysaccharides containing sulfur and uronic acids exhibited antioxidant activity, by restoring cell redox regulation, thus inhibiting cell proliferation and cancer formation. Following this context, our study was performed to assess the cytotoxic activity of exopolysaccharides produced by novel Egyptian marine bacterial strains on HepG2 cells. Methods: Bacteria were isolated, purified and cultured through routine microbiological techniques. 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequence analyses, Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR), Identification of monosugars by HPLC molecular weight estimation, sulfur content determination and neutral red uptake assay were utilized. Results: BLAST showed that the isolates were related to the Bacillus sp. FTIR analysis indicated that the four EPSs under study contained sulfur as substituent functional group but with different percentage in each EPS. The highest sulfur percentage (46%) appeared in the EPS-6 that was produced by Bacillus flexus isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. HPLC showed that EPSs contained uronic acids which appeared as glucuronic and galacturonic acid in the low molecular weight EPS-6 (4.296×104 g mol-1). Arabinose appeared besides the glucuronic and galacturonic acid residues. EPS-6 showed the highest cytotoxicity, IC50 (218 μg ml-1) which could be correlated to the presence of sulfure and uronic acids in its structure. Conclusion: The novel Firmicutes from the Egyptian saline habitat produced EPSs of cytotoxic activity on hepatocellular carcinoma.
