Emerging evidence are accumulating that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently been identified to participate in various cellular processes. Terminal differentiation induced ncRNA (TINCR) is a newly identified lncRNA with its functional roles not fully elucidated in human malignancy. The current study aims to identify the clinical significance of TINCR in prognosis and malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TINCR expression in HCC specimens at various stages of tumorigenesis were measured by quantitative real-time RT PCR (qRT-PCR). The matched para-carcinoma tissues were used as controls. The associations of TINCR with clinicopathological characteristics, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients were further evaluated. Results revealed that high TINCR expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P=0.005), tumor differentiation status (P=0.017), TNM stage (P=0.010), and vascular invasion (P=0.004). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that TINCR was correlated to both DFS and OS in HCC cohorts. Patients with high TINCR expression tended to have worse prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that TINCR was an independent poor prognostic indicator for DFS (HR =1.32, 95% CI: 1.00-1.57, P=0.000) and OS (HR =1.57, 95% CI: 1.30-1.86, P=0.004) in HCC. TINCR was demonstrated as a direct target of miR-137 and miR-133a, and was suppressed by miR-137/miR-133a These results provide the first evidence that the expression of TINCR in HCC may play an oncogenic role in HCC differentiation, invasion, and metastasis. miR-137/miR-133a-TINCR pathway may serve as a promising target for tumor recurrence and prognosis of patients with HCC.
