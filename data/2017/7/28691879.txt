Pancreatic cancer has adverse prognosis. Disease recurrence is typical and it occurs mainly within the first 2 years postoperatively. However late and soliter metastases are rare. This case report shows the history of a male patient, who was radically operated on for pancreatic cancer. 11 years later a solitary liver metastasis has developed and it was completely removed by resection. 1 year postoperatively the patient is doing well. Our case demonstrates that in patients after resection for pancreatic cancer, redo surgery might be justified in case of late and isolated metastasis. Orv Hetil. 2017; 158(28): 1109-1111.
