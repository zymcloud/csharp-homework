Methyl jasmonate has recently been found to have anti-cancer activity. Methyl jasmonate detached hexokinase 2 from a voltage dependent anion channel causing a reduction in mitochondrial transmembrane potential that led to the release of cytochrome C and apoptosis inducing factor resulting in intrinsic apoptosis. Blocked adenosine triphosphate synthesis caused by mitochondrial injury hampered oxidative phosphorylation and led to cell necrosis. The results were applied to the in vivo treatment of nude mice with a satisfactory effect. Collectively, our results suggest that methyl jasmonate may be an adjuvant therapy for liver tumors due to its mechanism in cancer cells compared to that in normal cells: The major function is to inhibit glycolysis instead of changing aerobic metabolism.
