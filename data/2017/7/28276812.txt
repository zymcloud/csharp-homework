Survival analysis has been conducted through Kaplan Meier analysis.Results:A total of 4396 patients with stage IV HCC were identified in the period from 2010-2013 and they were included into this analysis. Patients with isolated regional lymph node involvement have better outcomes compared to patients with any other site of extra-hepatic disease (P Conclusion:Within the limits of the current SEER analysis, HCC patients with isolated lung metastases seem to have worse outcomes compared to patients with isolated bone or regional nodal metastases.â€‹.
