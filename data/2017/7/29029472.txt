Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause for HCC. Hepatitis B virus X (HBx), one of four proteins encoded by HBV genome, plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of HBV-induced HCC. However, the molecular mechanisms of HBx-triggered HCC remain largely undetermined. Here we revealed that the expression of Brain-expressed X-linked 2 (BEX2) and Osteopontin (OPN) were elevated in liver tissues of HBV transgenic mice and human HCC specimens. Moreover, a positive correlation between BEX2 and OPN was exhibited in samples from HCC patients with HBV infection. The protein levels of BEX2 and OPN were both higher in HBV-positive HCC specimens compared to that of HBV-negative HCC specimens. HBx potentiated OPN expression through up-regulation of BEX2. Importantly, the depletion of BEX2 suppressed tumorigenic potential of HCC cells with highly expressed HBx. We demonstrated the important role of BEX2 in HCC pathogenesis, and BEX2 may be a novel therapeutic target for HCC patients with HBV infection. The newly identified HBx/BEX2/OPN signaling cassette is implicated in the pathogenesis of HBV-induced HCC.
