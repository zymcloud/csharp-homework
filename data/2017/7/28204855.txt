Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of parametric response mapping (PRM) analysis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:We recruited 65 HCC patients who underwent TACE. These patients underwent longitudinal multiphasic CT before and after TACE. We applied PRM analysis to the baseline CT before TACE and first/second follow-up CTs. The results of PRM analyses were used to stratify patients into responders and non-responders. Overall survival was compared between the two groups. An independent survival analysis using conventional radiological assessments was performed, and the results were compared with PRM results. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify clinical factors affecting survival.Results:The PRM analyses demonstrated that the responding group had a median survival of 529 days, while the non-responding group had a median survival of 263 days [hazard ratio (HR) 12.9, p Conclusions:The PRM analysis could be a better predictor of overall survival for patients with HCC undergoing TACE than conventional radiological assessments.
