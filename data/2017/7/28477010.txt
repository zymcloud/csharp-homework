Serum miRNAs have gained great popularity to act as circulating biomarkers of several cancers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of serum miR-21 as novel biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other controls.

The expression levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in primary HCC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P
