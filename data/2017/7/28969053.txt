Liver X receptor (LXR), a member of nuclear receptor superfamily, is involved in the regulation of glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Recently, it has been reported that LXR suppress different kinds of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the corresponding mechanism is still not well elucidated. In the present study, we found that activation of LXR downregulated cyclin D1 while upregulated p21 and p27 by elevating the level of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), leading to the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase and growth inhibition of HCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that LXRα (not LXRβ) mediated the induction of SOCS3 in HCC cells. Subsequently, we showed that LXR activation enhanced the mRNA stability of SOCS3, but had no significant influence on the transcriptional activity of SOCS3 gene promoter. The experiments in nude mice revealed that LXR agonist inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors and enhanced SOCS3 expression in vivo. These results indicate that "LXRα-SOCS3-cyclin D1/p21/p27" is a novel pathway by which LXR exerts its anti-HCC effects, suggesting that the pathway may be a new potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
