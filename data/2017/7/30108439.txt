Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Novel prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed for patients with HCC. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) overexpression may promote tumor metastasis in HCC. However, few studies investigate the prognosis predictive role of LGR5 in patients with HCC. Herein, we aimed to examine the expression level of LGR5 in tumors and its correlation with clinical characteristics and survivals of patients with HCC. LGR5 expression in tumor specimens and adjacent tissue resected from 66 patients were detected by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the expression of LGR5 was markedly higher in HCC than in normal adjacent tissues (P = .006). High expression of LGR5 was significantly correlated with later disease stage (P = .009). In addition, high LGR5 expression was remarkably correlated with short overall survival than those with low LGR5 expression (P
