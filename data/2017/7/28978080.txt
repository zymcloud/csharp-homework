Selenium compounds have strong anti-tumor effects and are well-tolerated. We examined the anti-tumor effects of (NH4)2H15Se2VIMo10V3O52·2H2O (Se2Mo10V3), a heteropoly compound containing selenium. Se2Mo10V3 inhibited proliferation in K562 cells with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 78.72±2.82 mg/L after 48 h and 24.94±0.88 mg/L after 72 h. Typical apoptotic morphologies were also observed in K562 cells treated with Se2Mo10V3, as were increased intracellular levels of Ca2+, Mg2+, H+, and reactive oxygen species, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, Se2Mo10V3 treatment triggered cytochrome C release and inhibited IκBα degradation and NF-κB translocation. In vivo experiments revealed that 5 or 10 mg/kg Se2Mo10V3 inhibited the growth of sarcoma 180 and hepatoma 22 xenograft tumors. These results indicate that Se2Mo10V3 inhibits tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and induces apoptosis in K562 cells, possibly by inhibiting the NF-κB/IκBα pathway.
