Background:Patients chronically infected with genotype 3 hepatitis C virus (HCV) have faster disease progression and are less responsive to current direct-acting antiviral regimens than patients infected with other genotypes. We conducted an open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in patients with genotype 3 HCV infection.Methods:We enrolled treatment-naive patients with and without compensated cirrhosis at 15 sites in Canada. All patients were treated with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (90 mg and 400 mg) plus weight-based ribavirin for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12). Secondary endpoints included evaluation of baseline and treatment-emergent drug resistance.Results:Of the 111 patients enrolled, 105 (95%) had subtype 3a HCV and 39 (35%) had compensated cirrhosis. SVR12 was achieved by 99 of 111 patients (89%; 95% confidence interval, 82%-94%). Of the 39 patients with cirrhosis, 31 (79%) achieved SVR12, compared with 68 of 72 (94%) patients without cirrhosis. No treatment-emergent resistance mutations occurred in those who failed treatment. One patient discontinued treatment due to liver cancer and died 22 days after treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse events were fatigue (51%), headache (36%), and nausea (23%).Conclusions:In this multicenter trial involving treatment-naive patients with genotype 3 HCV, 12 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir provided a high level of SVR in those without cirrhosis.Clinical trials registration:NCT02413593.
