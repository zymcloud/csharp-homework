LY2584702 is an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase-1 previously developed for the treatment of cancer. In two phase 1 trials in oncology patients, significant reductions of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride were observed. In the current study, we sought to understand the potential mechanism of action of this compound in regulating lipid metabolism. In Long Evans diet-induced obese (DIO) rats, oral administration of LY2584702 for 3-4 weeks led to robust reduction of LDL-C up to 60%. An unexpected finding of liver triglyceride (TG) increase implicated a metabolite of LY2584702, 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-day]pyrimidine (4-APP), in modulation of lipid metabolism in these rats. We showed that low-dose 4-APP, when administered orally for 3-4 weeks to Long Evans DIO rats, produced lipoprotein profile changes that were strikingly similar to LY2584702. Kinetic studies suggested that both LY2584702 and 4-APP had no effect on chylomicron-TG secretion and only exerted a modest effect on hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG secretion. In human hepatoma HepG2 cells, 4-APP, but not LY2584702, increased LDL uptake. We hypothesize that generation of the 4-APP metabolite may contribute to the efficacy of LY2584702 in lowering LDL-C in rats and potentially in humans as well. This mechanism of LDL-C lowering may include inhibition of VLDL production and increase in LDL clearance.
