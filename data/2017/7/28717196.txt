The TRIB1 locus has been linked to both cardiovascular disease and hepatic steatosis. Recent efforts have revealed TRIB1 to be a major regulator of liver function, largely, but not exclusively, via CEBPA degradation. We recently uncovered a functional interaction between TRIB1 and HNF4A, another key regulator of hepatic function, whose molecular underpinnings remained to be clarified. Here we have extended these findings. In hepatoma models, HNF4A levels were found to depend on TRIB1, independently of its impact on CEBPA. Using a reporter assay model, MTTP reporter activity, which depends on HNF4A, positively correlated with TRIB1 levels. Confocal microscopy demonstrated partial colocalization of TRIB1 and HNF4A. Using overexpressed proteins we demonstrate that TRIB1 and HNF4A can form complexes in vivo. Mapping of the interaction interfaces identified two distinct regions within TRIB1 which associated with the N-terminal region of HNF4A. Lastly, the TRIB1-HNF4A interaction resisted competition with a CEPBA-derived peptide, suggesting different binding modalities. Together these findings establish that TRIB1 is required for HNF4A function. This regulatory axis represents a novel CEBPA-independent aspect of TRIB1 function predicted to play an important role in liver physiology.
