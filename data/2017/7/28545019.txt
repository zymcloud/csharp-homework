Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is involved in the immune dysfunction of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study analyzed the association of circulating soluble PD-1 (sPD-1) levels with the phases and clinical diseases in chronic HBV infection. Serum sPD-1 levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in patients with different phases and liver diseases of chronic HBV infection. The sPD-1 levels in patients with chronic HBV infection were significantly elevated compared with HBV infection resolvers or healthy controls. According to phases, sPD-1 level in immune-tolerant phase (IT) was significantly lower than in other phases. Multivariate analysis showed that sPD-1 was an independent factor associated with IT. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) showed that sPD-1 was significantly discriminative of IT from other phases with a cut-off of 1.535 ng/mL (AUC, 0.984; P
