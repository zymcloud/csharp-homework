MicroRNAs (miRs) are short and highly conserved non-coding RNAs molecules consisting of 18-25 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by direct binding to complementary binding sites within the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNAs. New evidences have demonstrated that miRNAs play an important role in diverse physiological processes, including regulating cell growth, apoptosis, metastasis, drug resistance, and invasion. In chromosomes 11 and 22 of the miR-130 family, paralogous miRNA sequences, miR-130a and miR-130b are situated, respectively. MiR-130a has participated in different pathogenesis, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, prostate carcinoma, leukemia, etc. Most important of all, more and more evidences indicate that miR-130a is associated with drug resistance and acts as an intermediate in PI3 K/Akt/PTEN/mTOR, Wnt/Î²-catenin and NF-kB/PTEN drug resistance signaling pathways. Drug resistance has emerged as a major obstacle to successful treatment of cancer nowadays and in this review, we will reveal the function of miR-130a in cancer, especially in drug resistance. Therefore, it will provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer, especially in chemotherapy.
