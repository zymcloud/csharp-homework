Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common type of skin tumour with the ability of metastatic spread. It represents about 20% of all malignancies diagnosed worldwide each year. Despite increased knowledge regarding the causes of skin cancer, the incidence of cSCC rises. The disease originates from epidermal keratinocytes, but it may occur on all areas of the body. It has an invasive nature and the potential to metastasise. We report unusual case of a giant metastatic desmoplastic cSCC of the gluteal region in a patient with previously resected desmoplastic cSCC presenting 8 months later with multiple liver and lung metastases.
