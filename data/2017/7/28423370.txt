The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), TACE combined with Jie-du granules (JD), and TACE combined with sorafenib (SOR) for treating patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For this purpose, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 266 consecutive patients with unresectable HCC who underwent TACE treatment at the Shanghai Hospital and Eastern Hepatic Surgery Hospital between Jan 2009 and Dec 2010. We prospectively analyzed patient survival and progression times as well as independent predictors, within a follow-up period of 86 months. Patients were divided into TACE-JD (n = 75), TACE-SOR (n = 124) and TACE (n = 67) groups. Median overall survival (OS) times being: TACE-JD, 21.43 months; TACE-SOR, 23.23 months; TACE, 13.97 months (TACE-SOR vs TACE, P
