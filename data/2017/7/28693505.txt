Background:Percutaneous ablation has quickly arisen as one of the important alternative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to compare the therapeutic effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and other ablative techniques on HCCs.Methods:Databases were searched to identify literature on complete tumor ablation (CTA), overall survival (OS), local tumor recurrence (LTR), and complications of RFA in the treatment of HCC, compared with those of microwave ablation (MWA), percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), PEI plus RFA, cryoablation (CRA), laser ablation (LSA), and high-intensity focused ultrasound. Randomized controlled trials and high-quality cohort studies were included in the assessment.Results:The effects of MWA and CRA appeared to be similar to those of RFA, but lower rates of LTR and higher rates of CTA in large tumors compared with RFA were reported (P Conclusions:Compared with RFA, identical effects were found in MWA and CRA groups. Fewer complications were observed in PEI and LSA group. PEI plus RFA appeared more effective, with a higher rate of complications. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are further needed to confirm above results.
