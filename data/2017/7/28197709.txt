Background:Systemic inflammation can promote tumor growth. The Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), a simple assessment of systemic inflammation status, could be useful to predict the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatectomy.Methods:Consecutive HCC patients were enrolled following hepatectomy at our institution between 2005 and 2012. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival. Patients were stratified according to the GPS. To minimize selection bias, propensity score analysis was performed.Results:An elevated GPS (1-2), des-gamma carboxyprothrombin levels (≥40 mAU/mL), and the presence of multiple tumors were significantly associated with a poor OS. Alpha-fetoprotein levels (≥20.0 ng/mL), des-gamma carboxyprothrombin levels (≥40 mAU/mL), and the presence of multiple tumors were independent risk factors for a poor recurrence-free survival. After one-to-one matching, 92 patients each with a normal GPS (0) and an elevated GPS (1-2) had similar preoperative and operative characteristics. Poorer OS times in patients with an elevated GPS were confirmed by excluding possible misinterpretation.Conclusions:An elevated GPS was an independent prognostic indicator for OS after hepatectomy in HCC patients. The GPS, which employs inexpensive and readily available biomarkers, could be a novel tool for predicting survival in such patients.
