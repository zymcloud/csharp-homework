It is well known that liver cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Andrographolide (AD), a major bioactive component of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F.), is a potential anti-cancer pharmacophore and the synthesis of AD derivatives with better cytotoxicity to cancer cells has attracted considerable attentions. In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo inhibitory effects of ADN-9, a 15-benzylidene substituted derivative of AD, on the growth and metastasis of murine hepatoma H22 using an orthotopic xenograft model and a subcutaneous xenograft model, and we further studied the anti-angiogenic action and the related mechanisms of ADN-9 in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, ADN-9 remarkably suppressed the growth and metastasis of both orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft tumors, and the serum AFP level in orthotopic hepatoma-bearing mice treated with 100mg/kg ADN-9 (ig.) was decreased to the normal level. We also found that ADN-9 showed stronger abilities than AD in shrinking tumors, suppressing the invasion and metastasis of H22 cells, decreasing the MVD and promoting tumor cell apoptosis in subcutaneous xenograft of mice. Additionally, ADN-9 exhibited stronger inhibitory activity than AD against the migration and VEGF-induced capillary-like tube formation in HUVECs, which was further proved to be associated with attenuating VEGF/VEGFR2/AKT signaling pathway. The present research provides the first evidence that a 15-substituted AD derivative is more promising than the parent compound in therapeutic treatment of liver cancer.
