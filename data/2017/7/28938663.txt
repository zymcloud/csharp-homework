We performed a meta-analysis of transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which included 4 double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effects of TACE combined with sorafenib (experimental groups) on time to disease progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and various sorafenib-related adverse events, compared to those in the placebo (control) groups. A total of 877 HCC cases from 14 countries, including China and the USA, were included in our meta-analysis. The TTP increased significantly in the experimental groups (hazard ration [HR]: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.69-0.97; p = 0.02), but OS did not improve significantly (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.72-1.29; p = 0.82), compared with the control groups. The risks of hand and foot skin reactions (HFSR), rash, fatigue, and diarrhea were significantly greater in the experimental groups (p < 0.05 for all), compared to those in the control groups, whereas the risk of nausea was statistically similar (p > 0.05). Among these, the risk of HFSR was highest (risk ratio [RR]: 5.93; 95% CI: 2.00-17.53; p = 0.001), and a subgroup analysis of studies that lacked significant heterogeneity in the HFSR data showed a higher risk of HFSR (RR: 10.96; 95% CI: 5.54-21.69; p < 0.05). In conclusion, although TACE plus sorafenib increases TTP, it does not improve OS. Therefore, the risk of the adverse events of TACE plus sorafenib should be considered as a potential therapeutic limitation.
