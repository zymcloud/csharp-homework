Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein and has recently been detected in several human cancer cells. However, its clinical relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study aimed at evaluating NRP2 expression and clinicopathological significance in HCC patients. Tissue microarray of 190 HCC patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University was established, and immunohistochemical staining was performed for NRP2. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard model were used to analyze the survival rate. We found that NRP2 expression in HCC was significantly associated with tumor histological degree (P=0.023) and cirrhosis (P=0.040). Furthermore, NRP2-positive HCC patients demonstrated shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) than those of NRP2-negative patients. Then, the multivariate Cox analysis showed that hazard ratios of NRP2-positive patients with DFS and OS were 2.167 (95% CI: 1.626, 2.889) and 2.317 (95% CI: 1.548, 3.469), respectively. Our results suggested that NRP2 expression was considered as an independent factor for the prediction of unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients, and we believe that NRP2 could serve as a biomarker of poor prognosis and a novel target in treating HCC tumors.
