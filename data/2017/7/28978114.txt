MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding and endogenous RNAs that played as important roles in the proliferation and metastasis of tumors. In this study, we determined the role of miR-18a in the regulation of HCC cell motility. We showed that miR-18a expression was upregulated in human HCC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, Elevated expression of miR-18a promoted the HCC cell proliferation and migration. KLF4 was identified as a direct target of miR-18a in HCC cells. Furthermore, overexpression of KLF4 attenuated the effects of miR-18a on the regulation of HCC cell motility. The expression of KLF4 was negatively associated with the expression of miR-18a expression in HCC tissues. We also showed that the cell cycle inhibitor p21 was aberrantly downregulated in HCC cells, whereas this inhibition was reversed by miR-18a inhibitor. These data indicated that miR-18a may play a positive role in hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting the proliferation and migration of HCC cells through targeting KLF4 as well as downstream p21.
