Background:The risk factors for recurrence and death after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly known. This study was aimed to study the 10-year overall survival (OS) of HCC treated by ultrasound (US)-guided RFA and the risk factors for recurrence and death.Methods:Between June 2005 and June 2016, 1000 patients with HCC treated by US-guided RFA at 4 hospitals in China; among them, 525 patients met the criteria for radical ablation and 410 had high AFP levels before RFA treatment. Clinical and biochemical factors were tested for association with recurrence and survival. Patients were divided into the recurrence (n = 348) and no recurrence groups (n = 62).Results:The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 66 and 35%, respectively. Tumor size (HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.12-1.65), albumin levels (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.91), prothrombin time (HR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.54-3.10), and α-fetoprotein levels (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.26) were independently associated with mortality after RFA for HCC. Tumor size (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15-1.40), HBV-DNA (HR = 7.70, 95% CI 3.57-16.63), AFP levels before treatment (HR = 2.172, 95% CI 1.256-3.756, P = 0.006), and AFP response (HR = 4.722, 95% CI 1.053-21.184, P = 0.0427) were independently associated with the risk of recurrence of HCC after RFA. The median survival of the patients with and without recurrence after RFA was 54 (95% CI 45-58) and 62 (95% CI 48-80) months, respectively (log-rank, P = 0.04).Conclusions:Tumor size, albumin, prothrombin time, and α-fetoprotein levels were independently associated with mortality after US-guided RFA for HCC, while tumor size and HBV-DNA were independently associated with recurrence. Patients with recurrence had a poorer survival compared with those without.
