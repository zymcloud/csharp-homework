Objectives:The goal of our study was to assess the prognostic impact of the necroptosis relative protein RIPK1 genetic polymorphism in ischemia-reperfusion injury and survival after hepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:In this study, expression of RIPK1 and its genetic polymorphism(rs2272990) were examined in plasma of 44 HCC patients. All these patients were undergoing partial hepatectomy. The prognostic values of RIPK1 genetic polymorphism for tumor development and survival, and ischemia-reperfusion injury after hepatectomy were further determined.Results:Plasma RIPK1 expressions were significantly increased in HCC patients, compared to the healthy control group. Totally 19 patients have the GA + AA genotype in the RIPK1 rs2272990 SNP site and 25 have GG genotype. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences observed in age, gender, AFP value, HBV positive, tumor size or cirrhosis. GG genotype had positive correlation with TNM classification (p= 0.033) and lymphatic metastasis (p= 0.027) and was significantly associated with severe hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and decreased survival rate after hepatectomy.Conclusion:In conclusion, the RIPK1 polymorphism is an indicator of hepatic injury and a novel prognostic biomarker for tumor development and survival of HCC recipients after hepatectomy.
