Rationale:Ectopic liver tissue can develop at various sites near the liver. Ectopic hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) arising from ectopic liver tissue have a rare clinical incidence. A very rare case has been observed to have metastasis after operation.Patient concerns:We report an extremely rare case with multiple masses which were identified in the head and body of the pancreas.Diagnoses:Ectopic hepatocellular carcinomas.Interventions:The masses were removed by surgical resection. Histopathological analysis showed that both masses were ectopic HCC.Outcomes:The patient was still alive and did not have metastasis and relapse.Lessons:The literature review for this rare case is also presented to highlight the risk of ectopic HCC and good prognosis of operation for ectopic HCC.
