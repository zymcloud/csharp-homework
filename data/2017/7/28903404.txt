Tumor-specific hepatic stellate cells (tHSCs) contributes to tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The potential function of tHSCs on dendritic cells (DCs) was studied here. We discovered that tHSCs co-culture induced upregulation of DIgR2 (dendritic cell-derived immunoglobulin receptor 2) in bone marrow-derived DCs (mDCs). Activation of MEK-ERK is required for DIgR2 expression in mDCs. MEK-ERK inhibitors or shRNA-mediated silence of MEK1/2 in mDCs inhibited tHSCs-induced DIgR2 expression. Meanwhile, tHSCs stimulation decreased production of multiple cytokines (CD80, CD86 and IL-12) in mDCs. Such an effect was almost reversed by DIgR2 shRNA in mDCs. Further, tHSCs-stimulated mDCs induced T-cell hypo-responsiveness, leading to decreased cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity and reduced IFN-Î³ production in splenic T cells. T cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis were also noticed. These actions on T cells were again largely inhibited by DIgR2 shRNA in mDCs. Together, our results indicate that tHSCs directly induces DIgR2 expression in DCs to inhibit T cells.
