Background:It is supposed that the improvement of prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient by anterior approach for liver resection was related to the decreasing hematogenic dissemination of circulating cancer cells.Methods:The EpCAM+ circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected in HCC patients having liver resection with either anterior approach (AA) or conventional approach (CA). The relation of CTCs to the 2-year recurrence and survival after surgery was investigated.Results:Overall, patients with â‰¥3.5 CTCs had much higher recurrence rate than those with 5 cm AA group were much less than that in >5 cm CA group (3.7 vs. 2.4, P = 0.002). Moreover, the 2-year recurrence rate in >5 cm AA group was much lower than that in >5 cm CA group (29.2 vs. 54.7%, P = 0.001). Also, the 2-year survival rates in >5 cm AA group were much higher than that in >5 cm CA group (72.9 vs. 49.1%, P = 0.01). By multivariate analysis, CA is one of the independent risk factors for poor prognosis in HCC patients after liver resection.Conclusions:Like the liver-directed therapies, AA can reduce the dissemination of CTCs, especially in patients with large-size HCC (>5 cm) and successively improve the early prognosis.
