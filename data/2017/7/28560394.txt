MicroRNAs belong to a series of noncoding RNAs and have diverse roles in several biological processes. The association between aberrant microRNA expression and tumorigenesis is complex and remains to be fully elucidated. The present study investigated whether microRNA (miR) ‑526a can suppress the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, luciferase reporter assay, invasion assay, western blotting and in vivo implantation were used to investigate the potential function of miR‑526a. The present study observed that the level of miR‑526a was downregulated in HCC tissues and well‑established cell lines. In addition, the ectopic introduction of miR‑526a into Huh7 and HepG2 cells significantly attenuated HCC tumorigenesis, including proliferation, migration and invasion. The growth of tumor xenografts was also inhibited following transfection with miR‑526a. Using overlapping strategies, p21‑activated kinase 7 (PAK7) was predicted to be a target for miR‑526a, and this was verified experimentally. An inverse correlation was found between miR‑526a and PAK7 in HCC tissues. The results of the present study revealed a novel function of miR‑526a and may provide crucial insight into therapeutic interventions targeting microRNAs.
