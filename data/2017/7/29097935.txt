Objective:To investigate the effectiveness of a new individualized contrast medium injection protocol for enhanced liver CT scan.Methods:324 patients who underwent plain and dual phase enhanced liver CT were randomly assigned to 2 groups: G1 (n = 224, individualized contrast medium injection protocol); G2 (n = 100, standard contrast medium injection with a dose of 1.5 ml/kg). CT values and ΔHU (CT values difference between plain and enhanced CT) of liver parenchyma and tumor-liver contrast (TLC) during hepatic arterial phase (HAP) and portal venous phase (PVP) and contrast medium dose were measured. The tumor conspicuity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between two groups was independently evaluated by two radiologists.Results:The mean contrast medium dose of G1 was statistically lower than that of G2. There were no significantly statistical differences in CT values and ΔHU of liver parenchyma during HAP, TLC values during HAP, and PVP between two groups. The CT values and ΔHU of liver parenchyma during PVP of G2 were significantly higher than those of G1. Two independent radiologists were both in substantial conformity in grading tumor conspicuity.Conclusion:Using the individually optimized injection protocol might reduce contrast medium dose without impacting on the imaging quality in enhanced liver CT.
