Patients with unresectable hepatic colorectal metastases who become chemo-refractory have limited treatment options. Systemic chemotherapies such as TAS102 and regorafenib have been used in the refractory setting, but with only modest improvement in overall survival compared to best supportive care. In patients with liver-only or liver-dominant disease, direct chemotherapy to the liver such as hepatic artery infusional (HAI) chemotherapy and radioembolization (yttrium-90 (Y90)) should be considered. Due to the difficulty of HAI therapy post Y90 for technical reasons, we recommend HAI therapy prior to Y90.
