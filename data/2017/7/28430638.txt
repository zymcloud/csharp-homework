Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is common due to neoangiogenesis. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and somatostatin analogues were reported to inhibit tumour angiogenesis. The pilot randomized controlled trial was aimed to prospectively evaluate the protocol of TACE combined with celecoxib and lanreotide (TACE+C+L) in patients with unresectable and advanced HCC. A total of 71 patients with HCC were enrolled and randomly assigned to either TACE (n=35) or TACE+C+L (n=36) group. Overall survival, disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events were assessed during a 3-year follow-up period. The median overall survival of the TACE+C+L group (15.0 months) was doubled compared to that of TACE group (7.5 months), p = 0.012. DCR of the TACE+C+L group was significantly higher than that of the TACE group either at 6 months (72.2% vs 42.9%, p = 0.012) or at 12 months (61.1% vs 28.6%, p = 0.006). The median overall survivals (13 months vs 4.5 months, p = 0.013) and DCR at 12 months (50% vs 13.6%, p = 0.008) of patients with advanced HCC in TACE+C+L groups were significantly higher than those in TACE group. No significant difference of adverse events was observed between the two groups. The occurrence of post-embolisation syndrome in TACE+C+L group was significantly lower than that in TACE group (16.7% vs 60.0%, p = 0.001). In conclusion, the regimen of TACE+C+L prolonged overall survival, enhanced tumour response, reduced post-embolisation syndrome and was well-tolerable in the patients with unresectable HCC. It may be more beneficial for advanced HCC.
