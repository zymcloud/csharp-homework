Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. It is a type of inflammation-related cancer that usually follows liver hepatitis that mostly caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) in China. However, the metabolism disturbance of HCC and HBV-cirrhosis is not yet fully understood. In addition, there is little research on the relationships between inflammation mediators and HCC. In this study, we investigated serum metabolic abnormalities in HBV-cirrhosis and HCC patients through non-targeted metabolomics and targeted eicosanoid analysis. Metabolomic analysis identified 14 metabolites, i.e. malate, citrate, succinate, lysine, carnitine, proline, ornithine, serine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, arachidonic acid arabinose, galactose and uric acid are consistently altered in HBV-cirrhosis and HCC patients. Meanwhile, eicosanoid analysis uncovered several prostaglandins and leukotrienes are implicated in pathological processes in HBV-cirrhosis and HCC. Finally, these identified biomarkers possessed strong potential to distinguish and diagnose HCC from healthy controls and HBV-cirrhosis patients. This study provided a new perspective to understand the mechanism and discover probable biomarkers of HCC.
