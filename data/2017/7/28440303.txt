Objectives:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a well-documented risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Seven HCV genotypes have been classified, and the genotypes show a great variety of geographic distribution. HCV genotype 6 is prevalent in Southeast Asia and has been less studied than the other genotypes.Methods:This follow-up study was designed to evaluate the natural history of HCV genotype 6. The cohort enrolled 851 Asian patients consisting of 222 with HCV genotype 6 and 629 with other genotypes. The incidence of HCC per 1,000 person-years of various HCV genotypes was estimated by dividing the new HCC cases to the person-years of follow-up. The adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox's proportional hazards models.Results:After 4072 person-years of follow-up, there were 96 newly-developed HCC cases, confirming an incidence of 23.6 per 1000 person-years. By stratifying cirrhosis at study entry, the cumulative risk of HCC among HCV genotype 6 vs. non-6 was 2.9 vs. 2.2% for those without cirrhosis (P=0.45) and 76.2% (95% CI: 55.6-96.8%) vs. 36.2% (95% CI: 28.7-39.1%) for those with cirrhosis (PConclusions:Among patients with cirrhosis, those with HCV genotype 6 infection should be given high priority for antiviral therapy to decrease HCC risk and for vigilant adherence to HCC surveillance.
