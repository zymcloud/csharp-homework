Understanding the roles of splicing factors and splicing events during tumorigenesis would open new avenues for targeted therapies. Here we identify an oncofetal splicing factor, MBNL3, which promotes tumorigenesis and indicates poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. MBNL3 knockdown almost completely abolishes hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that MBNL3 induces lncRNA-PXN-AS1 exon 4 inclusion. The transcript lacking exon 4 binds to coding sequences of PXN mRNA, causes dissociation of translation elongation factors from PXN mRNA, and thereby inhibits PXN mRNA translation. In contrast, the transcript containing exon 4 preferentially binds to the 3' untranslated region of PXN mRNA, protects PXN mRNA from microRNA-24-AGO2 complex-induced degradation, and thereby increases PXN expression. Through inducing exon 4 inclusion, MBNL3 upregulates PXN, which mediates the pro-tumorigenic roles of MBNL3. Collectively, these data demonstrate detailed mechanistic links between an oncofetal splicing factor, a splicing event and tumorigenesis, and establish splicing factors and splicing events as potential therapeutic targets.
