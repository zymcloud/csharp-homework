TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and progression by regulating the expression of a number of genes. However, the association of their genetic variations with HCC prognosis remains elusive. Seven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in TEAD1-4 (rs2304733, rs10831923, rs12104362, rs3745305, rs11756089, rs2076173, rs7135838) were genotyped from 331 hepatitis B virus positive HCC patients using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform. The TEAD3 rs2076173 C allele and rs11756089 T allele were identified as protective alleles as they were significantly associated with longer median overall survival time (MST). The T allele of rs2076173 was significantly associated with HCC survival independent of age, gender, smoking and drinking status, BCLC stage, and chemotherapy or TACE status (HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.56-0.93, P = 0.012). This protective effect was more prominent for patients who were non-drinkers (P for multiplicative interaction = 0.002). Patients had more than one of these protective alleles had significant longer MST of 19.25 months than those had none (MST=12.85 months, adjusted HR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.33-0.95, P=0.030), especially for those non-drinkers (adjusted HR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.32-0.74, P = 0.001). These findings suggested that rs2076173 and rs11756089 in TEAD3 gene could serve as genetic markers for favorable survival in the Chinese HCC patients.
