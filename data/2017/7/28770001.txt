Background:The role of interleukin (IL) 17A in chronic liver diseases had been extensively studied, but the function of IL-17F, which shares a high degree of homology with IL-17A, in the progression of chronic hepatic diseases is poorly understood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between IL-17F and liver diseases including, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Hepatic tumor samples from both hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive and negative patients (without HBV and HCV, NBNC) were examined with quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry staining for inflammatory cytokine genes expression. In addition, 250 HCV patients na√Øve for interferon treatment were also subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for their serum cytokine concentrations.Results:Serum IL-17F concentrations were significantly elevated in HCV patients with severe fibrosis stages. In accordance with serum data, IL-17F expression was also found higher in HCV-associated HCC tissues compared with NBNC HCC tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels.Conclusions:Our data suggest that IL-17F might be used as a valuable biological marker than IL-17A during chronic fibrosis progression and HCC development in HCV patients.
