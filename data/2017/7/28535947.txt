Background & aims:Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a disease with rising prevalence and considerable geographical variation. To describe the prevalence, spatial and time distribution, baseline characteristics, response to treatment, outcome and the validity of GLOBE score in a large cohort of Greek PBC patients as an independent validation of this score has not been done so far.Methods:The last 16years, 482 PBC patients (86.5% females) were evaluated and analysed retrospectively, using a prospectively collected database. Special attention was paid to the assessment of treatment response according to GLOBE score.Results:Age at initial evaluation was 56.3Â±13.7years. Among 432 Thessaly residents, prevalence was 582/million (non-homogeneous distribution). Nineteen districts showed a prevalence >800/million. Symptomatic disease onset could be identified in 91 patients, with a significant peak during spring (P=0.03). At diagnosis, 43.6% were asymptomatic and 16.2% cirrhotic. Male sex (P=0.02), older age (P0.30 had significantly worse prognosis (PConclusions:There is increased PBC prevalence in Thessaly with remarkable geographic clustering and seasonal variability. PBC is diagnosed at early stages although males had a more advanced disease. GLOBE score applies perfectly in Greek patients and this will likely help detecting patients that may benefit from new therapies.
