Aim:The risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA under nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy are not well defined. We aimed to examine the relationship between Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive human Mac-2 binding protein (WFA+-M2BP) and HCC development in these patients.Results:There was a significant difference in the median levels of pre-treatment WFA+-M2BP between the HCC and control groups (0.67 vs 0.41 COI, respectively, p Materials and methods:Fifty-seven NA-treated patients with undetectable HBV DNA who developed HCC were compared with 57 controls (matched with demographics and treatment duration). WFA+-M2BP levels were measured, and expressed as cutoff index (COI). Subgroup analyses were also performed in patients with and without cirrhosis.Conclusions:A higher pre-treatment WFA+-M2BP level was associated with an increased risk of HCC development in patients with undetectable HBV DNA under NA therapy. Further longitudinal studies are required to examine the role of WFA+-M2BP as an accessory risk marker for HCC development.
