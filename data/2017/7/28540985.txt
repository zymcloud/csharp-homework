Purpose:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is indicated for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Whether TACE provides any long-term survival benefits remains unclear. We aimed to investigate micrometastases predictors with which to identify patients who would benefit from surgical resection (SR).Materials and methods:First, we analyzed risk factors of micrometastases, microvascular invasion, and poor histologic grade in 38 patients with newly diagnosed resectable BCLC stage B HCC limited to one or two segments with well-preserved liver function and who underwent SR between January 2006 and December 2013. Second, we validated identified risk factors in 54 newly diagnosed resectable BCLC B HCC patients with well-preserved liver function who underwent TACE during the same period to determine their influence on survival.Results:Risk factors of micrometastases in SR patients were α-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥110 [hazard ratio (HR)=5.166; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.031-25.897; p=0.046] and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) ≥800 (HR=5.166; 95% CI, 1.031-25.897; p=0.046). The cumulative probability of tumor recurrence (p=0.009) after SR differed according to levels of AFP and PIVKA-II. After validation of these risk factors in the TACE group, patients with SR and AFP Conclusion:AFP and PIVKA-II levels predict micrometastases and survival. Therefore, they should be considered when selecting SR for BCLC B HCC.
