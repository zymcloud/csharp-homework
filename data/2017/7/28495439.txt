Background:There are two philosophical approaches to planning liver resection for malignancy: one strives towards zero postoperative mortality by stringent selection of candidates, thus inherently limiting patients selected; the other, accepts a low yet definite postoperative mortality rate, and offers surgery to all those with potential gain in survival. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse an alternative and evolving strategy, and its impact on short-term outcomes.Method:3118 consecutive hepatectomies performed in 2627 patients over 3 decades (1980-2011) were analysed. Patient demographics, tumour characteristics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were analysed.Results:1528 patients (58%) were male. Colorectal liver metastases (1221 patients, 47%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (584 patients, 22%) were the most common diagnoses. Anatomical resections were performed in 2045 (66%), some form of vascular clamping was used in 2385 (72%), and blood transfusion was required in 1130 (36%) patients. Use of preoperative techniques to increase feasibility and safety of complex liver resections allowed expansion of indications to include sicker patients with larger tumours in the later period of the study. Overall morbidity and mortality rates were 31% and 3% respectively. During the first vs. second half of the study period the postoperative morbidity and mortality were 19% vs. 36% (p Conclusion:With increasing experience, more patients were accepted for complex hepatectomies. However, there was a definite yet contained increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality.
