Previous studies have shown that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops more frequently in hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-transgenic mice (Alb/HBs) than in wild-type (WT) mice. However, the mechanism of this HCC model has not been well documented. Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) signaling probably links innate immunity and HCC progression. This study was designed to investigate the role of innate immunity in hepatocarcinogenesis in Alb/HBs mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of liver specimens from Alb/HBs mice (16 per group) showed that the oncogenes Bmi1 (16/16, 100%) and Dkk1 (13/16, 81.25%) were highly expressed in Alb/HBs mice, whereas the other oncogenes evaluated were expressed in smaller percentages of mice (Afp, 9/16, 56.2%; Ctnnb1, 5/16, 31.3%; Epcam, 0/16; 0%). Comparable results were obtained by quantitative PCR analysis. Hepatic gene expression of Tlr2, Tlr4, Il6 and Tnf was additionally elevated in Alb/HBs mice. Stimulation of primary murine hepatocytes with cell culture-derived HBV particles or LPS increased the expression of oncogenes (Bmi1, Dkk1) and inflammatory factors (Tnf, Il6, Tlr4). Proliferation and colony formation of hepatoma cells were enhanced by treatment with HBV and LPS and were impaired by the suppression of Bmi1 and Dkk1 by small interfering RNAs. Substantial induction of BMI1 and DKK1 was found in liver biopsy samples from patients with HBV-related HCC but not in HCC samples without HBV infection background. These findings suggest that innate immunity may link inflammation and tumor progression during chronic HBV infection, involving the oncogenes BMI1 and DKK1.
