In 2011, a joint World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Environment Programme expert panel recommended the use of the WHO toxicity equivalency factor (TEF) scheme for assessment of the human health risks of brominated dioxins which have different sources from chlorinated dioxins. Therefore, WHO toxic equivalents (TEQs) should be determined for both chlorinated and brominated dioxins. As alternative to the conventional but time-consuming dioxin analysis using gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have developed a screening method involving cleanup and separation of brominated dioxins from chlorinated dioxins in field samples and subsequent analysis by CALUX (chemically activated luciferase expression) assays which are in vitro reporter gene assays detecting dioxin-like compounds. Cleanup and separation were accomplished with silica gel columns impregnated with 55% sulfuric acid and with 10% silver nitrate, respectively, and the average recoveries of the major contributors to the WHO-TEQs were approximately 90%. The CALUX 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (CALUX-TEQs) derived from all the dioxin-like compounds in the cleanup fractions of the field samples (n = 24) were measured by means of the CALUX assays, indicating significant positive correlations between the WHO-TEQs and CALUX-TEQs (r â‰¥ 0.969, P
