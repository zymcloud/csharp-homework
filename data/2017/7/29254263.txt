Background:The impact of sarcopenia on outcomes following treatment for primary liver tumors remains contentious. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical significance of sarcopenia in the treatment of patients with primary liver tumors.Data sources:A systematic literature search was performed in English through February 1, 2017 in databases.Results:There were significant differences between patients with and without sarcopenia in overall 1- and 3-year survival (1 year: OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.27-0.68; P=0.0004; 3 year: OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47-0.96; P=0.03). However, overall 5-year survival showed no significant difference between the groups (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.35-1.07; P=0.08). Patients with sarcopenia showed a significant 53% reduction in disease-free survival within 5 years (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.79; P=0.005). Also, sarcopenia had a significantly negative impact on recurrence in patients with primary liver tumors (RR: 2.71; 95% CI: 1.46-5.05; P=0.002). Regarding complications rate, we concluded that there was a statistically significant difference between two groups in overall complications rate (RR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.50-4.22; P=0.0005). However, the major complications rate showed no significant difference between the groups (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.65-2.20; P=0.57).Conclusions:Sarcopenia seemed to have a negative effect on overall survival in patients with primary liver tumors in the early phase post-treatment, but further research is needed to investigate the prognostic impact on overall survival over the longer term. Moreover, sarcopenia could significantly increase the incidence rates of post-treatment recurrence and overall complications in patients with primary liver tumors.
