Cirrhosis has many complications regardless of the aetiology. Complications include splenomegaly, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome and hepatocellular carcinoma and also linked to abnormalities in the endocrine system, including abnormal sex hormone metabolism, thyroid disease, osteoporosis, and, most recently identified, adrenal insufficiency. This prospective cohort study was done to evaluate the impact of adrenocortical insufficiency on clinical parameters in haemodynamically stable cirrhotic patients with ascites and had been performed at the inpatient of GHPD Department, BIRDEM, Dhaka, Bangladesh from April 2011 to March 2012. A total of fifty three (53) patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A (patients of normal adrenal function) and Group B (patients of insufficient adrenal function) and those were followed up for the next 6 months. In Group A, the total number of patients was 25(47%) and in Group B it was 28(53%). Between two groups, mean age difference and gender difference were not statistically significant (p value was 0.278 and 0.933, respectively). Group B patients had significant higher CLD duration (p=0.004). Haematemesis and/or maelena was significantly lower in Group B at follow up (p=0.0001) due to significant higher number of band ligation in this group (p=0.009). Hepatic encephalopathy was significantly higher in Group B at enrollment (p=0.028) and at follow up (p
