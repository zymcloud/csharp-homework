MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are a class of conserved non-coding endogenous small regulatory RNAs that regulate target gene expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of target mRNAs in a base-pairing manner, resulting in repression of transcription or degradation of target mRNAs. It has been demonstrated previously that the abnormal expression of miRNAs is involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of cervical cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression, biological functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-195 in cervical cancer. The reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the expression level of miR-195 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Following transfection, an MTT assay, cell migration and invasion assays, western blot analysis and a dual-luciferase reporter assay were performed in human cervical cancer cells. In the present study, it was identified that miR-195 was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Additionally, upregulation of miR-195 and knockdown of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase reporter assay identified that HDGF was a direct target gene of miR-195. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that miR-195 mimic inhibited HDGF expression at the mRNA and protein levels, whereas miR-195 inhibitor enhanced HDGF expression at the mRNA and protein levels. These results indicated that miR-195 targeted HDGF to inhibit the behavior of tumors in cervical cancer. These results also suggested that miR-195 was a potential therapeutic biomarker of cervical cancer.
