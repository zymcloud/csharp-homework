Tissues surrounding hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) lack glucose. Hepatocyte selection medium (HSM) is deficient in glucose and is supplemented with galactose. HCC cells were cultured in HSM to investigate the stem cell markers α-fetoprotein (AFP) and cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44). HCC cells (HLF and PLC/PRF/5 cells) were cultured in HSM. Viable cell numbers were determined on days 0 and 7 following culture in HSM. RNA was isolated and subjected to reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to analyze the mRNA expression levels of AFP and CD44. Immunostaining was performed to analyze the protein levels of AFP and CD44. The number of viable cells was significantly decreased on day 7 following culture in HSM. The expression levels of AFP and CD44 increased on day 7 as assessed using RT-qPCR. Immunostaining confirmed the results of RT-qPCR analysis. The number of viable HCC cells was decreased in HSM, whereas the expression levels of AFP and CD44 increased. Therefore, HSM is potentially useful for the enrichment of HCC cells with cancer stem cell characteristics.
