Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 170 million people worldwide and is the main cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the newly developed direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have transformed the treatment of HCV infection, controlling HCV infection on a global scale remains a challenge because of the high cost, low resistance barrier of DAAs and lack of HCV vaccine. The host immune responses associated with HCV infection, especially HCV-specific T cellular immunity, determine the outcome of HCV infection: either acute or chronic infection. It is important to fully interpret the immunopathogenesis of HCV infection and consequently to exploit effective strategies to eliminate HCV. Here, we review the current progress in HCV immunology, which will deepen our understanding of the spectrum of HCV infection and immunity in humans.
