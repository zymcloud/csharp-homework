The case of a 35-year old female patient with a diagnosis of metastatic mixed acinar-endocrine carcinoma (MAEC) is investigated in the present study. The patient was believed to have a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with a high Ki-67 index and uptake on 68Gallium-DOTATOC positron emission tomography-computed tomography for 9 years, and was treated accordingly. The patient had long lasting disease control by treatment with sunitinib, and a response was observed in numerous lesions with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Following treatment for metastatic disease for >4 years, liver transplantation was performed, as an exception to normal recommendations, at the time of progression of a centrally located liver lesion inducing obstructive jaundice. Following transplantation, the diagnosis of a Grade 3 NET, as defined by the WHO 2010 classification, was challenged and changed to MAEC. MAEC is a rare type of tumor of the pancreas, exhibiting endocrine and acinar differentiation. It is difficult to diagnose, often being misidentified as acinar cell carcinoma or predominantly as neuroendocrine neoplasms. Immunohistochemical labelling provides the only evidence for the dual differentiation of neuroendocrine (synaptophysin and chromogranin) and acinar (lipase, trypsin and chymotrypsin) cell markers. Studies investigating MAECs with a clear histopathological diagnosis are scarce, in addition to evidence of disease behaviour and treatment options. It is generally agreed that surgery is the primary treatment in patients with resectable tumors. The responses to sunitinib and PRRT suggested that treatments considered or developed for NETs may be beneficial in MAEC cases.
