This case-control study aimed to assess the interactive effect between polymorphisms of lymphotoxin (LT) α +252 and habitual substance use on risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We enrolled 150 pairs of sex- and age-matched HCC patients and unrelated healthy controls. LTα genotypes were detected with polymerase-chain reaction and restrictive fragment length polymorphisms. Information about habits of substance use was obtained through personal interview. Multivariate analysis indicated that LTα +252 G/G genotypes [odds ratio (OR) = 3.36], Hepatitis B surface antigen (OR = 16.68), antibodies to hepatitis C virus (OR = 34.88) and having at least two habits of substance use (OR = 2.50) were independent risk factors for HCC. There were additive interactions among LTα +252 G/G genotype, chronic viral hepatitis, and habit of each substance use.In conclusion:There are independent and additive interactions between LTα +252 G/G genotype, chronic viral hepatitis, and habits of substance use on risk of HCC.
