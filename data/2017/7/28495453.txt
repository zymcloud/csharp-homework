Purpose:To test the hypotheses that (i) heavier rats demonstrate improved survival with diminished fibrosis in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and (ii) transarterial embolization via femoral artery access decreases procedure times versus carotid access.Materials and methods:One hundred thirty-eight male Wistar rats ingested 0.01% DEN in water ad libitum for 12 weeks. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used for tumor surveillance. Rats underwent selective embolization of ≥ 5 mm tumors via carotid or femoral artery catheterization under fluoroscopic guidance. Rats were retrospectively categorized into 3 groups by initial weight ( 400 g) for analyses of survival, tumor latency, and fibrosis. Access site was compared relative to procedural success, mortality, and time.Results:No significant differences in tumor latency were related to weight group (P = .310). Rats weighing 400 g median, 1.0; P = .015). No significant difference was found in periprocedural mortality based on access site; however, procedure times were shorter via femoral approach (mean, 71 ± 23 vs 127 ± 24 min; P Conclusions:Greater initial body weight resulted in improved survival without prolonged tumor latency for rats with DEN-induced HCCs and was associated with less severe fibrosis. A femoral approach for embolization resulted in decreased procedure time. These modifications provide a translational animal model of HCC and transarterial embolization that may be suited for short-term survival studies.
