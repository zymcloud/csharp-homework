Liver cancer, primarily encompassing hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, has become the second leading cause of worldwide cancer-related death during the past two decades. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas (LELCs) are defined as tumors composed of undifferentiated epithelial cells with a prominent lymphoid infiltrate, and can arise in the liver as hepatocellular or cholangiocarcinoma forms. Patients with liver LELC display distinctive demographics and tumor characteristics. LELCs also appear to be associated with strikingly better outcomes compared to typical liver cancers, with 5-year survival rates of 57% to 100% versus 12% to 68%, respectively. Liver LELCs represent a unique model of immune response in liver cancer. Data on LELCs of the liver remain limited, and future comprehensive studies are needed to further elucidate this disease, which could ultimately offer precious insights for immunotherapeutic strategies in liver cancer.
