To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transarterial arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with gelatin sponge particles (GSPs-TACE) and Huaier granule to treat primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC).A series of 62 patients with PHC were included between June 2009 and December 2011, and randomly assigned to a control (n = 31) or an experimental group (n = 31). The control patients received TACE with 350 to 560 μm GSPs plus lobaplatin chemotherapy. Patients in the experimental group received TACE plus Huaier granule. Treatment safety and mid-to-long-term efficacy were evaluated.Follow-up ranged from 12 to 24 months with a mean of 28.7 months. The 6- and 12-month overall survivals were 100% and 93.5% in the experimental group and 90.3% and 80.6% in control group, respectively. The difference in overall survival at 12 months was significant (χ = 5.213, P .05). The number of TACE procedures in the experimental group (2.9 ± 8.7) and control group (4.1 ± 7.3) patients was significantly different (χ = 7.262, P
