Intracavitary cardiac extension remains an unusual site of extrahepatic metastasis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. While patients can present with signs and symptoms suggestive of right-sided heart failure, it may be totally asymptomatic, which is very rare with only a few cases reported so far. Also, cardiac metastasis is of great prognostic importance as patients with intracardiac metastasis can have an extremely poor prognosis. Here, we present the case of a 52-year-old male patient with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, with an incidentally found tumor thrombus extending from the inferior vena cava to the right atrium, protruding through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, on routine echocardiography. The patient did not have any signs or symptoms of heart involvement and unfortunately died on the 18th day of the hospital stay.
