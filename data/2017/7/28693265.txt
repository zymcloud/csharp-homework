Bladder cancer, the majority of which is urothelial carcinoma (UC), is a common malignancy worldwide. Genes encoding transmembrane/secretory proteins expressed specifically in certain cancers may be ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and may represent therapeutic targets. In the present study, the expression and function of the bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2) gene was analyzed in UC. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that expression of BST2 in normal tissue samples was the highest in liver tissue. However, expression of BST2 in UC tissue samples was higher than in normal liver. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed weak or no staining of BST-2 in non-neoplastic mucosa, whereas UC tissue exhibited stronger and more extensive staining compared with non-neoplastic mucosa. BST-2 staining was observed mainly on UC cell membranes. In total, 28 (41%) of 69 UC cases were positive for BST-2. UC cases positive for BST-2 were more frequently T2/3/4 cases [so-called muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)] than Ta/is/1 cases (P=0.0001). However, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated no association between BST-2 expression and survival. BST2 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected T24 cells exhibited significantly reduced cell growth relative to negative control siRNA-transfected T24 cells. The levels of phosphorylated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were lower in BST2 siRNA-transfected T24 cells than in control cells. These results suggest the involvement of BST-2 in the pathogenesis of UC. Since BST-2 is expressed on the cell membrane, BST-2 may be a good therapeutic target for MIBC.
