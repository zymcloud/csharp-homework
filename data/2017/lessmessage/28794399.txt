Differentiated embryonic chondrocyte (DEC) 1 has been reported to be involved in cell differentiation, hypoxia response, and cancer progression. Recent studies have demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in carcinoma cells to facilitate cell invasiveness and metastasis. However, it remains unclear whether DEC1 participates in hypoxia-mediated EMT processes. In the present study, we reported that hypoxia induced DEC1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cells, and DEC1 negatively regulated expression of HIF-1α and E-cadherin in transcriptional/translational levels. Cell morphological changes were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) staining. Exposure to hypoxia caused spindle-like shape in some of the HepG2 cells, and DEC1 overexpression furthered these changes. In conclusions, DEC1 is involved in hypoxia-induced EMT processes via negatively regulating E-cadherin expression in HepG2 cells.
