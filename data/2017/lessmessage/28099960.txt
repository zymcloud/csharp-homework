Background:Hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now established as the treatment most likely to yield the best outcome. We aimed to clarify the risk factors for HCC recurrence after curative resection of single HCC in patients with normal liver function (NLF).Methods:The clinical records of 105 patients with NFL and a single HCC less than 5 cm in diameter who had undergone curative liver resection between April 2000 and January 2013 were investigated. We analyzed risk factors for recurrence of HCC.Results:Forty of the 105 patients suffered recurrence of HCC, and median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 22.0 (5.1-148.5) months after surgery, and the liver was the most frequent site of recurrence. Univariate analysis showed that limited resection (LR; p = 0.002), the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (p = 0.023), C-reactive protein value (p = 0.001), bilirubin value (p = 0.042), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.042), operation time (p = 0.018), and amount of bleeding (p = 0.011) were associated with RFS. Multivariate analysis showed that LR (p = 0.007) was a significant risk factor associated with RFS.Conclusion:LR is a risk factor for HCC recurrence in patients with single-lesion HCC and NLF.
