Objective:The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of dual phase cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in detecting small (Materials and methods:Twenty-two consecutive patients with unresectable small HCCs in whom TACE was performed were retrospectively evaluated. Contrast CT or contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in all patients within 1 month prior to the procedure. Dual phase CBCT was performed prior to TACE and lipiodol-CBCT was performed after treatment. The sensitivity of dual phase CBCT in detecting small HCCs was compared to hepatic angiography, contrast enhanced CT and MRI.Results:Seventy HCC tumors with sizes of P Conclusions:Dual phase CBCT is significantly more sensitive than hepatic angiography, contrast enhanced CT, and MRI in detecting smaller than 3 cm HCC tumors and can be a helpful modality in making accurate planning for treatment of HCC.
