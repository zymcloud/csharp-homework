Background/aims:Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a member of the activating transcription factor family which regulates the expression of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, redox homeostasis and ER stress responses. ATF4 is also over-expressed in human solid tumors, although its effect on responsiveness to radiation is largely unexplored.Methods:Real-time PCR was used to detect ATF4 mRNA levels in cells treated with different doses of 60CoÎ³ radiation. Cell viability was assayed using a cell counting kit. The cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry, and cell apoptosis was assayed using Annexin V-PI double labeling. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against ATF4 was transfected into ECV304 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. An ATF4 over-expression plasmid (p-ATF4-CGN) was transfected into HEK293 cells that endogenously expressed low levels of ATF4. The levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using CM-H2DCFDA as a probe.Results:ATF4 mRNA and protein expression levels were higher after radiation and increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in AHH1 lymphoblast cells (P Conclusions:In this study, we found that radiation up-regulated the expression of ATF4. We used ATF4 knockdown and over-expression systems to show that ATF4 may play a role in radiation-induced cellular apoptosis.
