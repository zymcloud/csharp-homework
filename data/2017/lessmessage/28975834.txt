Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor that often arises in the setting of liver cirrhosis. Although early-stage disease is often amenable for surgical resection, transplant, or locoregional therapies, many patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage or have poor liver reserve. Systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for these patients. At present, the only approved therapy for the treatment of advanced disease is the tyrosine multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. Candidacy for treatment is based on liver reserve. Novel agents for the treatment of this disease are urgently needed. In this article, we review systemic therapy trials and upcoming data for the treatment of HCC.
