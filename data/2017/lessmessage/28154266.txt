Objective Oxidative stress is associated with the progression of chronic liver disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is also an oxidative stress-related disease. However, the oxidative/anti-oxidative balance has not been fully characterized in NAFLD. The objective of the present study was to investigate the balance between oxidative stress and the anti-oxidative activity in NAFLD, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients We recruited 69 patients with histologically proven NAFLD without HCC (NAFLD; n=58), and with NASH-related HCC (NASH-HCC; n=11). The 58 NAFLD patients included patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL; n=14) and NASH (n=44). Methods The serum levels of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) and anti-oxidative markers (OXY) were determined and then used to calculate the oxidative index. The correlations among such factors as ROM, OXY, oxidative index, and clinical characteristics were investigated. Results In NAFLD, ROM positively correlated with the body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the histological grade or inflammatory scores, while only high HbA1c and CRP levels were significant factors that correlated with a higher ROM according to a multivariate analysis. OXY positively correlated with the platelet counts, albumin, and creatinine levels, while negatively correlating with age. However, it improved after treatment intervention. The oxidative index positively correlated with BMI, CRP, and HbA1c. The NASH-HCC patients exhibited a lower OXY than the NASH patients, probably due to the effects of aging. Conclusion Oxidative stress correlated with the levels of NASH activity markers, while the anti-oxidative function was preserved in younger patients as well as in patients with a well-preserved liver function. The NASH-HCC patients tended to be older and exhibited a diminished anti-oxidative function.
