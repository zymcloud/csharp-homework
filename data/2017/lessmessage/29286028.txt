Aim:To present own experience of surgical treatment of isolated pancreatic metastases of renal cell carcinoma.Material and methods:There are 3 cases of pancreatic metastases of renal cell carcinoma. They were diagnosed in women aged 55, 66 and 67 years in 9, 11 and 23 years after nephrectomy respectively.Results:The tumors were placed in head (60 mm), body (10 and 5 mm) and tail (30 mm) of the pancreas. There were 2 distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and 1 pancreatoduodenectomy. All patients are alive within 39, 49 and 8 months after surgery respectively. One woman has been diagnosed pulmonary metastases after 19 months. 20-month sunitinib administration contributes to regression of the disease. There was no recurrent disease in other two patients.Conclusion:Isolated pancreatic metastases of renal cell carcinoma can occur in decades after nephrectomy. Therefore, lifelong follow-up is necessary. Pancreatectomy for focal lesion is associated with good long-term outcome.
