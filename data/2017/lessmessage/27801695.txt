Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of lesion-oriented whole-liver computed tomography (CT) perfusion for predicting transarterial chemoembolization early treatment response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Volume helical shuttle CT perfusion imaging on the whole liver was prospectively performed on 39 patients with 46 independent HCC lesions before target-selected chemoembolization. The therapeutic effects were assessed: responder group included lesions with a complete and partial response, whereas the nonresponder group contained stable and progressive disease. The perfusion parameter value comparison between 2 groups and receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed.Results:The responders demonstrated higher hepatic arterial perfusion (HAP) and hepatic arterial perfusion index (HAPI) and lower hepatic portal perfusion (HPP) compared with the nonresponders among the 34 lesions without Vp3 or Vp4 portal vein thrombosis. In addition, HAP and HAPI had good prognostic values.Conclusions:Whole-liver CT perfusion allows for hemodynamic evaluation of HCC lesions. The HAP, HAPI, and hepatic portal perfusion values may be useful predictors of short-term therapeutic response after transarterial chemoembolization.
