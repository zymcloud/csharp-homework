Introduction:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an established cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poor prognosis. High HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) load has been identified in HCC and hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients.Materials and methods:This study was done in the Department of Hepatology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2006 to December 2007. Thirty patients with HBV infection-related HCC were enrolled. Another 30 patients with HBV-related liver diseases without HCC were analyzed as controls.Results:The HCC patients had a high viral load (>105 copies/mL), while all of the controls had low (<105 copies/mL) viral load.Conclusion:It seems that patients with HCC bear high HBV DNA loads in Bangladesh, but the causes underlying this remain to be resolved.How to cite this article: Hussain MM, Al Mahtab M, Islam S, Ahmed N, Rahman S, Khan M.
