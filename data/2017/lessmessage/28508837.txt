Introduction:Bone metastasis is a rare site of metastasis, seen in only 3.7-11% of clinical cases. Isolated bone involvement has been reported very rarely in literature. Moreover, the patients who have bone metastasis at presentation are even rare.Objectives:To discuss the demographic characteristics, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, pattern of bone involvement, and their correlation with survival in patients of colorectal cancer that have bone metastasis at the time of presentation.Materials and methods:Retrospectively, tumor registry was analyzed for the cases of colorectal cancer presenting with bone metastasis between 2008 and 2013. Survival curves were generated by Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test.Results:Ten such patients were identified (male:female = 7:3) of the total 410 patients. Median age was 41 years (22-50 years). All patients were Conclusions: In this study, the patients of colorectal cancer presenting with bone metastasis were of male sex and younger age. The factors that were associated with reduced survival were extraosseous and liver involvement.
