Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is well established in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma and of metastatic disease from colorectal and neuroendocrine tumours. There are few published studies on the effectiveness of treating hepatic metastases from medullary thyroid carcinoma with chemoembolisation and none to our knowledge utilising bland particle transarterial embolisation (TAE). Here we describe the management of multifocal hepatic metastases from medullary thyroid cancer in a 39-year-old woman who underwent bland particle TAE with a biochemical and radiological response and discuss the potential for a wider scope of clinical application for bland TAE in hepatic metastases.
