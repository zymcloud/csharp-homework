Background:The novel water-soluble inclusion complex of Brucea javanica oil (BJO) by β-cyclodextrin polymers (CDP) was prepared by saturated aqueous method and characterized by SEM, FT-IR and 1H NMR. Compared with BJO, the aqueous solubility of BJO-CDP (77.76%) greatly enhanced due to the water-soluble CDP host.Results:In the acute toxicity test, the value of LD50 of BJO-CDP was 11.94 g/kg, suggesting the lower toxicity of BJO-CDP. Moreover, the pharmacodynamics of BJO-CDP was investigated by evaluating its inhibition effects on human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells and mice transplantable colon cancer CT- 26 cells.Conclusion:It has been revealed that BJO-CDP significantly decreased the toxicity of BJO and enhanced its anti-tumor activity. In conclusion, BJO-CDP could be a new and improved clinical formulation of BJO with higher water solubility, lower toxicity and enhanced anti-tumor activity.
