Introduction:Recently, the treatment of chronic hepatitis C has markedly advanced. A phase III clinical study of combination therapy with sofosbuvir (SOF) and ledipasvir (LDV) was conducted in Japan, and the additive therapeutic effects were reported. In this study, we report the results of treatment in our hospital.Methods:Of 147 patients with chronic type C liver disease who had consulted our hospital since September 2015 and received SOF/LDV therapy, in 91 subjects a sustained virological response of 12 weeks (SVR12) could be evaluated.Results:In all 91 patients, end treatment response was achieved. Subsequently, recrudescence was noted in 1 before the completion of treatment (week 12); an SVR12 was achieved in 90 patients (99%). The following adverse reactions were observed in 3 patients (3.3%): bradycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with QT prolongation, which were associated with heart disease.Conclusion:A favorable SVR was achieved by SOF/LDV therapy even in elderly patients, those with liver cirrhosis, or those having undergone radical treatment of liver cancer. Furthermore, a high tolerance was demonstrated, but adverse reactions associated with the heart may appear in patients with heart disease as an underlying disease; strict management during treatment is necessary.
