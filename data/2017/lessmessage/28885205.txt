Purpose:To determine the influence of pre-interventionally existing portal vein thrombosis on the ablation success of percutaneous tumor ablation of HCC.Materials and methods:15 patients with HCC and pre-existing portal vein thrombosis underwent thermal tumor ablation. We retrospectively analyzed the pre- and post-interventionally performed CT and MRI scans in terms of technical success as well as the complication rate. The portal vein thrombosis was classified into segmental, lobar and central thrombus.Results:In 13/15 cases (87%) complete ablation with no evidence of residual tumor tissue was seen 6 weeks after the procedure in contrast-enhanced MRI scans and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). No major and 2 minor complications were observed after the ablation procedure.Conclusion:Reduced perfusion due to pre-interventionally existing portal vein thrombosis has no significant impact on the ablation success or the complication rate.
