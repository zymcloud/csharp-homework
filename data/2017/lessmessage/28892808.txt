Purpose:The aim of this study was to compare the short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted resection for right posterior segment (LAR-RPS) with open resection (OR-RPS) performed by experienced hepatobiliary surgeons.Methods:This was a prospective comparative nonrandomized study.Results:The groups were comparable in terms of baseline demographics and clinicopathological data. Reduced operative time (254.88 ± 78.56 vs. 347.95 ± 82.56 min; p = 0.04) and estimated blood loss (477 ± 756 vs. 712 ± 836 mL; p = 0.03) were observed in LAR-RPS. Also, signiﬁcant less duration of hospital stay (7.53 ± 2.68 vs. 12.57 ± 3.21 days; p Conclusions:This study confirms that laparoscopic-assisted resection is a safe and effective operative procedure in those cirrhotic patients with a lesion in the right posterior section of the liver. When compared to the open approach, the laparoscopic-assisted approach reduces operative time and blood loss, as well as the length of hospital stay.
