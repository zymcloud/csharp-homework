Background:The purpose of the study to evaluate possibilities of CT-perfusion and PET methods with 18F-FDG and 18F-fluorocholine in the complex diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The study included the results of PET/CT with 18F-FDG, 18F-FCh and CT-perfusion of the liver in 18 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Depending on the degree of tumor differentiation, all patients were divided into 3 groups - patients with highly differentiated (6 patients), moderately differentiated (4 patients), and low-differentiated HCC (8 patients).Results:Average values of maxSUV in the group of patients with highly differentiated HCC in PET/CT with 18F-FDG and 18F- fluorocholine in a solid component of tumor reached 3.51 and 18.24, respectively; in patients with moderately differentiated HCC - 3.91 and 12.32, respectively; in patients with low-differentiated HCC - 9.58 and 9.70, respectively. Average values of CT perfusion imaging in a solid component of the tumor in the group of patients with highly differentiated HCC were the following: BF - 55,33 ml/100 ml/min, BV - 13,71 ml/100 ml, ALP - 52,41 ml/100 ml/min, PVP - 10.81 ml/100 ml/min (p ≤ 0,05), in the group of patients with moderately differentiated HCC: BF - 52,78 ml/100 m /min, BV - 12,23 ml/100 ml, ALP - 47,26 ml/100 ml/min, PVP - 9,10 ml/100 ml/min (p ≤ 0.05), in the solid component of low-differentiated HCC: BF - 46,96 ml/100 ml/min, BV - 9,49 ml/100 ml, ALP - 40.54 ml/100 ml/min, PVP - 7,66 ml/100 ml/min (p ≤ 0,05).Conclusions:The diagnostic capabilities of the complex of PET/CT techniques with 18F-FDG and 18F-FCh and CT perfusion in a single-scan mode for hepatocellular carcinoma were evaluated for the first time. The obtained data allow to assume that the integrated use of PET with 18F-FDG and 18F-FCh and CT perfusion in a single scan improves the differential diagnostic possibilities of PET/CT diagnostics, which can find application in planning and prognosis of the disease. Due to the small number of patients further study of the problem is required.
