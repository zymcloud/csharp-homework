Background & aims:To investigate the expression and prognostic value of α1-ACT (Alpha1-antichymotrypsin) in patients with HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and identify the mechanism by which α1-ACT inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of HCC.Methods:We first measured α1-ACT expression levels and determined their relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with HCC.We then established stable HCC cell lines with both α1-ACT overexpression and knockdown and performed a functional analysis in vitro.We first examined the relationship between α1-ACT and the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway using Western blotting. Then, we determined whether α1-ACT can directly bind to PTEN using co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, we measured α1-ACT expression to evaluate its correlation with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-related apoptosis proteins in a xenograft tumour mouse model using immunohistochemistry.Results:The α1-ACT expression level was significantly lower in the HCC tissues than in the paratumour tissues and was negatively positively correlated with the level of Ki67, AFP, the AJCC stage, tumour size and tumour invasion. The overexpression of α1-ACT can inhibit cell proliferation and increase cell apoptosis by activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated apoptosis via binding to PTEN and activating it in vitro. Additionally, the overexpression of α1-ACT can also increase the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 stage by increasing cyclin p21 expression and inhibiting the migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells by regulating MMP2 and MMP9. The xenotransplantation studies with nude mice also showed that overexpression of α1-ACT inhibited tumourigenesis and knockdown of α1-ACT had the opposite effect.Conclusions:Our study demonstrates that α1-ACT suppresses liver cancer development and metastasis via targeting the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, which may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in HCC.
