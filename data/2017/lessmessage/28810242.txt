Objective:To verify that miR-490-5p could influence hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells' proliferation, invasion, cycle, and apoptosis by targeting BUB1.Methods:Quantitative real time-PCR (QRT-PCR) was used to determine the miR-490-5p expression. Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were employed to detect BUB1 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ/Smad) signaling-related proteins expression in hepatic tissues and cells. The luciferase assay was used to confirm the targeting relationship between miR-490-5p and BUB1. The Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Transwell invasion, scratch healing assays, and flow cytometry analysis were conducted to evaluate HCC cells proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis alteration after transfection.Results:In HCC tissues and cells, lower expression of miR-490-5p was detected, while BUB1 was overexpressed than controls. The upregulation of miR-490-5p inhibited BUB1 expression and the overexpression of miR-490-5p or the under-expression of BUB1 inhibited HCC cells proliferation, migration, invasion, and increased the apoptosis rate.Conclusion:MiR-490-5p could regulate TGFβ/Smad signaling pathways by inhibiting BUB1, which could then inhibit HCC cells proliferation, invasion, and migration as well as decrease cell viability and increase apoptosis.
