Introduction:Both fine needle aspiration (FNA) and needle core biopsy (NCB) are widely accepted methods for obtaining diagnostic material. There is variability in how different institutions use these techniques in assessing liver masses. The aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy and tissue quality between FNA and NCB, and create a cost-effective algorithm for evaluating liver masses.Materials and methods:A database search was performed to detect all liver FNA cases and their corresponding NCB between January 2014 and August 2016. A retrospective chart review was performed to gather pertinent clinicopathologic information.Results:Seventy-seven FNA and 68 corresponding NCB were reviewed from 74 patients. Diagnoses in the 74 patients included 36 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), 29 metastatic malignancies (MET), 5 poorly differentiated carcinomas (PDC), 2 cholangiocarcinomas (CHO), and 2 benign lesions (BEN). More immunohistochemical (IHC) studies (P Conclusions:For HCC, NCB usually has better tissue quality and diagnostic accuracy than FNA; for metastatic lesions in the liver, FNA has better diagnostic accuracy than NCB, although NCB can provide more tissue for ancillary testing and has better diagnostic quality. Appropriate diagnostic method is important for improving diagnostic accuracy and saving medical resources.
