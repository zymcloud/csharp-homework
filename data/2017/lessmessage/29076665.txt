Background:The objective behind this study was to determine that Assessment for Retreatment with Transarterial chemoembolization (ART) score is really applicable in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A cross sectional observational study was conducted on all patients with hepatocellular carcinoma of intermediate stage and undergone ≥2 Transarterial chemoembolization. ART score was assessed before and after each session of Transarterial chemoembolization. Multi-logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the final outcome of patients with ART score of ≥2.5 into groups with two and more than two Trans-arterial chemo-embolization sessions.Results:A total of 100 HCC patients were recruited for final analysis. Our study participants consisted of total 100 HCC patients. Mean Child Pugh score was 6.1±0.95. In our study, most of the study participants (n=63) had ART score of less than 1.5 as compared to ART score >2.5 (n=37). A significant proportion of patients with ART score of 2.5, p-valueConclusions:Our study findings suggest that those HCC patients who receive multiple sessions of TACE with a low ART score have more favourable outcomes with increased survival rate.
