Purpose:CT during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides valid information in performing transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE). The usefulness of CTHA with the diluted contrast medium has been reported in some medical conferences. However, the operation becomes somehow complicated for the medical institutions that have angiography injectors with a single head. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical equivalence of low-rate injection method and diluted injection method.Methods:The relationship between the injection rate and transit time of contrast medium was tested. Then, we measured the signal values of CBCT and CT values both in varying injection rates and in the case of doubling dilution.Results:The transit time of contrast medium became delayed with decreasing injection rate. The signal values of CBCT in the case of doubling dilution showed almost the same as those at a half of injection rate without dilution. We also obtained the same finding from the comparative investigation of CT values. ROC analysis of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and CBCT was carried out, and the area under the curve (AUC) of CBCT showed a significantly higher value.Conclusion:It is suggested that CTHA with low-rate injection method offers diagnostic image similar in some degree to the diluted injection method.
