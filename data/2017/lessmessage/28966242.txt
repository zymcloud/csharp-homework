Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death. Due to treatments failures from drug resistance and cancer metastasis, discovering more effective treatments is imperative. As an angiogenesis inhibitor extracted from the Chinese herb-Safflower, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) inhibits the tumor growth in H22-bearing mice. Poorly differentiated hepatoma cells showed the ability to invade and metastasize, which are dependent on the angiogenesis. Accordingly, we hypothesized that HSYA could inhibit the metastasis of liver cancer cells. We investigated the metastasizing potential of human hepatic carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells treated with HSYA. A pulmonary metastatic model of mouse hepatoma H22 cells was established to evaluate the effect and possible mechanism of HSYA on lung metastasis from liver cancer. The results showed that HSYA inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of SMMC-7721 cells and reduced its adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). In H22 mice treated with HSYA, the formation of E-cadherin/β-catenin complex resulted in the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2. As a result, the degradation of ECM was reduced and epithelial-mesenchymal transition was prevented. The present findings indicate that HSYA can prevent pulmonary metastasis in liver cancer, which provides strong evidence for the application of HSYA in treatments.
