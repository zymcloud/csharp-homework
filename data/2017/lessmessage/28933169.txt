Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the worlds major causes of chronic liver disease. Care of patients infected with HBV and HCV and/or over the last 20 years has significantly improved thanks to the better understanding of the pathophysiology of disease, improvement of diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive options. The goal of treatment of chronic hepatitis B is to extend the length of life and improve its quality through the barriers of the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis, decompensation cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic HBV infection can by currently treated either with tenofovir or entecavir orally (absolute majority of cases), and that in the long-term (years), or even for life-long therapy, or with pegylated interferon Î±-2a, which is given by injection once a week for 48 weeks (limited possibility of use). The primary goal of chronic hepatitis C treatment is to cure the infection, by achieving a sustained virological response defined as undetectable virus nucleic acid (HCV RNA) in peripheral blood 12 or 24 weeks after the end of therapy. At present, IFN-free regimens become the standard of chronic HCV therapy with the efficiency of 95-100 % and with minimum of side effects and contraindications.Key words: chronic hepatitis B - chronic hepatitis C - IFN-free therapy.
