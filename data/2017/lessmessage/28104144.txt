Our aim was to describe the clinical indications, surgical technique, and clinical outcomes of a pancreas transplantation, performed 4 years after liver transplantation, as treatment for new-onset, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus in a 53-year-old man. Liver transplantation was performed for end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis B virus infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient had no history of diabetes prior to the liver transplantation. The decision to proceed with a pancreas transplantation was made when the patient's blood sugar levels could not be normalized despite insulin doses >100 IU/d. A modified cadaveric transplantation technique was used, with the recipient's inferior vena cava dissected for anastomosis with the portal vein of the graft, using a diamond-shaped patch procedure. Moreover, the right common iliac artery was anastomosed with a Y-graft in the pancreas graft, and the duodenum remnant of the graft was anastomosed to the recipient's duodenum using a side-to-side procedure. The 6-month postoperative follow-up included repeated endoscopic biopsy of the graft duodenum, with no evidence of thrombosis or rejection of the graft, with glucose level within normal limits without requirement for diabetic drugs. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pancreas transplantation after liver transplantation.
