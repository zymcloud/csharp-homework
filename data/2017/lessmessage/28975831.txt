The role of external beam radiation therapy for primary liver malignancies has historically been limited due to the risk of radiation-induced liver disease. However, with the advent of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), we are able to dose escalate while safely sparing critical nearby structures. This review explores the evidence surrounding the use of SBRT for the treatment of primary liver malignancies. A review of the literature was performed. This article discusses the challenges, efficacy, and safety of SBRT for primary liver malignancies in order to conceptualize its role within a multidisciplinary framework. Prospective phase I and II trials show local control rates at 1 to 2 years ranging from 65% to 100%. Overall survival at 1 to 2 years ranged from 48% to 77%. Grade >3 toxicity ranged from 0% to 36%. Total radiotherapy doses ranged from 24 to 60 Gy delivered in 1 to 6 fractions. The SBRT offers a noninvasive therapy for patients with limited treatment options and should be considered in a multidisciplinary setting for the management of unresectable, locally advanced primary liver malignancies. Prospective randomized trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of SBRT compared to and in combination with other treatment modalities.
