Background:Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in a wide range of pathophysiological processes, including cancer progression. Our previous study has shown that AFAP1-AS1 was upregulated and acted as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the expression and biological functions of lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains largely unknown.Methods:The expression level of AFAP1-AS1 was measured in 56 pairs of human cholangiocarcinoma tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent normal bile duct tissues. The correlation between AFAP1-AS1 and the clinicopathological features were evaluated by chi-square test. The effects of AFAP1-AS1 on CCA cells were determined by CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay. Finally, to determine the effect of AFAP1-AS1 on tumor growth in vivo, AFAP1-AS1 knockdowned CCLP-1 cells were subcutaneously into nude mice to evaluate tumor growth.Results:In this study, we found that lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 was increased in CCA tissues and patients with high AFAP1-AS1 expression had a shorter overall survival. SiRNA-mediated AFAP1-AS1 knockdown significantly decreased cell proliferation of the CCA cells, with downregulation of C-myc and Cycling D1 in vitro. Furthermore, AFAP1-AS1 silencing inhibited cell migration partly due to decrease the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. In addition, CCLP-1 cells with AFAP1-AS1 knockdown were injected into nude mice to investigate the effect of AFAP1-AS1 on the tumorigenesis in vivo.Conclusions:Taken together, our findings suggested that AFAP1-AS1 might promote the CCA progression and provided a novel potential therapeutic target for CCA.
