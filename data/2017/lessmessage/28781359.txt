We report a rare case of colonic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with rapid growth. A 75-year-old man underwent laparoscopic partial resection of segment three of the liver for primary hepatocellular carcinoma, but was referred to our hospital with right flank pain seven months after the operation. Computed tomography revealed a high-density tumor in the transverse colon measuring 6cm in diameter that not evident by colonoscopy. After one month, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the tumor had grown to 8cm in diameter, and we performed partial resection of the transverse colon. Macroscopically, the tumor comprised necrotic tissue and an old blood clot in the submucosal layer of the transverse colon. Histopathologically, the tumor was determined to be a hematogenous metastasis from the hepatocellular carcinoma, with evidence of necrosis and hemorrhage.
