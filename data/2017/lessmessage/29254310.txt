The aim of this study was to investigate the value of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging and T1 mapping sequence in the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 45 patients with HCC who were to undergo a resection were enrolled in this study. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance examination was performed prior to resection. T1 mapping was performed before and 20 min after injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA. T1 values of the lesions were measured on pre-contrast (T1p) and during HBP (T1-HBP) on T1 maps. The signal intensity, the diameter and the margin of HCC lesions on HBP images were analyzed. The reduction in T1 value (T1d) and the reduction rate (ΔT1%) of T1 mapping between pre-contrast and HBP were calculated. The Edmondson-Steiner classification of each lesion was made after surgery. The SPSS software package was used for statistical analysis and the analysis of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were carried out by using MedCalc software package. Mean values of T1p and T1-HBP were 1935.4±730.8 ms and 1257.1±529.1 ms, respectively. T1p accuracy (AUC = 0.685, p = 0.037) in predicting pathological grading was similar to that of T1-HBP (AUC = 0.751, p = 0.005). A T1p of 1648.2 ms or greater had a sensitivity and specificity of 85.19% and 61.11%, respectively. A T1-HBP of 1006 ms or greater had a sensitivity and specificity of 81.84% and 61.11%, respectively. The number of HCCs with a non-smooth tumor margin was 20 (44.4%), and a non-smooth tumor margin correlated moderately with the Edmondson-Steiner grade (Spearman r = 0.491, p = 0.041). There was no significant correlation between T1d, ΔT1%, HCC signal intensity on HBP image and lesion diameter with pathologic grading. T1 mapping in pre-contrast and HBP of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, a non-smooth tumor margin in the HBP of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, are useful in predicting the pathologic grading of HCC.
