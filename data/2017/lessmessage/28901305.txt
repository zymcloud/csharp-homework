Aims:The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with arterioportal shunts (APS).Subjects and methods:From January 2008 to June 2014, 36 cases of HCC with APS were treated by TACE with NBCA. NBCA-lipiodol mixture was superselective delivered before routine TACE in HCC patients with APS. Recanalization of shunt, objective response, clinical adverse events, and survival rates was retrospectively studied.Results:All interventional procedures were successful without any procedure relevant complications. The immediate APS improvement rate was 83.3% (30/36), and the APS improvement rate at first-time follow-up was 66.6% (20/30). Radiologically confirmed complete response (CR), partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease at 1 month after first chemoembolization were observed in 1 (2.7%), 19 (52.8%), 6 (16.7%), and 10 (27.8%) patients, respectively. Survival rates were 91.7% at 6 months, 47.2% at 1 year, and 13.9% at 2 years. The median survival time was 11 months. No severe adverse effects were noted.Conclusions:The preliminary experience indicates TACE with NBCA can be safely performed and may improve prognosis of HCC with arterioportal shunt.
