Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) after curative hepatectomy in improving the survival of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized or nonrandomized studies comparing postoperative adjuvant TACE with curative resection alone. Meta-analysis was performed after converting time-event data into a hazard ratio (HR), using an inverse diversity model.Results:Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 12 retrospective studies matched the selection criteria, thereby including 3191 patients (779 in RCT, 2412 in observational studies) for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that receiving adjuvant TACE was associated with improved overall survival (OS, ln[HR] = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.63-0.78, p Conclusions:This meta-analysis demonstrated that postoperative adjuvant TACE could achieve higher OS and RFS than surgical resection alone. However, these results need to be validated through further high-quality clinical studies.
