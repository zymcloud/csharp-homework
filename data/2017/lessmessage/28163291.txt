A 35-year-old woman, who was an HBV carrier, complained of fever for 2 weeks, and thus, she was admitted in our hospital. Both serum AFP and PIVKA-II levels were abnormally high, and an abdominal enhanced CT revealed the presence of multiple masses in both lobes of the liver. She was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (T4, N0, M0, and Vp4) and was treated with transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy. On the 4th day of her illness, her serum glucose level was 26mg/dl. Glucose infusion and intravenous hyperalimentation were not effective, and she experienced repeated hypoglycemic attacks. Based on the low levels of both insulin (0.4Î¼U/ml) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I (14ng/ml), we made a diagnosis of non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was orally administered prednisolone at a dose of 20mg/day. On the 49th day of illness, the hepatocellular carcinoma ruptured, and 2 days later, she died because of hemorrhage shock. Postmortem immunohistochemical staining for IGF-II was positive in the tumor cells of the liver. Furthermore, Western immunoblotting revealed the presence of high-molecular-weight form of IGF-II in the serum of the patient.
