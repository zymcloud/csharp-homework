A 53-year-old male patient with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma developed gastroesophageal varices refractory to endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS). He required EIS six times in 2 years for recurring variceal bleeding. After hepatic resection, he developed massive splenomegaly. Partial splenic embolization (PSE) was performed to reduce the portal pressure. Varices and variceal bleeding were not detected during 13-year follow up, until the patient died of hepatocellular carcinoma. This is a unique case of gastroesophageal varices controlled by PSE and improved portal hypertension.
gastroesophageal varices; partial splenic embolization.
