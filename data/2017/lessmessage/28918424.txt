Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasingly prevalent in people living with HIV. Systemic inflammation is a prognostic factor requiring validation in HIV-associated HCC.Aims:Using a multi-centre database of consecutive HCC cases, we investigated the prognostic role of a panel of inflammatory markers, including neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), using univariate and multivariate survival analyses.Results:Fifty-nine patients with HIV-associated HCC secondary to hepatitis C (69%) or B virus infection (32%) were identified. The median survival was 22 months. A raised NLR independently predicted patients' survival and was correlated with advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (p = 0.003) and poor performance status (p Conclusion:Systemic inflammation, as measured by NLR, is a prognostic determinant associated with adverse pathological features of malignancy, but not coexisting HIV infection, suggesting a tumour-promoting role of the innate immune response that warrants further investigation in mechanistic studies.
