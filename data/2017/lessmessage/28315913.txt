Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of dual-time-point 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with semiquantitative analyses for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Subjects and methods:The 150 patients with clinically suspected liver malignancies underwent dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was calculated at both time points of PET imaging. The change in SUVmax (retention index, RI) was defined as the ratio of increase in SUVmax between the early and delayed scans to the SUVmax in the early scan. The tumor-to-normal liver tissue (T/N) ratio of the early and delayed scan was also calculated. The final diagnoses were confirmed by histopathology. A hundred and twenty four patients had HCC, 4 with grade I, 64 with grade II, 55 with grade III and 1 with grade IV. Twenty six patients had benign liver diseases.Results:There were significant differences in the SUVmax and T/N between the early scan and the delayed scan in the HCC Group (t=4.23, PConclusion:Dual-time- point 18F-FDG PET/CT scan with semiquantitative analysis of SUVmax and T/N ratio may support the diagnosis of HCC and that of a higher grade HCC.
