Aims:Several studies have shown altered levels of plasma anti-CD25 antibodies in patients with malignancy in lung, esophagus and breast. The present study was thus designed to test whether circulating anti-CD25 antibody levels were changed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed in-house to detect plasma IgG antibodies to CD25-derived linear peptide antigens in 122 patients with HCC and 121 control subjects.Results:Student's t-test showed that plasma anti-CD25 IgG levels were significantly higher in HCC patients than control subjects (t = 4.96, P Conclusions:The present study suggests that circulating anti-CD25 IgG antibodies may have prognostic rather than early diagnostic values for HCC.
