Background:Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC-1) In human was originally isolated from rats brain and was often found to be deleted in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We undertook a structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature using a focused review question and inclusion/exclusion criteria.Results:Subsequent studies have demonstrated that DLC-1 is generally expressed in normal human tissues as well as in rats, while it always exists inactivated or even lost in many human cancers, which characterizes DLC-1 as a potential tumor suppressor. Additionally, the RhoGAP (Rho-GTPase activating proteins) activity was found to play a pivotal role in regulating DLC-1.Conclusion:Although emerging studies in a variety of cancers have identified DLC-1 and its downstream signaling molecules as potential therapeutic targets for treatments of DLC-1-related cancers, the mechanisms linked to DLC-1 remain undefined.
