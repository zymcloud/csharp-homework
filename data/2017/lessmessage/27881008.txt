Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for the unrestrained cell growth and chemo-resistance of malignant tumors. Reports about miR-33a in different type of cancer are limited, and it remains elusive whether there is a link between miR-33a and chemo-resistance of CSCs. Here we report that Lgr5+ hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells from primary tissues and cell lines behave similarly to CSCs and are chemo-resistant to doxorubicin. Significantly, reduced miR-33a expression is associated with the chemo-resistance of Lgr5+ HCC-CSCs, accompanied by an overexpression of ABCA1 which is identiÔ¨Åed as target of miR-33a by mainly using miRNA luciferase assay and western-blotting. We demonstrate that down-regulation of miR-33a expression directly contributes to chemo-resistance of Lgr5+ HCC-CSCs, and restoring miR-33a expression sensitizes them to doxorubicin via apoptosis by mainly using TUNEL assay, soft agar colony formation assay and xenograft assay. Additionally, reduced miR-33a expression in HCC tissues is associated with chemo-response and poor patient survival, which suggests the therapeutic potential of miR-33a. In conclusion, our work indicates that ectopic miR-33a expression sensitizes Lgr5+ HCC-CSCs to doxorubicin via direct targeting ABCA1, which sheds new light on understanding the mechanism of chemo-resistance in HCC-CSCs and contributes to development of potential therapeutics against HCC.
