Aim:Antiviral treatment for hepatitis C infection in elderly patients has been dramatically improved by direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). DAAs are easy to use as they are administered orally and the treatment periods are shorter. Furthermore, they are associated with fewer adverse effects. In this study, we sought to analyze the efficacy and safety of DAAs in HCV-infected elderly patients.Method:We analyzed 223 HCV-infected patients who were treated with DAAs in Kanazawa University Hospital, Japan. As of August 31, 2016, all of the patients were observed to have achieved a sustained viral response by the 12th week of treatment (SVR12). We categorized patients into two groups. Group one included 79 patients (average age 75.5 years; range 70-85 years). Group two included 144 patients (average age, 58.1 years; range 27-69 years). Group one included more female patients.Results:The platelet count of Group one was significantly lower than that of Group two. The FIB-4 index of Group one was significantly higher than that of Group two. Group one included a greater number of patients with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before the administration of DAAs. The SVR12 rate and rate of drop-out due to adverse effects did not differ between the two groups to a statistically significant extent. The rate of HCC occurrence after SVR in Group one was higher than that in Group two.Conclusion:Our study shows that DAAs can be used for older patients and that the antiviral efficacy and safety are similar to the efficacy and safety in younger patients.
