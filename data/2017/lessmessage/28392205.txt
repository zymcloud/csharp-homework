Aim:To retrospectively compare the initial response, local recurrence, and complication rates of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) vs microwave ablation (MWA) when combined with neoadjuvant bland transarterial embolization (TAE) or drug-eluting microsphere chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 35 subjects with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) very early and early-stage HCC (range: 1.2-4.1cm) underwent TAE (23) or TACE (12) with RFA (15) or microwave ablation (MWA) (20) from January 2009 to June 2015 as either definitive therapy or a bridge to transplant. TAE and TACE were performed with 40-400μm particles and 30-100μm plus either doxorubicin- or epirubicin-eluting microspheres, respectively. Initial response and local progression were evaluated using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. Complications were graded using common terminology criteria for adverse events version 5.0.Results:Complete response rates were 80% (12/15) for RFA + TAE/TACE and 95% (19/20) for MWA + TAE/TACE (P = 0.29). Local recurrence rate was 30% (4/12) for RFA + TAE/TACE and 0% (0/19) for MWA + TAE/TACE. Durability of response, defined as local disease control for duration of the study, demonstrated a significant difference in favor of MWA (P = 0.0091). There was no statistical difference in complication rates (3 vs 2).Conclusions:MWA and RFA when combined with neoadjuvant TAE or TACE have similar safety and efficacy in the treatment of early-stage HCC. MWA provided more durable disease control in this study; however, prospective data remain necessary to evaluate superiority of either modality.
