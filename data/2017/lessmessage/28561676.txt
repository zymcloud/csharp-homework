Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has presented a therapeutic challenge. Despite its heterogeneity, which is partially related to its various etiologies, it frequently arises in a background of chronic inflammation, which makes it a potentially excellent candidate for immunotherapeutic approaches. There is evidence of antitumor immunity in HCC as manifested by the cell infiltrate and its association with prognosis, the presence of tumor-associated antigens, and the reports of immune-mediated spontaneous regressions. However, both the liver itself and the tumor environment possess a diverse armamentarium of mechanisms that suppress antitumor immunity. Here, we describe the rationale for immunotherapy in HCC and discuss the emerging clinical data from various immunotherapeutic approaches including checkpoint inhibition, cell therapy, oncolytic viral therapy, and various combinatorial approaches. We also highlight the potential for various modalities to be adapted across different stages of the disease.
