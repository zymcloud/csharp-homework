We report a rare case of diffuse type of gastric cancer with signet ring cells in 10 years old boy who was admitted with a 12 months history with weight loss, dysphagia to solids first and to liquids later, anorexia, fatigue, dizziness, vomiting and later, with pain in the left upper quadrant. On examination, he appeared pale, malnourished, with caf√©-au- lait spots over the trunk and extremities. Laboratory tests showed; Hb 7.5 g, albumin 2.62 g, Thevenon positive on stools. Abdominal ultrasound examination showed periaortic masses and diffuse space occupying lesions in the liver. Endoscopic examination of the stomach showed multiple elevated tumor lesions. One located at 3 cm on the subcardial region presented irregular borders, partially eroded, that bleed easily when rubbing its surface. Multiple biopsy samples were taken. They showed a diffuse gastric signet cell type carcinoma of the stomach. Immunohistochemistry was positive to CK 8. The patient died a year later with wide spread metastasis. The boy was born through a normal delivery after a normal pregnancy to a primipara mother. His family history recorded a grandmother aunt dying of gastric cancer.
