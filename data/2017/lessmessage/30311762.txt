Echinococcus granulosus still remains a widespread disease. Moreover, there is a large number of patients in whom it is diagnosed rather late because its clinical presentation can be unspecific and symptoms vary. We report a familial case of the disease. Its specific feature was the onset with the bilateral pulmonary process and late involvement of the liver. This excluded other pulmonary diseases, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis or cancer.
