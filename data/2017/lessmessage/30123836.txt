Liver cancer remains one of the most common human cancers with a high mortality rate. Therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain ineffective, due to the heterogeneity of HCC with regard to both the etiology and mutation spectrum, as well as its chemotherapy resistant nature; thus surgical resection and liver transplantation remain the gold standard of patient care. The most common etiologies of HCC are extrinsic factors. Humans have multiple defense mechanisms against extrinsic factor-induced carcinogenesis, of which tumor suppressors play crucial roles in preventing normal cells from becoming cancerous. The tumor suppressor p53 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in liver cancer. p53 regulates expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, cell death, and cellular metabolism to avert tumor development due to carcinogens. This review article mainly summarizes extrinsic factors that induce liver cancer and potentially have etiological association with p53, including aflatoxin B1, vinyl chloride, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, iron overload, and infection of hepatitis viruses.
