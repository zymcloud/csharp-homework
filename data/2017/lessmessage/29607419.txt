The liver is an essential organ for nutrient and drug metabolism - possessing the remarkable ability to sense environmental and metabolic stimuli and provide an optimally adaptive response. Early growth response 1 (Egr1), an immediate early transcriptional factor which acts as a coordinator of the complex response to stress, is induced during liver injury and controls the expression of a wide range of genes involved in metabolism, cell proliferation, and role of Egr1 in liver injury and repair, deficiency of Egr1 delays liver regeneration process. The known upstream regulators of Egr1 include, but are not limited to, growth factors (e.g. transforming growth factor β1, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor), nuclear receptors (e.g. hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α, small heterodimer partner, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ), and other transcription factors (e.g. Sp1, E2F transcription factor 1). Research efforts using various animal models such as fatty liver, liver injury, and liver fibrosis contribute greatly to the elucidation of Egr1 function in the liver. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide due to the heterogeneity and the late stage at which cancer is generally diagnosed. Recent studies highlight the involvement of Egr1 in HCC development. The purpose of this review is to summarize current studies pertaining to the role of Egr1 in liver metabolism and liver diseases including liver cancer.
