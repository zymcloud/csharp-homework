The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a reporting system created for the standardized interpretation of liver imaging findings in patients who are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This system was developed with the cooperative and ongoing efforts of an American College of Radiology-supported committee of diagnostic radiologists with expertise in liver imaging and valuable input from hepatobiliary surgeons, hepatologists, hepatopathologists, and interventional radiologists. In this article, the 2017 version of LI-RADS for computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is reviewed. Specific topics include the appropriate population for application of LI-RADS; technical recommendations for image optimization, including definitions of dynamic enhancement phases; diagnostic and treatment response categories; definitions of major and ancillary imaging features; criteria for distinguishing definite HCC from a malignancy that might be non-HCC; management options following LI-RADS categorization; and reporting.
