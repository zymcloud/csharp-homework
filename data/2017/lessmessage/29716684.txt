A 59-year-old male patient was hospitalized in the Internal Medicine Department for investigation of hepatic metastases from an unknown primary neoplasm. During the hospitalization the patient died from acute myocardial infarction. The autopsy revealed a 8.2 kilograms (kg) liver that was diffusely infiltrated by whitish metastatic masses. No other tumor was detected, apart from a 2.5 centimeters (cm) pulmonary nodule next to the right intermediate bronchus that was histologically compatible with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Despite the fact that hepatic metastases from SCLCs are common, diffuse metastatic hepatomegaly from a malignant pulmonary nodule are rarely seen. Given that the most common cause of malignancy-related death is lung cancer, early diagnosis and appropriate management of pulmonary nodules is of paramount importance.
