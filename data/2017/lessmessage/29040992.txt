Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B. However, because of the heterogeneity of HCC in BCLC stage B; various subclassification systems have been proposed to predict the prognosis of patients. Previously, we proposed the Kinki criteria for precise classification of HCC cases in BCLC stage B. In this study, we compared the time to TACE refractoriness in HCC patients with Kinki criteria substages B1 and B2-HCC.Summary:Between January 2006 and December 2013, 592 HCC patients (substage B1, n = 118; substage B2, n = 170) underwent TACE. Time to progression under TACE treatment was defined as the time to untreatable progression (TTUP). TTUP and changes in liver function were analyzed in patients with substages B1 and B2-HCC. The median TTUP was 25.7 months (95% CI 19.3-37.3) and 16.4 months (95% CI 13.1-20.2) in patients with substage B1-HCC and substage B2-HCC, respectively (p = 0.0050). In patients with substage B2-HCC, median Child-Pugh scores after the first TACE session was significantly different from those after third and fifth TACE sessions (first-third, p = 0.0020; first-fifth, p = 0.0008). Key Message: TACE refractoriness occurred earlier in patients with substage B2-HCC than those with substage B1-HCC; deterioration of liver function with repeated TACE was more obvious in HCC cases with stage-B1 tumor. Shorter TTUP and impaired liver function due to repeated TACE could be responsible for the shorter survival in patients with substage B2-HCC.
