MicroRNA (miRNA) expression has been linked to the molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aberrant expression of miRNA is involved in the processes of tumorigenesis and cancer progression. According to the latest research, miR-888-5p is associated with strong cancer-promoting effect. For instance, miR-888-5p is up-regulated in prostate cancer and breast cancer. Nevertheless, the role of miR-888-5p in HCC has not been investigated to date. In this study, we found that miR-888-5p levels in four HCC cell lines (SMMC7721, HepG2, Huh-7 and Bel7402) were significantly up-regulated compared with human hepatocyte cell line (HHL-5). After transiently transfected with miR-888-5p mimic, our results demonstrated that miR-888-5p plays a major role in promoting the proliferation and metastatic potential of HCC cells. Moreover, miR-888-5p also increased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins which account for cell migration and invasion, and decreased the expression of p53 protein which further promoted malignance of HCC. Therefore, miR-888-5p may be considered a potential biomarker for diagnostics and prognosis of HCC.
