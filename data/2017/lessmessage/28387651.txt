Background/aim:Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteases which have been shown to be overexpressed in various types of cancers. However, the contribution of MMP1 genotype to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of MMP1 promoter 1607 genotype to the risk of HCC in Taiwan, where HCC incidence is relatively high in the world.Materials and methods:In this case-control study, MMP1 genotype and its interaction with consumption of cigarettes and alcohol in determining HCC risk was investigated among 298 HCC patients and 889 age- and gender-matched healthy controls.Results:The percentages of ever smokers and ever alcohol drinkers were much higher in the case group than in the control group. The percentages of 2G/2G, 1G/2G and 1G/1G for MMP1 promoter 1607 genotype were 37.2%, 38.3% and 24.5% in the HCC group and 34.8%, 44.0% and 21.2% in the control group, respectively (p for trend=0.2048). The allelic frequency distribution analysis showed the variant 1G allele of MMP1 promoter 1607 conferred similar HCC susceptibility as the wild-type 2G allele (odds ratio (OR)=1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.84-1.22, p=0.8735). As for the gene-lifestyle interaction, there was an obvious protective effect of MMP1 promoter 1607 1G allele on the risk of HCC among non-smokers, but not non-smokers, even alcohol drinkers or non-drinkers.Conclusion:The 1G allele of MMP1 promoter 1607 may have a protective effect on HCC risk for non-smokers in Taiwan and further validations are needed in other population groups.
