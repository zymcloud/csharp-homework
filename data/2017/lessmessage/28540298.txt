The early prediction values of diagnostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unclear at present. This study evaluated the prediction value of ten serum markers in HCC. A total of 109 cases of hepatic cirrhosis patients were followed up for 36 months and the relationship between the lifetime risk of developing HCC and levels of serum markers was analyzed. 31.2 (34/109) percent of hepatic cirrhosis patients developed HCC during the study's timeframe. Higher alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alpha-fetoprotein-L3 (AFP-L3), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and AFP-L3/AFP ratio levels are potential risk factors for malignization in hepatic cirrhosis patients (RR = 2.99, 2.92, 2.72, and 2.34); serum Golgi protein 73 (GP73) level of hepatic cirrhosis patients decreased significantly after developing HCC (t = 2.212; p = 0.041). The detection of ALT, AFP, AFP-L3, and GP73 has a certain guiding significance to predict the risk of HCC in hepatic cirrhosis patients.
