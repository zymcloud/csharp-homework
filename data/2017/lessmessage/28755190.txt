Hepatorenal tyrosinaemia (HT1) is a serious condition that used to be fatal before the advent of nitisinone (NTBC, OrfadineÂ®) as a therapeutic option. We have recently shown that selective screening is inadequate as initial symptoms are often uncharacteristic which leads to a considerable delay in diagnosis and treatment. This has a negative impact on morbidity and mortality as well as long-term outcome. For example, the odds ratio to develop hepatocellular carcinoma is 12.7 when treatment is initiated after the first birthday compared to start of treatment in the neonatal period. Timely diagnosis is only possible when neonatal mass screening is operational. HT1 meets all the criteria for neonatal mass screening at a clinical and analytical level. The natural course of the disease is well known, clinically there is a latent phase in most patients when presymptomatic treatment can be initiated. There are no mild phenotypes which do not require treatment. Using succinylacetone as the screening parameter a highly specific and sensitive test is available with acceptable financial burden. Neonatal mass screening for HT1 is acceptable to the target population as it can be performed simultaneously with the already existing screening tests in dried blood, there are no false negative and false positive cases and the financial burden to the health system is moderate. An efficient treatment is available with nitisinone and protein-reduced diet supplemented with special amino acid mixtures. Despite compelling evidence in favour of a neonatal mass screening for HT1 only 57% of European centres taking part in our recent cross-sectional study have included HT1 in their newborn screening programme.
