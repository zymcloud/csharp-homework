Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHC) are primary liver cancers where all or most of the tumor burden is usually confined to the liver. Therefore, locoregional liver-directed therapies can provide an opportunity to control intrahepatic disease with minimal systemic side effects. The English medical literature and clinical trials were reviewed to provide a synopsis on the available liver-directed percutaneous therapies for HCC and IHC. Locoregional liver-directed therapies provide survival benefit for patients with HCC and IHC compared to best medical treatment and have lower comorbid risks compared to surgical resection. These treatment options should be considered, especially in patients with unresectable disease.
