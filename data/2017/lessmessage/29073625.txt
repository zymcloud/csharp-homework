Background/aims:We performed this study to determine the role of IL-17 in the immune microenvironment of hepatitis B virus- (HBV-) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:HepG2 cells were treated with IL-17, STAT3 inhibitor S31-201 or IL-6 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (IL-6 mAb). Cell proliferation and migration were compared using the Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assays, respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western Blot, ELISA, immunofluorescence and histological staining were used for determining the expression levels of IL-17, IL-6, MCP-1, CCL5, VEGF, STAT3 and p-STAT3. HCC xenograft models were constructed in wild type and IL-17 knockout mice to clarify the effects of IL-17 on HCC in vivo.Results:Exogenous IL-17 enhanced the proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells, and it activated the phosphorylation of STAT3. RT-qPCR and ELISA showed that IL-17 promoted the expression of IL-6. The CCK-8 and Transwell assays showed that S31-201 or IL-6 mAb remarkably reversed the promotion effects of proliferation and migration by exogenous IL-17 in HepG2 cells. Additionally, IL-6 could promote the phosphorylation of STAT3, while IL-6 mAb acted as an inhibitor, and exogenous IL-17 could neutralize the inhibitory effects of IL-6 mAb. In vivo, compared to the wild type mice, the tumor volume, weight, density and size were decreased in IL-17 knockout mice. Additionally, the expression levels of p-STAT3, IL-6, MCP-1, CCL5 and VEGF decreased in IL-17 knockout mice.Conclusions:IL-17 can enhance the proliferation of HepG2 cells in vitro and in vivo via activating the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Therefore, the IL-17/IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic target for HBV-related HCC.
