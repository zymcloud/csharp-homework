Purpose:We evaluated the clinical efficacy of gelatin sponge microparticle (GSM) -mediated chemoembolization for the treatment of patients with liver metastases following surgery for gastrointestinal tumors.Materials and methods:In a retrospective analysis of 37 patients who were treated at our hospital with GSM-mediated chemoembolization for liver metastases over 13 years, we evaluated outcomes using a modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors system and also assessed liver function and adverse effects. All patients had previously undergone surgery for gastrointestinal tumors.Results:Treatment produced various degrees of necrosis and shrinkage of lesions among our patients. Two patients achieved a complete response (CR), 27 showed a partial response (PR), five had stable disease, and three had progressive disease. The overall response rate (CR + PR) was 78%, and no severe adverse effects were observed.Conclusion:GSM-mediated chemoembolization showed good clinical efficacy in the treatment of liver metastases after gastrointestinal tumor surgery. However, larger cohort and clinical controlled studies are warranted.
