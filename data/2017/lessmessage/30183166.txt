We studied proliferative features of cells in monolayer line of rat hepatoma Zajdela (the original, parent line) and in the sublines 3H and 9C cloned from different types of the colonies of the parental line. These sublines also differed by cytomorphometric parameters, by the types of colonies formed at recloning of these cells in vitro, and by tumorogenicity at transplantation to a rat. Using a time-lapse video of native living cells, we analyzed the cell cycle duration (CCD) and its relationship to a cell shape. Direct measurement of the CCD (a time period from mitosis to mitosis) was performed in individual cells of non-synchronized cultures. Average value of CCD in the parent Zajdela line appeared to be 14.6 Â± 0.2 hours, that was higher (at P
