Purpose:In our previous study, we have established the clinical significance of the SFLI (scoring formula of liver injury), the purpose of this study was to compare the SFLI system and the Child-Pugh grading system in the prediction of postoperative mortality in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:114 patients with HCC who underwent surgical treatment were enrolled. According to the requirement of the indicators for the Child-Pugh classification, various indices (including albumin [ALB], total bilirubin [TBIL], prothrombin time [PT], ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy) were considered in these patients before surgery, and then Child-Pugh grading was performed. Similarly, the serum biochemical markers including ALB, pre-albumin (PA), TBIL, serum creatining (SCR), international normalized ratio (INR), alanine transminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase (ggr;-GT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), PT, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and thrombine time (TT) were collected before surgery for SFLI analysis. The predicted postoperative mortality rates of these two scoring models and their diagnostic efficacy were analyzed and compared.Results:According to the Child-Pugh grading system, in level A, B and C were 75, 35, and 4 cases respectively, and the corresponding mortality rates were 1.3% (1/75), 17.1% (6/35) and 75% (3/4). Meanwhile, according to the SLFI classification, the number of patients in the grade I, I+, II, and III were 36, 29, 28, and 21, respectively, and the corresponding mortality rates were 0, 0, 14.3% (4/28), and 28.6% (6/21), respectively. The patient mortality rate increased significantly with increasing grading (pConclusion:The SFLI scoring system is very useful in the assessment of liver function and postoperative mortality, and its grading standard is much better than the traditional Child-Pugh classification in many aspects.
