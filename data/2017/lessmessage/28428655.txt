In the second part of this review, we will describe the ancillary imaging features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that can be seen on standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol, and on novel and emerging protocols such as diffusion weighted imaging and utilization of hepatocyte-specific/hepatobiliary contrast agent. We will also describe the morphologic sub-types of HCC, and give a simplified non-invasive diagnostic algorithm for HCC, followed by a brief description of the liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS), and MRI assessment of tumor response following locoregional therapy.
