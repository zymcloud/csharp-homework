Introduction:Robotic surgical system's ability to perform complex hepatobiliary surgeries is gaining momentum with outcomes similar to open surgery and advantages of minimal access surgery. The authors present their initial experience of a heterogenous spectrum of robotic hepatobiliary cases and the first reported case series from India.Methods:Retrospective review of hepatobiliary cases done robotically from February 2015 to January 2016 was done.Results:The series has ten patients; with median age of 45 years (range 15-72). Etiologies were choledochal cyst type IVa, benign lower end common bile duct stricture (biliary reconstruction group); incidental gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, polycystic liver disease, hemangioma, liver metastases, hydatid cyst (resection group). Median operative duration was 510min; one patient needed intra-operative blood transfusion and there were no conversions to open surgery. One patient developed bile leak which was managed by biliary stenting and another thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura during post-operative period. Median length of hospital stay was 6days with average cost of robotic surgery being $1700 USD more for major hepatectomy and $900 USD more for biliary reconstruction compared to open procedure.Conclusion:This initial series adds to existing data on the feasibility of robotic hepatobiliary cases with inherent advantages of minimal invasive surgery, however with limitation of availability and use of devices like cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) and higher operative cost.
