Dyslipidemia is the key precursor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the lipid-modifying potential of organic solvent-partitioned extracts from fruiting bodies of Amauroderma rugosum in vitro using oleate-induced human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells. Our results demonstrated that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with ethyl acetate (EA) extract greatly decreased intracellular and secreted total triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) compared with other extracts. Further investigation of cellular expression of selected apolipoproteins also revealed that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with the EA extract best attenuated the apolipoprotein (Apo) profile by downregulating ApoB-100 and ApoE while upregulating ApoA1. Because both ApoB-100 and ApoE are key components of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very LDL (VLDL), which are recognized as "bad cholesterol," this result indicates that treatment with the EA extract inhibited LDL and VLDL production in oleate-induced HepG2 cells. On the other hand, increasing ApoA1 evidence shows antiatherogenic benefits to increasing ApoA1, the key component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), particularly in relation to its role in promoting reverse cholesterol transport and preventing LDL oxidation; this indicates that the EA extract upregulated the production of HDL ("good cholesterol"). Hence, the EA extract is a good source of lipid-ameliorating agents in the management of dyslipidemia.
