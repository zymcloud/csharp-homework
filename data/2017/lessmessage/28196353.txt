Background/aims:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond Milan criteria (MC) are not eligible for liver transplantation (LT). To elucidate prognostic factors significantly linked to recurrence beyond MC or death related to the liver, we evaluated the clinical features in a series of HCC patients within MC at baseline.Methods:We enrolled 255 naïve HCC patients (≤70 years) within the MC who underwent upper-gastrointestinal-endoscopy, and were treated with resection or radiofrequency ablation (62 years old [median]; male:female = 202:53; Child-Pugh A:B = 216:39). A finding of esophagogastric varices (EGV) with an enlarged tortuous or coil shape, and past history of treatment for EGV were classified as clinically significant.Results:Following curative therapy, there was a significant difference for both 3- and 5-year rates of recurrence beyond the MC or liver-related death between the patients with and without significant-EGV (42.8 and 64.3% vs. 25.2 and 41.2%, respectively; p Conclusion:LT should be considered for EGV-positive patients with naïve HCC and within the MC.
