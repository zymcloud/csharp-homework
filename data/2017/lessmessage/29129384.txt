Objectives:This study was to evaluate the value of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver oligometastasis.Methods:102 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer with synchronous liver oligometastasis undergoing RFA were recruited in this retrospective study between January 2012 and December 2015. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging 1 month later. All patients were treated with RFA and systemic chemotherapy based on NCCN guideline.Results:The median follow-up was 21 months (range, 4.0-43.8 months). Of all patients, the 1-year survival rate was 47.1% and the median overall survival time was 11.40 months. Complete tumor ablation was achieved in 137 of 145 RFA sessions (94.5%), and in 244 of 254 tumors (96.1%). The incidence of common complications was 9.8%, and no severe complications were reported in any patient. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that primary tumor in the head of the pancreas (HR = 1.868, 95% CI: 1.023-3.409; P = 0.042), maximum diameter of liver metastasis 3-5 cm (HR = 1.801, 95% CI: 1.081-3.001, P = 0.024) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) â‰¥2.5 (HR = 1.716, 95% CI: 1.047-2.811; P = 0.032) were independent predictors of poorer survival.Conclusion:RFA provides a minimally invasive and safe treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer with liver oligometastases. The clinical efficiency of RFA for hepatic oligometastatic pancreatic cancer was easily affected by the following factors: primary tumor location, maximum diameter of liver metastasis and NLR. These factors could be helpful for treatment decision and clinical trial design.
Liver metastases; Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio; Pancreatic cancer; Prognosis factor; Radiofrequency ablation.
