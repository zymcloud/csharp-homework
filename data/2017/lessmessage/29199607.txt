Transposable elements (TEs) have shown a great significance in regulatory elements research, being responsible for different types of cancers. They are divided into three classes on the basis of their mode of transposition, structural properties, and their homology with DNA sequence. In evaluating their role in cancers and other pathologies, researchers have found extensive evidence of their involvement. TEs can also be used as genetic markers for cancers and help in identifying potential therapeutic targets. There have been advancements in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma using TEs as regulatory components involved in the cancer's pathogenesis.
