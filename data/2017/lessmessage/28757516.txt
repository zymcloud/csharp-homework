Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a severe health threat in China. Early tumor detection is crucial for improving the prognosis of patients. Currently, ultrasound plus biomarker alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is recommended by Chinese Liver Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines in China. However, most HCC continues to be diagnosed beyond an early stage due to insufficient sensitivity and specificity of current surveillance tools, highlighting the need for more accurate biomarkers to improve early HCC detection. In Japan, ultrasound plus triple biomarkers AFP, Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3), and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) has been routinely used for HCC surveillance and achieved increased early HCC detection rate. Very recently, the assay of triple biomarkers AFP, AFP-L3, and PIVKA II using Î¼TASWako i30 immuno-analyzer was brought into China. The prospect of the modality of ultrasound plus triple biomarkers for early HCC detection in China is expected in the future.
