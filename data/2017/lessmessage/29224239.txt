Background:This study introduces an innovative stepwise vascular control technique to address the high risk of massive bleeding from main hepatic veins and the retro-hepatic inferior vena cava during hepatectomy involving hepatocaval confluence.Methods:From January 2010 to July 2016, 80 patients underwent stepwise vascular occlusion during complex liver resection involving hepatocaval confluence. Relevant clinical data were collected and compared with those obtained in parallel studies. The protocol has been registered in the Protocol Registration and Results System as protocol NCT02996006.Results:All 80 patients underwent portal triad (PT), infra-hepatic inferior vena cava (IIVC) and supra-hepatic inferior vena cava (SIVC) preparation for occlusion in that order; PT, PT + SIVC and PT + IIVC + SIVC occlusions were performed during liver resection for six, 42 and 32 patients, respectively. The PT, IIVC and SIVC clamping times were 12.9 ± 2.5, 9.1 ± 2.1 and 5.1 ± 1.4 min, respectively. The mean blood loss was 504.1 ± 234.5 mL. Sixteen patients received blood transfusions. Haemodynamic parameters remained stable. No patients had life-threatening complications or died (Clavien-Dindo grade IV or V). Compared with other techniques used in parallel studies, this technique has the advantage of decreased blood loss in less warm ischaemia time.Conclusion:For complex hepatectomy involving hepatocaval confluence, this newly described stepwise vascular control technique was efficacious and feasible for controlling intraoperative bleeding.
