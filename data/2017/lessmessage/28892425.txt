Laparoscopic partial pancreatectomy has been performed in experimental canine studies and has been evaluated in human medicine but has not been reported in a clinical veterinary case. The authors present a 9 yr old field spaniel with weakness and hypoglycemia with insulin levels and Amended Insulin: Glucose Ratio results equivocal for a pancreatic insulinoma. Multiple abdominal ultrasounds did not detect the tumor, yet dual-phase computed tomographic angiography revealed the presence of a focal hypoattenuating nodule in the left lobe of the pancreas. A 3-port laparoscopic approach to the abdomen confirmed a 1.5-cm mass in the mid-left limb of the pancreas, and resection of the mass was performed with a bipolar vessel-sealing device. The surgery was performed without complication, and the dog became normoglycemic within 4 hr following surgery. Final histopathology results revealed pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of the Î² cells. Recurrence of hypoglycemia was noted 18 mo postoperatively; however, repeat computed tomographic angiography did not reveal pancreatic abnormalities and fine needle aspirates of liver nodules did not suggest metastatic disease. Medical management was elected and the patient was euthanized 28 mo after surgery due to refractory hypoglycemic seizures.
