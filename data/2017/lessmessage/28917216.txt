Introduction:We report the first case of mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT), where the extrahepatic bile duct was preserved with thrombectomy.Presentation of case:A 70-year-old male. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the tumor extending from the hepatic hilum to the left hepatic duct with complete obstruction of the left hepatic duct and a defect at the left portal vein. We planned to perform extended left lobectomy, lymph node dissection, extra hepatic bile duct resection and reconstruction based on the diagnosis of mass-forming ICC with left portal vein and left hepatic duct infiltration (cT3N0M0 Stage III). Intraoperative cholangiography revealed a crab claw-like filling defect at the left hepatic duct, which suggested tumor thrombus. Accordingly, we performed thrombectomy. The margin of the left hepatic duct was tumor negative, so we performed extended left lobectomy, lymph node dissection and thrombectomy. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as ICC (pT4N0M0 Stage IVA, vp3, b3). Tumors in the left hepatic duct and left portal vein proved to be tumor thrombus. The postoperative course was uneventful. He is doing well without recurrence.Discussion:Thrombectomy is performed for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor thrombus. Furthermore, extrahepatic bile duct resection and reconstruction are recommended for ICC. In this case, intraoperative cholangiography was effective for precisely diagnosing. Thrombectomy could reduce surgical stress and prevent complications.Conclusions:Thrombectomy can be a valid option for ICC with tumor thrombus, as well as for HCC.
