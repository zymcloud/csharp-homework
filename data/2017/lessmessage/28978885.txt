Platelet transfusions are generally administered to patients with liver cirrhosis and associated thrombocytopenia before radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Here, we describe a 77-year-old woman who was diagnosed with hepatitis C, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 2006. She underwent RFA in October 2014 and October 2015, with platelet transfusions. She was admitted to our hospital in July 2016 to receive RFA for recurrence of HCC. To avoid platelet transfusion before RFA, she was administered lusutrombopag. The platelet count increased, and she did not need a platelet transfusion. In November 2016, computed tomography revealed that HCC had recurred. Lusutrombopag was readministered to avoid platelet transfusion before performing RFA. Subsequently, her platelet count increased, platelet transfusion was avoided, with no side effects. The results obtained in this case are valuable because there is little information on readministration of lusutrombopag.
