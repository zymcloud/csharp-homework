Aim:This study is presenting an effective method of inducing liver fibrosis by CCL4 as a toxin in two different breeds of rat models.Background:Liver fibrosis is a result of inflammation and liver injury caused by wound healing responses which ultimately lead to liver failure. Consequently, after liver fibrosis, the progression will be continued to liver cirrhosis and at the end stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Many studies have demonstrated that one of the most important causes of liver fibrosis is Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Fibrotic Liver is affected by an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins like collagen and α-SMA.Methods:In two different experiments, male Vistar, and Sprague Dawley Rat models ranging from 200±60, corresponding to an age of approximately 10 weeks were utilized in order to induce CCL4 treated liver fibrosis.Results:After 6 weeks of CCL4 injection, different tests have been carried out to verify the liver fibrosis including serum markers such as Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), molecular tests containing, laminin and α-SMA and also pathological observation by Hematoxylin and eosin staining in both fibrosis and control group.Conclusion:The results of Pathology and Real-time PCR showed that fibrosis was induced much more effectively in Sprague Dawley rat model compared with Wistar rats.
