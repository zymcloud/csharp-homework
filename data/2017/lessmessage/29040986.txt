Background:Sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (RBV) therapy showed higher sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) than pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) plus RBV; however, liver function, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma markers have not been assessed so far.Summary:Patients (n = 21) receiving Sofosbuvir plus RBV and those (n = 24) receiving peg-IFN plus RBV were enrolled in this study. Changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, platelet (PLT) counts, FIB-4, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) in both groups were assessed in patients achieving SVR12. Also, fibrosis regression was assessed using pathophysiological biomarkers, such as hyaluronic acid, bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the Sofosbuvir plus RBV group. In both groups, while the reduction in ALT levels was significant that of AFP was not. Compared with the baseline, although serum PLT count at the end of treatment (EOT) was significantly higher in the Sofosbuvir plus RBV group, it was significantly lower in the peg-IFN plus RBV group. Although a significant decline in fibrosis markers such as FIB-4 and APRI was observed between the baseline and at EOT in the Sofosbuvir plus RBV group, no significant change of these markers was observed in the peg-IFN plus RBV group. Moreover, BMP-7 and CTGF were significantly lower at EOT than the baseline in the Sofosbuvir plus RBV group. Key Message: The treatment with Sofosbuvir plus RBV results in not only a higher SVR, but also improves the liver function and the degree of fibrosis.
