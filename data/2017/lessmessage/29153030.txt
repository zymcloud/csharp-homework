Copper and copper compounds have multifunctional properties (antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal) with promising applications. Copper in its nanoparticle (Cu NPs) forms has been widely used in various industrial and commercial applications. In the current research, the cytotoxic effects of textile fabrics impregnated with copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) were studied in mammalian cell lines. CuO NPs were impregnated onto textile substrates using 2 different techniques: the sonochemical generation and impregnation of NPs from metal complexes ( insitu) and a "throwing the stones" technology using commercially prepared CuO NPs. The cytotoxicity of these 2 textile fabric types was assayed on human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and was evaluated by indirect contact using an MTT assay. The impregnated fabrics were not exposed to the cells, rather their leachates were used to test cytotoxicity. The fabrics were soaked into the growth media for up to 7 days, and the leachates from day 1 and day 7 were incubated with the cell lines for 24 hours prior to the testing. The discharge or leaching from antimicrobial nanomaterials into the surroundings and surface waters is posing a serious environmental threat, which needs to be addressed. Hence, with regard to product safety, it is a good approach to study the fabric leachates rather than the intact material. The results showed that CuO NPs are not toxic to HDF cells. However, cytotoxicity was seen in HepG2 cells with cell viability decreasing by 20% to 25% for all the fabrics after 24 hours.
