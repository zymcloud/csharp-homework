Aim:The present study investigated the anti-tumor activity of Imatinib mesylate through modulation of NM23 gene expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line.Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered to be the third leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. Down regulation of NM23, a metastasis suppressor gene, has been associated with several types of malignant cancer. Recently, effects of Imatinib mesylate, a first member of tyrosine kinases inhibitors, were indicated in research and treatment of different malignant tumors.Methods:Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay after HepG2 cells exposure to Imatinib mesylate at various concentrations of 0, 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25,50Î¼M for 24 hours. Also, quantitative real time PCR technique was applied for the detection of NM23 gene expression in HepG2 cell line.Results:There was a dose dependent increase in the cytotoxicity effect of imatinib. The real time PCR results demonstrated that inhibitory effect of Imatinib mesylate on viability via up regulation of NM23 gene expression compared to GAPDH gene (internal control gene) in cancer cells.Conclusion:According to our findings, imatinib can modulate metastasis by enhancing Nm23 gene expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line.
