A 45-year-old woman with dyspnea and appetite and weight loss was admitted to our hospital. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a right hypovascular renal tumor with tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava and metastases in the liver, stomach, and left kidney. The renal tumor was diagnosed as a mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) by pathological examination of a percutaneous needle biopsy specimen. She was treated with temsirolimus (25 mg per week). Five weeks after initiation of this treatment, her liver metastases had clearly decreased in size and her appetite had been restored. However, progressive disease was diagnosed by CT scan revealing expansion of tumor thrombus after 7 weeks, prompting a switch in treatment to axitinib. Approximately 6 months after the diagnosis, she died of cancer. MTSCC is considered to have relative good prognosis, however, many cases with poor prognoses have been reported recently. Our experience with this patient suggests that temsirolimus may be effective treatment for metastatic MTSCC.
Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma; temsirolimus.
