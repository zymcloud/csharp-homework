With the development of molecular targeting therapy, several treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have become available in cases where curative and other palliative treatments, such as radiofrequency ablation, surgical resection, and transarterial chemoembolization, are not applicable. However, with the detection of a variety of mutations in cancer-related genes in a single tumor, molecular heterogeneity is commonly observed in HCC. Therefore, mutations in the major cellular signaling pathways underlie the development of resistance to molecular targeting agents. On the contrary, immune checkpoint inhibitors have proven effective in patients who are refractory to conventional treatments and molecular targeting therapy. Several clinical trials are currently investigating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors both individually and in combination with other types of anticancer agents. In this review, we focus on the potential of immune checkpoint blockade in the treatment of human HCC.
