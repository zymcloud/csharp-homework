Purpose:To assess efficacy or long-term result of metastasectomy for recurrent or metastatic biliary tract carcinoma (BTC), we conducted a retrospective review of the outcomes of metastasectomy for recurrent or metastatic BTCs, comprising intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (IHCCC), proximal and distal common bile duct cancer (pCBDC and dCBDC), gallbladder cancer (GBC), and ampulla of Vater cancer (AoVC).Patients and methods:The clinicopathological features and outcomes of BTC patients who underwent surgical resection for the primary and metastatic disease at the Gachon University Gil Medical Centre from 2003 to 2013 were reviewed retrospectively.Results:We found 19 eligible patients. Primary sites were GBC (seven patients, 37%), IHCCC (five patients, 26%), dCBDC (three patients, 16%), pCBDC (two patients, 11%), and AoVC (two patients, 11%). Eight patients (42%) had synchronous metastasis whereas 11 (58%) had metachronous metastasis. The most common metastatic site was liver (nine patients, 47%), lymph node (nine patients, 47%), and peritoneum (three patients, 16%). Nine patients (47%) achieved R0 resection, whereas four (21%) and six (32%) patients had R1 and R2 resection, respectively. With a median follow-up period of 26.7 months, the estimated median overall survival (OS) was 18.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.6-22.9 months). Lower Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (P = 0.023), metachronous metastasis (P = 0.04), absence of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.009), lower numbers of metastatic organs (P < 0.001), normal postoperative CA19-9 level (P = 0.034), and time from diagnosis to metastasectomy more than 1 year (P = 0.019) were identified as prognostic factors for a longer OS after metastasectomy.Conclusions:For recurrent or metastatic BTCs, metastasectomy can be a viable option for selected patients.
