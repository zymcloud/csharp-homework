Background/aims:Zinc finger protein 667 (ZNF667) is a member of C2H2 zinc finger protein family. For the first time, we aim to analyze the expression pattern of ZNF667 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues; to explore its role in HCC tumorigenesis.Methods:Immuno-histochemistry was carried out to characterize the ZNF667 expression in paraffin-embedded HCC samples. The relationship between ZNF667 expression and the clinical, pathological data of the patients were analyzed. Human normal hepatocyte cells LO2 over expressing ZNF667 (LO2-ZNF667 cells), ZNF667 depleted hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells (HepG2-shZNF667 cells) were set up, their proliferation, migration and invasion abilities were analyzed. Xenograft nude mice were used to analyze the malignancy of HepG2-shZNF667 cells in vivo. Western blot was performed to analyze the expression of Bcl-2 and BAX in LO2-ZNF667 and HepG2-shZNF667 cells.Results:Increased ZNF667 was found via immuno-histochemistry in HCC. Enhanced ZNF667 expression was associated with tumor size, clinical stage and tumor differentiation. LO2-ZNF667 cells displayed increased and HepG2-shZNF667 cells decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Xenograft experiments proved reduced malignancy of HepG2-shZNF667 cells in vivo. LO2-ZNF667 cells displayed increased Bcl-2 and decreased BAX protein expression. HepG2-shZNF667 cells displayed enhanced BAX and inhibited BCL-2 expression.Conclusions:ZNF667 is shown to be a new oncogene in HCC and it may serve as a new therapeutic target for HCC via enhancing BCL-2 and decreasing BAX expression.
