Ceritinib is a novel ALK inhibitor approved for advanced stage NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement, progressed and/or intolerant to crizotinib. 13 patients were included in our study who received ceritinib. Majority of them were women and never smokers with a median age of 47 yrs. Nearly half of them had a compromised performance status and received ceritinib in third line and beyond. Ceritinib showed nearly 50% response rates. With a median follow up of 9 months for the entire cohort, median PFS and OS were not reached. However, the mean values for PFS and OS were 10.9 and 14.8 months,with an estimated 1 year PFS and OS being 56% and 78% respectively.1/3 of the patients had gastrointestinal and liver toxicities. Metabolic abnormalities were seen in 1/4 th of them. ceritinib was permanently discontinued in one patient due to pneumonitis. In conclusion, ceritinib has a favorable efficacy and side effect profile in our patient population., similar to that reported in large clinical trials. It has shown promising efficacy even in patients with compromised performance status; presence of brain metastases and heavily pre-treated disease.
