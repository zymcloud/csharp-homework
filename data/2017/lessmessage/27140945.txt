Background:The use of a new chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer is not free of complications. Monoclonal antibodies are associated with bleeding and intestinal perforations.Objective:To report the case of a patient who developed a serious complication after treatment with an antiangiogenic drug for colorectal neoplasm.Clinical case:The case is presented of a 42-year-old male operated on due to subocclusive rectal cancer with metástasis at the time of diagnosis. Sixteen months after surgery during second-line adjuvant therapy, an intestinal perforation was observed with haemorrhage and intestinal leak to retroperitoneum and left lower extremity. Despite intensive medical and surgical treatment this complication had fatal consequences.Conclusions:Future research should be directed at obtaining biomarkers for the specific use of antiangiogenic agents in order to decrease the rate of adverse factors.
