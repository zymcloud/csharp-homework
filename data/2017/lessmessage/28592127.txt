Aberrant methylation of tumor-related genes has been identified as a promising biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 1 (SOX1) and Vimentin (VIM) promoter methylation for HCC. The study included 360 subjects, 240 patients with HCC, 29 with liver cirrhosis (LC), 66 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 25 healthy controls (HCs). The methylation status of SOX1 and VIM promoters in the serum was detected by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). The methylation frequencies of SOX1 and VIM promoters in HCC patients were significantly higher than those in LC (p
