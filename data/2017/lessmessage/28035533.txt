Mitochondria are considered cholesterol-poor organelles, and obtain their cholesterol load by the action of specialized proteins involved in its delivery from extramitochondrial sources and trafficking within mitochondrial membranes. Although mitochondrial cholesterol fulfills vital physiological functions, such as the synthesis of bile acids in the liver or the formation of steroid hormones in specialized tissues, recent evidence indicates that the accumulation of cholesterol in mitochondria may be a key event in prevalent human diseases, in particular in the development of steatohepatitis (SH) and its progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation promotes the transition from simple steatosis to SH due to the sensitization to oxidative stress and cell death. However, mitochondrial cholesterol loading in HCC determines apoptosis resistance and insensitivity to chemotherapy. These opposing functions of mitochondrial cholesterol in SH and HCC define its paradoxical role in cell death as a pro- and anti-apoptotic factor. Further understanding of this conundrum may be useful to modulate the progression from SH to HCC by targeting mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking.
