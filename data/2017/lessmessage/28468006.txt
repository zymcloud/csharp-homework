Hepatobiliary cancer comprises a heterogeneous group of malignancies in which the standard treatments for advanced disease are minimally effective and evolve slowly over time. Like the majority of gastrointestinal cancers, with some notable exceptions, the impact of immune-based approaches is yet to be experienced. Notwithstanding this, the etiological background of hepatobiliary cancer - overlapping in almost every known causative or associated factor with inflammation - provides a strong clue that these approaches may have an impact on this group of diseases. This review seeks to put the management of hepatobiliary cancers in the context of its inflammation-based etiology, with the aim of pointing to the therapeutic opportunities in immune-based approaches currently entering the clinic or those that are about to do so.
