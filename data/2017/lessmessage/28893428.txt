Introduction:Preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein levels can have predictive value for hepatocellular carcinoma survival.Aim:Our aim was to analyze the correlation between preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and survival, following the surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Nineteen patients were prospectively followed (07/2005-01/2016). An ROC curve was created to determine the sensitivity and specificity of alpha-fetoprotein in relation to survival (Kaplan-Meier).Results:Of the 19 patients evaluated, 57.9% were men. The mean patient age was 68.1 ± 8.5 years and survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 89.4, 55.9, and 55.9%. The alpha-fetoprotein cutoff point was 15.1 ng/ml (sensitivity 100%, specificity 99.23%). Preoperative alpha-fetoprotein levels below 15.1, 200, 400, and 463 ng/ml correlated with better 1 and 5-year survival rates than levels above 15.1, 200, 400, and 463 ng/ml (PConclusions:Elevated preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein levels have predictive value for hepatocellular carcinoma survival.
