Study objective:To analyze the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic secondary cytoreductive surgery in a retrospective series of patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.Design:Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting:Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy.Patients:Between October 2010 and October 2016, 58 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer were selected for a retrospective analysis of data.Interventions:All patients underwent a laparoscopic secondary cytoreduction with single or multiple procedures.Results:The most frequent pattern of recurrence was peritoneal (48.3%); 6 patients (10.3%) experienced parenchymal disease (spleen, n = 5; liver, n = 1), and 24 patients (41.4%) had lymph node recurrence. Complete debulking was achieved in all patients. The median operative time was 204 minutes (range, 55-448 minutes), median estimated blood loss was 70 mL (range, 20-300 mL), and the median length of hospital stay was 4 days (range, 1-21 days). Four patients (6.8%) experienced intraoperative complications. Early postoperative complications were documented in 6 patients (10.3%), but only 1 G3 complication was noted. The median duration of follow-up since secondary cytoreduction was 24 months (range, 9-71 months). Twenty-one patients (36.2%) experienced a second disease relapse. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 28 months, and the 2-year PFS was 58.7%. Five patients died (8.6%); the 2-year overall survival was 90.7%.Conclusions:For selected patients, laparoscopy is a feasible and safe approach to optimal cytoreduction for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
