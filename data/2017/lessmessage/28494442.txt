Background:Perihepatic adhesions induced by hepatectomy make the subsequent repeat hepatectomy technically demanding. The aim of this study was to verify the effect of hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose-based bioresorbable membrane (HA membrane) in preventing posthepatectomy adhesion formation by focusing on the ease of the adhesiolysis in subsequent hepatectomy for recurrent tumors.Methods:A total of 201 patients who underwent hepatectomy using HA membrane were prospectively followed-up for 3 years. Thirty of the 201 patients underwent a repeat hepatectomy for recurrence. The operative data of 85 cases of repeat hepatectomy, the primary hepatectomy of which had been performed without the use of HA membrane, served as the historical control data. The primary endpoint was the time interval between the skin incision and the start of hepatic parenchymal transection (the preparation time) including adhesiolysis. Secondary endpoints were blood loss during the operation, incidence of postoperative complications, and the biochemical data.Results:The median preparation time (183 vs. 228 min; p = 0.027) and total operation time (374 vs. 439 min; p = 0.041) were significantly shorter in the HA membrane group than in the control group.Conclusion:Use of HA membranes during hepatectomy enabled significant shortening of the adhesiolysis time during the sequential hepatectomy performed for recurrent tumors.
