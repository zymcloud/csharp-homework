Osteosarcoma is the commonest primary malignant bone tumor. Since bones lack a lymphatic system, metastatic spread in these tumors is exclusively hematogenous, the commonest sites being lungs and bone. We report a case of osteosarcoma humerus which recurred locally after primary therapy consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and limb salvage surgery, who developed calcified liver metastases in addition to local and pulmonary relapse. Liver, though a common site of hematogenous spread in most solid tumors, has rarely been reported to be involved in metastatic osteosarcomas.
