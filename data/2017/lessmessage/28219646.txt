Squamous cell carcinoma of thyroid is an uncommon, very aggressive neoplasm, having a poor prognosis and poor response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is the initial treatment of choice, although it often presents as a widespread disease at the time of diagnosis, usually with cervical swelling that causes most of the symptoms due to local infiltration or metastasis. Local infiltration from adjacent tumour and metastatic disease needs to be excluded from other primary epidermoid carcinomas, in order to make a correct diagnosis. This also requires the typical cytokeratin pattern seen in histological studies. The case is presented of a 53 year-old man with a medical history of hepatocarcinoma, with a cervical hypermetabolic lesion detected in an 18F-FDG PET/CT performed to exclude widespread disease. The follow-up of this lesion with this technique and its usefulness is also described.
