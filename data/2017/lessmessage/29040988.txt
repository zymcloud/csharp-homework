Background and aims:Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) dramatically improve the sustained virological response (SVR) of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. However, continuous liver damage after SVR may be a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We clarified pretreatment characteristics related to sustained liver damage after SVR.Methods:A total of 286 CHC patients were treated with an interferon-free DAA regimen. Among them, 250 patients achieved SVR for 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12); these individuals were classified based on α-fetoprotein (AFP) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels posttreatment. Baseline characteristics significantly associated with AFP >5 ng/mL and ALT level ≥20 IU/L after SVR were clarified using multivariate analyses.Results:Among the pretreatment factors examined, serum AFP values and the presence of fatty liver (FL) were significantly associated with abnormal AFP (p Conclusions:High FIB-4 index, low albumin level, and FL before DAA treatment were associated with a risk of sustained liver damage with AFP and ALT elevation after SVR; patients with these factors should be carefully monitored for emergence of HCC.
