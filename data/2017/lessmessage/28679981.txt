We conducted a multicenter retrospective study for evaluating the background of and diagnostic opportunity for 651 patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The etiologies were hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 20.0% of patients, hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 36.3%, and non-B non-C (NBNC) in 43.5%. The characteristics of non-alcoholic NBNC HCC patients included low frequency of liver cirrhosis and high frequency of life style-related diseases. The mean diameter of HCC was approximately 4cm. Most patients were diagnosed using ultrasonography and dynamic computed tomography (CT). However, 18.6% of patients were diagnosed using conventional contrast-enhanced CT. Compliance with the surveillance program for HCC diagnosis was 35.4% in HBV carriers and 49.2% in HCV carriers. The main causes of deviation from the program included undiagnosed HBV and HCV carriers, non-compliance with the surveillance program by physicians, and no medical care for HBV and HCV carriers. For an early diagnosis of HCC, it is essential to improve the diagnoses of HBV and HCV carriers, promote the follow-ups of HBV and HCV carriers in hospitals, re-educate physicians, and identify the risk factors of NBNC HCC.
