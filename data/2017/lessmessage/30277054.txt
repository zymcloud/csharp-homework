The effectiveness of two transplantation methods of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells HepG2 and allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells of adipose tissue (AT MSCs) into mice was compared in order to select the most effective for liver damage repair. Considerable advantage of cell transplantation into the spleen compared with intraperitoneal administration was shown. It is found that, under similar conditions of transplantation, AT MSCs are detected in liver tissue in smaller quantities than human hepatocellular carcinoma cells HepG2; differences in cell localization of these types of cells in the liver are revealed. A tendency to decrease in the degree of fibrotic changes in liver tissue after transplantation of AT MSCs and to a greater extent after transplantation of AT MSCs, pretreated with interleukin-6, was traced.
