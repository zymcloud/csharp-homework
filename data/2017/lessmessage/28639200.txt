The prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor and has not improved in over two decades. Most patients with advanced HCC who are not eligible for surgery have limited treatment options due to poor liver function or large, unresectable tumors. Although sorafenib is the standard-of-care treatment for these patients, only a small number respond. For the remaining, the outlook remains bleak. A better approach to target "undruggable" molecular pathways that reverse HCC is therefore urgently needed. Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) may provide a novel strategy to activate expression of genes that become dysregulated in chronic disease. The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), a critical regulator of hepatocyte function, is suppressed in many advanced liver diseases. By using an saRNA to activate C/EBPα, we can exploit the cell's own transcription machinery to enhance gene expression without relying on exogenous vectors that have been the backbone of gene therapy. saRNAs do not integrate into the host genome and can be modified to avoid immune stimulation. In preclinical models of liver disease, treatment with C/EBPα saRNA has shown reduction in tumor volume and improvement in serum markers of essential liver function such as albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT). This saRNA that activates C/EBPα for advanced HCC is the first saRNA therapy to have entered a human clinical trial. The hope is that this new tool will help break the dismal 20-year trend and provide a more positive prognosis for patients with severe liver disease.
