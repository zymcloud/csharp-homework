Background and objectives:Laparoscopic liver resections (LLRs) have gained wider acceptance during the decade as safe and efficient procedures in the management of several benign and malignant diseases when performed by experienced surgeons. We report our initial institutional experience with LLRs performed by 1 certified hepatobiliary surgeon.Methods:Patients undergoing LLRs by 1 senior hepatobiliary surgeon in our Institution during the period from January 2012 through January 2017 were prospectively sampled and retrospectively analyzed for the purposes of this study.Results:Forty-two of 175 patients (24%) who had surgery for liver tumors underwent LLR. Median age was 64 years; median body mass index and Charlson comorbidity index were 27.3 kg/m2 and 6.5, respectively. Patients underwent resections for benign (n = 22) or malignant (n = 20) lesions. Median total operating time was 115 minutes and liver resections included: 1 left hepatectomy, 11 bisegmentectomies, 7 segmentectomies, 5 wide wedge resections, 1 left lateral sectionectomy combined with segmentectomy and radiofrequency ablation, 15 liver cyst unroofing, 1 laparoscopic drainage of a pyogenic liver abscess, and 1 laparoscopic drainage of a hepatic hydatid cyst. Blood transfusion was needed in 10 patients. Six patients (14%) had postoperative complications, none of which necessitated reoperation. None of the patients was admitted to the intensive care unit after surgery, and the median hospital stay was 4 days. The tumor-free resection margin was documented in all primary or secondary oncologic cases.Conclusions:Careful patient selection and compliance with the international recommendations are the keys for the successful introduction and evolution of an LLR program with a certified hepatobiliary surgeon with laparoscopic experience.
