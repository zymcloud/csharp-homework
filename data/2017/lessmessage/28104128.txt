The combined liver-kidney transplantation (cLKT) is the procedure of choice for patients with end-stage liver and kidney disease. In cLKT we can usually accommodate the grafts in two different ways, varying the kidney placement. The retroperitoneal kidney implant has some advantages, such as the easy access or avoiding vascular complications. We propose a new single incision, not yet reported, maintaining an extraperitoneal kidney, with excellent surgical field for cLKT and possible reduction of the impact of wound complications.
