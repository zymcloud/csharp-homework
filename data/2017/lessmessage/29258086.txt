The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the first oral molecular targeted agent with proven prognostic benefit in unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, as with other drugs, sorafenib has its limitations, and various clinical trials have been conducted to develop novel molecular targeted agents for use alone or in combination with existing locoregional therapies. Despite this, clinical trials of molecular targeted agents combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) have not reported major treatment outcomes to date. In this review, we describe previous clinical trials of combination therapy with TACE and a molecular targeted agent in patients with unresectable HCC.
