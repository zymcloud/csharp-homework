Objective:To evaluate the impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication on the clinical outcome of patients with HCV-related advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib.Methods:A total of 58 HCV-related advanced HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A disease who were treated with sorafenib were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Of these, 27 patients were HCV RNA negative as a result of previous antiviral therapy (sustained viral response [SVR] group), while the remaining 31 were HCV RNA positive (non-SVR group).Results:The response rate, disease control rate and median time to progression in the SVR group (6, 46.0%, and 3.8 months, respectively) were similar to those in the non-SVR group (3, 51.5%, and 2.7 months, respectively). On the other hand, the median time to treatment failure (TTTF), post-progression survival (PPS), and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer in the SVR group than in the non-SVR group (9.7, 8.5, and 15 months vs. 5.9, 5.2, and 9.3 months; p = 0.023, 0.02, and 0.014, respectively). On multivariate analysis, SVR was identified as a significant and independent determinant of PPS (p = 0.009), TTTF (p = 0.028), and OS (p = 0.01).Conclusion:HCV eradication before sorafenib treatment for HCV-related advanced HCC could prolong PPS and TTTF and improve OS.
