Introduction:The caudate lobe is a distinct liver lobe and surgical resection requires expertise and precise anatomic knowledge. Left-sided approach was described for resection of small tumors originated in the Spiegel lobe but now the procedure has been performed even for tumors more than five centimeters. The aim of this study is to present three cases of tumor of caudate lobe underwent isolated lobectomy by left-sided approach.Presentation of case:Three patients with metastasis of colorectal cancer, carcinoma hepatocellular and metastasis of neuroendocrine tumor underwent resection. After modified Makuuchi incision, early control of short hepatic e short portal veins before hepatectomy was performed. The operative time was 200, 270 and 230min respectively. No blood transfusion was used and no postoperative complications were observed. The length of stay was 7, 11 and 5days respectively.Discussion:Some approaches have been described to access and resect tumors of the caudate lobe, including the left-sided approach, right-sided approach, combined left- and right-sided approach and the anterior transhepatic approach. For liver resection in patients with malignant disease, parenchymal preservation is important in order to avoid postoperative liver failure or due to the risk of second hepatectomy. In these patients isolated caudate lobectomy is a safe option.Conclusion:Isolated caudate lobectomy is a feasible procedure. Left-sided approach can be preformed even for tumors larger than 5cm.
