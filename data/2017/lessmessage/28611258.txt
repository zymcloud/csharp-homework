Introduction:Hepatitis B (HBV) and C viruses (HCV) are important causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our aim was to assess mortality and resource utilization of patients with HCC-related to HBV and HCV.Material and methods:National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database (2001-2009) was used. Medicare claims included patient demographic information, diagnoses, treatment, procedures, ICD-9 codes, service dates, payments, coverage status, survival data, carrier claims, and Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) data. HCC related to HBV/HCV and non-cancer controls with HBV/HCV were included. Pair-wise comparisons were made by t-tests and chi-square tests. Logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used.Results:We included 2,711 cases of HCC (518 HBV, 2,193 HCV-related) and 5,130 non-cancer controls (1,321 HBV, 3,809 HCV). Between 2001-2009, HCC cases related to HBV and HCV increased. Compared to controls, HBV and HCV patients with HCC were older, more likely to be male (73.2% vs 48.9% and 57.1% vs. 50.5%), die within one-year (49.3% vs. 20.3% and 52.2% vs. 19.2%), have decompensated cirrhosis (44.8% vs. 6.9% and 53.9% vs. 10.4%) and have higher inpatient ($60.471 vs. $47.223 and $56.033 vs. $41.005) and outpatient charges ($3,840 vs. $3,328 and $3,251 vs. $2,096) (all P Conclusions:The rate of viral hepatitis-related HCC is increasing. Mortality and resource utilization related to HBV and HCV-related HCC is substantial.
