Background:Poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHA) have recently attracted increasing attention due to their biodegradability and high biocompatibility, which makes them suitable for the development of new prolong drug formulations.Objective:This study was conducted to develop new prolong paclitaxel (PTX) formulation based on poly(3- hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) microparticles.Method:PHB microparticles loaded with antitumor cytostatic drug PTX were obtained by spray-drying method using Nano Spray Dryer B-90. The PTX release kinetics in vitro from PHB microparticles and their cytotoxity on murine hepatoma cell line MH-22a were studied. Microparticles antitumor activity in vivo was studied using intraperitoneally (i.p.) transplanted tumor models: murine Lewis lung carcinoma and xenografts of human breast cancer RMG1.Results:Uniform PTX release from PHB-microparticles during 2 months was observed. PTX-loaded PHB microparticles have demonstrated a significant antitumor activity versus pure drug both in vitro in murine hepatoma cells and in vivo when administered i.p. to mice with murine Lewis lung carcinoma and xenografts of human breast cancer RMG1.Conclusion:The developed technique of PTX sustained delivery from PHB-microparticles has therapeutic potential as prolong anticancer drug formulation.
