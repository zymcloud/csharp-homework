Purpose:Few results regarding the long-term survival from laparoscopic liver resection have been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:IOf 638 patients who underwent open or laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma, 184 treated by laparoscopic liver resection and 184 treated by open liver resection were studied using the propensity score matching method. The short-term surgical outcomes and long-term survival outcomes of these matched groups were compared.Results:The two study groups were well matched with respect to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), liver function, underlying liver disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, tumor location and type of resection. The laparoscopy group had a significantly longer operative time but significantly less intraoperative blood loss. Postoperatively, no significant intergroup differences were found for hospital stay, morbidity or mortality. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival were similar between the two groups.Conclusion:Laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma is technically safe and feasible compared with open resection. The long-term outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma are considered acceptable.
