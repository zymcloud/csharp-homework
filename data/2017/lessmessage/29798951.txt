Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health burden and the seventh most common cause of cancer-related death in India. Patients with advanced unresectable HCC have a poor prognosis with a reported median survival of only 2-3 months with the best supportive care (BSC). Sorafenib is the only drug that has demonstrated a survival benefit over BSC in advanced HCC. Unfortunately, even though it has been used for a long time, there are very few published data regarding the experience of sorafenib therapy in advanced HCC from India.Materials and methods:Patients diagnosed with advanced HCC from January 2012 to July 2017 at our center were reviewed retrospectively. Patients' profile, time to progression, survival, and toxicity of sorafenib therapy were evaluated.Results:Of the 48 advanced patients with HCC, 35 (72.9%) were male. The median age at diagnosis was 52 years. The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (77%, n = 37), followed by abdominal distension (37.5%, n = 18), loss of appetite and/or weight (33.3%, n = 16), and jaundice (16.7%, n = 8). Hepatitis B virus infection was documented in 37 patients (77%), whereas 4 patients had hepatitis C virus infection. Patients were treated with standard dose sorafenib (n = 30), BSC alone (n = 14), or transarterial chemoembolization followed by sorafenib (n = 4). Sorafenib therapy was well-tolerated in most cases. The median progression-free survival with upfront sorafenib was 4.3 months. The median overall survival (OS) of the patients who received upfront sorafenib was significantly better than those treated with BSC alone (5.9 vs 3.0 months; log-rank P= 0.00).Conclusion:Sorafenib therapy was well-tolerated and provided about 3 months longer median OS in our patients with advanced HCC than those treated with BSC alone.
