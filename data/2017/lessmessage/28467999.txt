Cancer cells possessing "stemness," or stem-cell properties, are referred to as cancer stem cells (CSC) or cancer-initiating cells. The concept that these cells rest at the apex of the cancer hierarchy is an evolving theme in cancer research. These cells are by definition primarily responsible for the initiation and propagation of tumors as well as relapse after therapy, and they are therefore of major scientific interest. Several studies indicate that hepatocellular carcinomas that harbor phenotypic features of stem cells and progenitor cells constitute a subclass of therapeutically challenging cancers that are associated with a particularly poor prognosis. We recently demonstrated that any cell type in the mouse hepatic lineage can undergo oncogenic reprogramming into a CSC by activating different cell type-specific pathways [1]. Identification of common and cell of origin-specific phenotypic and genetic changes could provide new therapeutic targets for liver cancer.
