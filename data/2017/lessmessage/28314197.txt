Objectives:To determine the prognostic value of Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI findings of liver metastasis from breast cancer.Methods:29 metastatic lesions from 12 breast cancer patients who received chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. We evaluated hepatobiliary phase of the lesions and classified them as a "target" or "non-target" appearance. The relationship of appearance or SI ratio with tumor response was analyzed.Results:A non-target appearance was more frequent in disease control group than in non-control group [14/18 (77.8%) vs. 4/18 (22.2%)], and it was associated with a better response [p=0.048].Conclusion:HBP analysis may be useful to predict the response to chemotherapy and survival.
