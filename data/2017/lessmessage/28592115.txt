Immunological microenvironment is not only composed of multiple immune cells, but also deposited various inflammation factors that regulate immune response to tumor cells. To ascertain the crucial immune factors presented in hepatocellular carcinoma microenvironment (HCM), tumor tissue culture supernatant (TCS) and the corresponding non-tumor tissue culture supernatant (NCS) from patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were analyzed by antibody array technology. Among the inflammation-associated cytokines assayed, high level of chemokines CXCL8/IL-8 (6.82-fold increase) and CXCL10/IP-10 (16.45-fold increase) in TCS than that in paired NCS were evidently identified. And low expression of IL-16 (0.14-fold decrease) and RANTES/CCL5 (0.17-fold decrease) in TCS were also uncovered. Especially, overexpression of CXCL10 in primary HCC compared with their non-tumor counterparts was significantly associated with serum AFP level (P = 0.004), tumor size (P = 0.021), tumor number (P
