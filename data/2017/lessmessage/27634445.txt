Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, acute kidney injury (AKI) may occur after TACE due to the contrast agent and cytotoxic anticancer drugs used in this procedure. Post-TACE AKI is not an unusual event, and may adversely affect patient outcome. Coexisting situations including cirrhosis, renal insufficiency, diabetes and hypertension play a role in the development of HCC, and may predispose patients to AKI after TACE. Most post-TACE are transient and reversible, while prolonged AKI may predict a decreased survival. The best strategy to manage post-TACE AKI is prevention. Patients, before undergoing TACE, should be carefully assessed. In this study, we reviewed the current literature published in English about the incidence rate, risk factors, management and prognosis of AKI in patients with HCC undergoing TACE for a better understanding of this complication.
