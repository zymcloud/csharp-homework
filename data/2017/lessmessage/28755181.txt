Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of diseases involving a genetic defect that alters a metabolic pathway and that presents usually during infancy. The tyrosine degradation pathway contains five enzymes, four of which being associated with IEMs. The most severe metabolic disorder associated with this catabolic pathway is hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1; OMIM 276700). HT1 is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the last enzyme of the tyrosine catabolic pathway. Although a rare disease worldwide, HT1 shows higher incidence in certain populations due to founder effects. The acute form of the disease is characterized by an early onset and severe liver failure while the chronic form appears later and also involves renal dysfunctions. Until 1992 the only treatment for this disease was liver transplantation. Since then, NTBC/Nitisone (a drug blocking the pathway upstream of FAH) is successfully used in combination with a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine, but patients are still at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. This chapter summarizes the biochemical and clinical features of HT1.
