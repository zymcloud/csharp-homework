Background/aim:Ovarian cancer remains one of the most commonly encountered malignancies affecting women worldwide, that is unfortunately commonly diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease. In these stages, the tumoral process usually involves the surrounding viscera throughout contiguity or induces the apparition of distant metastases via peritoneal, lymphatic or hematogenous spread, multiple resections being needed in order to achieve a good control of the disease.Patients and methods:In the present study, we present a case series of 12 patients in whom various surgical procedures on the rectosigmoidian loop were performed in order to achieve debulking surgery to no residual disease.Results:Digestive tract resections consisted of rectosigmoidian resection with left colostomy in three cases, low rectosigmoidian resections with anastomosis in eight cases and a stripping procedure of the peritoneal layer in one case.Conclusion:Due to the close proximity of the digestive and gynecological tract, advanced-stage ovarian tumors frequently involve the rectosigmoidian loop, imposing association of digestive tract surgical procedures.
