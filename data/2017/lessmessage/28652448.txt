Background:Prognosis of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is poor. In this study, we assessed the predictive value of easily available baseline factors for prolonged survival.Patients and methods:We conducted a retrospective study on patients who received gemcitabine between 1999 and 2010 for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The primary end-point was the 12-month survival rate.Results:We included 195 patients. The median age was 62.9 years; the performance status was 0-1 in 80 and 2-3 in 92 patients. The median number of metastatic sites was one. A total of 73 patients (37.4%) were alive 12 months after beginning chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis, no liver metastasis, CA19-9 level <250 IU/ml and localized or locally advanced cancer at diagnosis were good prognostic factors. According to a clinical score based on these features, overall survival was 7.7, 13.5, 19.7 and 21.0 months, respectively (p<0.001).Conclusion:We identified easily available prognostic factors for prolonged survival in patients treated with gemcitabine.
