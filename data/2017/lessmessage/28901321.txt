Purpose:To assess the value of conventional transarterial embolization/chemoembolization (cTAE/TACE) therapy via extrahepatic arteries for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients with unresectable HCC who underwent cTAE/TACE therapy via extrahepatic arteries between May 2008 and July 2016 across 4 medical centers were identified. The technical success, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels changes, tumor response, disease control rate, survival rate, and major complication were analyzed.Results:A total of 185 patients (167 male and 18 female) were included in this study. A total of 401 procedures were performed of the 185 patients, with 2.2 ± 0.4 procedures for each patient. A total of 197 extrahepatic arteries were identified, including inferior phrenic artery (n = 80), omental artery (n = 39), gastric artery (n = 22), right renal capsular artery (n = 21), adrenal artery (n = 13), cystic artery (n = 11), and right internal mammary artery (n = 11). The technical success rate was 96.8% (179/185). The serum AFP levels were significantly reduced at 1 month after treatment in 71 patients whose AFP ≥400 ng/mL preprocedure (P Conclusion:cTAE/TACE therapy via the extrahepatic arteries can reduce the incidence of presence of residual HCC, and improve the therapeutic efficacy of cTAE/TACE.
