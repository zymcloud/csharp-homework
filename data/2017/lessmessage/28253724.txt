Here we assessed the predictive value of gamma-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) for the prognosis of patients with HCC and compared the γ-GT with other prognostic factors. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes for 858 patients first diagnosed with HCC. Cox univariate and multivariate analyses receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used for the study of significance of prognostic factor. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess the value of γ-GT as an HCC prognostic factor in different classifications of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) or Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) and different levels of serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP). We showed patient survival rates were significantly associated with γ-GT as well as serum biological markers including absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), AFP. A γ-GT ≥ 75 U/L strongly indicated poor prognosis for HCC patients. The survival time of patients with γ-GT ≥ 75 U/L was significantly shorter in advanced BCLC and TNM stages and at any serum AFP level. All these results suggested that baseline γ-GT could effectively aid in determining the prognosis of patients with HCC, and the prognostic value of γ-GT ≥ 75 U/L was superior to that of Child-Pugh class, MELD stage, and serum AFP.
