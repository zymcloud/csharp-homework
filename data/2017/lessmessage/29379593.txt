Aim:The aim of this study was to address the association of the EGF gene +61A/G polymorphisms and HCC susceptibility in an Iranian population.Background:The association of epidermal growth factor (EGF) gene +61A/G polymorphism (rs4444903) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been investigated in several populations. However, the findings are controversial.Methods:A total of 40 unrelated HCC patients and 106 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA of HCC patients was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples using CinnaPure DNA kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA of healthy individuals, also, was extracted from peripheral blood cells using the boiling method. The rs4444903 (A/G) polymorphism was genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method.Results:Significant association was found for the EGF +61A allele and HCC risk [OR = 1.72, 95% CI (1.02 - 2.90), P value = 0.04]. Also, significant association was observed for the EGF +61A/G genotypes and HCC risk under codominant and dominant models by SNPStats software analysis.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that the EGF gene +61A/G polymorphism (rs4444903) might be a risk factor for susceptibility to HCC in Iranian population. However, further studies using more samples are needed.
