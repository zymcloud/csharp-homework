Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common types of liver cancer, could be treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Due to its side effects, 5-FU is more often used as the co-administration drug in clinical practice. Secalonic acid-F (SAF), isolated from a fungal strain identified in our lab as Aspergillus aculeatus, showed potent biological activities. The goal of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of SAF on hepatocellular carcinoma and to compare it with that of 5-FU. Results showed that SAF effectively inhibited cell growth with a dose-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. And the inhibitory effects of SAF were stronger than that of 5-FU. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of SAF to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was similar to that of 5-FU. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that SAF arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase and induced apoptosis with a dose-dependent manner by activating caspase3 and caspase9 through a mitochondrial pathway. Consequently, SAF may be a better potential candidate compound for human cancer treatment; these results will afford more data for antitumor agent design in detail.
