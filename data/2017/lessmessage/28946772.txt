Cinobufacini, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used widely for cancer treatment, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), sarcoma, and leukemia. Previous studies done by our lab indicated that cinobufacini could suppress HCC cells through mitochondria-mediated and Fas-mediated apoptotic pathways. Here, we use a combination of cinobufacini and doxorubicin to inhibit the growth of HCC cells. The combination group induced more significant apoptosis by affecting proteins and RNA of apoptosis-related elements, such as Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, and cytochrome c. Furthermore, cinobufacini, as a mixture of a number of components, had stronger apoptosis-inducing activity than particular individual components or a simple mixture of a few components. Overall, these results suggested that the combination of cinobufacini and doxorubicin may provide a new strategy for inhibiting the proliferation of HCC cells.
