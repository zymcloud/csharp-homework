Introduction:In general population, gallstone pancreatitis is the most common cause of pancreatitis. However, there are very few literatures that address this topic in post-liver-transplant patients.Clinical case:A 69-year-old female who had a liver transplant in 2015 due to hepatocellular carcinoma and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis. She had a recent episode of acute cellular rejection that was treated with high dose methylprednisolone 1 week prior to admission. She presented with severe epigastric abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Her laboratory studies showed significantly elevated serum lipase, AST, and ALT from her baseline. She underwent urgent Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) with Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that showed common bile duct stone that was extracted.Discussion:Biliary sludge and stones accounted for 22% of late onset acute pancreatitis after liver transplant. Corticosteroids have been identified as one of the potential causes of drug-induced pancreatitis. However, she is more likely to have gall stone pancreatitis since she also had dilated common bile duct and intrahepatic duct. In addition, there was CBD stone noted on ERCP.Conclusion:Acute gallstone associated pancreatitis after liver transplant is not uncommon. Patients generally have good outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted.
