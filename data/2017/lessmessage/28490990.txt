During the last twenty years, a huge progress has been achieved in the treatment of liver cancer and recent strategies include interventional radiology, chemotherapy regimens and surgery. Meanwhile, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SRBT) has developed in the treatment of all organs with millimetre accuracy, very few side effects and a high control rate. So, SRBT has become a therapeutic weapon in his own right in liver tumour treatment. Many publications have reported encouraging results in colorectal liver metastasis, hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhosis and peripheric cholangiocarcinoma. It is important that radiation therapists involve systematic multidisciplinary "liver tumour" meetings to discuss therapeutic indications and initiate treatments quickly.
