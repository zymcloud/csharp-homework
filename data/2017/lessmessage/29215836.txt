Clinical characteristics:Rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome (RTPS) is characterized by a markedly increased risk of developing rhabdoid tumors â€“ rare and highly aggressive malignant tumors occurring predominantly in infants and children younger than age three years. Rhabdoid tumors can occur in almost any anatomic location, commonly in the central nervous system (i.e., atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor [AT/RT]); more than 50% occur in the cerebellum.Other common locations include extracranial extrarenal malignant rhabdoid tumors (e.g., rhabdoid tumors of the head and neck, paravertebral muscles, liver, bladder, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, pelvis, and heart) (eMRT), rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (RTK), and possibly small-cell carcinoma of the ovary (hypercalcemic type). Individuals with RTPS typically present before age 12 months with synchronous tumors that exhibit aggressive clinical behavior.Diagnosis/testing:The diagnosis of RTPS is established in a proband with a rhabdoid tumor and/or a family history of rhabdoid tumor and/or multiple SMARCA4- or SMARCB1-deficient tumors (synchronous or metachronous) and identification of a germline heterozygous pathogenic variant in SMARCA4 or SMARCB1 by molecular genetic testing.Management:Treatment of manifestations: Due to the rarity of RTPS, standards for management are evolving. Most individuals are treated by intensive multimodal therapeutic strategies, according to institutional preference combining surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy may be discussed after childbearing.Prevention of secondary manifestations: Consider risk-reducing treatment strategies (e.g., postpone or replace radiotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy or proton beam therapy; targeted therapy used concomitantly with, or before, standard chemotherapy).Surveillance: From birth to age one year:Monthly physical and neurologic examination, head ultrasound, and abdominal and pelvic ultrasound recommended.If not feasible for patients with AT/RT, monthly head ultrasound plus abdominal and pelvic ultrasound every two to three months is a minimum requirement. If fontanelle closes prematurely consider head MRI every two to three months.For patients with eMRT, RTK: monthly head, abdominal, and pelvic ultrasound examination.If ultrasound is not sufficient consider MRI at least every two to three months for affected site and ultrasound for all other sites. Whole-body MRI is desirable but not universally available.From age one year to age four to five years:For patients with AT/RT: brain and total spine MRI every three monthsIf available, consider whole-body MRI. (Note: Whole-body MRI resolution may not be sufficent for brain MRI, which would then need to be performed separately).For patients with eMRT, RTK: abdominal and pelvic ultrasound or MRI (or whole-body MRI) every three months.After age four years:Twice-yearly physical examination in a tumor predisposition clinic with targeted imaging for symptomatic areas.For patients with SMARCA4-related SCCOHT: abdominal and pelvic ultrasound every six months.Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of screening, treatment, and preventive measures.Genetic counseling:RTPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The vast majority of individuals diagnosed with RTPS have the disorder as the result of a de novo germline SMARCB1 pathogenic variant. Most reported individuals diagnosed with SMARCA4-related RTPS inherited a pathogenic variant from an unaffected parent. Each child of an individual with a germline SMARCA4 or SMARCB1 pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. However, penetrance appears to be incomplete and the types of RTPS-related tumors can vary among different members of the same family. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.
