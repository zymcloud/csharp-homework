Liver carcinogenesis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a subject of intense research nowadays, since NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease, affecting a great percentage of the population worldwide, while hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which represents the most common primary liver malignancy, is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The underlying pathogenic pathways of both NAFLD and HCC are not completely understood, but there is growing evidence that they share many common pathophysiologic mechanisms and risk factors. Due to lack of solid evidence, though, the ultimate goal of designing effective diagnostic tools, treatment options and screening policies remain unmet for the time being. This review article aims to present recent data available regarding pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of HCC and NAFLD, as well as to highlight the importance of the development of HCC in the setting of NAFLD and NASH.
