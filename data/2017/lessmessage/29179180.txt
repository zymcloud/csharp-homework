Background/aims:Systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is widely considered as a preoperative risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) outcomes. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), two of the prognostic indices, have been investigated in post-therapeutic recurrence and survival of HCC. Here, we quantify the prognostic value of these two biomarkers and evaluate their consistency in different HCC therapies.Methods:A systematic review of electronic database of the Web of Science, Embase, PubMed and the Cochrane Library was conducted to search for associations between the NLR and PLR in the blood and clinical outcomes of HCC. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were the primary outcomes, and hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were explored as effect measures. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the heterogeneity of different therapies.Results:A total of 24 articles comprising 6318 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled outcomes revealed that a high NLR before treatment predicted a poor OS (HR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.34 to 1.76, pConclusion:An increased NLR or PLR indicated poor outcomes for patients with HCC. The NLR and PLR may be considered as reliable and inexpensive biomarkers for making clinical decisions regarding HCC treatment.
