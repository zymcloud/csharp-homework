Background:Tumors classified based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are heterogeneous in nature. Previously, the Kinki criterion was proposed for a more precise subclassification of tumors in BCLC-stage B. However, tumors in sub-stage B2 include various size and number of HCCs even with the Kinki criteria, which could lead to heterogeneity for overall survival (OS). In this study, we assessed how the size and number of tumors affect the OS and time to progression (TTP) in patients with Kinki criteria stage B2 tumors and treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Of 906 HCC patients treated with TACE at Kindai University Hospital, 236 patients with HCC considered as Kinki criteria stage B2 were examined. They were classified into the following 4 groups according to the maximum tumor diameter and number of tumors: B2a group, tumor size ≤6 cm and total number of tumors ≤6; B2b group, size ≤6 cm and number >6; B2c group, size >6 cm and number ≤6; and B2d group, size >6 cm and number >6. The OS and TTP of patients in each group were compared.Results:There were 131 patients (55.5%) in the B2a group, 58 (24.6%) in the B2b group, 41 (17.4%) in the B2c group, and 6 (0.03%) in the B2d group. Comparison of the survivals revealed that the median OS was 2.8 years (95% CI 2.0-3.5) in the B2a group, 2.8 years (95% CI 2.0-3.3) in the B2b group, 1.9 years (95% CI 0.8-4.0) in the B2c group, and 2.3 years (95% CI 1.2-ND [no data]) in the B2d group, respectively (p = 0.896). The median TTP in B2a, B2b, B2c, and B2d sub-substage HCC were13.2, 12.1, 13.8, and 11.5 months, respectively (p = 0.047). The median TTP in B2a + B2c sub-substage patients was longer than that in B2b + B2d sub-substage HCC patients (14.0 months and 10.4 months; p = 0.002).Conclusion:No significant differences were observed in the OS among HCC patients subclassified based on the maximum tumor diameter and tumor number in Kinki criteria stage B2. Consequently, Kinki criteria stage B2 HCC is a homogeneous subgroup in terms of OS prediction. However, shorter TTP in B2b+B2c sub-substage HCC patients than that in B2a + B2c sub-substage HCC patients suggests that different treatment strategy, such as systemic therapy with targeted agents instead of TACE, may be suitable to preserve the liver function.
