Background and objectives:To investigate the effect of overweight status on the 6-month survival rate in patients with extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods and study design:We retrospectively analyzed the records of 51 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic metastases between 2007 and 2010 before treatment. The associations among overweight status (body mass index [BMI] >24 kg/m2), demographic variables, and survival outcome were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:BMI>24 kg/m2 was significantly associated with the 6-month survival rate (p=0.042). Gender (p=0.149), Child Pugh classification (p=0.149), Okuda staging (p=0.093), and albumin concentration >3.5 mg/dL (p=0.082) showed marginal survival benefits in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis confirmed that BMI >24 kg/m2 was an independent prognostic factor for the 6-month survival rate (p=0.03).Conclusions:BMI >24 kg/m2 was associated with an improved 6-month survival rate in patients with extrahepatic metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
