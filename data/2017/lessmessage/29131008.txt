Background/aims:Increasing evidence has indicated that Forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2) plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, the expression and the role of FOXC2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been extensively studied.Methods:FOXC2 expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry in HCC tissue and cells. The relationship between FOXC2 expression and patient clinical significance and survival were assessed by Pearson's correlation and Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively. Cell proliferation assays, colony formation assays, flow cytometric analysis and Transwell assays were employed to measure the effects of FOXC2 on HCC cells in vitro.Results:The expression of FOXC2 was increased in HCC tissue, and high FOXC2 expression was associated with worse patient survival. Knockdown of FOXC2 inhibited HCC cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as tumor growth. Furthermore, we found that activation of AKT-mediated MMP-2 and MMP-9 was involved in FOXC2 promoting an aggressive phenotype.Conclusions:Taken together, these findings demonstrate that FOXC2 is upregulated in HCC tissue and is associated with tumor size, vascular invasion and advanced TNM stage. Further investigation suggested that FOXC2 may play a vital role in promoting proliferation and invasion in HCC and serves as a novel therapeutic target in HCC.
