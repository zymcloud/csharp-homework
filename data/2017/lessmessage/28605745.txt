Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive liver tumor with a poor 5-year survival rate. Many HCCs are not amenable to surgical resection, because of tumor size, location, or because of the patient's poor liver function, a common obstacle to HCC therapy, because HCCs almost always develop in chronically inflamed livers.Summary:In recent years, many efforts have been made to improve patient survival by conducting clinical trials investigating local and systemic treatment options for patients with unresectable tumors. These treatment options include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), selective internal radiotherapy with yttrium-90 (SIRT), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), proton beam therapy, molecular targeted therapy, and checkpoint inhibition. In this "to-the-point" article, we review the current standard and summarize the most recent findings in unresectable HCC treatment.Key points:(1) RFA is currently the preferred treatment for patients with tumor burden restricted to the liver and not eligible for surgical resection; (2) TACE is utilized in patients who are not eligible for RFA because of tumor location and/or number of tumor lesions; (3) SIRT might improve treatment responses achieved by TACE and is feasible in patients with portal vein thrombosis; (4) new radiation therapy treatment modalities such as SBRT and proton beam therapy show promising results for local tumor control; and (5) sorafenib remains the first-line systemic treatment option after several large clinical trials have failed to show superiority of other molecular targeted therapies in HCC patients.
