Background:The presence of liver fibrosis is the common denominator in numerous chronic liver diseases that can progress to fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Most important, with respect to frequency, are viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, the prevalence of which is increasing in epidemic proportions. Liver biopsy, albeit imperfect, continues to be the criterion standard, but in many clinical situations tends to be replaced with noninvasive imaging methods.Objectives:The aim of the present article was to describe our imaging department experience with magnetic resonance elastography and to analyze and discuss recently published results in gastroenterology, hepatology, and radiology from other authors in the literature, complemented with a PubMed search covering the last 10 years.Results and conclusions:Magnetic resonance elastography is an efficacious, noninvasive method with results that are concordant with liver biopsy. It is superior to ultrasound elastography because it evaluates a much greater volume of hepatic tissue and shows the often heterogeneous lesion distribution. The greatest advantage of the magnetic resonance protocol described is the fact that it quantifies fibrosis, fat content, and iron content in the same 25min examination specifically directed for that purpose, resulting in a favorable cost-benefit ratio for the patient and/or institution.
