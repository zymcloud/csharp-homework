Thyroid carcinoma (TC) represents 1-2 % of all human tumors, and is the seventh most common tumor. Women are in large majority among new patients. For women, this is the fifth most common tumor. In the Czech Republic, 1 143 new cases of TC were diagnosed in 2015. It is the tumor with the highest increase in incidence. Among newly diagnosed tumors, most of those are differentiated thyroid gland carcinomas (DTCs) originating from follicular thyroid cells. These tumors are follicular and papillary carcinomas and Hurthle carcinoma, accounting for 95 % of new cases. Due to the great progress in treatment, the prognosis is most commonly good for these tumors. Treatment is more difficult for other types of tumors. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (representing less than 1 % of thyroid tumors) is a rare form of thyroid cancer that is very malignant. Also found in the thyroid gland is Euro-C-cell tumor, which originates in C cells. This is the so-called medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is less common (5 % of all thyroid carcinomas). It emerges from the parapolyclic neuroendocrine cells of the thyroid gland. This tumor often metastasizes to the cervical lymph nodes, and frequently occurs in distant bone, liver and lung metastases. In 2015, in this publication we published an article: Thyroid gland carcinomas, current therapeutic procedures. This article was devoted to the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma and individual treatment procedures. In this article, we look at differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs), especially current opinions on the treatment of low-risk carcinomas.Key words: differentiated thyroid cancer - radioidine - targeted therapy.
