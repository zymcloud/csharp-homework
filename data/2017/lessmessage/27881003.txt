Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer associated mortality. Accumulating evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as critical factors for tumor recurrence and metastasis. MiR-508-5p has been reported as a down-regulated miRNA in the primary gastric cancer tissues. However, the role of miR-508-5p on HCC has not been well elucidated. In this study, we observed that miR-508-5p was downregulated in HCC tissues when compared to the non-tumorous tissues. We then demonstrated that overexpression of miR-508-5p attenuated HepG2 cells proliferation and invasion and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, our further investigations revealed that mesoderm development candidate 1 (MESDC1) is a potential target of miR-508-5p, as well as miR-508-5p overexpression downregulated MESDC1 expression. Overexpression of MESDC1 promoted HepG2 cells migration, invasion and proliferation in vitro. In addition, miR-508-5p markedly suppressed the tumor growth in xenograft model, while MESDC1 promoted the tumor growth in xenograft model. This study provides new insight into molecular mechanisms that miR-508-5p acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting MESDC1 in HCC progression.
