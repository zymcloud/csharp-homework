Background:Interferon-based antiviral therapies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been shown to reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with sustained viral response (SVR). Recently, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have been proven to be much more effective in achieving SVR than interferon-based therapies. However, whether DAAs can efficiently prevent the occurrence of HCC after SVR remains controversial. To clarify this issue, we analyzed the clinical features of patients in whom HCC developed after achievement of SVR with DAAs for chronic HCV infection.Summary:Among patients who achieved SVR with daclatasvir and asunaprevir (n = 100), HCC developed in 17 patients (HCC group; n = 17) and did not develop in 83 patients (non-HCC group; n = 83) during a mean observation period of 15 months. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified past history of HCC and male sex as significant risk factors for the emergence of HCC after DAAs. Sixteen cases with HCC after DAAs were in the very early or early stage (16/17, 94.1%), and one case was in the advanced stage (1/17, 5.9%) with portal venous tumor thrombus. Radiofrequency ablation and/or transarterial chemoembolization were performed in most cases as curative therapy (16/17, 94.1%). Key Messages: SVR by DAAs did not completely prevent the occurrence of HCC. However, even if HCC did develop after SVR, curative anticancer therapy was applicable in most cases.
