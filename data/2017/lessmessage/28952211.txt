Purpose:To determine the expression levels of PTEN and p53 genes in HBsAg-positive liver tumors and analyze the data for correlations of the expression levels of each gene with pathological features of primary liver cancer (PLC).Methods:Blood and postoperative tissues were collected from 43 cases diagnosed with PLC treated in our hospital. The cases included 29 HBsAg-positive and 14 HBsAg-negative PLC. The mRNA expression levels of PTEN and p53 in normal liver, tumor-adjacent and liver tumor samples were detected via RT-PCR. Additionally, protein expression levels of PTEN and p53 in different liver tissues were detected via immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results:RT-PCR results showed that the relative mRNA expression levels of PTEN and mutant p53 in PLC and tumor-adjacent tissues were significantly different (p0.05). The protein expression levels of p53 were highest in cancer tissues, but the levels revealed no correlation with the presence of the HBV antigen, the tumor diameter, the AFP levels, the pathologic grade, or the invasion and metastasis capabilities of the tumor tissues (p>0.05). Finally, Spearman correlation analysis showed that the levels of PTEN exhibited no correlation with the levels of mutant p53 (rs=-0.021, p>0.05).Conclusion:This study showed that the expression of PTEN was significantly reduced in PLC when compared to its expression in normal liver; and the expression levels were associated with the pathologic grade, invasion and metastasis capabilities of the tumor. On the other hand, p53 expression was high in PLC tissues but no correlations to the cancer's characteristics were found.
