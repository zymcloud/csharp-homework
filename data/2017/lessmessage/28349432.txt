Double-stranded RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) has shown promising results over posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) due to its long term and heritable nature. Various research groups have shed light on different mechanisms by which TGS operate. Some of these include histone modification, DNA methylation, or restriction of RNA polymerase binding onto the target gene's promoter. This serves as an added advantage since permanent c-Myc inactivation is critical for suppressing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Inability to target cancer cells specifically, without affecting the normal cells, has been one of the biggest drawbacks of an effective cancer therapy. Therefore, we aimed to overcome this barrier by first generating tumor-specific transcriptional units expressing TGS inducing shRNAs against c-Myc's P2 promoter only in neoplastic liver cells. Secondly, we coupled this TGS inducing system with Sendai fusion virosomes for liver-specific delivery to minimize nonspecific side effects in vitro.
