Aim:Liver transplantation (LT) is the most effective treatment for long-term survival from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, insufficient donors limit therapy. We sought to identify characteristics that predicted long-term survival after non-transplant therapies in patients with small HCC.Methods:In a database of 1,050 HCC patients, we identified those with single HCC â‰¤ 3.0 cm, who underwent hepatic resection (HR, n = 16), radiofrequency ablation (RFA, n = 55), or LT (n = 23) with 5-years follow-up. Survival and odds-ratios for survival (OS) after HR/RFA were calculated for MELD score, platelet count, creatinine, albumin, AST/Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), INR, and bilirubin.Results:LT patients had 3 and 5-year OS of 82.6% and 73.9% compared to HR/RFA patients with 3 and 5-year OS of 40.8% and 33.8%. The strongest predictors of survival after HR/RFA were MELD Conclusion:Patients with MELD
