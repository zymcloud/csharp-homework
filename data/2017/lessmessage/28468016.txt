Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. HCC represents more than 90% of primary liver cancers. There is growing incidence of HCC worldwide. In the western world, HCC arises in a cirrhotic background in up to 90% of cases, and cirrhosis itself is a progressive disease that affects patient survival. Thus, outcome in patients with HCC and the chances for anti-tumor treatment and it is results are dependent not only on tumor-associated factors but also on the liver function. Cholangio carcinoma is the second most common primary liver tumor with an estimated incidence of 1:100,000. Cholangiocarcinoma can be sub-classified as intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar or distal where iCCA arises within the liver parenchyma. Overall, the incidence of iCCA seems to be increasing globally. This may be attributed to a global increase of risk factors shared between HCC and iCCA, such as viral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, obesity, NASH, and others.
