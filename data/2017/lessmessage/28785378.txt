The carcinogenic potential of phenobarbital (PB) was assessed in a mouse line carrying a mutant Mmh allele of the Mmh/Ogg1 gene encoding the enzyme oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (Ogg1) responsible for the repair of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Mmh homozygous mutant (Ogg1-/-) and wild-type (Ogg1+/+) male and female, 10-week-old, mice were treated with 500 ppm PB in diet for 78 weeks. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were found in PB-treated Ogg1-/- mice, while Ogg1+/+ animals developed only hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) at the same rate. This was coordinated with PB-induced significant elevation of 8-OHdG formation in DNA and cell proliferation in adjacent liver of Ogg1-/- mice. Proteome analysis predicted activation of transcriptional factor Nrf2 in the livers and HCAs of PB-administered Ogg1+/+ mice; however, its activation was insufficient or absent in the livers and HCCs of Ogg1-/- mice, respectively. Significant elevation of phase I and II metabolizing enzymes was demonstrated in both Ogg1-/- and Ogg1+/+ animals. Treatment of Ogg1-/- mice with PB resulted in significant elevation of cell proliferation in the liver. These results indicate that PB induced progression from HCA to HCC in Ogg1-/- mice, due to persistent accumulation of DNA oxidative base modifications and suppression of Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response, resulting in significant elevation of cell proliferation.
