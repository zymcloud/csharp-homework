Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) urinary bladder is known to metastasize to regional lymph nodes (LNs), liver, lung, bone, adrenal glands, and intestine. However, an asymptomatic TCC bladder manifesting as metastatic axillary LN mass and extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is rarely heard of. A 46-year-old male, smoker, presented with 8 cm Ã— 6 cm right axillary swelling of 1-month duration. Aspiration cytology revealed metastatic deposits of poorly differentiated carcinoma favoring TCC. Metastatic evaluation with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) scan showed mass lesion urinary bladder, conglomerate right axillary mass and extensive retroperitoneal LNs with significant metabolic activity, biopsy from which revealed deposits of TCC. Transurethral-resection of bladder confirmed TCC and was exhibited palliative chemotherapy on which he progressed. Received palliative radiotherapy to axilla to which he showed significant symptomatic clinical response. He developed obstructive uropathy and was kept on supportive care. Review of literature reveals that our case may be the second case of TCC bladder with generalized lymphadenopathy and the first case of asymptomatic bladder carcinoma manifesting with upfront disseminated abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy detected by 18FDG-PET scan ever reported in world literature.
