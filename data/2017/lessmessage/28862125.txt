The usual neoplastic dissease involving suprarenal glands are adrenal metastaes. The majority of suprarenal metastatic disease arise from lung cancer, followed by the stomach and colon cancer, oesophagus, the liver/bile ducts cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Invasive mammary carcinoma usually spreads to the bones, lungs, lymph nodes, liver and the brain. Adrenal gland metastases from invasive no special type carcinoma represents an extremly low rate number of cases. We discuss about a 66 year old patient who presented with a solitary adrenal metastases from triple negative breast invasive carcinoma. The patient underwent total left adrenalectomy in June 2016. No further adjuvants therapies were performed. At the time of writing the patient is in good condition, without any evidence of recurrence. The role of surgical and adjuvant therapy in treating adrenal metastases after breast cancer in survival rate will be determined in future studies.
