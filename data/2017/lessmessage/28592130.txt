Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Although advances have made in treatment of HCC, the overall survival rate remains low and the molecular pathogenesis of HCC is still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the molecular pathogenesis of HCC. A total of 89 patients were involved in the study. MicroRNA-93 (miR-93) was aberrantly up-regulated in HCC tissues as determined by qRT-PCR. The high level of miR-93 was closely associated with larger tumor size (p
