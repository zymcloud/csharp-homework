Background/aim:Determination of failure of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B (BCLC-B) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become important because of the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. We evaluated the usefulness and efficacy of the newly proposed time to TACE progression (TTTP).Patients and methods:From 2006 to 2016, 192 BCLC-B HCC patients [median age 72 years, male/female ratio = 149/43, Child-Pugh score 5/6/7 = 106/56/30, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade 1/2 = 64/128, Kinki criteria B1/B2 = 64/128] were enrolled. TTTP was defined based on a previous report and first imaging performed 3 months after initial TACE had been used to obtain baseline images. The patients were divided into three groups according to TTTP (Results:The median number of TACE procedures was 4 (interquartile range 3-7). There was a moderate correlation between TTTP and OS (r = 0.527, 95% CI 0.416-0.622, p 100 ng/mL) (HR 1.540, 95% CI 1.035-2.291, p = 0.033), and TTTP (Conclusion:In patients with reduced TTTP, especially
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B; Conventional transarterial chemoembolization; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Overall survival; Time to transarterial chemoembolization progression; Transarterial chemoembolization-refractory status.
