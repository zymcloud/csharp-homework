Aim:The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the toxicity and tumor response of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) protocol for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in our institution.Background:Hepatocellular cancer is one of the leading cancers among men in India. In recent years, SBRT has emerged as a promising tool in the treatment of HCC.Materials and methods:Ten patients diagnosed as HCC with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B and C, treated with SBRT technique from January 2013 to December 2016, were included in this study. SBRT was delivered using 6 MV photons with volumetric modulated arc therapy. Acute and late toxicities were graded, and tumor response was assessed using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:The median age was 61.5 (52-69) years. The radiation dose ranged from 35 Gy to 60 Gy. All patients obtained partial response during assessment at 3 months after completion of treatment. The median PFS is 8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] - 5.22-10.77 months). The median OS is 51 months (95% CI - 17.64-65.10 months). The OS at 1 and 2 years is 75% and 57%, respectively.Conclusions:SBRT is well tolerated by our patients. The 1- and 2-year OS of 75% and 57% is consistent with other prospective and retrospective SBRT studies from the literature.
