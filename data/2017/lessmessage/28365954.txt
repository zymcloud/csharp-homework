Purpose:Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy among women, while isolated operable liver metastases (LMs) from BC are very rare and occur in only 1-5% of the patients. Besides, positive steroid receptor (SR) status for oestrogen and/or progesterone is known as a factor which improves disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of SR status on DFS and OS after liver metastasectomy in female patients with primary BC.Methods:We analyzed 32 medical records of female patients diagnosed and treated for primary BC with LMS as the first and only site of disease progression, at the Institute of Oncology and Radiology of Serbia (IORS), during 2006- 2009. All of them underwent primary BC surgery as well as LMs resection.Results:Patients with metachronous BC and LMs and positive SR status in both BC and LM (BC+/LM+) had a median time from BC to LM occurrence (TTLM) of 36 months, compared to BC+/LM- and BC-/LM- subgroups, whose medians for TTLM were 30.5 and 14.5 months, respectively (p<0.01). For all patients, positive SR status showed high correlation with longer DFS and OS after LM resection (medians according survival analysis for DFS/OS in subgroups BC-/LM-, BC+/LM- and BC+-LM+ were 10/19, 25/45, 50/not reached months respectively; p<0.01 for DFS/ OS). Cox regression analysis confirmed that the subgroup of patients with BC-/LM- had 10.8 and 18.8 higher risk of events for DFS (disease relapse or death) and event for OS (death only), respectively, compared to BC+/LM+ subgroup of patients.Conclusion:Positive SR status in BC and LM has a high impact not only on time from BC to LM occurrence, but also on longer DFS and OS after LM resection.
