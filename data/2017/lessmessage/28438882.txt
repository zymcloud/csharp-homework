Aim:The aim of the present study was to compare successful rate, failure reasons, and complications among procedures of histological rebiopsy.Patients and methods:We retrospectively reviewed medical records of histologically rebiopsied cases with non-small cell lung cancer.Results:One hundred and eleven histological rebiopsies were performed in: 86 (77%) lung; 11 (10%) lymph node; 5 (5%) pleura; 4 (4%) liver; 2 (2%) muscle; 2 (2%) adrenal gland; and 1 (1%) rib. Successful rate by computed tomography-guided biopsy (CTGB), transbronchial biopsy (TBB), and ultrasound-guided biopsy were 86% (48/56), 90% (28/31), and 100% (24/24), respectively. Reasons for rebiopsy failure by CTGB were no/insufficient malignant cells (n=5) and pneumothorax (n=3), and those by TBB were no/insufficient malignant cells (n=2) and bleeding (n=1). Severe complications (â‰¥grade 3): one grade 3 pneumothorax and one grade 4 air embolization were observed in two (2%, 2/111) cases receiving CTGB.Conclusion:Rebiopsy of histological samples can be highly successful and feasible by optimal procedural selection.
