Background:To assess the feasibility of dual-contrast spectral photon-counting computed tomography (SPCCT) for liver imaging.Methods:We present an SPCCT in-silico study for simultaneous mapping of the complementary distribution in the liver of two contrast agents (CAs) subsequently intravenously injected: a gadolinium-based contrast agent and an iodine-based contrast agent. Four types of simulated liver lesions with a characteristic arterial and portal venous pattern (haemangioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cyst, and metastasis) are presented. A material decomposition was performed to reconstruct quantitative iodine and gadolinium maps. Finally, a multi-dimensional classification algorithm for automatic lesion detection is presented.Results:Our simulations showed that with a single-scan SPCCT and an adapted contrast injection protocol, it was possible to reconstruct contrast-enhanced images of the liver with arterial distribution of the iodine-based CA and portal venous phase of the gadolinium-based CA. The characteristic patterns of contrast enhancement were visible in all liver lesions. The approach allowed for an automatic detection and classification of liver lesions using a multi-dimensional analysis.Conclusions:Dual-contrast SPCCT should be able to visualise the characteristic arterial and portal venous enhancement with a single scan, allowing for an automatic lesion detection and characterisation, with a reduced radiation exposure.
