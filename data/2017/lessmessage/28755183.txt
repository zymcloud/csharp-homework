Untreated HT1 rapidly degenerates into very severe liver complications often resulting in liver cancer. The molecular basis of the pathogenic process in HT1 is still unclear. The murine model of FAH-deficiency is a suitable animal model, which represents all phenotypic and biochemical manifestations of the human disease on an accelerated time scale. After removal of the drug 2-(2-N-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC), numerous signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and cancer are rapidly deregulated in FAH deficient mice. Among these, the Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway, the heat stress response (HSR), the Nrf2, MEK and ERK pathways, are highly represented. The p21 and mTOR pathways critical regulators of proliferation and tumorigenesis have also been found to be dysregulated. The changes in these pathways are described and related to the development of liver cancer.
