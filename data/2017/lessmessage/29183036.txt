Background/aims:The resection of hepatic tumors located in the region surrounded by the right hepatic vein (RHV) and the portal pedicles of the right paramedian/lateral sector (the right hepatic core) remains a challenge for liver surgeons. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the surgical techniques and outcomes of our atypical-parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy (atypical-PSH) approach for the removal of tumors in the right hepatic core.Methods:Perioperative records of 1,179 consecutive patients who had undergone hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma or colorectal liver metastases from January 2006 to December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed.Results:Twenty-six patients (2%) had a tumor in the right hepatic core. Among them, 20 patients underwent atypical-PSH, including the anterior approach (resection of the right paramedian hepatic parenchyma, n = 9), posterior approach (resection of the right lateral hepatic parenchyma, n = 10), and transhepatic approach (tumor enucleation from the raw surfaces along the RHV, n = 1). Their postoperative outcomes were similar to the remaining 6 patients who had undergone right hepatectomy.Conclusions:Atypical-PSH can be safely applied for the removal of tumors in the right hepatic core. This technique may have potential advantages in preserving hepatic function for postoperative chemotherapy and repeated hepatectomy for future recurrence.
