A 38-year-old Malayan gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) with a 2-week history of anorexia was found dead and presented for post-mortem examination. Numerous white firm nodules of various sizes were found on the surface of the liver, both left and right kidneys, the spleen and the serosa of the intestinal tract. All masses had similar microscopical appearance and were diagnosed as metastasizing fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells did not react with antibodies specific for pan-cytokeratin, vimentin or HepPar-1. The anti-HepPar-1 and anti-pan-cytokeratin antibodies also did not react with normal hepatocytes or exocrine pancreatic cells. This is the first description of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma with metastases in a crocodilian.
