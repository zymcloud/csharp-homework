Hepatic radioembolization with 90Y is an increasingly widely used locoregional therapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Its potential benefit has recently been described as a downstaging treatment, achieving a decreased tumour burden and allowing patients to be rescued for more radical treatments, such as liver transplantation. The case is presented of a patient diagnosed with multifocal bilobar hepatocellular carcinoma, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) intermediate stage, in whom treatment with 90Y achieved a satisfactory radiological response with a very significant reduction of tumour burden, allowing rescue with liver transplantation.
