A 60-year-old woman visited our hospital due to hematochezia. Colonoscopy revealed a 50-mm-diameter submucosal tumor with ulceration of the left side of the transverse colon, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the presence of small hepatic nodules. Submucosal tumor of the colon with liver metastasis was therefore diagnosed. To prevent tumor bleeding, we performed partial transverse colectomy. The histopathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma presenting as a submucosal tumor with a high frequency of vascular invasion. Computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a 40-mm-diameter confluent multinodular-type hepatocellular carcinoma with outward spread from segment II and multiple intrahepatic metastases. Our final diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma with hematogenous colon metastasis.
