Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays an essential role during carcinogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism between oxidative stress and carcinogenesis remains unknown. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) are revealed to be involved in oxidative stress response and carcinogenesis. This study aims to identify miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells which might involve in oxidative stress response. An integrated analysis of miRNA expression signature was performed by employing robust rank aggregation (RRA) method, and four miRNAs (miR-34a-5p, miR-1915-3p, miR-638, and miR-150-3p) were identified as the oxidative stress-responsive miRNAs. Pathway enrichment analysis suggested that these four miRNAs played an important role in antiapoptosis process. Our data also revealed miR-34a-5p and miR-1915-3p, but not miR-150-3p and miR-638, were regulated by p53 in HCC cell lines under oxidative stress. In addition, clinical investigation revealed that these four miRNAs might be involved in oxidative stress response by targeting oxidative stress-related genes in HCC tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that these four miRNAs were associated with patients' overall survival. In conclusion, we identified four oxidative stress-responsive miRNAs, which were regulated by p53-dependent (miR-34a-5p and miR-1915-3p) and p53-independent pathway (miR-150-3p and miR-638). These four miRNAs may offer new strategy for HCC diagnosis and prognosis.
