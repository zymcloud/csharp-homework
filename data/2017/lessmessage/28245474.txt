Background/aims:MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) have emerged as important post-transcriptional regulators in various cancers. miR-543 has been reported to play critical roles in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer, however, the role of miR-543 in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer has not been fully understood.Methods:Expression of miR-543 and Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP) in clinical prostate cancer specimens, two prostate cancer cell lines, namely LNCAP and C4-2B, were determined. The effects of miR-543 on proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells were also investigated with both in vitro and in vivo studies.Results:miR-543 was found to be negatively correlated with RKIP expression in clinical tumor samples and was significantly upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer cell line C4-2B compared with parental LNCAP cells. Further studies identified RKIP as a direct target of miR-543. Overexpression of miR-543 downregulated RKIP expression and promoted the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells, whereas knockdown of miR-543 increased expression of RKIP and suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion:Our study demonstrates that miR-543 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer via targeting RKIP.
