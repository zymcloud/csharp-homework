Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of death by cancer worldwide. Resection and liver transplantation are the gold standards, but only a minority of people are eligible. Percutaneous ablation therapies, such as microwave ablation (MWA), have consequently been developed. There is a lack of guidelines regarding the treatment of HCCs in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Here, we report the case of a 67-year-old patient who was undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) for chronic congestive heart failure and who presented with an HCC while undergoing PD. The tumor size was 48 mm. Due to the patient's comorbidities, MWA was chosen as a first-line treatment. Peritoneal dialysis was stopped 1 day before the MWA, which was performed by an interventional radiology department. There were no complications from the procedure. The treated area completely covered the tumoral lesion. Peritoneal dialysis was resumed 3 weeks after the MWA without any complications. The computed tomography (CT) scan performed 3 months later showed that the tumor mass had completely regressed; a year and a half after the MWA, no recurrence has been observed. This report shows that an MWA of an HCC in PD patients is a feasible and safe procedure.
