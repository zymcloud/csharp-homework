Purpose:To evaluate the prevalence of fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, and E) and zinc deficiency in patients with cirrhosis being assessed for liver transplantation and the correlations between vitamin deficiencies, nutritional markers, and severity of liver disease.Methods:This is a single centre retrospective study. Serum vitamin A, D, E, and zinc levels were collected in adult patients being assessed for liver transplantation between January and July 2012. Patient and liver disease demographics, nutritional markers, Child-Pugh score, and MELD-Na score were collected. Fisher's exact test and multiple variable logistic regression was used for statistical analysis.Results:A total of 109 adult patients were assessed for liver transplantation during the 6-month period. The mean patient age was 54 ± 10 years and 66% were males. Mean BMI was 27 ± 6 kg/m2, pre-albumin was 0.10 ± 0.07 g/L, albumin was 33 ± 6 g/L, total bilirubin was 48 ± 61 mmol/L, MELD-Na score was 16 ± 5 (range 6-33), and 15% had hepatocellular carcinoma. The Child-Pugh score was A in 29%, B in 54%, and C in 17%. The causes of liver disease were hepatitis C in 36%, alcohol in 20%, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in 17%, and other in 27%. The mean vitamin A level was 0.88 ± 0.86 umol/L, D was 69 ± 52 nmol/L, E was 24 ± 17 umol/L, and zinc was 477 ± 145 ug/L. Vitamin A deficiency was prevalent in 77%, D in 63%, E in 37%, and zinc in 84%. On multiple variable analysis, low albumin (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.65-0.94, p = 0.0069) was a predictor of vitamin A deficiency ; cholestatic liver enzyme elevation (OR = 3.53, 95%CI = 1.40-8.89, p = 0.0073) and low albumin (OR = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.73-0.94, p = 0.0032) were predictors of vitamin D deficiency ; low albumin (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74-0.97, p = 0.015) was a predictor of vitamin E deficiency ; and age (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.72-0.96, p = 0.012), low albumin (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.42-0.84, p = 0.0036), and high MELD-Na (1.43, 95% CI = 1.05-1.94, p = 0.021) were predictors of zinc deficiency. Vitamin A (p = 0.0034), D (p = 0.020), E (p = 0.012), and zinc (pConclusion:Low albumin was a recurrent predictor of fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, and E) and zinc deficiency while other predictors varied depending on the vitamin or mineral. Further studies need to be conducted on fat-soluble vitamin and zinc supplementation in deficient patients with cirrhosis to assess clinical outcomes.
