It is well documented that anomalous production of inflammatory proteins linked with most of the toxic expression and genesis of diverse chronic disease including cancer. Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) a well-known hepatotoxin and hepatocarcinogen, can induce oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction in it. Umbelliferone, secondary metabolites, is present in different plants and widely consumed by humans as medicine and food supplements. The aim of the current study was to scrutinize the chemoprotective potential of umbelliferon-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(2I→1II)-α-d-glucopyranoside (UFD) against DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in experimental rats. Single intraperitoneal injection of DEN (200mg/kg) was used for induction of HCC in rats and rats were grouped and orally treated with UFD (5, 10 and 20mg/kg) dose for 22 weeks. Parameters under investigation included hepatic, non-hepatic enzymes, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, COX-2 and NF-κB level along with histopathological examination in HCC rats. UFD exerted protective effect via reduction of oxidative stress, liver and non-liver parameters in a dose-dependent manner. It also reduced the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and COX-2 in diseased rats. Our result revealed the essential repression of the inflammation cascade through modulation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.
