This study investigated hepatitis B virus (HBV) single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and deletion mutations linked with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ninety-three HCC patients and 108 non-HCC patients were enrolled for HBV genome-wide next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. A systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were performed to validate NGS-defined HCC-associated SNVs and deletions. The experimental results identified 60 NGS-defined HCC-associated SNVs, including 41 novel SNVs, and their pathogenic frequencies. Each SNV was specific for either genotype B (n = 24) or genotype C (n = 34), except for nt53C, which was present in both genotypes. The pathogenic frequencies of these HCC-associated SNVs showed a distinct U-shaped distribution pattern. According to the meta-analysis and literature review, 167 HBV variants from 109 publications were categorized into four levels (A-D) of supporting evidence that they are associated with HCC. The proportion of NGS-defined HCC-associated SNVs among these HBV variants declined significantly from 75% of 12 HCC-associated variants by meta-analysis (Level A) to 0% of 10 HCC-unassociated variants by meta-analysis (Level D) (P
