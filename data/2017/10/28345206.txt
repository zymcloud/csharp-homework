In this prospective study, we evaluated the effectiveness and tolerability of novel therapies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) in a cohort of PWID enrolled at our centre from April 2015 to July 2016. In this analysis, a total of 174 patients were included: eleven (6.3%) were treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) containing regimens, 163 (93.7%) with IFN-free treatments. RBV has been used in 70 patients (40.2%); 59 (33.9%) patients were in opioid substitution therapy (OST) with methadone or buprenorphine. Overall, sustained virological response (SVR) has been observed in 162 subject (93.1%), breakthrough (BT) in three (1.7%), relapse in one (0.6%) and dropout in eight (4.6%). Treatment was interrupted for clinical conditions in seven patients: six (3.4%) had hepatic decompensation and one died for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In multivariate analysis, predictive factors of treatment failure were as follows: albumin level below 3 g/dL (OR=7.190; 95% IC=1.236-41.837; P10 (OR=5.886; 95% IC=1.411-35.994; P20 (OR=1.286; 95% IC=0.556-9.455; P=.016). In conclusion, treatment with DAAs was effective and well tolerated in PWID; cirrhotic subjects with MELD > 10 and albumin low level showed a higher risk of developing serious adverse events and treatment failure.
