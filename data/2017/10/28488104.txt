Purpose:To investigate the impact of the first transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and identify predictors for low HRQoL following TACE.Materials and methods:HRQoL was prospectively evaluated in 79 patients with standardized questionnaires (QlQ-C30 and HCC18) pre- and 2 weeks post-TACE. Treatment response was evaluated using common tumour response criteria. Clinical parameters [e.g. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Model of End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score], tumour load and pre-TACE HRQoL scores were tested for predicting HRQoL after TACE.Results:Patients showed a 12.1% decrease in global health score (GHS). Major decreases were observed for physical (-21.4%), role (-23.4%), and social (-21.5%) functioning and increases in symptom severity for fatigue (+30.1%), loss of appetite (+25.3%), pain (+19.4%) after TACE. ECOG performance status >1 was associated with increased nausea/vomiting (p = 0.002) and decreased GHS (p = 0.01). MELD score >10 was associated with increased fatigue (p = 0.021) and abdominal swelling (p Conclusion:The first TACE for treatment of HCC does not result in a major loss of HRQoL in general. For TACE as a palliative therapy maintaining HRQoL is of critical importance and standardized HRQoL assessment can help to detect HRQoL problems.
