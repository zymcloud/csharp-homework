Purpose:To prospectively compare multidetector-row CT (MDCT) and MR imaging (MRI) in the assessment of the ablative margin (AM) and index tumor immediately after radiofrequency (RF) ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and assess whether non-contrast MRI with limited sequences (T1- and T2-weighted imaging only) was superior to a conventional MDCT protocol.Methods:A total of 33 consecutive patients with 42 HCCs were included in this study. Both MDCT and MR images were independently reviewed by two radiologists regarding the ability to visually discriminate between the AM and index tumor, and the AM status within ablation zones. The AM status was classified as AM-plus (AM completely surrounding the tumor), AM-zero (AM was partly discontinuous, without protrusion of the tumor), and AM-minus (AM was partly discontinuous, with protrusion of the tumor). During the follow-up period, the cumulative local tumor progression rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. To determine the added value of contrast-enhanced MR images, both reviewers separately evaluated the two sets (unenhanced and enhanced) of MR images.Results:Visual discrimination between the AM and index tumor was possible in four (9.5%) and 34 (81%) of the 42 ablation zones using MDCT and MRI, respectively (p Conclusion:MRI was superior to MDCT for the differential assessment of the AM and index tumor immediately after RF ablation for HCC. Non-contrast MRI was also superior to the conventional MDCT protocol.
