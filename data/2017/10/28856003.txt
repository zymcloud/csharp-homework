Comprehensive treatments together with sorafenib provide a survival benefit for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is an increasingly recognized distinct entity; however, only few cases induced by sorafenib have been reported to date. We herein present a rare case of ACLF in a patient under treatment with sorafenib. A 63-year-old woman who suffered from hepatitis B for 10 years was admitted to our hospital. A computed tomography (CT) scan led to a diagnosis of HCC in the V/VIII hepatic segment, with invasion of the middle hepatic and the right portal veins. The patient received multidisciplinary treatment, including transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation and sorafenib. Two months after sorafenib treatment, the patient was readmitted due to progressive jaundice and ACLF was diagnosed by liver biopsy shortly thereafter. Although aggressive treatment was administered, the patient succumbed to the disease following rapid deterioration of her clinical condition. The majority of patients with HCC have underlying liver disease and combination therapy with sorafenib should be administered with caution, as it may increase the risk of severe hepatotoxicity. The present case suggests that patients treated with sorafenib may require a dose reduction following interventional treatment.
