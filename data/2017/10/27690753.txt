1. This article aims to evaluate the potentials of using cytochrome P450 2W1 (CYP2W1) as a biomarker and a drug target of cancer because of its characteristic cancer-specific expression. 2. Discrepant findings comparing the expression levels of CYP2W1 in cancer and non-cancer samples were reported. In general, the expression followed a developmental pattern. The demethylation status of CpG island and the expression levels of CYP2W1 genes was positively correlated. 3. CYP2W1 was able to activate several procarcinogens, anticancer pro-drugs and to metabolise many endogenous substances including fatty acids and lysophospholipids. 4. CYP2W1 expression level was suggested to serve as an independent prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. The correlation of genetic polymorphisms of CYP2W1 and cancer risk was uncertain. 5. Further characterisation of CYP2W1 structure is suggested to link to its functions. More studies are warranted to reveal the true status and the regulation of CYP2W1 expression across normal and cancer tissues. Catalytic activity of CYP2W1 should be tested on a wider spectrum of endogenous and exogenous substances before its use as the drug target. Larger size of clinical samples can be included to verify the potential of CYP2W1 as the prognostic or cancer risk biomarker.
