Purpose:Troxerutin (TXER), a trihydroxyethylated derivative of the natural bioflavonoid rutin, abundantly found in tea, various fruits and vegetables, is known to exhibit ample pharmacological properties. In the present investigation, we examined the antineoplastic, therapeutic efficacy and furthermore the possible mechanisms of action of TXER against NAFLD/NASH progression to hepatocarcinogenesis.Methods:The effect of TXER (12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg b.w/day) was evaluated on the nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) model of hepatocarcinogenesis in rats, after 16 weeks of oral treatment, with special focus on liver specific enzymes, xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, antioxidant status, lipid peroxidation profile, DNA damage, fibrosis, cell proliferation and inflammatory status.Results:Administration of TXER to hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing rats restored the enzyme activities and the hepatic architecture. Furthermore, TXER significantly curtailed NDEA-induced DNA damage, cell proliferation, inflammation, fibrosis and hepatic hyperplasia.Conclusion:This study provides the evidence that troxerutin exerts a significant therapeutic effect against liver cancer by modulating liver function enzymes, xenobiotic enzymes, oxidative damage, inhibiting cell proliferation, suppressing inflammatory response and induction of apoptosis.
