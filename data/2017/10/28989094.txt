Background & aims:The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines recommend resection for very early and early single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. It is not known whether a delay in resection from the time of diagnosis (the time to surgery [TTS], i.e. the elapsed time from diagnosis to surgery) affects outcomes. We aim to evaluate the impact of TTS on recurrence and survival outcomes in patients with HCC.Methods:All patients resected for BCLC stage 0-A single HCC from 2006 to 2016 were studied to evaluate the impact of TTS on recurrence rate, recurrence-free survival (RFS), transplantability following recurrence, and intention-to-treat overall survival (ITT-OS). Propensity score matching (PSM) was further performed to ensure comparability.Results:The study population included 100 patients. Surgery was performed between 0.6 and 77 months after diagnosis (median TTS: three months; interquartile range: 1.8-4.6 months). There was no post-operative mortality. Compared to those with TTS Conclusion:Patients with BCLC stage 0-A single HCC can undergo surgery with TTS ≥3 months without impaired oncologic outcomes. An increase in the TTS within a safe range could allow time for proper evaluation before surgery, and ethical testing of new neoadjuvant treatments, aiming to reduce the high rate of tumor recurrence despite curative resection.Lay summary:A delay of ≥3 months in time to resection after diagnosis in HCC patients meeting the European Association for the Study of Liver Disease/American Association for the Study of Liver Disease criteria for resection does not affect oncological and long-term outcomes compared to those with a delay to surgery of
