Post-examination interpretation of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) cineloops of focal liver lesions (FLLs) requires offline manual assessment by experienced radiologists, which is time-consuming and generates subjective results. Such assessment usually starts by manually identifying a reference frame, where FLL and healthy parenchyma are well-distinguished. This study proposes an automatic computational method to objectively identify the optimal reference frame for distinguishing and hence delineating an FLL, by statistically analyzing the temporal intensity variation across the spatially discretized ultrasonographic image. Level of confidence and clinical value of the proposed method were quantitatively evaluated on retrospective multi-institutional data (n = 64) and compared with expert interpretations. Results support the proposed method for facilitating easier, quicker and reproducible assessment of FLLs, further increasing the radiologists' confidence in diagnostic decisions. Finally, our method yields a useful training tool for radiologists, widening CEUS use in non-specialist centers, potentially leading to reduced turnaround times and lower patient anxiety and healthcare costs.
