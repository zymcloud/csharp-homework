The evidence is insufficient for safe use of elderly donors in adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of right lobe LDLT by donor age (≥55 versus < 55 years). All living donors who underwent right hepatectomy at the authors' institution between March 2008 and December 2015 were divided into 2 groups: group A with an age ≥ 55 years and group B with an age of <55 years. The selection criteria for elderly donor were preservation of middle hepatic vein, remnant liver volume ≥30%, and no or mild fatty liver. The matching criteria of recipients for the elderly donor grafts were Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of <25, graft-to-recipient weight ratio of >0.8%, and body mass index of <25 kg/m2 . Perioperative data, complications by the Clavien classification, and the outcomes with at least 12 months follow-up were compared. A total of 42 donors were enrolled in group A and 498 in group B. No significant differences in operative parameters were observed between the 2 groups. The peak postoperative aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels made no difference between the 2 groups. The peak international normalized ratio level was significantly lower in group A than in group B (P = 0.001). All donors recovered completely with no significant differences in overall complications between the 2 groups. All recipients of grafts from donors in group A showed good initial function with no significant differences in 1-year graft and patient survival or biliary complications between 2 groups. These results provide clinical evidence for feasibility of right hepatectomy in living donors aged ≥ 55 years without compromising donor safety or recipient outcomes.
