Purpose:The purpose of this study was to report the imaging presentation of hepatic metastases from hepatoid adenocarcinoma (HAC).Methods:We retrospectively identified 11 patients (10 men and 1 woman; median age 66) with HAC liver metastasis who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) which included arterial phase and portal venous phase. Two radiologists analyzed the imaging parameters, which included the enhancement pattern on arterial and portal phase images, necrosis, venous thrombi, and overall imaging diagnosis, and arrived at a consensus.Results:On arterial phase, the liver lesions had global hyper-enhancement (n = 0), heterogeneous hyper-enhancement (63.6%; n = 7/11), peripheral hyper-enhancement (n = 0), iso-enhancement (n = 0/11), or hypo-enhancement (36.4%; n = 4/11). On portal venous phase, homogenous hypo-enhancement (18.2%; n = 2/11) and heterogenous hypo-enhancement (81.8%; n = 9/11) were observed. Venous thromboses occurred in four patients (36.4%; n = 4/11). The overall imaging diagnoses were "HCC-like" in seven patients (63.6%; n = 7/11), "indeterminable" in 1 patient (9.1%; n = 1/11), and "HCC-unlike" in three patients (27.3%; n = 3/11).Conclusions:The imaging features of HAC liver metastasis were varied. Arterial phase enhancement coupled with venous phase washout (resembling HCC imaging features) was a major finding, but arterial phase hypo-enhancement (distinct from HCC imaging features) was also frequently encountered.
