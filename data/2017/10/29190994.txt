It is unclear whether hemorrhage of brain metastasis is a poor prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare overall survival between hemorrhage and no-hemorrhage groups of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with brain metastasis. Hepatocellular carcinoma patients with brain metastasis treated between June 2000 and June 2016 at the Cancer Hospital of Guangxi Medical University were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics and overall survival were compared between patients with (n = 11) and without (n = 25) hemorrhage of brain metastasis. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses showed hemorrhage to be a poor prognostic factor (hazard ratio = 5.812, 95% confidence interval: 1.399-24.142, p = 0.015). Patients with hemorrhage had a shorter median survival than those without hemorrhage (4 weeks vs 8 weeks, p = 0.001). These results suggest hemorrhage of brain metastasis is a poor prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
