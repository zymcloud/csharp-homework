Aim:To investigate the factors that influence survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Retrospectively enrolled HCC patients with PVTT (n = 57). Patients received TACE, and the local tumor response was evaluated by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumor (mRECIST). Overall survival and disease progression were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate Cox regression analysis.Results:Following TACE, the median survival times was 8.3 months in HCC patients with PVTT. The median survival time was 3.1 months for patients with progressive disease following TACE and was 11.3 months for patients with complete response or partial response. The one-year rate of survival for patients with progressive disease was 5.0% and was lower than in patients with complete response or partial response (20.0%, P Conclusion:Our study indicates that TACE is feasible and potentially efficacious in HCC patients with PVTT, and identifies factors that may predict the prognosis of these patients.
