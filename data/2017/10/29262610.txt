The miRNAs play important regulating roles in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To uncover key regulating miRNAs in HCC that were neglected by traditional analyzing methods of transcriptomics data, we proposed a novel molecular-network-based omics' (MNBO) method. With this method, we predicted HCC-regulating miRNAs, and confirmed the role of a novel miR-590-3P/EED axis by a clinical study and in vitro, in vivo wet-experiments. The miR-590-3P is significantly down-regulated in HCC patients. And low level of miR-590-3P in HCC is associated with poor prognosis of patients. In HCC cell lines, the miR-590-3P suppressed cell proliferation by inhibiting the transformation G1 phase to S phases of the cell cycle. Moreover, the miR-590-3P inhibited migration and invasion of HCC cells. Further investigations indicated that miR-590-3P play its roles by inhibiting polycomb protein EED. The experiments in animal model implied miR-590-3P could be a potential therapeutic agent for HCC in the future. In conclusion, the discovery of miR-590-3P revealed the MNBO would be a useful strategy to uncover key regulating miRNAs in HCC.
