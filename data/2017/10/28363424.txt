Aim:Protein kinase D (PKD) acts as a key mediator in several cancer development signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance and prognostic value of PKD3 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatectomy.Methods:PKD3 mRNA and protein expression levels in tumor and matched non-tumoral (NT) tissues, HCC cell lines were evaluated by quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting and immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Additionally, PKD3 mRNA expression in HCC tissues correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survival.Results:PKD3 mRNA and protein expression was elevated in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. Our data also showed that in HCC patients after resection, a high-expression of PKD3 mRNA and protein significantly correlated with multiple tumor nodules (P=0.009, P=0.020, respectively), poor tumor differentiation (P=0.001, P=0.004, respectively), high serum AFP level (P=0.005, P=0.002, respectively), vascular invasion (P=0.006, P=0.009, respectively) and advanced AJCC stage (P=0.001, P=0.022, respectively). A Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that an elevated PKD3 mRNA expression correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) (PConclusions:Our findings suggest that abnormal PKD3 expression might contribute to HCC progression. Furthermore, high PKD3 expression predicts a poor prognosis in HCC patients after hepatectomy.
