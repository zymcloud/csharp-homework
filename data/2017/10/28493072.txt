Purpose:To investigate clinical features and results of follow-up in patients with arterial injury during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:From 2005 to 2015, 2219 TACE procedures were performed in 906 patients in our hospital. Iatrogenic arterial injury occurred during 38 TACE procedures (sessions) in 35 patients (24 men, 11 women; mean age 71.8 years). The incidence of arterial injury was 1.7%. We evaluated the characteristics of arterial injury, and evaluated the risk factors for incomplete recanalization of the injured artery at follow-up angiography conducted after 1-11 months (mean 102.5 days).Results:Iatrogenic arterial injury was caused by the microcatheter in 34 of 38 cases (86.8%). There were 15 cases (39.5%) in which the replaced hepatic artery or the extrahepatic artery was the parasitic supply. Extravasation occurred in five cases. In 36 of 38 cases, follow-up angiography was performed. We divided 36 cases into two groups: complete reopening (n = 24) and non-complete reopening (n = 12). The two groups were compared regarding the factors associated with incomplete recanalization of the injured artery at follow-up. Injury length >3 cm (p = 0.0002) and proximal arterial injury (proximal to the segmental artery; p = 0.03) were significant risk factors for non-complete reopening of the injured artery.Conclusion:Iatrogenic arterial injury frequently occurred in the extrahepatic artery or replaced hepatic artery. Recanalization rate of arterial injury was high; however, injury length >3 cm and proximal arterial injury were risk factors for non-complete reopening of the injured artery.
