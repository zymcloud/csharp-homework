Purpose:Even though the therapeutic gold standard of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) resection is cancer-free resection margin (RM), surgical treatment still remains challenging. This study evaluated the prognostic significance of RM status in resected HCCA patients and identified survival prognostic factors.Materials and methods:We reviewed records of 96 HCCA patients who underwent surgery from 2001 to 2012 and analyzed the RM status and prognostic factors that affecting survival.Results:Negative RM (n=31, 33%) was significantly associated with better survival vs. positive RM (n=65, 67%) (mean survival time [MST], 33 months vs. 21 months; p=0.011). Margins with histological findings of non-dysplastic epithelium, low-grade dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ were not associated with survival differences (MST, 33 months vs. 33 months vs. 30 months; p=0.452), whereas positive margins were associated with poorer survival relative to carcinoma in situ (MST, 30 months vs. 21 months; p=0.050). Among patients with R0 resection, narrow (â‰¤ 5 mm) and wide (> 5 mm) margins were not associated with survival differences (MST, 33 months vs. 30 months; p=0.234). Although positive proximal RM was associated with poorer survival compared to negative RM (MST, 19 vs. 33; p=0.002), no survival difference was observed between positive and negative distal RMs (MST, 30 vs. 33; p=0.628). Proximal RM positivity (hazard ratio [HR], 2.688; p=0.007) and nodal involvement (HR, 3.293; p < 0.001) were independent survival prognostic factors.Conclusion:A clear RM, especially proximal RM status, was significant prognosticator, and proximal bile duct resection to the greatest technically feasible extent may be necessary, with careful consideration of the potential morbidity and oncologic outcomes after resection. However, an aggressive approach to obtain a negative distal RM might be controversial and should be considered carefully, depending on the patient's status.
