A 61-year-old Chinese male was found to have a lesion in the left liver during a routine body check-up. Laboratory tests revealed no abnormalities except for a rise in C-reactive protein. Computed tomography showed features suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient underwent liver IVb segmentectomy and cholecystectomy. Histopathology showed features of hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor. The C-reactive protein decreased to close to normal on postoperative day 9. A patient with hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor who presented with features mimicking hepatocellular carcinoma was reported. A preoperatively raised C-reactive protein was the only hint which suggested that our patient might have had hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor instead of hepatocellular carcinoma.
