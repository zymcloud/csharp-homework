This retrospective study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound with Sonazoid (S-CEUS) for liver metastasis. We enrolled in this study 98 patients with 148 histologically proven liver lesions, with 121 metastases and 27 non-metastases. The S-CEUS technique showed sensitivity in 95.0% (115 of 121), specificity in 44.4% (12 of 27) and accuracy in 85.8% (127 of 148) for the diagnosis of metastasis. Higher body mass index had a negative influence on the positive predictive value and accuracy, and a greater depth of the lesion had a negative influence on the accuracy. The management was changed in 8 patients (8.2%) because of S-CEUS findings. In conclusion, the addition of S-CEUS may offer a great benefit by improvement of the quality of diagnosis and management for patients with cancer who have a tentative diagnosis of liver metastasis by contrast-enhanced computed tomography.
