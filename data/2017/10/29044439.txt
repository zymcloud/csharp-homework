Purpose of review:This paper reviews diagnostic imaging techniques used to characterize liver masses and the imaging characteristics of the most common liver masses.Recent findings:The role of recently adopted ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents will be emphasized. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is an inexpensive exam which can confirm benignity of certain liver masses without ionizing radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging using hepatocyte-specific gadolinium-based contrast agents can help confirm or narrow the differential diagnosis of liver masses.
Appropriate exam; CT; Contrast; Focal liver lesion; MRI; Ultrasound.
