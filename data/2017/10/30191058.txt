Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) leads to improved survival; however, current early detection strategies for HCC surveillance are ineffective. Thus, there has been interest in developing biomarkers to aid in the early detection HCC. In this review, we discuss the five phases of biomarker discovery that are necessary for clinical implementation. We also describe the most promising investigational biomarkers and their phase of discovery. We review several promising technologies for the early detection of HCC, including miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics. Promisingly, there are samples from multiple longitudinal cohorts of patients with cirrhosis in the USA that are being collected in order to validate candidate biomarkers for HCC. A biomarker-based strategy has the potential to become the primary surveillance method for HCC detection.
