Purpose:To analyze the outcomes of patients developing pulmonary metastases (PM) following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and perioperative intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (IPC) for colorectal cancer (CRC) with peritoneal carcinomatosis.Patients and methods:A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing CRS/IPC for CRC from 1996 to 2016 was performed. Lung-specific disease-free and patient overall survival was analyzed. Patients undergoing percutaneous lung ablative therapy (PLAT) for PM were compared to patients receiving systemic chemotherapy alone.Results:273 patients underwent CRS/IPC for CRC. Of these, 61 (22%) developed PM. Median time to development of PM was 8 months (range 0-52 months) and 41 patients (67%) had metachronous lesions. Twenty-one PM patients underwent PLAT, either by radio-frequency or micro-wave ablation, for an average of 3 lesions (range 1-12) and 13 (62%) had bilobar disease. The most common post-interventional complication was the development of pneumothorax (71%). Overall survival following development of PM was 18 months and higher in patients undergoing PLAT compared to those treated with systemic chemotherapy (26 vs. 14 months, p = 0.03). In eight cases (38%) local tumor recurrence developed post-PLAT. A peritoneal carcinomatosis index >10 (HR 3.48, 95% CI 1.69-7.19), presence of liver metastases (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.24-5.03) and PLAT (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.93) were identified as significant predictors of overall survival following diagnosis of PM.Conclusion:PM develop in approximately a fourth of patients undergoing CRS/IPC for CRC. Of these, about 1/3 may be eligible for PLAT. PLAT is a valuable treatment option providing good local control and potentially prolongation of overall survival.
