Iatrogenic pancreatic cancer metastasis after islet infusion is a potential risk of islet autotransplantation performed after pancreatectomy. To model this risk, islets and/or pancreatic exocrine clusters obtained from a genetically engineered mouse model for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (the LSL-KrasG12D/+ ;LSL-Trp53R172H/+ ;Pdx-1-Cre, termed KPC mouse) were transplanted via the portal vein in syngeneic wild type (WT) severely diabetic recipients in the following treatment groups: group A (n = 11) received KPC exocrine clusters in volume equal to 250 islet equivalents (IEQs); group B (n = 12) received 250 WT IEQs mixed with KPC exocrine clusters (1:1 volume ratio); group C (n = 5) received 250 KPC IEQs, and group D (n = 7) received 250 WT IEQs. The incidence of hepatic metastasis was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and histology over the 13 months of follow-up. Overall survival was not different in the four groups. No mice developed liver metastases during the follow-up. Two mice developed spontaneous tumors: a liver hepatocellular tumor in group A and a malignant lymphoma in group D. Islets and/or exocrine clusters obtained by KPC mouse, a model that develops pancreatic cancer with 100% penetrance, do not retain the same risk of tumor development when transplanted via the portal vein in a syngeneic diabetic recipient.
