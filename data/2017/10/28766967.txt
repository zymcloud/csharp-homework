Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the fastest growing causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Sorafenib was the first and only drug to improve survival for patients with advanced disease, and has been the cornerstone of treatment for nearly a decade. Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that has recently been shown to significantly improve survival in patients who have progressed on first-line sorafenib. In this review, we discuss the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of regorafenib and its efficacy and tolerability in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
