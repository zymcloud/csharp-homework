Two of the most important human oncogenic viruses are hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV). HBV infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982; vaccination of neonates and infants is highly effective, resulting already in decreased rates of new infections, chronic liver disease and hepato-cellular carcinoma. Nonetheless, HBV remains a global public health problem with high rates of vertical transmission from mother to child in some regions. Prophylactic HPV vaccines composed of virus-like particles (VLPs) of the L1 capsid protein have been licensed since 2006/2007. These target infection by the oncogenic HPVs 16 and 18 (the cause of 70% of cervical cancers); a new vaccine licensed in 2014/2015 additionally targets HPVs 31, 33, 45, 52, 58. HPV vaccines are now included in the national immunization programmes in many countries, with young adolescent peri-pubertal girls the usual cohort for immunization. Population effectiveness in women is now being demonstrated in countries with high vaccine coverage with significant reductions in high-grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (a surrogate for cervical cancer), genital warts and vaccine HPV type genoprevalence. Herd effects in young heterosexual men and older women are evident. Cancers caused by HBV and HPV should, in theory, be amenable to immunotherapies and various therapeutic vaccines for HPV in particular are in development and/or in clinical trial.This article is part of the themed issue 'Human oncogenic viruses'.
