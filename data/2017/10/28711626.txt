Background & aims:Little is known about the absolute risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-disease related death, in association with metabolic risk factors, for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.Methods:We collected data from 5373 male Taiwanese civil servants who visited Taiwan's Government Employees' Central Clinics and received routine free physical examinations from 1989 through 1992. We obtained information on liver-related morbidity and mortality in HBV carriers, 40-65 years of age (n=1690), with different metabolic risk factors. We compared their medical histories with those of study participants without HBV or HCV infection in the same age range (n=1289). We used patients' baseline data on obesity, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and high blood pressure to assign them to metabolic risk categories. We then performed a case-cohort analysis of the effects of hepatitis B viral factors on risk for HCC, based on metabolic factors and insulin resistance.Results:Over a median follow-up period of 19 years, 158 of the 1690 HBV carriers developed HCC and 126 died from liver-related diseases. Among participants without HBV or HCV infection, only 6 developed HCC or died from liver-related disease. HBV carriers with different metabolic risk factors had significant differences in cumulative incidence of HCC and liver-related death. Patients with 3 or more metabolic risk factors had a substantially higher risk for HCC (10-year cumulative incidence, 13.60%) than patients with a low metabolic risk profile (10-year cumulative incidence, 4.83%; adjusted-hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.18-4.54). Smoking had a significant effect on this association (Pinteraction = .0044). Having 3 or more metabolic risk factors, compared with no factors, significantly increased the risk of HCC (adjusted-hazard ratio, 5.06; 95% CI, 2.23-11.47) and 10-year cumulative incidence of HCC (25.0% in smokers with 3 or more metabolic risk factors vs 3.87% in smokers with none; P < .0001) in smokers, but did not increase risk of HCC in nonsmokers. Metabolic risk factors and insulin resistance had the largest effect on HCC risk in patients with levels of HBV-DNA <10,000 copies/mL.Conclusions:In a study of men with chronic HBV infection ages 40-65 years in Taiwan, we associated a high burden of metabolic risk factors with increased risk of HCC; smoking has a significant effect on this association.
