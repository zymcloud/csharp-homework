Lessons learned:There continues to be a lack of systemic options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); sorafenib and, very recently, regorafenib are the only approved options. There exists a potential to combine sorafenib with chemotherapeutic agents shown to be active in HCC, such as capecitabine, safely.Good tumor response was observed, with objective improvement in a few patients seldom seen by single agent sorafenib; however, because of the limited number of patients, meaningful conclusions on survival cannot be drawn.Background:Sorafenib is the currently approved first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Capecitabine has antitumor activity in hepatobiliary cancers. The combination of the two, if tolerated, could possibly improve antitumor response, and survival.Methods:Patients with advanced HCC ineligible for locoregional therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤2, Child-Pugh class A or B-7 cirrhosis, hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL, platelets ≥50,000/μL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 cells/μL, and serum creatinine of ≤2.0 mg/dL were recruited. All subjects received a combination of sorafenib and capecitabine, on a 14-day 7-days on 7-days off schedule. The primary end point was safety and secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and disease control rate.Results:A total of 15 out of 47 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 64 years (56-79) and 77% were male. With a median follow-up of 12 months, median OS was 12.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5-23.4). Disease control rate was 77% (complete response 8%, partial response 8%, and stable disease 61%). Common adverse events were as follows: (a) thrombocytopenia (64%); (b) anemia (14%); (c) hypophosphatemia (21%); (d) hypomagnesemia (14%); (e) hyperbilirubinemia (21%); (f) increased aspartate transaminase (AST) (14%); (g) hand-foot syndrome (21%); and (h) deep vein thrombosis (21%).Conclusion:At tolerable doses, the combination of sorafenib and capecitabine seems an active and safe palliative treatment for HCC in class A and B-7 patients with cirrhosis. The small sample size does not allow comparison with single-agent sorafenib.
