Background:Chemotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis of breast cancer patients. However, it may also result in undesirable side effects such as hepatitis virus reactivation. Little information is available on the liver toxicity of chemotherapy and targeted therapy for breast cancer patients with hepatitis virus (HBV/HCV) infection.Methods:We performed a retrospective survey of 835 patients diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2010 and December 2015 at our institution. All patients had been screened for HBV/HCV infection at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. We retrospectively investigated the toxicity of chemotherapy and the changes in HBV/HCV load based on a medical record review.Results:52 patients with positive anti-HBV antibody test and 21 patients with positive anti-HCV antibody tests received chemotherapy. 762 patients without HBV and HCV infection served as the control group. The morbidity of liver toxicity and disruptions in chemotherapy attributable to liver toxicity were not significantly different among control group, HBV group and HCV groups (27.7% vs 34.6% vs 42.9%, P = 0.189 and 5.0% vs 9.6% vs 9.5%, P = 0.173, respectively). No patients presented with HBV/HCV reactivation.Conclusion:Breast cancer patients with HCV can be treated with chemotherapy and targeted therapy with trastuzumab. Breast cancer patients with HBV who accept antiviral therapy can be treated with chemotherapy and targeted therapy with trastuzumab and patients can benefit from prophylactic antiviral therapy before chemotherapy. However, a multidisciplinary cooperation and closely monitoring liver function during the course of chemotherapy may benefit patients.
