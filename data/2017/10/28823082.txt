Introduction:Previous studies have reported that specific depletion of mammalian sterile-like kinase (MST1) in the mouse liver driven Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, how the expression of MST1 was regulated in the progression of HCC remains largely unknown.Materials and methods:The expression of miR-3910 in the HCC tissues and cell lines were examined using q-PCR. The functions of miR-3910 in HCC were examined using MTT assay, Boyden chamber assay and soft agar assay. The effects of miR-3910 on the metastasis of HCC cells were evaluated using the mouse model.Results:Here, we have shown that miR-3910 regulated the expression of MST1. MiR-3910 was up-regulated in HCC samples and cell lines, and the expression of miR-3910 was induced by the oncogenic RasV12. In the functional study, miR-3910 was found to promote the growth and migration of HCC cells, and knocking down miR-3910 inhibited the metastasis of HCC cells. Mechanically, it was found that miR-3910 activated YAP signaling by targeting MST1.Conclusion:Taken together, this study demonstrated that miR-3910 exerted oncogenic effects on the progression of HCC and suggested that miR-3910 might be a therapeutic target for cancer therapy.
