Background:Serum albumin levels have been shown to have prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as part of an inflammatory index. The aim of this study was to examine the possible relationship of serum albumin levels to parameters of HCC aggressiveness.Methods:A large HCC patient cohort was retrospectively examined, and the possible relationships of albumin levels to tumor diameter, multifocality, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and α-fetoprotein levels were examined.Results:HCC patients with lower serum albumin levels had significantly larger maximum tumor diameters, greater prevalence of PVT, increased tumor multifocality and higher α-fetoprotein levels, than HCC patients with higher albumin levels. A correlation was found between levels of these tumor parameters and serum albumin levels.Conclusions:These results indicate that low serum albumin levels correlate with increased parameter measures of HCC aggressiveness, in addition to their role as a monitor of systemic inflammation. Decreased serum albumin might have a role in HCC aggressiveness.
