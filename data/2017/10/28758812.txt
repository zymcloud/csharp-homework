Purpose:Hepatocyte Paraffin 1 (Hep Par 1) and cytokeratin 19 (CK19) were shown to be associated with post-surgical prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, further validation might be needed. Besides, their combined evaluation has not been reported. The present study was designed to address the issues.Materials and methods:Expressions of Hep Par 1 and CK19 were detected using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining in 79 patients with HCC underwent curative hepatectomy. Their associations with cliniopathologic variables, overall and recurrence-free survival were analyzed.Results:Hep Par 1 was highly expressed in 61 patients (77.2%), whereas CK19 was positive in 8 patients (10.1%). Moreover, expressions of these two proteins were all associated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and vascular invasion. It was found that high Hep Par 1 expression was univariately associated with good overall and recurrence-free survival, while CK19 was marginally prognostic. Also in univariate analyses, combination of the two markers more effectively predicted for long-term prognosis in HCC than Hep Par 1 did. However, neither Hep Par 1 nor Hep Par 1/CK19 was multivariately significant. Finally, Hep Par 1/CK19 combined with TNM stage might obtain more satisfactory outcome prediction, especially for overall survival.Conclusions:Combination of CK19 with Hep Par 1 might have higher prognostic power, which might be further improved by adding TNM stage, than Hep Par 1 alone, in resected HCC. Of course, subsequent confirmation is necessary.
