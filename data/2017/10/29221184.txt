Chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is encoded by one of the four open reading frames of HBV, and is well known as an important coactivator for HBV replication and HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinogenesis. However, its role in keeping cells from apoptosis to promote HCC proliferation remains controversial. Here, we used HBx expressing HCC cells as a model, to investigate the mechanism of HBx-mediated cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We found that HBx protein was localized in ER lumen and interacted with GRP78 directly. This interaction resulted in suppression of eIF2α phosphorylation, inhibited expression of ATF4/CHOP/Bcl-2, and reduced cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and level of γH2AX, thus preventing HCC cells from cell death and negatively regulating DNA repair. This study reveals a novel mechanism of the HBx-mediated oncogenesis and provides a basis for potential HBx-targeted therapeutic intervention of HCC.
