The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has continued to increase worldwide, and advanced HCC is difficult to treat using the currently available therapeutics. Chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, CDDP) is expected to confer a curative benefit on HCC patients; however, its application is limited due to side-effects such as acute nephrotoxicity as well as the conventionally limited application of chemoradiotherapy for HCC. For the practical application of this drug in the clinical setting, we formulated a novel drug carrier-comprising bio-nanocapsule (BNC) and liposomal CDDP (BNC-LP-CDDP) that recognizes the human liver and releases CDDP. BNC-LP-CDDP showed selectively high cytotoxicity for HCC cells, and markedly reduced the survival fractions of HCC when combined with ionizing radiation (IR) treatment in in vitro assays. In particular, the treatment of mice bearing human HCC with BNC-LP-CDDP and 3 Gy IR showed 95.68% growth inhibition, whereas IR treatment alone showed 65.6% growth inhibition. Moreover, BNC-LP-CDDP led to the withdrawal of CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. These results indicate that BNC-LP-CDDP in combination with IR markedly enhanced the chemo-radiotherapeutic efficacy and eliminated CDDP induced nephrotoxicity, thus, suggesting the potential for its clinical application as human HCC therapy.
