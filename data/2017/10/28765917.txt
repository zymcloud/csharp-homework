Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor and one of the most common causes for human cancer-related deaths. Fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) is overexpressed in many types of cancer, and is associated with cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. miR-139 has recently been reported as a tumor suppressor in various types of cancer and it can regulate many tumor-related genes, however its association with FGF18 expression in HCC has not been reported and thus remains unknown. In the present study, to explore the potential regulation mechanism of miR-139 with FGF18 in HCC, HCC tissues and cell lines were used. The results revealed that FGF18 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cells, however miR-139 was lowly expressed. FGF18 was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-139. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of miR-139 on FGF18 and in turn on proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration and tumor-induced angiogenesis of HCC cells was investigated. FGF18 was suggested as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC patients and miR-139 may be a promising strategy used in HCC treatment via the suppression of FGF18.
