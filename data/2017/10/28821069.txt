In this study, norcantharidin (NCTD), a small-molecule anticancer drug derived from Chinese traditional medicine blister beetle (Mylabris), was conjugated covalently onto carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS). Then the hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutic properties and liver-protective effects were investigated through orthotopic transplantation tumor model. Results showed that the obtained CMCS-NCTD demonstrated remarkable anti-growth efficacy against hepatocellular 22 in mice. Significant improvement of the liver injury caused by cancer cells was observed in tumor-bearing mice administrated with CMCS-NCTD. Moreover, CMCS-NCTD remarkably increased the serum levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, TIMP-1 and E-cadherin in mice treated for 12days. Administration of CMCS-NCTD significantly reduced the elevated serum ALT, AST, VEGF and MMP-9 levels of tumor-bearing mice. In addition, activities of SOD and GSH-Px in serum or homogenate of the CMCS-NCTD treated mice were significantly high when compared with model control group. Our data suggested that CMCS-NCTD was a promising candidate as an anti-hepatoma and liver-protection compound.
