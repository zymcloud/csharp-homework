MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are able to modulate hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and play an important role in the pathogenesis of HBV infection. Recently, we have identified that serum miR-125b-5p levels correlated with HBV DNA levels and liver necroinflammation. In the present study, we addressed how miR-125b-5p regulated HBV replication at the different steps, inclduing viral transcription, assembly, and virion production and investigated the underlying mechanisms. We found that miR-125b-5p overexpression increased HBV replication without altering HBV transcription. This is the first demonstration of post-transcriptional miRNA regulation of HBV replication. In contrast, transfection of miR-125b-5p inhibitor resulted in downregulation of HBV replication in hepatoma cells. Further, miR-125b-5p inhibited the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and blocked cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase in hepatoma cell lines. Our results indicate that certain miRNAs are able to arrest the cell cycle at G1 phase and may increase HBV replication. RNA sequencing revealed several liver-specific metabolic pathways regulated by miR-125b-5p, which was also found to suppress LIN28B and induce let-7 family members. Additional data demonstrated that miR-125b-5p targeted the LIN28B/let-7 axis to stimulate HBV replication at a post-transcriptional step.
