Many studies have investigated the efficacy of Endostar combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) versus TACE alone for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Endostar. PubMed, Embase, and other databases were searched, and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Nine studies, all of which were clinical randomized controlled trials, involving 411 participants were included. The overall response rate, disease control rate and Î±-fetoprotein negative conversion ratio, and the 6- and 12-month survival rate of HCC patients treated with combined Endostar and TACE were higher than those treated with TACE alone ( P .05). However, large studies and more randomized trials are necessary to determine the effects of Endostar on HCC.
