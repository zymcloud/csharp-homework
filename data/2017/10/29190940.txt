MAP17, a small non-glycosylated membrane protein, was significantly up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues in our previous genome-wide microarray analysis. In this study, quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were applied to examine MAP17 mRNA and protein expression in primary HCC and matched peritumoral tissues. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The expression of MAP17 was significantly higher in HCC tissues compared to the paired peritumoral tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. High MAP17 expression was positively correlated with gender, distant metastasis, early recurrence (â‰¤ 2 year), and serum alpha-fetoprotein (all p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the DFS (p = 0.004) and OS (p = 0.013) in HCC patients with elevated expression of MAP17 were much worse than that in the low expression subgroup. High level of MAP17 was also significantly associated with a high probability of HCC early recurrence after surgical resection (p = 0.005). Cox regression analysis indicated MAP17 was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (HR, 1.710; 95% CI, 1.156-2.449, p = 0.012) and OS (HR, 1.743; 95% CI, 1.152-2.639, p = 0.009) in HCC. Silencing MAP17 significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells in vitro, and decreased the expression levels of Akt, p-Akt (Ser473), mTOR, p-mTOR (Ser2448) and MMP-9. Suggesting MAP17 was a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HCC patients and promoted HCC cell proliferation, invasion and migration via the Akt/mTOR pathway.
