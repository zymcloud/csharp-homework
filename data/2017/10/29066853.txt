Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the only cancer for which non-invasive diagnosis is recognized by international guidelines. Contrast agent free ultrasound imaging, computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging are techniques used for early detection and confirmation. Clinical evidence depicts that CT is 30% less precise as compared to MRI for detection of small tumors. In our work, we have reported some novel tools that can enhance the sensitivity and precision of CT applied to preclinical research (micro-CT). Our system, containing non-toxic nano-droplets loaded with iodine has high contrasting properties, liver and hepatocyte specificity and strong liver persistence. Micro-CT was performed on HCC model implanted in nude mice by intrahepatic injection. Contrast agent was administrated intravenously. This method allows an unprecedented high precision of detection, quantitative measurement of tumor volume and quantitative follow-up of the tumor development.
