Background:The role of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and Torque teno virus (TTV) infection in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C patients is still uncertain.Aim:The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and significance of OBI and TTV infection, and to examine the genetic diversity of these viruses, in chronic hepatitis C patients with and without HCC.Methods:Sera from 151 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients (49 patients with HCC and 102 without HCC) negative for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) were tested for the presence of OBI and TTV infection by semi-nested and group-specific multiplex PCR assays, respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of HBV S region was further performed.Results:OBI and TTV infection were detected in 5 (3.3%) and 68 (45%) patients, respectively. HBV isolates were classified into genotypes A (4/5, 80%) and D (1/5, 20%), and no HBsAg escape mutation was observed. TTV phylogenetic group 3 was the most prevalent among both HCC and non-HCC patients. OBI and TTV infection were significantly more frequent in patients with HCC than patients without HCC (p=0.003, and p=0.009, respectively). Moreover, TTV infection was associated with HCC (OR=2.23, 95%CI=1.04-4.80, p=0.040), independently of liver cirrhosis.Conclusions:A low prevalence of OBI was observed in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease, and TTV infection was an independent factor associated with the occurrence of HCC. Whether TTV influences the progression of liver disease in chronic hepatitis C patients remains to be elucidated.
