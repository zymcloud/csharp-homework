Aim:To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the Liver Imaging-Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) with computed tomography (CT) for diagnosing hepatic nodules (10-20 mm) detected in cirrhotic livers.Materials and methods:Fifty-five patients with liver cirrhosis and a solitary nodule (10-20 mm in diameter) detected via ultrasound surveillance, underwent hepatic CT and fine-needle biopsy. All the CT images were analysed and the lesions were categorised into five categories according to the LI-RADS.Results:Final diagnoses of the 55 nodules were as follows: 34 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, one adrenocortical carcinoma metastasis, and 19 benign lesions. None (0%) of four LI-RADS category 1 lesions, two (22%) of nine category 2 lesions, seven (50%) of 14 category 3 lesions, two (67%) of three category 4 lesions, 22 (96%) of 23 category 5 lesions and one (50%) of two lesions classified as other malignancies was HCC. One category 5 lesion was adrenocortical carcinoma metastasis and one of two lesions categorised as other malignancies was intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In patients with nodules detected at surveillance ultrasound, the best threshold for confident HCC diagnosis was more than LI-RADS category 3. The use of this threshold produced a sensitivity and specificity of 72.7% and 90%, respectively. So combining LI-RADS 4 and 5 categories for confident HCC diagnosis would improve accuracy and sensitivity with no significant impairment of specificity or positive predictive value.Conclusion:LIRADS with CT provides a strong validity for the diagnosis of small hepatic nodules, and is very useful to improve the accuracy of CT reports.
