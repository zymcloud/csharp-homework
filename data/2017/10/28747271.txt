Purpose:To evaluate detectability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using split-bolus cone-beam CT in intraindividual comparison between cone-beam CT and contrast-enhanced MR imaging.Materials and methods:In a retrospective, single-center study, 28 patients with 85 HCC tumors were treated with transarterial chemoembolization between May 2015 and June 2016. All patients underwent arterial and hepatobiliary phase (HBP) MR imaging within 1 month before transarterial chemoembolization. Cone-beam CT images were acquired using a split-bolus contrast injection with 2 contrast injections and 1 cone-beam CT acquisition. Statistical analyses included Friedman 2-way analysis, Kendall coefficient of concordance, and Wilcoxon test. Tumor detectability was scored using a 5-point system (1 = best; 5 = worst) by 2 independent readers resulting in 170 evaluated tumors. Quantitative analysis included signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio and contrast measurements. P values Results:Better tumor detection was provided with split-bolus cone-beam CT (2.91/2.73) and HBP MR imaging (2.93/2.21) compared with arterial MR imaging (3.72/3.05; P Conclusions:Split-bolus cone-beam CT showed excellent detectability of HCC. Sensitivity is comparable to HBP MR imaging and better than arterial phase MR imaging.
