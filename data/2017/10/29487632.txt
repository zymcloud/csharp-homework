Metastatic tumor involvement of the heart is uncommon but may occur with all types of primary neoplasms. We report the case of a 51-year-old male who developed a massive mass involving the upper right pulmonary vein. The tumor was removed and the final pathology report disclosed metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma affecting the pulmonary veins is a very rare condition.
