Enhanced Myd88 expression has been found in various parenchymal tumors especially in hepatocellular carcinoma with little mechanism of its upregulation known. A lot of long non-coding RNAs are reported to regulate the protein-coding genes which have location association through various mechanisms. In our study we confirmed a new long non-coding RNA Myd88 aberrant upregulated in HCC located upstream of Myd88 and verified a positive regulation relationship between them indicating that Lnc-Myd88 might participate in the enhanced expression of Myd88 in HCC. The gain- and loss-of-function analysis revealed that Lnc-Myd88 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ChIP assays demonstrated that Lnc-Myd88 might increase Myd88 expression through enhancing H3K27Ac in the promoter of Myd88 gene, thus resulting in the activation of both NF-ÎºB and PI3K/AKT signal pathways. In conclusion, we proposed that Lnc-Myd88 might serve as a novel diagnosis and therapeutic target for HCC.
