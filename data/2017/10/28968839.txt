The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process is a crucial step for tumor invasion and metastasis. Previous research investigating EMT has mostly focused on its role in cancer progression. Recent studies showed that EMT and EMT-driving transcription factor (EMT-TF) expression are early events in lung cancer pathogenesis, implying a potential association between EMT and lung cancer risk. In this study, we examined whether genetic variants in EMT-related genes are associated with risk of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We used data from a genome-wide association study of 1482 NSCLC cases and 1544 healthy controls as the discovery phase, in which we analyzed 1602 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 159 EMT-related genes. We then validated the significant SNPs in another 5699 cases and 5815 controls from the National Cancer Institute lung cancer genome-wide association study. Cumulative effects were evaluated for validated SNPs, and a gene-based test was performed to explore gene-level association with disease risk. In the discovery phase, 174 SNPs demonstrated significant associations with NSCLC risk. In the validation phase, seven SNPs mapped to EGFR, NOTCH3, ADGRF1 and SMAD3 were confirmed. Cumulative effect analysis of the significant SNPs demonstrated increasing risk with the number of unfavorable genotypes in the discovery and validation datasets. Gene-based analysis implicated ADGRF1, NOTCH3 and CDH1 as significant for NSCLC risk. Functional prediction revealed several potential mechanisms underlying these associations. Our results suggest that EMT-related gene variants may be involved in susceptibility to NSCLC; if confirmed, they might help identify higher-risk individuals.
