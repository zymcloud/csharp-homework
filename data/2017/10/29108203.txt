Objective: To investigate the association between miR-146a single nucleotide polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data, and Google Scholar were searched for case-control studies on the association between miR-146a single nucleotide polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to HCC published up to October, 2016 in Chinese or English. The Q-statistics test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of these articles. Results: A total of 18 articles with 5 610 cases and 7 531 controls were included for the meta-analysis. There was no significant association between miR-146a single nucleotide polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to HCC. The odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI), and P values for the five genetic models were as follows: the allele model C/G (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.88-1.06, P = 0.440); the heterozygous model CG/GG (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.90-1.10, P = 0.898); the homozygous model CC/GG (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.75-1.10, P = 0.314); the dominant model CC+CG/GG (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.79-1.19, P = 0.759); the recessive model CG+GG/CC (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.94-1.18, P = 0.405). A subgroup analysis of race, source of control population, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were performed in these five genetic models, and miR-146a single nucleotide polymorphism increased the susceptibility to HCC only in the control population-based subgroups of the recessive model CG+GG/CC (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.40, P = 0.024). There was no association between miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and susceptibility to HCC in all the other subgroups. A stratified analysis of HBV infection revealed that miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism increased the risk of HBV-positive HCC (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.10-1.49, P = 0.001). Conclusion: There is no significant association between miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and the risk of HCC, but miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism may increase the risk of HBV-positive HCC.
