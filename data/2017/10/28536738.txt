Purpose:Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a promising therapeutic approach for clinical application. Cluster of differentiation 24 (CD24) is over-expressed in several human malignancies, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to develop a new class of CD24-targeted ADCs for HCC.Methods:DOX was conjugated with G7mAb by a heterobifunctional cross-linker GMBS (N-[gamma-maleimido butyryloxy] succinimide ester) and further analyzed using HPLC. The targeting specificity and endocytosis of the newly generated ADC, G7mAb-DOX, were characterized using flow cytometry assay, near-infrared fluorescence imaging and laser scanning confocal microscope. The antitumor effects were evaluated in nude mice bearing HCC xenografts.Results:G7mAb-DOX with average two drug molecules per antibody was selectively captured and endocytosed by CD24 (+) tumor cells in vitro. In vivo, the ADC was proved to target tumor tissues, suppress tumor growth and prolong the survival of HCC-bearing nude mice with improved efficacy and less systemic toxicity compared with either G7mAb or DOX single-agent treatment.Conclusion:These studies provide proof of concept for development of DOX-based ADCs which provide a novel approach for HCC-targeted immune therapy in clinical application.
