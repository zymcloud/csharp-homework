Background:The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the prognosis of patients with different types of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) recurrence following hepatectomy. Specifically, it evaluated overall survival and disease-free survival in HCC patients with multicentric occurrence (MO) or intrahepatic metastasis (IM).Methods:Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched until August 22, 2016 using the following search terms: hepatocellular carcinoma, multicentric occurrence, intrahepatic metastasis, early recurrence, and late recurrence. Prospective, retrospective, and case control studies were included.Results:The pooled results showed that patients in the MO group had lower risk of death than the IM group (pooled HR = 0.495, 95% CI = 0.378 to 0.648, P Conclusion:This study found that MO patients have greater survival following surgery than IM patients, indicating the prognosis of MO patients is significantly better than that for IM patients.
