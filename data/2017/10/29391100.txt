Minorhepatectomy (MH) is a common type of robotic-assisted liver resection, but few studies compared it with laparoscopic. We compared the perioperative outcomes of patients who underwent robotic (RH) or laparoscopic (LH) minor hepatectomy and evaluated the effect of surgeon's experience on outcomes. A prospective database was used to identify patients from 2009 through 2016 who underwent RH or LH. Two surgeons performed RH starting in 2014, whereas LH had been established before that. Of the 93 patients, 42 were in RH and 51 in LH group. The mean patient age, gender, race, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, proportion of patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were similar. Operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), conversion to open, 30-day complication rate, Clavien-Dindo grade â‰¥ 3 complications, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were similar. There was no difference in average tumor size, specimen volume, or achievement of R0 margin. In RH group, after completing 15 cases, there were no conversions to open. After 25 cases, EBL, LOS, and 30-day complication rate were improved as compared with LH. Perioperative outcomes of robotic MH are equivalent to laparoscopic. After approximately 25 cases, robotic-assisted MH may result in superior outcomes compared with laparoscopic.
