The present study aimed to assess the tumoricidal effect of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) induced by pterostilbene (PTER) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The SMMC-7721 hepatoma cell line was treated with PTER. Following treatment, the mRNA transcript abundance of MTA1 was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, cell viability was determined using an MTT assay, and protein expression was measured through western blotting. Cell invasion, motility and apoptosis, as well as the cell cycle, were also investigated. Following PTER treatment, MTA1, histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and HDAC2 were downregulated, whereas the ratio of acetyl-p53 to total p53 was increased in HCC cells. Cell viability decreased as the PTER dose increased. MTA1 may be associated with proliferation, motility, invasion and metastasis in HCC cells. PTER appeared to repress cell proliferation, trigger apoptosis, induce cell cycle arrest, and inhibit motility and invasion via MTA1 in human liver cancer cells. The results of the present study demonstrated that PTER can downregulate the MTA1-nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex, and enhance p53 acetylation to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in HCC.
