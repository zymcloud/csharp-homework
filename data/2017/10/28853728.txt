Objectives:Several viral and host risk factors have been used to predict risks of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, little is known whether fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, a liver fibrosis biomarker, helps identify non-cirrhotic patients with the lowest HCC risk.Methods:A total of 2075 treatment-naive Taiwanese patients with chronic HBV infection were followed for an average period of 16.02 years. None of them had liver cirrhosis at baseline. We explored whether a low FIB-4 index complements the favourable predictors to defines patients with the lowest HCC risk. The finding was validated in 532 non-cirrhotic patients receiving long-term nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) treatment with suppressed viral replication.Results:A total of 137 treatment-naive and 10 NUC-treated patients developed HCC, respectively. We found that HCC risk started to increase when baseline FIB-4 index >1.29 in the treatment-naive cohort. Patients with FIB-4 >1.29, compared to those with FIB-4 Conclusions:In non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HBV infection, FIB-4 index
