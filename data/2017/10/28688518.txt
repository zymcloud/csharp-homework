Background:Previous studies have demonstrated a strong association between the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and the outcomes of patients with resected hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal liver metastases. However, the predictive ability of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, especially those treated with preoperative chemotherapy, has been less well described.Methods:The clinicopathological characteristics, overall survival, and recurrence free survival of all patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma resected between 2000-2015, were compared between those with elevated (â‰¥3.0) and normal (Results:Among 119 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 64 (53.8%) had neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio Conclusion:Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated independently with worse survival in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma undergoing resection or neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to resection.
