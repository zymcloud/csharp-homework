Although sorafenib is currently used as a standard treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, low response rate, transient and limited efficacy, primary and acquired resistance and negative side-effects gain increasing attentions, suggesting the need for better efficacious combination therapy. Here, we demonstrated that the sorafenib-induced or hypoxia-induced hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2α could bind to an hypoxia responsive element within 500 bp region of androgen receptor (AR) promoter and thus transcriptionally suppress AR. Importantly, In vitro and In vivo studies suggested a specific and potent HIF-2α inhibitor, PT-2385, could significantly enhance sorafenib efficacy by suppressing HIF-2α, increasing AR and suppressing downstream pSTAT3/pAKT/pERK pathways. Clinical samples further confirmed the role of HIF-2α and AR. It is promising that PT-2385 could alleviate the undesirable side-effects of sorafenib treatment by sorafenib-PT-2385 combination therapy, which may shed light for late-stage HCC patients.
