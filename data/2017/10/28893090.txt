Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent and severe complication of cirrhosis. Most HCC patients initially present with or progress to advanced stage disease and require systemic treatment. As hypervascularization is a major characteristic of HCC, antiangiogenic drugs have been tested. Areas covered: In this review, we summarize data on the use of drugs targeting the angiogenesis. Despite many trials, in 2017 only 3 drugs, all antiangiogenic, have demonstrated efficacy in first (sorafenib, lenvatinib) or second line (regorafenib) treatment of advanced HCC. The heterogeneous mechanisms of action and the major reasons for failure of most trials are discussed. An English-language, abstract-based literature review was performed by a PubMed-based strategy. Expert opinion: Currently all trials based on purely antiangiogenic compounds (bevacizumab, linifanib, brivanib and ramucirumab) or drugs with strong antiangiogenic properties (sunitinib) have failed (increased toxicity, minor efficacy and/or flaws in trial design); sorafenib, lenvatinib and regorafenib are multityrosine kinase inhibitors and their efficacy can be partly related to another mechanism of action. We need to better refine future trials design (randomized phase 2, good stratification factors and marker-enriched patient selection) in order to progress toward customized treatment, perhaps in association with immunotherapy.
