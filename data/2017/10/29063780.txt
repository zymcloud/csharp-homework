Aim:Primary objectives of the study were to assess the safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using DC Bead LUMIâ„¢ for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and beads distribution after TACE.Patients/methods:This was a prospective observational cohort study. The study included 44 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who were treated with TACE using DC Bead LUMI. Beads distribution was monitored 1 h after TACE by CT scan.Results:TACE had no intraprocedural complications. Observed side effects were of mild intensity and included pain in 5 (11%), fever in 4 (9%) and vomiting in 2 (5%) patients. Most patients (89%) reported no adverse event. Non-target distribution was observed in only two cases (5%).Conclusion:DC Bead LUMI allowed assessing in real time their distribution. This could prevent non-target infusion and reduce toxicity.
