Purpose:To evaluate detailed organ-based radiation-absorbed dose for planning double high-dose treatment with I-MIBG.Methods:In a prospective study, 33 patients with high-risk refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma were treated with high-dose I-MIBG. Organ dosimetry was estimated from the first I-MIBG posttherapy imaging and from subsequent I-MIBG imaging prior to the planned second administration. Three serial whole-body scans were performed per patient 2 to 6 days after I-MIBG therapy (666 MBq/kg or 18 mCi/kg) and approximately 0.5, 24, and 48 hours after the diagnostic I-MIBG dose (370 MBq/kg or 10 mCi/1.73 m). Organ radiation doses were calculated using OLINDA. I-MIBG scan dosimetry estimations were used to predict doses for the second I-MIBG therapy and compared with I-MIBG posttherapy estimates.Results:Mean ± SD whole-body doses from I-MIBG and I-MIBG scans were 0.162 ± 112 and 0.141 ± 0.068 mGy/MBq, respectively. I-MIBG and I-MIBG organ doses were variable-generally higher for I-MIBG-projected doses than those projected using posttherapy I-MIBG scans. Mean ± SD doses to liver, heart wall, and lungs were 0.487 ± 0.28, 0.225 ± 0.20, and 0.40 ± 0.26, respectively, for I-MIBG and 0.885 ± 0.56, 0.618 ± 0.37, and 0.458 ± 0.56, respectively, for I-MIBG. Mean ratio of I-MIBG to I-MIBG estimated radiation dose was 1.81 ± 1.95 for the liver, 2.75 ± 1.84 for the heart, and 1.13 ± 0.93 for the lungs. No unexpected toxicities were noted based on I-MIBG-projected doses and cumulative dose limits of 30, 20, and 15 Gy to liver, kidneys, and lungs, respectively.Conclusions:For repeat I-MIBG treatment planning, both I-MIBG and I-MIBG imaging yielded variable organ doses. However, I-MIBG-based dosimetry yielded a more conservative estimate of maximum allowable activity and would be suitable for planning and limiting organ toxicity with repeat high-dose therapies.
