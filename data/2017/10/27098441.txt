Aim:Primary clear cell carcinoma of liver (PCCCL) is a specific and rare subtype of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a retrospective study with long-term follow-up to investigate predictive factors and prognosis of intrahepatic recurrences of PCCCL after radical resection.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed records of 38 patients with PCCCL who were diagnosed at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 1989 and September 2010, with a long-term follow up to January 2015, to determine their clinical characteristics and postoperative survival. The data were compared with 400 patients received radical hepatectomy for common type hepatocellular carcinoma (CHCC) during the study period.Results:PCCCL tumors were smaller than those of CHCC (P Conclusions:PCCCL is a less malignant subtype of HCC than CHCC, patients with PCCCL likely have later intrahepatic recurrences and a better prognosis. Edmondson grade predicts survival of patients with PCCCL after curative resection; those with higher Edmondson grades may require more careful follow-up and aggressive post-hepatectomy therapy.
