Background/aim:Cancer stem cells (CSC) plays an important role in various kinds of cancers. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of CD44 expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) as a marker of CSCs.Materials and methods:Thirty-five patients with IHCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were evaluated. CD44 expression was determined immunohistochemically. The patients were divided into a CD44-positive group (n=22) or CD44-negative group (n=13). Clinicopathological variables including prognosis were compared between the two groups.Results:The CD44-positive group had a worse prognosis than the CD44-negative group (5-year survival: 19.3% vs. 55.5%, respectively, p=0.016), although no difference in the background variables was observed. In multivariate analysis, CD44-positivity was identified as an independent prognostic factor (hazard ratio=3.676, p=0.034).Conclusion:These data suggest that CD44-positivity might be a candidate CSC marker in IHCC and a prognostic indicator.
