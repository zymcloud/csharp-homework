BACKGROUND Liver failure is the most feared complication following hepatectomy. Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is closely related to the remnant liver volume, and functional reserve. There are several methods for predicting PHLF prior to liver resection. The indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test was popularized in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC). We aim to demonstrate the value of preoperative ICG clearance measurement via pulse spectrophotometer (LIMONÂ®) in prediction of PHLF in noncirrhotic patients prior to liver resection. MATERIAL AND METHODS Fifty-three noncirrhotic patients who underwent liver resection due to different pathologies were included. Retrospectively collected clinical data, including the preoperative ICG clearance measurements and remnant liver volumes of the patients, were statistically evaluated according to the PHLF criteria of the International Study Group of Liver Surgery. RESULTS Four (7.5%) patients with PHLF were observed. There was no significant difference between PHLF and non-PHLF groups regarding ICG clearance measurements with cut-off values of 5% and 9.5%. CONCLUSIONS The ICG clearance test does not satisfy our expectations in noncirrhotic patients in predicting PHLF. We believe that the ICG clearance test should be reserved for patients with cirrhosis and/or HCC. This test could be an option for noncirrhotic patients with chronic active hepatitis, advanced-grade fatty livers, or for patients who received long-term preoperative chemotherapy, and also for patients who underwent single or multiple sessions of TACE or TARE prior to liver resection. If the routine selection criteria have been fulfilled, there is no further need to perform the ICG clearance test for living liver donors.
