Telomere length is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and recent studies have focused on the genetic alteration or polymorphism in telomere-maintaining genes. We examined the clinicopathologic and prognostic value of rs401681 polymorphism, located in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus, in HCC. The relationship between rs401681 variants and telomere length was also analyzed in 156 HCC patients. The rs401681 polymorphism had the following genotype frequencies: C/C in 51.3% of the samples, C/T in 39.7%, and T/T in 9.0%. Telomeres in the tumor samples were 4.04-fold longer, on average, than the telomeres in matched normal samples (SD =1.32), and there were no differences in telomere length according to rs401681 polymorphism (p=0.802). Our results indicate that the rs401681 C allele was significantly associated with increased T and International Union for Cancer Control stages (p<0.01). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses showed that HCC with C allele had poorer prognosis (p<0.01). In conclusion, our findings suggest that rs401681 is a possible prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.
