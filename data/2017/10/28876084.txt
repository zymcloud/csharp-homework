Schizophrenic patients tend to have reduced incidence of some cancers due to the treatment of antipsychotic drugs with antitumor effects, such as chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine (TFP). Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) as tumor suppressor in many malignancies is often inactivated by nuclear export, which could be inhibited by TFP. However, the antitumor efficiency of TFP and related role of FOXO1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unclear. Thus, two HCC cell lines SMMC-7721 and Bel-7402 were treated with different concentrations of TFP and the IC50 was determined. We found that TFP could inhibit the vitality of two cell lines and induce cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Meanwhile, the apoptosis was also increased and the ability of migration or invasion was found to be impaired by TFP. Interestingly, TFP reversed the cytoplasmic localization of FOXO1 to nuclear and increased its expression in nuclear, and increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. However, knockdown of FOXO1 significantly abrogated the TFP-induced apoptosis by decreasing the Bcl-2 expression [corrected]. Furthermore, we found that TFP in vivo could effectively restrict the angiogenesis and tumor growth with reduced expression of VEGF, Bcl-2, and PCNA, and increased the nuclear localization of FOXO1, which indicated its antitumor role in HCC.
