Background:This study examined whether serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and chronic liver diseases were interactively, jointly, or independently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in type 2 diabetic patients.Materials and methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 46,369 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients, aged 30 and older, in National Diabetes Care Management Program in 2002-2004. These data were analyzed by multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Results:Mean follow-up period was 8.20 years. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios of HCC were 2.85 (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.45-3.31), 3.80 (3.04-4.76), and 3.89 (3.08-4.91) for patients with a level of ALT 40-80, 80-120, and >120 U/L, respectively, compared with patients with a level of ALT Conclusions:Results suggest significant effect modification and joint associations of ALT â‰¥ 40 U/L and chronic liver diseases. Diabetes care should provide lifestyle or treatment interventions to manage ALT level, liver cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus infection for reducing burden of HCC.
