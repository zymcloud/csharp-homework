The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PCAT-1 resides in the chromosome 8q24 cancer-risk locus and acts as a vital oncogene during tumorigenesis and progression. However, how PCAT-1 is post-transcriptionally regulated, for example, by small ncRNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) is largely unknown. Here, we report how miRNAs regulate PCAT-1 expression and also investigate the biological significance of this regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that miR-215, a P53-inducible miRNA, is a key regulator of PCAT-1 expression in HCC and identified an interaction between miR-215 and PCAT-1 in dual luciferase reporter gene assays. We also found that post-transcriptional silencing of PCAT-1 by miR-215 or PCAT-1 siRNAs significantly inhibited proliferation of HCC cells and, conversely, that inhibition of endogenous miR-215 up-regulated PCAT-1 expression and promoted cell viability. The tumor-suppressing role of miR-215 was further confirmed in an in vivo mouse HCC xenograft model. Of note, gene profiling assays suggested that the kinase CRK-like proto-oncogene, adaptor protein (CRKL), is a potential downstream target of the miR-215-PCAT-1 axis in HCC, and we demonstrated that CRKL silencing significantly suppresses cell proliferation. Taken together and considering the essential role of CRKL in cancer cells, we propose that the TP53-miR-215-PCAT-1-CRKL axis might represent an important regulatory pathway in HCC. In summary, our results highlight the involvement of several ncRNAs in HCC and thus provide critical insights into the molecular pathways operating in this malignancy.
