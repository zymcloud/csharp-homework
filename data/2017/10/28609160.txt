Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in about 3-4% of cirrhotic patients every year. The squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) has been found elevated in liver cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry, and detected in complex with IgM (SCCA-IgM) in the serum of patients with HCC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of serological SCCA-IgM levels to predict the efficacy of HCC therapy.Materials and methods:From April 2012 to April 2014, 131 patients with a new diagnosis of HCC were enrolled. The HCC diagnosis was made according to the EASL guidelines. The patients were staged and treated according to the BCLC Staging System: BCLC stages A and B were treated with locoregional therapy, and BCLC stage C was treated with Sorafenib. Response to therapy was evaluated according to the mRECIST criteria. Serum SCCA-IgM levels were determined by a commercially available ELISA kit at basal time (T0) and after one month of treatment (T1).Results:At baseline and one month into therapy, SCCA-IgM levels were significantly lower (p value 0:115.1 AU/mL [50.0 + 174.4] vs. 149.1 AU/mL [111.3 + 198.8]; median SCCA-IgM level [25th + 75th percentile] at T1: 113.4 AU/mL [50.0 + 194.2] vs. 170.6 AU/mL [111.7 + 344.2]).Conclusion:Our study suggests that the SCCA-IgM determination could be helpful in predicting the response to therapy in patients with HCC.
