Alcohol is an established risk factor for cirrhosis. Current recommendations for a "safe" limit for alcohol consumption are usually set to around 30 g of alcohol per day for men and 20 g per day for women, but evidence is mounting that these cut-offs might be set too high. Also, inter-individual differences in the hepatic sensitivity for alcohol likely play into the risk of development of cirrhosis. In patients with concomitant liver diseases, a synergistic effect on fibrosis progression and high consumption of alcohol is evident. The role of low to moderate consumption is less clear. Alcohol can also lead to a specific inflammatory state in the liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH). Treatment of severe AH consists of corticosteroids, which are at best moderately effective, and new treatments are needed. Liver transplantation is an option in severe alcoholic liver disease, although selection of patients that are at a very low risk of post-transplantation alcohol consumption is paramount. There is some evidence to suggest an increased risk for fibrosis progression and development of hepatocellular carcinoma specifically for smoking.
