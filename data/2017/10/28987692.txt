Intrahepatic chlangiocarcinomas (CCs), the second most common primary malignant liver tumours, usually occur in non-cirrhotic liver, and can be classified into three types based on gross morphology: mass-forming; periductal infiltrating; and intraductal growing. Among them, mass-forming intrahepatic CCs are the most common type and characterized by homogeneous mass with an irregular but well-defined margin with peripheral enhancement on late arterial phase and delayed enhancement in central portion of tumours corresponding to the fibrous stroma. Several imaging features such as enhancement pattern and degree of diffusion restriction have been suggested as prognostic markers for mass-forming CCs. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the most common primary malignant liver tumors, and usually arise from the cirrhotic liver. However, approximately 20% of HCCs involve the non-cirrhotic liver (hereafter, non-cirrhotic HCC), and non-cirrhotic HCCs are often detected at an advanced stage due to the lack of surveillance for patients with non-cirrhotic liver. Other primary malignant liver tumours other than CCs and HCCs including angiosarcoma, undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma are quite rare, and imaging diagnosis is often difficult. This review offers a brief overview of epidemiology, risk factors and imaging features of primary malignant tumours in non-cirrhotic liver. Understanding of radiologic appearance and predisposing clinical features as well as differentials of primary malignant tumour in non-cirrhotic liver can be helpful for radiologists to adequately assess these tumours, and subsequently to make optimal management plan.
