Background:The study aimed too investigate the rate of hepatoceliac lymph node (HCLN) involvement, as well as its association with clinicopathologic features, together with morbidity of HCLN resection and the prognostic impact of metastatic HCLN status on patients with advanced ovarian cancer (OC) undergoing cytoreductive surgery.Methods:All consecutive patients with stages 3c to 4 epithelial OC who underwent HCLN surgery from January 2010 to September 2016 were analyzed for surgical procedures, pathology, and oncologic outcomes.Results:During the study period, 85 patients underwent HCLN resection. Absence of visible tumor at the end of surgery was documented for 73 of the patients (85.9%). The median number of HCLNs removed was 6 (range 1-18). Histopathologic evaluation was able to identify HCLN metastasis in 45 (52.9%) of the 85 cases. No difference in the rate of surgical morbidity according to pathologic status of HCLN was observed. As of December 2016, the median follow-up period was 36 months (range 6-54 months). Recurrence of disease was observed in 35 (41.2%) of the 85 cases. Relapse of disease most frequently occurred for the patients with metastatic HCLN involvement (65.7%) compared with the patients who had no HCLN involvement (34.3%) (p = 0.048). The median progression-free survival values were 16 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 12-19 months) for the patients with metastatic HCLNs and 22 months (95% CI, 12-19 months) for the patients with no HCLN involvement (p = 0.035).Conclusions:The study confirmed that HCLN surgery is feasible with acceptable morbidities for patients with advanced OC. Metastatic HCLNs are a marker of disease severity associated with worst oncologic outcome.
