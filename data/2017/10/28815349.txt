Background and aims:To evaluate the clinical value of tumor growth rate in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, we investigated the growth rate of HCC by calculating the tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) and its impact on survival and recurrence.Methods:A retrospective cohort study of 269 HCC patients who underwent two or more pretreatment imaging studies of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Tumor growth rate and TVDT were calculated by comparing tumor volumes between imaging studies. Clinical parameters independently related to a TVDT of 2 months) and rapid-growing (110 patients with TVDT Results:The median tumor growth rate and TVDT were 37.5%/month and 2.37 months, respectively. By logistic regression analyses, a high Child-Pugh score, small initial tumor diameter, gross vascular invasion, and tumor multiplicity were found to be independently associated with a TVDT of Conclusions:A fast HCC growth rate is associated with poor liver function and aggressive tumor biology. HCC patients with shorter TVDTs exhibit poorer survival and recurrence outcomes as well as a poor response to TACE.
