Background:ZEB1-AS1 acts as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma, accelerating tumor growth and promoting metastasis. However, its roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear.Methods:In this study, we determined the expression of ZEB1-AS1 in CRC tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, we investigated the relationship between various clinicopathological features of CRC patients and ZEB1-AS1 expression, and evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic value of ZEB1-AS1 in CRC.Results:We found that ZEB1-AS1 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in adjacent normal colorectal tissues. Moreover, its expression was significantly correlated with tumor size, differentiation degree, TNM grade, metastasis, depth of invasion and Dukes' classification, but not with sex, age, location and organization. In addition, at the optimal cutoff value of 2.340, the values of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity amounted to 63.0% and 90.7%, respectively, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.846 (95% CI, 0.797-0.895). Finally, CRC patients of the high ZEB1-AS1 expression group had a poorer prognosis and a significantly lower survival rate than those of the low expression group, and Cox regression analysis indicated that ZEB1-AS1 expression and metastasis were independent predictors of poor prognosis.Conclusions:Our data suggest that ZEB1-AS1 has no obvious early diagnostic value, but it may be utilized as a new prognostic biomarker for CRC.
