Objective:Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), are related to HBV associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study recruited HCC patients and employed the SMMC-7721 and L02 liver cell lines, to analyze the expression levels of HBx, VEGF and CEACAM1 in liver cancer and their correlation with the cancer prognosis.Patients and methods:HBV-related HCC patients were recruited from our hospital. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting assay were used to detect the expression of HBx, VEGF and CEACAM1 in liver tissues. Multi-variant analysis and the correlation analysis between HBx, VEGF, CEACAM1 expression and clinical/pathological features of HCC were performed by using the Cox regression analysis.Results:In HBV-related HCC tissues, positive expression rates of HBx, CEACAM1, and VEGF, were 80%, 50%, and 65%, respectively. In HBx-positive group, positive rate for CEACAM1 and VEGF were 56.25% and 75%, while in HBx-negative group such figures were 75% and 25% (pConclusions:HBx, VEGF and CEACAM1 were widely expressed in HBV-related HCC. HBx may facilitate occurrence and progression of HBV-related HCC via down-regulating CEACAM1 and up-regulating VEGF.
