Ovarian clear cell carcinoma represents a distinct histopathological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, with poor outcomes, especially in cases diagnosed in advanced stages of disease. However, even in these cases, it seems that the most effective treatment remains debulking surgery to no residual disease. We present the case of a 56-year-old patient diagnosed with a large pelvic mass invading the rectosigmoidal colon, and ileal loop who was successfully submitted to cytoreductive surgery to no residual disease. The histopathological studies demonstrated the presence of a well-differentiated clear cell ovarian carcinoma of the ovary. At 1-year follow-up there is no evidence of residual disease.
