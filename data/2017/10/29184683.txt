Background:Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 resin (Y-90 resin) microspheres has been used as a locoregional therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined patient and disease characteristics that might affect survival after Y-90 resin, as well as treatment tolerability.Methods:Data from patients with unresectable HCC treated with Y-90 resin at a single institution were reviewed retrospectively. Survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. Response was evaluated with the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria. Adverse events (AEs) were noted, and laboratory values were graded with CTCAE v3.0.Results:Data from 111 patients were analyzed. AEs occurred in 23 patients at 1 week after treatment and in 46 at 3 months. At 6 months, 13 patients had a complete response and 13 had a partial response. Factors associated with longer overall survival (OS) included early-stage disease [27.8 months for patients with Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) A vs. 9.2 months for BCLC C]; treatment with other locoregional therapies (69.0 vs. 11.4 months); and lack of bilobar disease (23.5 vs. 9.4 months), portal vein thrombosis (16.2 vs. 8.6 months), ascites (16.6 vs. 10.3 months), and treatment with sorafenib (17.2 vs. 10.3 months). In six patients, Y-90 resin was used as a bridge to liver transplantation, which greatly improved survival (69.0 vs. 12.1 months).Conclusions:Several characteristics may prove useful for selecting patients likely to respond well to Y-90 resin. These results should be confirmed in prospective studies.
