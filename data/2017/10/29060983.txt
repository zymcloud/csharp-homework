Objective: A prospective cohort study was carried out to assess the mortality and potential risk factors for primary liver cancer (PLC) in Haimen city of Jiangsu province. Methods: The cohort involved 89 789 adult residents aged 25-69 years. Upon the entry of this project, each subject was asked to complete a questionnaire and to provide a blood sample of 10 ml. Surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) was tested by radioimmunoassay. All the subjects were followed-up every year for vital statistics and death certificate information until 2014. Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for PLC mortality associated with HBsAg status and other risk factors. Results: During the 1 299 611 person-years of follow-up, a total of 2 583 PLC cases were identified, including 2 149 men and 434 women. Mortality of the PLC for men and women were 247.80/100 000 person-years and 100.38/100 000 person-years, respectively. Among those who died of PLC, 73.87% had been tested HBsAg positive. HBV infection seemed the predominant risk factor for PLC and the HRs were 15.97 for men (95%CI: 14.29-17.85) and 21.63 for women (95%CI: 16.16-28.96) respectively. Ageing, cigarette smoking, previous history of hepatitis, and family history of HCC were factors associated with the increased risk for PLC. Conclusion: People living in Haimen city had a high risk on PLC. HBV infection appeared the most important risk factor for HCC mortality in this area.
