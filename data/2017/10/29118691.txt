We report a case of vanishing tumor considered as inflammatory pseudotumor (IPT) found in the liver after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) from a hepatitis B virus surface antigen-positive donor. The radiological findings were similar to those of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the tumor disappeared completely within several months and was suggested to have been an IPT. IPT is known to be associated with biliary duct operation or biliary infection, and it can show various enhancement patterns in radiological studies, sometimes resembling HCC. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a liver tumor in patients with LDLT.
