Background:The availability of novel direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represents a new era of curative hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, with over 95% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1 achieving sustained virological response (SVR). Nevertheless, the majority of patients globally are unable to access these treatments because of cost and infrastructure constraints and, thus, remain untreated and uncured.Data source:Relevant articles of peginterferon (PegIFN)-based treatments in HCV and sofosbuvir-based treatments, simeprevir, daclatasvir/asunaprevir, ritonavir-boosted paritaprevir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir, and grazoprevir/elbasvir, were searched in PubMed database, including general population and special population.Results:PegIFN in combination with ribavirin remains an important and relevant option for some patients, achieving SVR rates of up to 79% in genotype 1 and 89% in genotype 2 or 3 infections, which increases for patients with favorable IL28B genotypes. Triple therapy of DAA plus PegIFN/ribavirin is effective in treating difficult-to-cure patients infected with HCV genotype 3 or with resistance-associated variants. Owing to its long history in HCV management, the efficacy, tolerability and long-term outcomes associated with PegIFN alfa-2a are well established and have been validated in large-scale studies and in clinical practice for many populations. Furthermore, emerging data show that IFN-induced SVR is associated with lower incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma compared with DAAs. On the contrary, novel DAAs have yet to be studied in special populations, and long-term outcomes, particularly tumor development and recurrence in patients with cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma, and reactivation of HBV in dually infected patients, are still unclear.Conclusion:In this interferon-free era, PegIFN-based regimens remain a safe and effective option for selected HCV patients.
