Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high predilection with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). However, part of the PVTT type can be found only under the microscopy, which was namely as type I0. The objective of this study was to establish a simple and inexpensive non-invasive model to predict the presentation of PVTT at HCC patients. A total of 815 HCC patients were retrospectively evaluated and randomly assigned into 2 groups: the training group (n = 408) and validation group (n = 407). A new index model, namely WγAL, was built to predict the presence of PVTT in the training subjects and was further validated in the validation subjects. At the optimal cutoff of 8.90, WγAL identified patients with a hazard ratio (HR) of 7.139 for the presence of PVTT. The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of WγAL was 0.795 (sensitivity: 71.9%; specificity: 78.6%) for differentiation between PVTT and non-PVTT patients in the training group. The AUROC of WγAL in differentiating patients with PVTT type I0 from non-PVTT patients was 0.748 (sensitivity: 72.1%; specificity: 68.4%) with an HR of 5.355. In addition, WγAL > 8.90 was significantly associated with large tumors, multiple tumor numbers, TNM stage III-IV, metastasis, and overall survival in HCC patients. The novel predictive model represents a simple and inexpensive model that can identify the presence of PVTT in HCC patients with a high degree of accuracy, with important clinical significance in the future therapeutic management of HCC patients.
