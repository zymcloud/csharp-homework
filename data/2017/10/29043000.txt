Chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection is a burden on global healthcare and is associated with a higher risk of serious sequelae, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical application of entecavir as a treatment for CHB has produced positive outcomes, and so is an attractive form of pharmacological therapy. However, little data exists comparing the safety and efficacy of entecavir for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related compensated, and decompensated cirrhosis, respectively. The aim of the present study was to evaluate entecavir therapy as a treatment for patients with HBV-related compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. A retrospective analysis of 46 compensated patients (compensated group) and 51 decompensated cirrhotic patients (decompensated group) treated with entecavir was conducted. Baseline demographics, clinical outcomes, and adverse events during the treatment were compared. Treatment with entecavir for 96 weeks resulted in significant improvements in serum levels of HBV DNA (P=0.002), albumin (P=0.014), cholinesterase (CHE; P=0.001), HBV DNA negativity rate (P=0.004), Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (P=0.030), alanine aminotransferase normalized rate (P=0.039), and the degree of esophageal varices liver stiffness (P=0.002) in the two groups. However, statistical analysis revealed that the improvements were significantly higher in the compensated group compared with the decompensated group (P
