Previous research has demonstrated the anti-tumor properties of Abnormal Savda Munziq (ASMq), a traditional Uyghur compound herbal medicine. The effects of ASMq on cervical carcinomas in U27 tumor-bearing mice is investigated, the effect of adding Fluorouracil (5-FU) is also assessed in this paper. The results demonstrate that ASMq and 5-FU significantly inhibited the proliferation of U27 cells in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Evaluating the interactions between ASMq and 5-FU on U27 cell growth yields a combination index (CI) < 1 in different time periods, suggesting a synergistic effect between the two drugs in vitro. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis demonstrates that ASMq can inhibit enhanced lipid metabolism in tumor mice, enhance the glutamine content, promote lymphocyte and macrophage proliferation, and increase tumor necrosis factor(TNF-Î±) and interleukin(IL) production, which can enhance the effect of 5-FU on the inhibition of tumors. Also ASMq can reduce the content of ALT and AST in serum. Increased SOD, GSH-Px, and decreased the content of MDA in liver tissue. ASMq has a synergistic effect on liver and tumor pathology, as well as tumor inhibition rate. In addition, ASMq can also enhance the body's antioxidant capacity and improve the body's metabolism, and reduce 5-FU's toxic side effects.
