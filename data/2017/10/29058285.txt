Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a process by which aggressive tumor cells generate non-endothelial cell-lined channels in malignant tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has provided new insights into tumor behavior and has surfaced as a potential target for drug therapy. The molecular events underlying the process of VM formation are still poorly understood. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between Notch4 and VM formation in HCC. An effective siRNA lentiviral vector targeting Notch4 was constructed and transfected into Bel7402, a HCC cell line. VM networks were observed with a microscope in a 3 dimensional cell culture system. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using wound healing and transwell assays. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity was detected by gelatin zymography. Furthermore, the role of Notch4 inhibition in Bel7402 cells in vivo was examined in subcutaneous xenograft tumor model of mice. The results showed that downregulation of Notch4 destroyed VM network formation and inhibited migration and invasion of tumor cells in vitro (P
