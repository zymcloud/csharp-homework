Fusion images of diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background body signal suppression and T2-weighted image (DWIBS/T2) demonstrate a strong signal for malignancies, with a high contrast against the surrounding tissues, and enable anatomical analysis. In the present study, DWIBS/T2 was compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for diagnosing cancer in the abdomen. Patient records, including imaging results of examination conducted between November 2012 and May 2014, were analyzed retrospectively. In total, 10 men (age, 73.6±9.6 years) and 8 women (age, 68.9±7.1 years) were enrolled into the current study. Of the enrolled patients, 2 were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 with cholangiocellular carcinoma, 1 with liver metastasis, 2 with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 1 with renal cell carcinoma and 1 with malignant lymphoma. Benign lesions were also analyzed, including adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder (5 patients), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (4 patients) and right adrenal adenoma (1 case). All the patients with cancer showed positive results on DWIBS/T2 images. However, only 7 out of 8 patients were positive with PET/CT. One patient with right renal cellular carcinoma was positive with DWIBS/T2, but negative with PET/CT. All the patients with benign lesions were negative with DWIBS/T2 and PET/CT. In conclusion, DWIBS/T2 was more sensitive in diagnosing cancer of organs in the abdominal cavity compared with PET/CT. Furthermore, negative results with DWIBS/T2 and PET/CT were useful for the diagnosis of benign lesions, such as adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.
