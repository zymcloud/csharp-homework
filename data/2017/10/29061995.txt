The general prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains extremely dismal, due to the high frequency of metastasis. Since 2003, our research group has explored the gene expression profiles of metastasized HCC tissue samples and identified a significant upregulation of CCN3. However, the role and precise pathological function of CCN3 remains elusive. We showed that CCN3 is associated with the poor prognosis of patients with HCC, the malignant phenotype of HCC, and vascular thrombosis. We further evaluated the negative roles of CCN3 in vitro and in vivo, and identified osteopontin (OPN), and coagulation factors tissue factor (TF) and thrombin as the leading genes downstream of CCN3, that are positively associated with HCC cell stemness. We demonstrated that overexpressed CCN3 in HCC cells leads to enhanced survival and increased number of pulmonary metastases in vivo. The elevated levels of OPN and TF were associated with signal activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). Our findings suggest CCN3 is a potential therapeutic target that would affect the upregulation of OPN and coagulation factors, which would lead to an enhanced stemness and blood coagulation microenvironment in HCC tissue.
