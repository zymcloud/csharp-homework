The effects of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unclear. In this study, we identified an interferon (IFN)-γ-induced LncRNA, LncRNA00364, in HCC by microarray. LncRNA00364 displays lower expression in HCC tumor samples compared to paired normal controls. Overexpression of LncRNA00364 inhibits cell proliferation, G1/S cell cycle progression and promotes apoptosis in HCC cell lines. Consistently, LncRNA00364 overexpression leads to decreased HCC tumor formation in vivo. Mechanistically, LncRNA00364 specifically binds with STAT3, resulting in inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation and therefore leads to upregulation of IFIT2. In a clinical setting, LncRNA00364 shows an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival and cumulative recurrence in HCC patients, and correlates with IFIT2. Therefore, our study provides new insights into a novel therapeutic avenue targeting the LncRNA00364 signaling axis in HCC.
