Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended as the standard care for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A-B. However, the efficacy of TACE on large (â‰¥ 10 cm) stage A-B HCC is far from satisfactory, and it is proposed that hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) might be a better first-line treatment of this disease. Hence, we compared the safety and efficacy of HAIC with the modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) regimen and those of TACE in patients with massive unresectable HCC.Methods:A prospective, non-randomized, phase II study was conducted on patients with massive unresectable HCC. The protocol involved HAIC with the mFOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m2 intra-arterial infusion; leucovorin, 400 mg/m2 intra-arterial infusion; and fluorouracil, 400 mg/m2 bolus infusion and 2400 mg/m2 continuous infusion) every 3 weeks and TACE with 50 mg of epirubicin, 50 mg of lobaplatin, 6 mg of mitomycin, and lipiodol and polyvinyl alcohol particles. The tumor responses, time-to-progression (TTP), and safety were assessed.Results:A total of 79 patients were recruited for this study: 38 in the HAIC group and 41 in the TACE group. The HAIC group exhibited higher partial response and disease control rates than did the TACE group (52.6% vs. 9.8%, P Conclusions:HAIC with mFOLFOX yielded significantly better treatment responses and less serious toxicity than did TACE. HAIC might represent a feasible and promising first-line treatment for patients with massive unresectable HCC.
