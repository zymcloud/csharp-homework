Chronic HBV infection is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The association between hepatitis B "e" antigen (HBeAg) and HCC is well-established by epidemiological studies. Nonetheless, the biological role of HBeAg in HCC remains enigmatic. We investigate the role of HBeAg in HBV-related HCC. Our findings suggest that HBeAg enhances cell proliferation and accelerates progression from G0/G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle in Huh7 cells. Examination of host gene expression and miRNA expression profiles reveals a total of 21 host genes and 12 host miRNAs that were differentially regulated in cells expressing HBeAg. Importantly, HBeAg induced the expression of miR-106b, an oncogenic miRNA. Interestingly, HBeAg-expression results in a significant reduction in the expression of retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, an experimentally validated target of miR-106b. Inhibition of miR-106b significantly increased the expression of the Rb gene, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and slowing of cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 phase to S phase. These observations suggest that the up-regulation of miR-106b by HBeAg contributes to the pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC by down-regulating the Rb gene. Our results highlight a role for HBeAg in HCC and provide a novel perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying HBV-related HCC.
