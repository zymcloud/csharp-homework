Liver cancer is the one of most common types of cancer and the 2nd cause of cancer-associated mortalities worldwide. Establishing appropriate animal models of liver cancer is essential for basic and translational studies. The present study evaluated the effects of the combined use of alcohol with a conventional chemical-induced mouse liver cancer model. The treatment of alcohol/diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in the mice of experimental groups resulted in a series of pathological changes in the liver. Liver inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were identified, and this method used less time (1-5 months) for inducement compared with the conventional chemical-induced method alone. In addition, murine Î±-fetoprotein (mAFP) was expressed throughout and ultrastructural features met the criteria for liver cancer. Fatty degeneration of pancreas, reduced blood glucose levels, and increased spleen weight were observed. These results indicated that an AFP-secreting hepatocellular carcinoma model of BALB/c mouse was successfully developed. The disease process and morphological changes met the criterion of the liver cancer process. Therefore the model developed in the present study may be an ideal animal model for studying the occurrence and development of liver cancer.
