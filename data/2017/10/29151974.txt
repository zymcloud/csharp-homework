Surgical resection remains the initial treatment of choice for the majority of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Although the factors that influence the prognosis of postoperative HCC patients have been well elucidated, there are a limited number of simple, objective, and distinct methods for estimating survival for postoperative patients with solitary HCC within the Milan criteria and Child-Pugh (C-P) A cirrhosis. The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score is a new evidence-based approach to assess liver function. The ALBI score eliminates subjective variables, such as ascites and encephalopathy which are the requirements for the conventional C-P grading system. This study enrolled 654 patients to determine whether the ALBI score can predict the outcomes of postoperative solitary HCC patients within the Milan criteria and C-P A cirrhosis. Our results showed the ALBI score significantly influenced the overall survival and cumulative recurrence rates. Furthermore, the ALBI score was significantly related to the degree of liver cirrhosis and serum Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) concentration in solitary HCC cases within the Milan criteria and C-P A cirrhosis. Additionally, the combination of the ALBI score and serum GGT concentration contributed to the prognosis prediction in this cohort. In conclusion, we externally validated the ALBI grade as a novel biomarker to predict prognosis for solitary HCC within the Milan Criteria and C-P A cirrhosis.
