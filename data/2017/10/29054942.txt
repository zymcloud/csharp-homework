A 36-year-old woman was diagnosed with compensated cirrhosis of liver secondary to Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and had undergone stenting of a thrombosed left hepatic vein. Eight months later, she presented with jaundice and right upper quadrant pain. CT revealed multiple focal lesions in the liver, which on biopsy proved to be hepatic hemangioendothelioma (HHE). Her liver disease and ascites progressively increased. Four months later, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed an advanced stage of HHE with infiltration of the common bile duct and vascular invasion with a blocked stent, with metastasis to the spleen and dorsolumbar vertebrae. We believe this is the first reported case of an HHE developing in the background of BCS.
