Purpose:To compare physicochemical properties of emulsions of ethiodized oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet, Villepinte, France) and epirubicin prepared using different techniques for conventional transarterial chemoembolization.Materials and methods:Lipiodol was mixed with epirubicin solution (8.33 mg/mL) by using a 3-way stopcock. The following technical parameters were compared: ratio of epirubicin solution to Lipiodol (1:2 vs 1:1), number of pumping exchanges through the stopcock (20 exchanges vs 10 exchanges), pumping speed (1 s/push vs 2 s/push), and first push syringe (epirubicin solution vs Lipiodol).Results:The mean percentage of water-in-oil was 70.45 ± 1.51 in the 1:2 epirubicin-Lipiodol ratio and 16.03 ± 2.95 in the 1:1 ratio (P Conclusions:The ratio of epirubicin to Lipiodol is a significant factor to form water-in-oil emulsions with higher viscosity. The percentage of water-in-oil is limited to 70% using current pumping techniques. The pumping speed strongly influences droplet size and viscosity.
