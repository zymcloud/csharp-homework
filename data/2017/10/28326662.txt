Aim:The risk of hepatitis C virus infection-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is lower, with a better prognosis, in patients who achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) than in those who do not. We aimed to identify risk factors of post-hepatectomy HCC recurrence in patients who achieved a SVR.Methods:This retrospective study included 349 HCC patients who underwent an initial radical hepatectomy at our institution between January 2005 and December 2014. Sixty-eight patients had achieved a SVR (the SVR group) and 281 patients had not (the non-SVR group). Clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified variables associated with recurrence-free survival in the SVR group.Results:Post-hepatectomy overall and recurrence-free survival rates were significantly higher in the SVR group than the non-SVR group (P Conclusion:The interval between achieving a SVR and hepatectomy is an important predictor of recurrence in hepatitis C virus infection-related HCC patients who achieved a SVR.
