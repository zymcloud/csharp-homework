Aim:To elucidate the role of STAT3 in hepatocarcinogenesis and biliary ductular proliferation following chronic liver injury.Methods:We investigated thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver injury, compensatory hepatocyte proliferation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in hepatic STAT3-deficient mice. In addition, we evaluated TAA-induced biliary ductular proliferation and analyzed the activation of sex determining region Y-box9 (SOX9) and Yes-associated protein (YAP), which regulate the transdifferentiation of hepatocytes to cholangiocytes.Results:Both compensatory hepatocyte proliferation and HCC formation were significantly decreased in hepatic STAT3-deficient mice as compared with control mice. STAT3 deficiency resulted in augmentation of hepatic necrosis and fibrosis. On the other hand, biliary ductular proliferation increased in hepatic STAT3-deficient livers as compared with control livers. SOX9 and YAP were upregulated in hepatic STAT3-deficient hepatocytes.Conclusion:STAT3 may regulate hepatocyte proliferation as well as transdifferentiation into cholangiocytes and serve as a therapeutic target for HCC inhibition and biliary regeneration.
