Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors of primary liver cancer treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and then to establish a prognostic model. Methods: Clinicopathological and follow-up data of 145 patients who underwent TACE combined with RFA from January 2010 to December 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model, and the prognostic model was established. Results: The 1, 2, and 3-year survival rates were 92.6%, 81.4% and 66.2%, respectively. The 3-year recurrence and metastasis rate was 64.8%.Multivariate analysis showed that female cases and higher serum albumin levels were the protective factors for the 3-year overall and relapse-free survival of patients(P<0.05 for all). High levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL), portal vein thrombosis and higher Child Pugh stages were the independent risk factors for the 3-year overall survival(P<0.05 for all). High levels of AFP, TBIL, portal vein thrombosis and advanced stages of BCLC staging (B and C) were the independent risk factors for tumor recurrence and metastasis(P<0.05 for all). The predictive model established based on the multivariate analysis showed good sensitivity and specificity. The area under ROC curve were higher than 0.90. Conclusions: The prognosis of liver cancer patients treated with TACE combined with RFA is affected by various clinicopathological factors. The systematic evaluation of the relevant factors before treatment may help to select proper patients and improve prognosis.
