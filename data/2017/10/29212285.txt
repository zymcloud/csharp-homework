Long non-coding RNAs account for large proportion of non-coding transcripts in human genomes. Though they lack of open reading framework and cannot encode protein, they can control endogenous gene expression though regulating cell life activities. They serve as transcriptional modulator, posttranscriptional processor, chromatin remodeler and splicing regulator during the process of gene modification. Moreover, long non-coding RNAs were regarded as potential tumor markers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. BANCR was identified as a cancer-promoting long non-coding RNA in melanoma tissues. Since then, increasing studies about BANCR in cancer progression were reported. BANCR was dysregulated in various cancers including melanoma, colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma, lung carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, and increased BANCR expression cause poor prognosis and shorter survival rate of cancer patients. Furthermore, the functions and mechanisms of BANCR in cancer cells have been clarified. Here, we focus on the current research on the role of BANCR in the clinical management, progression and molecular mechanisms in human cancer.
