Background:Cirrhosis is a heterogeneous clinical condition that includes patients at wide-ranging stages of severity. The role of the underlying liver disease on patient prognosis remains unclear.Aim:To assess the impact of the underlying liver disease on the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death.Methods:Data related to the occurrence of HCC and death were collected during a 21-year period among patients with cirrhosis related to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (n = 529), chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (n = 145) or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n = 78).Results:At inclusion, ALD patients were younger than HCV and NAFLD patients (56 vs. 67 vs. 63 years; pConclusion:Despite a lower incidence of HCC, patients with ALD-related cirrhosis have a worse outcome than those with chronic HCV infection or NAFLD-related cirrhosis.
