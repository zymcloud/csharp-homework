To explore the effects and mechanism of aqueous extracts of gecko on cancer stem cells properties of hepatocellular carcinoma. In vitro, MTT assay was used to detect the cells growth in Huh7 and Hep3B. Spheroid-forming assay and flow cytometry were performed to observe the the stemness of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. The protein expressions of β-catenin, CD44, c-Myc, CCND1, Sox2, Oct4, Nanog and ABCG2 were detected by Western blot. Interacting proteins were detected by co-immunoprecipitation; and a subcutaneous xenograft model was used to detect the stemness of hepatoma carcinoma cells. The results indicated that aqueous extracts of gecko induced cell growth inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with the IC₅₀ of (0.750±0.112) g•mL⁻¹ for Huh7 and (0.454±0.039) g•mL⁻¹ for Hep3B, respectively. The number and size of tumor spheres formed by hepatoma carcinoma cells were decreased after treatment by aqueous extracts of gecko(P
