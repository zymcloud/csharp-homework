The human insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) gene transcribes four mRNAs (P1 mRNA-P4 mRNA), and P3 mRNA overexpression contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis. IGF-II-derived miR-483-5p is implicated in the development of cancers. Here, we investigated the involvement of miR-483-5p in P3 mRNA overexpression regulation and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma. Our results showed that miR-483-5p up-regulated P3 mRNA transcription by targeting the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of P3 mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanism was involved in recruiting of an argonaute 1(Ago1)-argonaute 2 (Ago2) complex to the P3 mRNA 5'UTR and the P3 promoter of IGF-II gene by miR-483-5p, accompanied by increased enrichment of RNA polymerase II and activating histone marks histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), and histone 4 lysine 5/8/12/16 acetylation (H4Kac) at the P3 promoter. High miR-483-5p expression was an independent predictor for shorter survival of HCC patients. The findings suggest that miR-483-5p promotes P3 mRNA transcription by recruiting the Ago1-Ago2 complex to the P3 mRNA 5'UTR and is associated with poor prognosis of HCC. Our results display a potential new model for miRNAs to up-regulate gene expression.
