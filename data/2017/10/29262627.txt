Primary liver cancers represent the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Diverse etiological factors include chronic viral hepatitis, aflatoxin and alcohol exposure as well as aberrant liver lipid overload. Cholesterol has been identified as a key inducer of metabolic impairment, oxidative stress and promoter of cellular dysfunction. The aim of this work was to address the oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage induced by cholesterol overload, and its role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. C57BL/6 male mice were fed with a high cholesterol diet, followed by a single dose of N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 10 Î¼g/g, ip). Reactive oxygen species generation, DNA oxidation, antioxidant and DNA repair proteins were analyzed at different time points. Diet-induced cholesterol overload caused enhanced oxidative DNA damage in the liver and was associated with a decrease in key DNA repair genes as early as 7 days. Interestingly, we found a cell survival response, induced by cholesterol, judged by a decrement in Bax to Bcl2 ratio. Importantly, N-acetyl-cysteine supplementation significantly prevented DNA oxidation damage. Furthermore, at 8 months after DEN administration, tumor growth was significantly enhanced in mice under cholesterol diet in comparison to control animals. Together, these results suggest that cholesterol overload exerts an oxidative stress-mediated effects and promotes the development of liver cancer.
