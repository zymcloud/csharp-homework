Methods:357 patients at a free STD clinic in Miami, FL were screened for HCV. Surveys were administered assessing risk factors for infectious disease transmission, and HCV and HIV screening history.Results:15.1% of participants had been screened for HCV before whereas 83.8% had been screened for HIV (n = 356). Of the patients previously screened for HCV (n = 54), 98.2% of these patients had previously been screened for HIV as well.Conclusion:This data shows the low prevalence of prior HCV screenings in a high-risk population in Miami, FL. Participants who had previously received an HIV screening test were more likely to report receiving a prior HCV screening. Despite the high prevalence of HCV, most HCV infections are undiagnosed. Mortality from HIV has been declining in the United States while mortality from HCV is increasing. To decrease HCV related mortality, we recommend offering HCV screening in conjunction with HIV screening.
