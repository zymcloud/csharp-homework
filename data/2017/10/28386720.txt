Objectives:To compare treatment outcomes of subcentimeter hypervascular nodules at high risk for developing into hepatocellular carcinomas (SHNHR) between early treatment and watchful waiting until progression to overt hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) groups.Methods:SHNHRs were defined as subcentimeter hypervascular nodules with the usual imaging features of HCC on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Among 63 patients with 74 SHNHRs, 27 (37 SHNHRs) received early treatment (treatment of Results:Among the 36 patients who adopted watchful waiting, 33 eventually underwent treatment because their SHNHRs progressed to overt HCC. For recurrence-free survival, significant risk factors included number of previous treatments (HR, 1.181; p Conclusion:Recurrence-free survival was not significantly different between early treatment and watchful waiting for SHNHRs.Key points:• Recurrence-free survival did not vary between the two treatment strategies. • Treatment modality was a significant factor for local recurrence-free survival. • Number of treatments, tumour number, and α-FP were risk factors for recurrence.
