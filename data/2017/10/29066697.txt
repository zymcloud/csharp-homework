A 72-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to an abdominal mass. Ultrasound sonography and computed tomography revealed liver tumors in liver segments 2 and 3. The preoperative diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient underwent an extended left lobectomy. Histological examination of resected specimens revealed that the tumors were hepatic leiomyosarcoma. We report our experience of this hepatic leiomyosarcoma, along with the literature on this tumor type.
