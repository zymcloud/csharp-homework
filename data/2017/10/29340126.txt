Peripheral T cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of post-thymic, mature lymphoid malignancies, accounting for approximately 10-15% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSGDTCL) is a rare entity, which is characterized by primary extra nodal disease with typical sinusoidal or sinusal infiltration of the liver and the spleen, respectively by expression of the T-cell receptor γδ chain, and by a number of other frequent clinicopathologic features, including aggressive course of disease. Secondary involvement of liver by hematopoietic malignancies is much more common as compared to primary liver involvement. Primary involvement of liver by non- Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is documented and mostly DLBCL (diffuse large B cell lymphoma) type. But, T cell lymphoma primarily arising from liver is very rare. It occurred commonly in immunocompromised patients and prognosis is very poor. Here, we present two case reports of Hepatosplenic gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (HSGDTCL) and both are immunocompetent patients. Liver biopsy from the mass and subsequent IHC (immunohistochemistry) were performed for the purpose of diagnosis, which were positive for LCA (leukocyte common antigen), CD2 and negative for CD5, CD20 and CD79a. First patient was a 63-year-old female with hepatitis C virus seropositivity presented with liver mass simulating hepatocellular carcinoma. Second patient was a 60-year- old male, chronic alcoholic patient, presented with liver mass and lytic bony lesion in pelvis. Both patients were managed with conventional CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) and showed complete response after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. After completion of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, both patients remained under 6-month surveillance period for any recurrence of the disease.
