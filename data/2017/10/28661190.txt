Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of death globally and is frequently seen following Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus infection. Areas with high HBV infection rates, such as Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, are therefore also high-risk areas for HCC. Areas covered: This review identifies and discusses the current evidence from robust clinical trials which have investigated the benefits of Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) antiviral therapy in HBV-related HCC patients, including HCC patients that underwent liver transplantation and HCC patients with or without curative treatment. In addition, we assess how this evidence has influenced current clinical practice, with a particular focus on those areas of high HBV infection rates. Expert commentary: A number of studies have assessed whether NA antiviral treatment can improve the prognosis of HBV-related HCC patients. In this review we evaluate the current evidence, including that from trials in Asia, for antiviral NA treatments in HBV-related HCC patients. We also focus on those NAs with a high genetic barrier to resistance (i.e. ETV or TDF), on different therapeutic approaches, and on the future evidence that is required in this field.
