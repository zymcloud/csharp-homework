Innate immunity consists of several kinds of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which participate in the recognition of pathogens and consequently activation of innate immune system against pathogens. Recently, several investigations reported that PRRs may also play key roles in the induction/stimulation of immune system related complications in microbial infections. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), as the main cause of viral hepatitis in human, can induce several clinical forms of hepatitis B and also might be associated with hepatic complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on the important roles of PRRs in the eradication of microbial infections including viral infections and their related complications, it appears that the molecules may be a main part of immune responses against viral infections including HBV and participate in the HBV related complications. Thus, this review article has brought together information regarding the roles of PRRs in immunity against HBV and its complications.
