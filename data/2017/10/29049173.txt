This study aimed to explore the genetic association of polymorphisms in caveolin-1 gene (CAV1) with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-related HCC) susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.The genotyping of polymorphism was conducted using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Whether the genotype distribution of polymorphisms in the healthy controls was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was detected. The genotype and allele frequency difference between the 2 groups was compared by chi-square test. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to show the relative risk of HCC which resulted from genetic variants in CAV1. Moreover, the linkage disequilibrium of CAV1 polymorphisms was analyzed by Haploview.The AG genotype and A allele of rs1049334 showed significantly higher frequency in HCC patients than that of chronic HBV patients and the healthy controls (P
