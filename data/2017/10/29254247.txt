It is unclear whether targeted agents can produce survival advantage in patients with advanced HCC previously treated with sorafenib. We performed this meta-analysis of randomized trials and reviewed clinical outcomes of molecular targeted agents in the second-line treatment for advanced HCC. A systematic computerized search of the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library (up to May 2017) was carried out. From six studies, 2,388 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Almost all patients were treated with sorafenib as first-line therapy. Compared with placebo, targeted agents significantly improved time-to-progression (hazard ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.78, P < 0.0001). In terms of overall survival, targeted therapy tended to improve prognosis (hazard ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.74-1.01, P = 0.06). In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates that molecular targeted agents have a potential to improve prognosis after failure of first-line treatment with sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC.
