Background:To investigate the predictable value of postprognostic nutritional index (PNI) for patients who are suffering hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within Milan criteria and hypersplenism with well-preserved liver function after curative resection.Methods:Patients were divided into two groups: group A (postoperative PNI Results:The 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-year OS of patients in group A were 93.3, 74.2, 53.6, 39.6, and 33.0%, respectively, and 98.9, 89.5, 79.7, 63.9, and 63.9%, respectively, for patients in group B (P = 0.001). The corresponding 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-year DFS was 74.1, 51.1, 41.5, 30.1, 24.0, and 83.8, 64.6, 79.7, 54.0, and 49.9% for patients in the two groups, respectively (P = 0.009). Multivariable analysis revealed postoperative PNI as independent predictors of OS (P = 0.004) and DFS (P = 0.007) in patients with HCC within Milan criteria and hypersplenism after liver resection.Conclusions:Postoperative PNI, not preoperative PNI, could predict survival of patients with HCC within Milan criteria and hypersplenism after surgical resection.
