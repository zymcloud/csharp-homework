Background:Chemosaturation with percutaneous hepatic perfusion (CS-PHP; hepatic CHEMOSATÂ® delivery system; Delcath Systems Inc, USA) is a novel medical device, which delivers high doses of melphalan directly to the liver in patients with primary and secondary liver tumors while limiting systemic toxicity through hemofiltration of the hepatic venous blood. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and efficacy of the second-generation CS-PHP after 54 treatments at Hannover Medical School, Germany.Methods:Overall response rates (ORR) were assessed according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST1.1). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and hepatic PFS (hPFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier estimation.Results:29 patients were treated with CS-PHP as last-line therapy up to five sessions. 19 patients had unresectable hepatic metastases from solid tumors [ocular melanoma (OM) n = 11; colorectal carcinoma n = 2; pancreatic adenocarcinoma n = 2; periampular carcinoma n = 2; breast and endometrial cancer each n = 1] and 10 patients were diagnosed with hepatocellular or cholangiocarcinoma (HCC/CCA). ORR was 19.2%. Patients with OM had the highest ORR (33.3%). Similar to patients with OM, patients with hepatobiliary tumors had durable disease stabilization (40%). Median OS, PFS, and hPFS were 261, 117, and 135 days, respectively. Tumor volume negatively correlated with OS. Complications and toxicities included thrombocytopenia, cardiovascular events, ulcerous bleeding, and edema.Conclusion:Second-generation CS-PHP seems to be effective and tolerable. Patient selection based on tumor volume and entity is of importance. Particularly, patients with OM and hepatobiliary tumors represent promising candidates for CS-PHP.
