Background:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and Des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) have been extensively studied as biomarkers for the diagnosis of and prognostication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However there are only few reports on the clinical characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma in relation to the combination of the two tumor markers in hepatitis B virus-related HCC.Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of HBV-related HCC in relation to different sets of AFP and DCP values.Methods:Sixty-two patients with untreated HCC were studied. The positive value of AFP was set at 20 1U/L while DCP positive value was set at 150 mAU/ml. Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1(n=36) with AFP ≥ 20 IU/L and DCP ≥ 150 mAU/ml. Group 2(n=24) with AFP Results:Clinical and laboratory variables were comparable among the groups with the exception of gender and values of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Males were significantly more than females among the groups (pConclusion:HCC patients who are sero-positive for DCP and sero-negative for AFP have significantly higher levels of serum ALT; serum ALT levels may be of diagnostic importance in AFP-negative, HBV-related HCC patients.
