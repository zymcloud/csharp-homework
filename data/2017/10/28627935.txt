Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease which is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in most cases. As there is currently no medical therapy which alters the natural history of PSC, liver transplantation may be required. Areas covered: We searched for articles in PubMed and critically reviewed current literature on the interrelationship between PSC and IBD with a specific focus on considerations for patients in the liver transplant setting. Expert commentary: PSC is an uncommon disease which limits available studies to be either retrospective or contain relatively small numbers of patients. Based on observations from these studies, the behavior and complications of PSC and IBD impact on each other both before and after a liver transplant. Both these autoimmune conditions and their associated cancer risk also influence patient selection for transplantation and may be impacted by immunosuppression use post-transplant. Hence, a complex interplay exists between PSC, IBD and liver transplantation which requires clarification with ongoing research.
