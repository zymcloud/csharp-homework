Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with isolated right atrial metastasis is extremely rare; most cases are considered inoperable. We herein report the case of a 74-year-old man with HCC with isolated right atrial metastases without hepatic vein invasion; the right atrial lesion was resected because of the risk of heart failure and sudden death. Postoperatively, he underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation for intrahepatic HCC. He recovered completely, with a long-term survival of 36 months. This is the first report of an HCC patient with isolated right atrial metastases without hepatic vein invasion. Tumorectomy for solitary atrial metastasis is effective for HCC patients.
