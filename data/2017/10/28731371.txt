Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a worldwide health problem and has been for long an attractive point of research due to diversity among different genotypes regarding unique geographical distribution and diverse treatment outcome. HCV is considered a major cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, which leads to liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma requiring liver transplantation. Of the HCV genotypes identified, HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4) is the least studied. HCV-4 is responsible for âˆ¼10% of HCV infections and is common in the Middle East and Africa; recently it is increasingly prevalent in European Countries. HCV-4 is a continuing epidemic in Egypt, having the highest prevalence of HCV worldwide. "Know your epidemic, know your response" concept necessitates better understanding of HCV-4 characteristics to control disease dissemination and progression, which compromises the life quality of chronic HCV-infected patients. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment options for patients with HCV-4 infection.
