Objective:The optimal treatment strategy for patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study was designed to investigate the outcomes of salvage liver transplantation (SLT) and re-resection (RR)/radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with respect to the time to recurrence after initial curative resection.Methods:Between 2007 and 2016, 756 patients underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC in accordance with the Milan criteria. Among them, 152 experienced an intrahepatic recurrence and underwent SLT (n = 36) and RR/RFA (n = 116). Clinical data, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) (including subgroup analyses) according to the time to recurrence were statistically compared between the 2 groups, and prognostic factors were identified.Results:The DFS of the patients who underwent SLT was much better than that of the patients who underwent RR/RFA (P = 0.002), particularly those with late recurrence (more than 12 months, P = 0.004). The time to recurrence from initial hepatectomy was found to be an independent predictor of OS and DFS.Conclusions:SLT, rather than re-resection or RFA, should be the preferred treatment option for patients with late recurrence.
