Purpose:It is unclear whether the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) and transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with 90Y are comparable in patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods and materials:In total, 209 treatment-naive patients with stage B or C cancer according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification who were treated with TARE or CCRT were analyzed. Propensity scores were calculated and matched at a 1:1 ratio for TARE versus CCRT using age, tumor size, tumor number, portal vein thrombosis, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging. In the CCRT group, concurrent hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil was delivered at a dosage of 500 mg/d during the first and last 5 days of radiation therapy (median, 45 Gy). Overall survival, freedom from progression, tumor response, and complication rate were compared between the TARE and CCRT groups.Results:Among 209 patients, 124 (62 undergoing TARE and 62 undergoing CCRT) were selected after propensity score matching. Overall survival (TARE vs CCRT, 14.0 months vs 13.2 months, P=.435) and freedom from progression (6.9 months vs 7.8 months, P=.437) were comparable between the 2 groups. Objective response rates at 1 month after treatment were higher for CCRT than for TARE (46.8% vs 16.1%, PConclusions:Both treatments yielded comparable survival rates and long-term response rates in patients with intermediate- or advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. The role of these modalities as a bridge to curative therapy requires further investigation.
