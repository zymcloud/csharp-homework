Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. In most cases, HCV infection becomes chronic, leading to the development of liver diseases that range from fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to its medical importance, the HCV life cycle has been deeply characterized, and a unique feature of this virus is its interplay with lipids. Accordingly, all the steps of the virus life cycle are influenced by the host lipid metabolism. Indeed, due to their association with host lipoproteins, HCV particles have a unique lipid composition. Furthermore, the biogenesis pathway of very low density lipoproteins has been shown to be involved in HCV morphogenesis with apolipoprotein E being an essential element for the production of infectious HCV particles. Association of viral components with host cytoplasmic lipid droplets is also central to the HCV morphogenesis process. Finally, due to its close connection with host lipoproteins, HCV particle also uses several lipoprotein receptors to initiate its infectious cycle. In this review, we outline the way host lipoproteins participate to HCV particle composition, entry and assembly.
