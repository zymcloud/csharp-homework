Aims:To evaluate the diagnostic performance of CT, MRI and CEUS alone and in combination, for the diagnosis of HCC between 10 and 30 mm, in a large population of cirrhotic patients.Patients and methods:In a multicentre prospective trial, 442 patients have been enrolled. Within a month, CEUS, CT and MRI were performed for all patients. A composite algorithm was defined to obtain the more accurate gold standard.Results:A total of 544 nodules in 381 patients have been retained for the performance analysis. Eighty-two percent of the patients were male, mean age was 62 years. For the 10-20 mm nodules (n=342), the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) for the diagnosis of HCC were, respectively, 70.6% and 83.2% for MRI, 67.9% and 76.8% for CT and 39.6% and 92.9% for CEUS. For the 20-30 mm nodules (n=202), the Se and Sp were, respectively, 72.3% and 89.4% for MRI, 71.6% and 93.6% for CT and 52.9% and 91.5% for CEUS. THE BEST COMBINATION FOR THE 10-20 MM NODULES WAS MRI + CT (SE: 55.1%, SP: 100.0%).: After a first inconclusive technique, CEUS as second image technique allowed the highest specificity with only a slight drop of sensitivity for 10-20 mm nodules and the highest sensitivity and specificity for 20-30 mm nodules.Conclusion:This large multicentre study validates the EASL/AASLD recommendations in daily practice. Specificity using CT or MRI in 10-20 mm HCC was low, but we do not recommend combined imaging at first as sensitivity would be very low. The best sequential approach combined MRI and CEUS.
