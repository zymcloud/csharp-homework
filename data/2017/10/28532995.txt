Background & aims:Our increasing understanding of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biology holds promise for personalized care, however its translation into clinical practice requires a precise knowledge of its relationship to tumour phenotype.Methods:We aimed at investigating molecular-phenotypic correlations in a large series of HCC. To this purpose, 343 surgically resected HCC samples were investigated by pathological review, immunohistochemistry, gene expression profiling and sequencing.Results:CTNNB1 (40%) and TP53 (21%) mutations were mutually exclusive and defined two major groups of HCC characterized by distinct phenotypes. CTNNB1 mutated tumours were large (p=0.002), well-differentiated (pConclusion:HCC phenotypes are tightly associated with gene mutations and transcriptomic classification. These findings may help in translating our knowledge of HCC biology into clinical practice. Lay summary: HCC is a very heterogenous tumour, both at the pathological and molecular levels. We show here that HCC phenotype is tightly associated to its molecular alterations and underlying oncogenic pathways.
