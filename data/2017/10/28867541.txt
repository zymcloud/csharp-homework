Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) has been implicated in human cancers, but its role and clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. Here, we show that HMGCS2 is downregulated and exhibits antimetastatic potential in HCC. Low expression of HMGCS2 was associated with poor tumor differentiation, vascular invasion and worse overall and disease-free survivals in two independent cohorts consisting of 743 cases. In vitro data demonstrated HMGCS2 overexpression suppressed, whereas HMGCS2 silence promoted HCC cell migration via Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process and the activation of ERK/c-Jun signaling pathway. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PD098059 markedly attenuated the malignant phenotypes mediated by HMGCS2 siRNA. Furthermore, miR-107 was identified as an upstream regulator of HMGCS2 via directly targeting the 3'-UTR of HMGCS2 mRNA. Collectively, our findings suggest HMGCS2 serve as a promising prognostic biomarker and exert anti-tumor activity towards HCC, and therefore provide a potential target for HCC clinical intervention.
