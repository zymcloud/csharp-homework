Metastasis associated 1 protein (MTA1) is one of the prime facilitators of metastatic progression in all solid tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of MTA1 expression in HCC is not clear. In this study, we evaluated MTA1 transcript and protein expression in HCC and normal hepatic cell lines. The results revealed that MTA1 protein expression had a significantly increase in HCC cell line, HuH6, compared with that in normal hepatic cell line, THLE-2. Determination of protein half-life using cycloheximide (CHX) treatment did not reveal any statistically significant difference in protein turn-over rates between THLE-2 (3.3 ± 0.25 h) and HuH6 (3.6 ± 0.15 h) cell lines. MTA1 protein level was stabilized in THLE-2 cells after treatment with MG-132 to levels similar to those observed in HuH6 cells. Mass spectrometric analysis of FLAG immunoprecipitates of FLAG-MTA1 transfected THLE-2 cells after MG-132 treated revealed candidate ubiquitin ligases that were interacting with MTA1. RNAi-mediated silencing of each prospective ubiquitin ligase in THLE-2 cells indicated that knockdown of TRIM25 resulted in stabilization of MTA1 protein, indicating TRIM25 as a putative E3 ligase for MTA1. Coimmunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged MTA1, but not IgG, in MG-132 treated and untreated THLE-2 cells cotransfected with either FLAG-MTA1 or Myc-TRIM25 revealed robust polyubiquitinated MTA1, confirming that the TRIM25 is the ubiquitin ligase for MTA1 degradation. Overexpression of TRIM25 in HuH6 and RNAi mediated silencing of TRIM25 in THLE-2 cells inhibited and increased the cell migration and invasion, respectively. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data for assessment of TRIM25 transcript level and MTA1 protein expression in 25 HCC patients confirmed an inverse correlation between the expression of TRIM25 and MTA1. Cumulatively, our data reveal a novel mechanism of post-translational to regulate MTA1 expression in normal hepatic cells, which is repressed in HCC. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(10):795-801, 2017.
