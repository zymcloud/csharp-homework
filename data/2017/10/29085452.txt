Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. Despite progress in the diagnosis and treatment of HCC, prognosis remains unfavorable. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important factors in tumorigenesis and cancer progression; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of lncRNAs in HCC remain largely unknown. The present study examined the expression pattern and clinical significance of a novel lncRNA, LOC728290, in HCC. Expression of LOC728290 was markedly decreased in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, as detected using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for LOC728290 was 0.728. The expression of LOC728290 was associated with the level of Î±-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion. Furthermore, patients with low LOC728290 expression exhibited decreased recurrence-free survival times (P
