This is a systematic review and meta-analysis on the surgical treatments of splenic flexure carcinomas (SFCs). Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus were searched from January 1990 to May 2016. Studies of at least 5 patients comparing extended right colectomy (ERC) versus left colectomy (LC) and/or laparoscopy versus open surgery for SFCs were retrieved and analyzed. Overall, 12 retrospective studies were selected, including 569 patients. ERC was performed in 23.2% of patients, whereas LC in 76.8%. Pooled data suggested that ERC and LC had similar oncologic quality of resection and postoperative outcomes. Laparoscopy was used in 50.6% of patients (conversion rate: 2.5%) and it was associated with significantly shorter time to oral diet, fewer postoperative complications, and shorter hospital stay than open surgery. In conclusion, the optimal extent of SFC surgical resection, that is, ERC or LC remains under debate. However, laparoscopy provides better postoperative outcomes and fewer postoperative complications than open surgery.
