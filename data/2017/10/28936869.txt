A novel catalyzed hairpin assembly-based turn-on ratiometric fluorescence biosensor was constructed for the determination of microRNA-122 (miRNA-122) by using 2-aminopurine (2-AP) and thioflavin T (ThT) as detection signal sources. Hairpin DNA sequence (H1) includes the complementary strands of miRNA-122 and G-quadruplex-forming sequence. When miRNA-122 was presented, hybridization occurred between miRNA-122 and part of H1, causing a double-stranded DNA and a G-quadruplex formed. The formed double-stranded DNA significantly decreased the fluorescence intensity of 2-AP. Furthermore, after binding with ThT, the formed G-quadruplex led to the fluorescent enhancement. The hairpin DNA sequence (H2) hybridized with the unfolded H1 and displaced miRNA-122. Finally, the displaced miRNA-122 again hybridized with the H1 and initiated cycle amplification. This sensor showed a linear ranges of 0.5-50 nM and the limit of detection for miRNA-122 assay was 72 pM (with the lowest measured concentration of 500 pM) for determination of miRNA-122 when no other miRNA was present. Measurements on cell lysates from 100, 1000, and 10 000 cells of three different cell lines provided increasing signal ratios, which showed the application potential of the sensor for miRNA determination in real samples.
