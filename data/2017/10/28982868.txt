Background/aim:Recently CD4+CD49b+ LAG3+regulatory T (Tr1) cells are reported to be IL-10 driven, have strong regulatory activities. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether Treg and Tr1 cells participate in immunological status against cancer.Patients and methods:Peripheral blood was withdrawn from patients (n=78), and healthy volunteers as controls (n=23). The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were subjected to FACScan analysis after labeling with anti-CD4, -CD25, - Foxp3, -CD49b and -LAG3 antibodies. Resected specimens were stained for IL-10. Patients' clinical course and clinicopathological factors were compared.Results:Tr1 was significantly higher in patients with cancer (p=0.02). Among patients who underwent R0 resection, those with early recurrence had a significantly higher pre-/post-operative Tr1 ratio (p<0.05). Median pre-/post-operative ratios of Foxp3Tregs and Tr1s predicted early recurrence with 85.6% sensitivity and 93.3% specificity. Disease-free survival was significantly lower in patients with high IL-10 expression in resected specimens.Conclusion:Peripheral Tregs and Tr1 indicate immunological state against cancer.
Foxp3 regulatory T cells; Type 1 regulatory T cells; biomarker; hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers; tumor immunity.
