Liver resection (LR) and liver transplantation (LT) are potential curative treatment methods for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it is controversial which treatment is more beneficial to patients with solitary HCC meeting the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) criteria (single lesion, diameterâ‰¤50mm, no vascular invasion, no extrahepatic metastasis). We retrieved patients with solitary HCC meeting UNOS criteria diagnosed between 2004-2013 from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the impact of surgery type (LR/LT) on overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in both the whole study group and subgroups. Our analyses show that LT Patients had significantly superior OS (Adjusted HR (95% CI): 0.39 [0.26-0.59]) and DSS (Adjusted HR (95% CI): 0.19 [0.10-0.35]) than those receiving LR, although compared with the 288 patients receiving LR, the 258 patients receiving LT had younger age, smaller tumor size, and higher fibrosis score (P<0.001). Subgroup analyses identified significant interactions between surgery type (LR/LT) and gender (Male/Female) in both OS (P=0.02) and DSS (P=0.02). Male patients benefit more from LT compared with LR in both OS (Adjusted HR (95% CI): 0.29 [0.18-0.47]) and DSS (Adjusted HR (95% CI): 0.10 [0.05-0.21]), but there is no difference between patients receiving LT and LR in female patients. In conclusion, LT is associated with superior survival than LR in patients with solitary HCC meeting UNOS criteria. Moreover, male patients benefits more from LT than LR, while female patients do not show different outcomes between the two procedures.
