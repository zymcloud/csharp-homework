Mycoplasma infection has been reported to be associated with cancer migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as the resistance to nucleoside analogues chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we found that the sensitivity of hepatocarcinoma cells to Cisplatin, Gemcitabine and Mitoxantrone was increased by mycoplasma elimination. Similar to the effect of anti-mycoplasma agent, interrupting the interaction between Mycoplasma hyorhinis membrane protein P37 and Annexin A2 of host cells using the N-terminal of ANXA2 polypeptide enhanced the sensitivity of HCC97L cells to Gemcitabine and Mitoxantrone. Meanwhile, we did not observe any changes in expression or distribution of multidrug resistance associated transporters, ATP-Binding Cassette protein B1, C1 and G2, on the removal of mycoplasma. These results suggest that mycoplasma induces a resistance to multiple drugs in hepatocarcinoma cells which required the interaction of P37 and Annexin A2. The pathway downstream this interaction needs to be explored.
