Thanks to the improvement in radiotherapy physics, biology, computing and imaging, patients presenting with liver tumors can be efficiently treated by radiation. Radiotherapy has been included in liver tumors treatment guidelines at all disease stages. Liver stereotactic radiotherapy has to be preferred to standard fractionated radiotherapy whenever possible, as potentially more efficient because of higher biological equivalent dose. Liver stereotactic radiotherapy planning and delivery require extensive experience and optimal treatment quality at every step, thus limiting its availability to specialized centres. Multicentre studies are difficult to develop due to a large technical heterogeneity. Respiratory management, image guidance and immobilization are considerations as important as machine type. The use of multimodal planning imaging is compulsory to achieve expected contouring quality. Treatment efficacy is difficult to assess following liver stereotactic radiotherapy, but local control is high and toxicity unusual. As a consequence, liver stereotactic radiotherapy is part of multimodal and multidisciplinary management of liver tumors.
