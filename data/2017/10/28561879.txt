Background:The use of des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) as a predictor of the risk of recurrence of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) after liver transplant (LT) has recently gained interest, especially in view of the recent extension of the eligibility criteria of these patients for LT. The aim of the present study is to look into this important matter based on a systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods:A systematic literature review about the role of DCP in the specific setting of LT for HCC has been conducted.Results:Three selected studies, which showed a high rate of homogeneity (I2 = 0.0%), confirmed that the tumor marker DCP is a useful predictive factor, indicating a 5-fold increased risk for HCC recurrence after LT (pConclusions:The meta-analysis enabled us to underline the importance of DCP in the refinement of the eligibility criteria of HCC patients for LT. This information, based on Japanese studies performed in the setting of living-donor LT only, needs further validation in the Western world both in the setting of post-mortem and living-donor LT.
