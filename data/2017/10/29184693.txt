Intra-arterial or percutaneous locoregional therapies (LRT) are often employed to maintain potential liver transplant (LT) recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within T2/Milan criteria. Predictors of survival when LRT is used as destination therapy in those who are either ineligible or unwilling for LT remain poorly defined. We evaluated predictors of 3-year survival with destination LRT in a population of cirrhotic patients diagnosed with HCC, presenting within T2 criteria, and either ineligible or unwilling for LT. The cohort surviving 3 years had a significantly lower model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score at HCC diagnosis (9.7 vs. 11.4, P=0.037) and MELD following initial locoregional therapy (10.7 vs. 13.3, P=0.008) compared to those not surviving three years despite similar demographic, tumor, and treatment variables. LRT as destination therapy results in modest intermediate term survival, with liver function at presentation and immediately following initiation of LRT predicting intermediate survival with this approach.
