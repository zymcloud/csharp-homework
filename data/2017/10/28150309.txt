Portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome characterized by the development of collateral circulation and portosystemic shunts, as well as ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. We present the case of a large portosystemic shunt between the hepatic portal vein and aneurysmal right renal vein in a cirrhotic 64-year-old man with thrombosis of the portal vein and hepatocellular carcinoma. This is a very rare clinical manifestation which, to our knowledge, has been described only once previously in the literature. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Ultrasound 45:524-527, 2017.
