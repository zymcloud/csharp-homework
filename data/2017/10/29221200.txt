The prognostic biomarkers and potential therapy targets are urgently needed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this article, we report the expression of TUBA1C was significantly increased in HCC on mRNA and protein level, and this finding was further validated in another two independent datasets. Survival analysis was also implemented on these three datasets, and TUBA1C high expression group was detected to have relative shorter survival time. Furthermore, the metastatic ability is increased along with TUBA1C abundance, according to protein abundance evaluation of normal-tumor-portal vein tumor thrombus pairs, and mRNA comparison between metastasis-averse HCC and metastasis-incline HCC. Correlation analysis was implemented and TUBA1C expression was shown to be significantly associated with recurrence, embolus, and AFP level. Proliferation and migration assays following knock down of TUBA1C in two cell lines, HCCLM3 and PLC, revealed that down-regulation of TUBA1C significantly reduces proliferation and migration in HCC cells. in vivo study also showed the similar results. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) comparing the TUBA1C-low and TUBA1C-high group indicates that KEGG pathways including "cell cycle", "DNA replication", and "proteasome" were significantly enriched in TUBA1C-high group. In conclusion, prognostic biomarker and oncogene TUBA1C promotes migration and proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, probability via cell cycle signaling pathway.
