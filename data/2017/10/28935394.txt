A 34-year old male with a giant condyloma acuminatum of the anus secondary to HIV infection presented to the emergency department with a persistent nose bleed lasting 2-3days, acute anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient also had significant hepatosplenomegaly and elevated liver enzymes which were a new finding since the patient's last hospitalization 1-2month prior to the current admission. A bone marrow biopsy showed diffuse infiltration by carcinoma with neuroendocrine features. The patient quickly developed multi-organ injury, decompensated, and died. An autopsy was obtained which established the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the liver.
