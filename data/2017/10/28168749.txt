Background and aim:Reduced expression in immortalized cells (REIC)/dickkopf-3 (Dkk-3) is a tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated in various cancers. In our previous study of prostate cancer, the REIC/Dkk-3-expressing adenoviral vector (Ad-REIC) was found to induce cancer-selective apoptosis. This study recently developed a novel super gene expression (SGE) system and used this system to re-construct an Ad-REIC vector, termed the Ad-SGE-REIC, to achieve more effective therapeutic outcomes. In this study, the therapeutic effects of Ad-SGE-REIC on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was assessed.Methods:Human HCC cell lines (HLE, Huh7, HepG2, HLF, SK-Hep1, and PLC), human HCC tissues, and mouse HCC cell line (Hepa1-6) were used in this study. REIC/Dkk-3 expression was assessed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The relative cell viability and the apoptotic effect were examined in vitro, and the anti-tumor effects of Ad-SGE-REIC treatment were analyzed in the mouse xenograft model. This study additionally assessed anti-tumor immunological effects on the immunocompetent mice.Results:REIC/Dkk-3 expression was decreased in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues. Ad-SGE-REIC reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines (HLE and Huh7), inhibited tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model, and demonstrated in vivo anti-cancer immunostimulatory effects on the HCC cell line (Hepa1-6).Conclusions:Ad-SGE-REIC treatment not only enhanced cell killing effects in vitro but also elicited significant therapeutic effects, with tumor growth suppression, in vivo. REIC/Dkk-3 gene therapy using Ad-SGE-REIC potentially represents an innovative new therapeutic tool for HCC.
