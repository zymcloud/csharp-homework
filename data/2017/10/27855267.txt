Background:Caudate lobe is located in the deep dorsal area of the liver between the portal triad and the inferior vena cava (IVC). Torrential bleeding can occur from the IVC and short hepatic veins during dissection. Isolated total caudate lobe resection is still rare and technically demanding. We herein present a video on the technical aspect of laparoscopic total caudate lobectomy.Method:A 61-year-old woman was admitted for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma detected on imaging. She had history of multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma in July 2015 and underwent open cholecystectomy, segment 6 and segment 8 tumorectomy. Ten months later, the computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 1 cm arterial enhancing lesion in segment I (S1) with no other foci of recurrence. Laparoscopic total caudate lobectomy was contemplated.Results:The operative time was 270 minutes. The intraoperative blood loss was 200 mL and blood transfusion was not necessary. The patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day without any complications.Conclusion:This report showed the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic total caudate lobectomy. Nonetheless, it is a technically demanding procedure. It should be performed in carefully selected patients and by experienced hepatobiliary surgeons proficient in laparoscopic liver resection.
