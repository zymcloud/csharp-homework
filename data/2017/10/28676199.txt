Introduction:The appropriate selection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who are eligible for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains a challenge. The ART score has recently been proposed as a method of identifying patients who are eligible or not for a second TACE procedure.Objective:To assess the validity of the Assessment for Retreatment with TACE (ART) score in a cohort of patients treated with drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE).Secondary objective:to identify clinical determinants associated with overall survival (OS).Method:A retrospective, multicentre study conducted in Spain in patients with HCC having undergone two or more DEB-TACE procedures between January 2009 and December 2014. The clinical characteristics and OS from the day before the second DEB-TACE of patients with a high ART score (ART≥2.5) and a low ART score (ART 0-1) were compared. Risk factors for mortality were identified using Cox's proportional hazards model.Results:Of the 102 patients included, 51 scored 0-1.5 and 51 scored ≥2.5. Hepatitis C was more frequent in patients scoring ≥2.5. Median OS from the day before the second DEB-TACE was 21 months (95% CI, 15-28) in the group scoring 0-1.5, and 17 months (95% CI, 10-25) in the group scoring ≥2.5 (P=0.3562). Platelet count and tumour size, but not the ART score, were independent baseline predictors of OS.Conclusions:The ART score is not suitable for guiding DEB-TACE retreatment according to Spanish clinical practice standards.
