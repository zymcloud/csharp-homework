Epigenetic modifications are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are considered potential therapeutic agents. Histone tails undergo acetylation at lysine residues, which is associated with transcriptional activation. However, previous studies indicated that as histone deacetylase inhibitors, both (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and valproic acid presented the effects of downregulation of amyloid precursor protein expression, which resulted in the induction of apoptosis. The downregulation of amyloid precursor protein, instead of conventionally activating gene expression as histone deacetylase inhibitor, was attractive. However, there was no relevant report on the correlation of the expression of amyloid precursor protein and histone deacetylase 1 in cancer. In the present study, we detected the expression of amyloid precursor protein and histone deacetylase 1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent tissues, as well as the correlations among histone deacetylase 1, amyloid precursor protein, and tumor stage. The results showed that the expressions of amyloid precursor protein and histone deacetylase 1 were significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues than that in adjacent tissues ( P
