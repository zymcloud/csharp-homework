There are many shortcomings of current animal models as surrogates of hepatocellular carcinoma that handicap preclinical testing of embolization agents. The present study explores the feasibility of using the woodchuck (Marmota monax) as an animal model for the testing of novel embolization agents. Four woodchucks underwent magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and left lobar hepatic artery particle embolization. Percutaneous access, arteriography, and lobar embolization were successful in all animals, with angiographic stasis obtained in the target vessel with minimal reflux of embolic material. These results support the feasibility of the woodchuck as an animal model for preclinical testing of embolization agents.
