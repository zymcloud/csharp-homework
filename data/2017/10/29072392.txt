Aim: The present study was performed to determine any associations of genetic polymorphisms of Fas/FasL promoter regions, at Fas670 and Fas1377 and FasL844, with hepatitis C cirrhosis and HCC, with a focus on severity of disease. Methods: Totals of 120 patients with cirrhosis and 101 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were enrolled. All had chronic HCV infection as indicated by positive anti-HCV antibodies and positive HCV RNA on real time PCR. One hundred healthy control subjects were also included in the study. Patients were subjected to full clinical, radiological and histopathological examinations. In addition to routine laboratory tests for liver function tests, Fas670 and Fas1377 and FasL844 genetic polymorphisms of Fas/FasL promoter regions were assessed by RFLP-PCR (restriction fragment length polymorphism with polymerase chain reaction). Results: Significant higher levels of the AG genotype in Fas670 and Fas1773 were observed in patients with cirrhosis and HCC (P=0.0001) as compared to control subjects. In addition, the CC genotype in FASL844 was also more common in patients (P=0.01). Furtehrmore, there was a significant association of substitution of A by G alleles in Fas670 and Fas1773 with advanced BCA staging (P=0.02, P=0.0001 respectively) and larger tumor size >5cm (P=0.01, P=0.0001 respectively) and in Fas670 with advanced pathological grading (P=0.0001). Moreover the CC genotype of FASL844 was significantly linked with advanced BCA, large tumor size >5cm and advanced pathological grading (P=0.0001). Conclusion: The findings of the present study highlight associations of genetic polymorphisms of promoter regions in Fas and Fas L with cirrhosis and HCC associated with chronic HCV. Support was also obtained for the conclusion that single nucleotide polymorphisms of the Fas/ FasL system impact on clinical and histopathological grading of HCCs. Further large scale studies are recommended for confirmation.
