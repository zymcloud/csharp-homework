In recent years it was found that the synthesis and biological activity of ribosomes are closely associated with tumor cell growth, tumorigenesis, and malignant transformation. However, the role of regulator of ribosome synthesis 1 (RRS1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been reported. In the present study, we aimed to examine the potential role of RRS1 in tumor cell growth by using a lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) system in the HCC cell line SMMC-7721 in vitro. Compared with that of the negative control group (Lv-shCon), the mRNA and protein expression levels of RRS1 in SMMC-7721 cells transfected with Lv-shRRS1 were significantly decreased. Further experiments found that silencing of RRS1 gene expression in SMMC-7721 cells significantly suppressed cell proliferation, inhibited colony formation capacity, increased apoptosis and arrested cells in the G1 phase. These results suggest that the RRS1 gene plays a critical role in cell proliferation, colony formation, cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in human HCC cells, and that silencing of RRS1 by RNAi is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC, and should be further developed.
