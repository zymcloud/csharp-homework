Objective: To investigate the clinical effect of ultraselective transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) originating from the caudate lobe. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for 13 patients with solitary HCC originating from the caudate lobe who were admitted to Department of Interventional Radiology in PLA General Hospital from March 2013 to December 2016. A 2.6-F microcatheter was used to perform ultraselective TACE, and the embolization material was ultra-liquefied iodinated oil. The number of tumor-feeding arteries, success rate and short-term efficacy of ultraselective technique, and long-term survival were evaluated after surgery. Results: Of all patients, 8 (61.5%) had a single tumor-feeding artery and 5 (38.5%) had multiple tumor-feeding arteries. The success rate of ultraselective technique was 84.6% (11/13). The complete remission rate at 1 month after ultraselective TACE was 63.6% (7/11). During the follow-up period after the expiration date, 10 out of 11 patients who underwent successful ultraselective TACE survived, and one out of two patients who underwent failed ultraselective TACE survived. Conclusion: Ultraselective TACE has good feasibility, clinical effect, and safety in the treatment of HCC originating from the caudate lobe, with an important clinical significance in the prognosis of such disease.
