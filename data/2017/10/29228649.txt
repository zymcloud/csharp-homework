Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels elevated in benign liver diseases (BLD) represent a challenge in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis. The present study aimed to develop a simple method to identify HCC in AFP-elevated liver diseases based on combining serum fluorescence and general clinical data. Serum specimens and clinical data were collected from 201 HCC and 117 BLD (41 liver cirrhosis, 76 chronic hepatitis) patients with abnormal serum AFP levels. Dual serum fluorescence (autofluorescence and cell-free DNA-related fluorescence) intensities were sequentially measured and expressed as 6 fluorescence indicators. The diagnostic value of these fluorescence and clinical data were evaluated alone and in combination by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). All fluorescence indicators significantly differed between HCC and BLD and some of them were more valuable for diagnosing HCC than AFP (AUROC 0.782-0.801 vs. 0.752). The diagnostic model established with fluorescence indicators, AFP, hepatic function tests and age showed that AUROC, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.958 (95% CI 0.936-0.979), 92.0%, 88.9% and 92.3%, respectively, and positive rates in AFP-negative, early and small HCCs were 73.8%, 81.6% and 74.3%, respectively. In conclusion, the combination of dual serum fluorescence, AFP, hepatic function tests and age is simple and valuable for identifying HCC in serum AFP-elevated liver diseases.
