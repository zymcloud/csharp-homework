Background:The aim of this study is to investigate the association C-reactive protein to albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio, a novel inflammation based prognostic score, and long-term outcomes among patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) after hepatic resection.Methods:We retrospectively investigated 106 patients who underwent hepatic resection for CRLM and explored the relationship between CRP/Alb ratio and long-term outcomes.Results:In multivariate analysis, more than 4 lymph node metastases (p = 0.003), presence of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.008) and CRP/Alb ratio ≥ 0.04 (p = 0.021) were independent and significant predictors of cancer recurrence, while more than 4 lymph node metastases (p = 0.001), presence of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (p < 0.001), and CRP/Alb ratio ≥ 0.04 (p = 0.002) were independent and significant predictors of poor overall survival.Conclusions:The CRP/Alb ratio seems to be a predictor of poor long-term outcomes in patients with CRLM after hepatic resection.
