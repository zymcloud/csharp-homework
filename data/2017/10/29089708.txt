Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver, and extrahepatic metastases are typically found during disease progression. The incidence of adrenal metastasis (AM) from HCC in autopsy series ranges from 4.6 to 12.5%, and it is the second most common site of metastasis after the lungs. To date, there have been few reports of patients who underwent adrenalectomy for isolated AM from HCC after liver transplantation (LT). A woman aged 55 years was referred to our clinic for the evaluation of a right adrenal mass that was detected by abdominal ultrasonography at another center. She had undergone liver transplantation secondary to HCC and acute liver failure due to cryptogenic liver cirrhosis 138 months previously. She had been followed up for 5 years following LT after which she declined to continue with further follow-up. After radiologic and biochemical evaluation, she underwent adrenalectomy and the histopathologic examination revealed a 10 × 8 × 7-cm adrenal mass, which was considered to be an isolated AM from HCC. To our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated AM from HCC in the literature that was diagnosed 138 months after liver transplantation. Isolated AM from HCC after LT is rare and might be detected a long time after LT. Curative surgical resection of isolated metachronous AM from HCC in the absence of disseminated disease might provide for an acceptable disease-free period after adrenalectomy.
