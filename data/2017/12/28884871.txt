Objectives:Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of non-protein-coding RNAs that are greater than 200 nucleotides in length. Increasing evidence indicates that lncRNAs, which may serve as either oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes, play a vital role in the pathophysiology of human diseases, especially in tumourigenesis and progression. Deregulation of lncRNAs impacts different cellular processes, such as proliferation, dedifferentiation, migration, invasion and anti-apoptosis. The aim of this review was to explore the molecular mechanism and clinical significance of long non-coding RNA-activated by transforming growth factor Î² (lncRNA-ATB) in various types of cancers.Materials and methods:In this review, we summarize and analyze current studies concerning the biological functions and mechanisms of lncRNA-ATB in tumour development. The related studies were obtained through a systematic search of Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library.Results:Long non-coding RNAs-ATB is a novel cancer-related lncRNA that was recently found to exhibit aberrant expression in a variety of malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and lung cancer. Dysregulation of lncRNA-ATB has been shown to contribute to proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells. Long non-coding RNAs-ATB promotes tumourigenesis and progression mainly through competitively binding miRNAs to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Conclusions:Long non-coding RNAs-ATB likely represents a feasible cancer biomarker or therapeutic target.
