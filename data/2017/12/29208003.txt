Background:Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) expression is associated with various types of tumors; however, the function and underlying mechanism of FOXA1 in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains obscure.Methods:Here, we investigated the role of FOXA1 in the development of HCC by applying gene function gain and loss analysis to HepG2 and Hep3B cell lines, and comparing outcomes with those of clinical HCC samples.Results:Phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), which encodes protein PI3Kp85 (p85), was identified as a FOXA1 target gene. Analyses of the mechanism and function revealed that FOXA1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma cell viability and motility by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling through direct inhibition of PIK3R1 transcription. Moreover, in clinical samples from male HCC patients, FOXA1 expression was much lower, whereas PI3Kp85 levels were much higher in tumor than in non-tumor tissues. Elevated PI3Kp85 is an unfavorable factor in HCC.Conclusions:As a tumor suppressor, FOXA1 targets PIK3R1 directly to inhibit PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thus exerting a negative regulatory effect on proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC in male patients.
