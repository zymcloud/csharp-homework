Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most common types of malignancy with high mortality and morbidity rates. Previous studies have suggested that microRNAs (miRs) serve pivotal functions in various types of tumor. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between miR-34a expression and HCC cell migration and invasion, and the potential underlying mechanisms. The miR-34a overexpression vector or scramble control was transfected into human Hep3B and Huh7 cell lines. Transwell assays, and Matrigel and wound healing assays were used to detect the effects of miR-34a expression on HCC cell invasion and migration, respectively. The expression of miR-34a and the mRNA expression of other associated proteins were detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and protein levels were measured using western blot analysis. Compared with the control, miR-34a expression was significantly downregulated in Hep3B and Huh7 cells, but this was reversed by the transfection with exogenous miR-34a (P
