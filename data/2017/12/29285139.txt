Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide (GLP) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, known for its anti-cancer and immunomodulatory properties. The present study aims to investigate whether GLP has a therapeutic effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exposed to radiation. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the nuclei, the protein expression was measured by western blot analysis and flow cytometry was used to detect the rate of cell apoptosis. GLP treatment was demonstrated to enhance radiation-induced growth inhibition and apoptotic death of HCC cells. At a molecular level, GLP suppressed the activities of DNA repair-associated proteins including ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA dependent-protein kinase (DNA-PK) in liver cancer cells under radiation conditions. Furthermore, the addition of an Akt inhibitor elevated the activities of DNA-PK and ATM and attenuated the GLP-induced HepG2 cell injury under the radiation condition. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that GLP enhances the radiosensitivity of HCC cells via the regulation of Akt signaling pathways, implying a potential therapeutic effect of GLP as a radiation sensitizer in HCC treatment.
