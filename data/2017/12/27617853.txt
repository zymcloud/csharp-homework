Objective:An intent-to-treat analysis of overall survival (ITT-OS) of cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) listed for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) or brain-dead donor liver transplantation (BDLT) across 5 French liver transplant (LT) centers.Background:Comparisons of HCC outcomes after LDLT and BDLT measured from time of transplantation have yielded conflicting results.Methods:Records from 861 cirrhotic patients with HCC consecutively listed for either LDLT (n = 79) or BDLT (n = 782) from 2000 to 2009 were analyzed for ITT-OS using a Cox model; and tumor recurrence using 2 competitive risk models.Results:Tumor staging was similar between groups. In total, 162 patients dropped out (20.7%), all from Group BDLT (P 2 were independent predictors of recurrence, whereas LT type was not.Conclusions:LDLT improves ITT-OS, and it is not a risk factor for tumor recurrence. Therefore, LDLT and BDLT should be equally encouraged in countries where both are available.
