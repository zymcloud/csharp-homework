Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a safe and effective treatment for solitary cancerous lesions. The present study reported a rare case of sustained remission after SBRT for oligorecurrence in the liver in a patient with esophageal carcinoma. A 60-year-old Japanese man presented with a chief complaint of dysphagia. On medical examination, the patient was diagnosed as having squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus that was clinically staged as T4bN1M0. The patient received definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy, consisting of four 28-day cycles of chemotherapy comprising nedaplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and S-1 120 mg/body orally on days 1-14, with radiotherapy comprising a total of 50 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy. After a 9-month disease-free interval following the primary treatment, a solitary liver metastasis was identified. The patient underwent SBRT using a radiation dose of 48 Gy in 4 fractions and two 28-day cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising nedaplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1, and S-1 100 mg/body orally on days 1-14. The patient exhibited no signs of recurrence for 3 years with sustained local control. SBRT may be considered a treatment option for patients with relapsed esophageal cancer with oligo-recurrence in the liver.
