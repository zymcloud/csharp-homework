Laparoscopic liver resection under hemihepatic vascular inflow control has advantages over Pringle's maneuver, especially in patients with cirrhosis. From January 2016 to August 2016, 7 patients who underwent total laparoscopic left hepatectomy under hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion using the extra-glissonian approach were included in this study. All were hepatitis B carriers and 4 had cirrhosis. The mean operation time was 247 minutes. The mean transection time was 110 minutes. No patient needed additional Pringle's maneuver. The mean intraoperative blood loss was 74 ml and no patient required blood transfusion. No open conversion happened. Postoperatively, no patient developed complications and there was no perioperative mortality. The mean resection margin was 2 cm. The mean hospital stay was 6 days. Upon a mean follow-up of 9 months, no patient developed tumor recurrence. The technique of total laparoscopic left hepatectomy using extra-glissonian approach was safe and feasible. The early surgical outcomes were good.
