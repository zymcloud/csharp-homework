Primary sarcomatous hepatocellular carcinoma (PSHCC) is a rare and aggressive variety of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The recent evidence suggests that anticancer therapy promotes the dedifferentiation of the carcinomatous component and is largely responsible for this aggressive variant of HCC. However, in the absence of any anticancer therapy, occurrence of PSHCC is extremely rare. Herein, we present a rare case report of a 65 year old male patient, with a hepatitis B positive status, presenting with PSHCC without any history of anticancer therapy. Detailed immunohistochemical evaluation of the tumor was performed with comparison of morphological and immunohistochemical features of the sarcomatous and carcinomatous components. This appears to be the first documented case of PSHCC from India, to the best of our knowledge.
