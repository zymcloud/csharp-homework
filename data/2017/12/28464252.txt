Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generally resistant to chemotherapy due to intrinsic or acquired drug resistances. Many molecules and signaling pathways are involved in chemo-resistance of HCC cells. However, the contribution of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) to chemo-resistance of HCC cells is still largely unknown. In this study, we revealed the critical roles of long noncoding RNA lncARSR in chemo-resistance of HCC cells. lncARSR is upregulated in HCC, associated with large tumor size and advanced BCLC stage, and indicts poor prognosis. Functional assays showed that overexpression of lncARSR enhances doxorubicin resistance of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. And while knockdown of lncARSR increases sensitivity of HCC cells to doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that lncARSR physically associates with PTEN mRNA, promotes PTEN mRNA degradation, decreases PTEN expression, and activates PI3K/Akt pathway. PTEN is downregulated in HCC, and the expression of PTEN is negatively correlated with lncARSR in HCC tissues. Furthermore, the effects of lncARSR overexpression on doxorubicin resistance could be reversed by PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, and lncARSR knockdown-induced doxorubicin sensitivity could be reversed by PTEN depletion. Taken together, our results showed that upregulated lncARSR promotes doxorubicin resistance in HCC via modulating PTEN-PI3K/Akt pathway, and implied that lncARSR may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC chemo-resistance.
