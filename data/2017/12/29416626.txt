Glycine N-methyltransferase is a tumor suppressor gene for hepatocellular carcinoma, which can activate DNA methylation by inducing the S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocystine. Previous studies have indicated that the expression of Glycine N-methyltransferase is inhibited in hepatocellular carcinoma. To confirm and identify missing proteins, the pathologic analysis of the tumor-bearing mice will provide critical histologic information. Such a mouse model is applied as a screening tool for hepatocellular carcinoma as well as a strategy for missing protein discovery. In this study we designed an analysis platform using the human proteome atlas to compare the possible missing proteins to human whole chromosomes. This will integrate the information from animal studies to establish an optimal technique in the missing protein biomarker discovery.
