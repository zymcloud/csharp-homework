Background:Reliable biomarkers for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis are lacking. We evaluated the use of miR-122, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin k absence/antagonist II (PIVKA-II) for HCC risk prediction in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis under surveillance.Methods:We first analyzed a group of 63 patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis of whom 33 had HCC. Then we performed a retrospective analysis on another group of 13 cirrhotic patients who developed HCC during surveillance, of whom serial serum samples were available (at time of HCC diagnosis [T0], 6-9 months [T-1] and 12-18 months [T-2] before HCC detection). Serum miR-122 levels were assessed by quantitative real time-PCR, whereas AFP and PIVKA-II were measured by fully automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.Results:Serum levels of miR-122, AFP and PIVKA-II were different between patients with cirrhosis and those with HCC (P=0.024, PConclusions:In HBV-related cirrhosis, the combination of miR-122, AFP and PIVKA-II enables the identification of patients at higher risk of HCC development that could benefit from closer monitoring.
