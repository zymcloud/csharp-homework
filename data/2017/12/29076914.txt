Gastrointestinal tract is rarely a metastatic site of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We present a 43-year-old woman with small bowel metastasis from HCC in which metastasis was detected using F-FDG PET/CT. However, the site of metastasis showed no significant uptake on C-acetate PET/CT. C-acetate PET/CT has a limited value in HCC patients with suspected extrahepatic metastasis, compared with F-FDG PET/CT.
