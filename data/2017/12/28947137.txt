In early studies, it was shown that HINT2, which sensitizes cells to mitochondrial apoptosis, is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (Martin et al., 2006). However, the molecular mechanism of this effect is unknown. Immunohistochemistry revealed that HINT2 expression is relatively low in pancreatic cancer tissues, compared to that in adjacent tissues (P 2+ levels. However, co-treatment of HINT2 overexpressing BxPC-3 cells with ruthenium red partially inhibited HINT2-induced apoptosis, which was associated with a reduction in ΔΨm and an increase in intracellular ROS and mitochondrial Ca2+. According to our results, mitochondrial calcium uptake1 and 2 (MICU1 and MICU2) were down-regulated and the essential MCU regulator (EMRE) was up-regulated in cells transduced with Adv-HINT2. Therefore, we deduced that HINT2 triggers apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells by regulating mitochondrial Ca2+ influx through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). In addition, we found that HINT2 can sensitize BxPC-3 and L3.6pl cells to gemcitabine-induced apoptosis and that gemcitabine up-regulates HINT2 expression. This indicates that gemcitabine-induced apoptosis is related to HINT2 levels.
