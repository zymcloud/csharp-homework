This study aimed to investigate the value of computed tomographic (CT) spectral imaging in evaluating the effect of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).The records of 67 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had undergone dynamic spectral CT before treatment were selected for the study. Iodine concentrations pretreatment in liver parenchyma, the HCC lesion(s), portal vein, and aorta were measured from the decomposition images. The normalized iodine concentrations (NIC) were calculated. All of them underwent plain scan or contrast-enhanced CT post-treatment (approximately 4-6 weeks after TACE).The values of arterial phase normalized iodine concentrations (AP NIC) before TACE correlated with the grades of lipiodol deposition in tumors (r = 0.76, P
