Background/purpose:The pattern of tumor cell spread via the portal system has not been fully clarified in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to evaluate the intrahepatic distribution of cancer cells derived from the main tumor by assessing histological portal invasion and/or intrahepatic metastasis (vp/im).Methods:In 14 patients who underwent anatomical resection of primary solitary HCC â‰¤ 50 mm in diameter, vp/im were examined pathologically, and the sites of the lesions were reproduced on preoperative 3D-CT images. The number of vp/im and the distance of each lesion from the tumor margin were also determined.Results:The tumor diameter was Conclusions:3D mapping suggested tumor cells of HCC spread via the portal vein extensively in several cases.
