Background and aims:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most common treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In case of portal vein (PV) flow diversion, outcome may be compromised due to a decompensation of hepatic perfusion following arterial embolization. The aim of this study was to determine whether TACE in patients with retrograde PV flow results in a stronger deterioration of liver function and a poorer survival compared to patients with orthograde PV flow.Methods:A database of 606 patients treated with TACE between 2000 and 2015 at Hannover Medical School was screened for Doppler ultrasound (US) findings on PV flow prior to TACE. A total of 407 patients were identified, among which 32 patients had retrograde PV flow.Results:Patients with retrograde PV flow had significantly more often liver cirrhosis with advanced hepatic dysfunction (93.5% vs. 72.7%, p .05). Patients with retrograde PV flow showed a trend for a shorter OS when matched for cirrhosis (12 vs. 21months, HR 1.51), Child-Pugh score/albumin-bilirubin grade (12 vs. 15 months). There was no difference in the deterioration of liver function after repeated treatments between both groups as assessed by increase of CP points and ALBI grade.Conclusions:Retrograde PV flow alone was not a significant prognostic marker, but patients with retrograde PV flow and advanced liver cirrhosis treated with TACE had a very short survival. Assessment of PV flow prior TACE may be helpful in borderline cases considered for TACE.
