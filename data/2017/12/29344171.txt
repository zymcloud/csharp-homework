DEP Domain Containing 7 (DEPDC7) is highly and specifically expressed in normal liver tissue, belonging to the class of genes of liver-selective cell communication. Although the function of DEPDC7 remains poorly understood, its expression is decreased in liver cancer compared with normal liver tissues. It has previously been demonstrated that knockdown of DEPDC7 promotes cell growth, S phase entry and cell mobility and invasion in HepG2 cells. In the present study, it was shown that DEPDC7 expression is downregulated in four hepatoma cell lines (SMMC-7721, Huh-7, SK-Hep-1 and HepG2) and 48 hepatoma tissues, determined using western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. When DEPDC7 is overexpressed in hepatoma cell lines (SK-Hep-1 and Huh-7), it inhibits cell proliferation and cell growth; inhibits cell cycle entry; and inhibits cell motility and invasion. These results, together with the results of knockdown experiments, demonstrate that DEPDC7 may have an important role in hepatoma cells growth and metastasis and suggest it could be a therapeutic target; however, in vitro studies are required to validate this hypothesis.
