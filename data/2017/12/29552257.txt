We report a case of an 81-year-old woman with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transarterial chemoembolization. The patient had significant superior mesenteric artery (SMA) ostial stenosis, which led to retrograde flow in the retroportal artery to the SMA. The authors adopted several approaches to avoid potential nontarget embolization that might result from the change in the hemodynamics in the hepatoenteric arteries by initially stenting the SMA ostial stenosis as well as the use of the Surefire infusion system and balloon occlusion for delivery of chemoembolization material to tumors in the hepatic lobes. To our knowledge, the collective use of these approaches to avoid potential risks related to SMA ostial stenosis and retrograde flow in a retroportal artery has not been previously described in the literature.
