Background:The purpose of this case series is to investigate the relationship between splenic thickness (ST) and postoperative outcomes after hepatic resection in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:The clinical data of 320 patients with HBV-associated HCC who had undergone liver resection were retrospectively analyzed. The value of ST in predicting postoperative outcomes was evaluated.Results:A total of 320 patients were enrolled in the study. An increase in ST was significantly associated with an increase in portal vein diameter (PVD), indocyanine green retention rate 15 min (ICG R15), and total bilirubin (TBIL); however, it was negatively correlated with platelet count (PLT). Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) occurred in 35 (10.9%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that ST was an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality after hepatectomy. Meanwhile, ST was associated with an almost sixfold increased risk for developing perioperative complications (OR 5.678; 95% CI 2.873 to 11.224; P Conclusions:ST, which is an easy, inexpensive, and routinely available perioperative marker, showed a favorable predictive value for postoperative outcomes in HBV-associated HCC patients.
