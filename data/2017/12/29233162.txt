Background:Sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma (SHC) is a rare malignant hepatic tumor. Recurrent interventional therapies such as transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and percutaneous ethanol injection have been reported previously utilized in a majority of SHC cases. To date, the exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying sarcomatoid transformation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown.Case presentation:In this study, we report a 68-year-old female SHC patient admitted to our hospital due to discrete abdominal distention for more than 20 days. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with tri-phase enhancement revealed portal vein tumor thrombi (PVTT) and a left hepatic lobe lesion measuring 110.0 mm Ã— 160.0 mm. The patient subsequently underwent liver resection, after which pathological examination revealed proliferation of spindle-shaped SHC cells. A sarcomatoid, T4 stage carcinoma was eventually diagnosed. Forty-seven days after the operation, tri-phase enhanced CT detected extensive lesions in the liver, spleen, peritoneum, omentum majus, and mesentery, indicating SHC recurrence and metastases. Combination chemotherapy with pirarubicin and cisplatin was initiated for 1 cycle, but terminated due to resultant severe myelosuppression and medication intolerance. The patient was lost to therapy after 3 months of follow-up.Conclusions:This case is unique because of hepatitis C virus infection. We should consider the possibility of this disease in patients with atypical clinical presentation.
