Aim:To analyze clinical significance of preoperative liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by FibroScan in postcurative resection hepatitis B virus (HBV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients & methods:A total of 263 patients underwent preoperative LSM and curative operation for primary HBV-positive HCC were enrolled. The correlation between preoperative LSM and survival was analyzed.Results:All patients were stratified into two groups using the optimal cut-off value (13.2 kPa) of LSM using the receiver-operating characteristic. Patients with an LSM â‰¥13.2 kPa had poorer overall survival (median, 61.3 vs 48.2 months, hazard ratio: 0.15; p = 0.009) and recurrence-free survival (median, 60.4 vs 47.0 months; hazard ratio: 0.32; p = 0.011) than patients with an LSM Discussion:This could potentially guide patient stratification and individualized treatment.Conclusion:Preoperative LSM can be considered as an independent prognostic factor for HBV-positive HCC after curative resection.
