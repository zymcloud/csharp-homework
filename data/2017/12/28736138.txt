Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global problem. Several HBV genotypes exist with different biology and geographical prevalence. Whilst the future aim of HBV treatment remains viral eradication, current treatment strategies aim to suppress the virus and prevent the progression of liver disease. Current strategies also involve identification of patients for treatment, namely those at risk of progressive liver disease. Identification of HBV genotype, HBV mutants and other predictive factors allow for tailoured treatments, and risk-surveillance pathways, such as hepatocellular cancer screening. In the future, these factors may enable stratification not only of treatment decisions, but also of patients at risk of higher relapse rates when current therapies are discontinued. Newer technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, to assess drug-resistant or immune escape variants and quasi-species heterogeneity in patients, may allow for more information-based treatment decisions between the clinician and the patient. This article serves to discuss how HBV genotypes and genetic variants impact not only upon the disease course and outcomes, but also current treatment strategies. Adopting a personalised genotypic approach may play a role in future strategies to combat the disease. Herein, we discuss new technologies that may allow more informed decision-making for response guided therapy in the battle against HBV.
