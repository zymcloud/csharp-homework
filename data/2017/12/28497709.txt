We report on a 70-year-old man with unresectable multiple hepatocellular carcinomas who underwent treatment with transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization. In treating a tumor in segment 1 of the liver, the proximal side-hole micro-balloon catheter, which has been newly developed, was useful.
Chemoembolization; interventional procedures; liver neoplasm.
