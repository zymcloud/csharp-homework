Rationale:Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm, and its presence in a grafted liver is exceedingly rare.Patient concerns:A 54-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a half-month history of intermittent melena. She had undergone deceased-donor liver transplantation (LT) for hepatitis B virus related liver cirrhosis without hepatocellular carcinoma 5 months previously.Diagnosis:Laboratory examination showed impaired liver and renal functions and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, but tumor markers within normal ranges. Gastroscopy showed esophageal varices. Ultrasound and computed tomography angiography revealed an ill-defined and irregular solitary lesion in the porta hepatis, encasing both the portal vein and the hepatic artery. The lesion was characterized by arterial hyper-enhancement and hypo-enhancement in the remaining phases with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The lesion was finally confirmed as an IMT by ultrasound-guided biopsy.Intervention:The patient received conservative treatment, including immunosuppression, endoscopic variceal ligation, antibiotics, steroids, and antiviral agents.Outcome:The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding was controlled, but the symptoms associated with portal hypertension worsened. Attempts to perform a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt were unsuccessful, and she unfortunately died soon after.Lessons:A differential diagnosis of IMT should be considered in LT recipients presenting with EBV infection, normal tumor markers, and a de novo hepatic lesion with quick wash-in and wash-out on CEUS. Ultrasound is associated with the advantages of convenience and nonionizing radiation, and should thus be the priority approach for monitoring transplanted liver.
