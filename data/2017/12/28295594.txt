Background and aim:The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade is a new index to assess objectively liver function and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to elucidate the application of ALBI grade in baseline and sorafenib-end in advanced HCC patients who received sorafenib.Methods:A total of 415 consecutive advanced HCC patients in Child-Pugh A received sorafenib in our hospital. Sorafenib was terminated when radiologic tumor progression or clinical liver function deterioration (LD) occurred in the reassessment bimonthly. Patients who failed with sorafenib monotherapy were retrospectively analyzed.Results:A total of 260 (62.6%) patients were enrolled, including 98 (37.7%) ALBI grade I and 162 (62.3%) grade II in baseline. More patients in ALBI grade II stopped sorafenib because of LD than in grade I (33.3% vs 14.3%, P Conclusions:In clinical practice, we firstly demonstrated that not only ALBI grade in baseline but also ALBI grade change during treatment could predict the prognosis of advanced HCC patients who received sorafenib.
