Objective:To detect the plasma levels of mannan?binding lectin (MBL) and MBL?associated serine protease?2 (MASP-2) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explore their role in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC.Methods:The plasma levels of MBL and MASP?2 were detected by enzyme?linked immunosorbent assay in 64 HCC patients and 30 healthy control subjects. The correlation of MBL and MASP?2 with the clinical parameters of HCC patients were analyzed.Results:The plasma levels of MBL (P=0.014) and MASP?2 (P=0.002) were significantly higher in HCC patients than in the healthy controls, but the MBL?to?MASP?2 ratio did not differ significantly between the two groups. In HCC patients, plasma MBL level was positively correlated with vascular invasion (r=0.253, P=0.047) and total bilirubin level (r=0.283, P=0.024). The plasma level of MASP?2 was positively correlated with TNM stage (r=0.276, P=0.027) and negatively correlated with plasma albumin level (r=0.?0.317, P=0.015). ROC curve analysis revealed an area under curve of 0.665 for MBL (P=0.010) and 0.694 for MASP?2 (P=0.003). The sensitivities of MBL and MASP?2 were 50% and 89.1% in the diagnosis of HCC, respectively.Conclusion:MBL and MASP?2 are associated with the inflammatory state and disease progression in patients with HCC.
