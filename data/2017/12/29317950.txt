A biliobronchial fistula is an abnormal communication between the biliary tract and the bronchial tree. It may be a rare complication after treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). We present a case of a 71-year-old man that developed a biliobronchial fistula as a complication of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with TACE. It was successfully diagnosed by hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan and treated with endoscopic retrograde pancreatography.
