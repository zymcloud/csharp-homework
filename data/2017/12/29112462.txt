Hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers along with other gastrointestinal malignancies remain the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Strategies developed in the recent years on immunotherapy and cancer vaccines in the setting of primary liver cancer as well as in pancreatic cancer are the scope of this review. Significance of orthotopic and autochthonous animal models which mimic and/or closely reflect human malignancies allowing for a prompt and trustworthy analysis of new therapeutics is underlined. Combinational approaches that on one hand, specifically target a defined cancer-driving pathway, and on the other hand, restore the functions of immune cells, which effector functions are often suppressed by a tumor milieu, are shown to have the strongest perspectives and future directions. Among combinational immunotherapeutic approaches a personalized- and individual cancer case-based therapy is of special importance.
