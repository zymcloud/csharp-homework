Liver resection is the most effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, however, decision for surgery remained confusing. In Europe the most accepted Barcelona staging system sets minimal value on surgical interventions. Long lasting diagnostic steps and uncertainty for indication of resection are possible consequences of this approach. The reported case is an example for the fact that exceptionally large tumor having been grown during time-consuming diagnostic attempts might be removed by laparoscopic surgery. The case hopefully could lead to widespread acceptance of up-to-date surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
