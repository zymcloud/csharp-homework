Rationale:Hemangioma of the liver is a benign hepatic tumor, more common in women than in men, which is typically asymptomatic, solitary, and incidentally discovered. Atypical hemangioma is a variant of hepatic hemangioma with atypical imaging finding features on CT and MRI that can be confused with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and mixed hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC).Patient concerns:We report a case of atypical hepatic hemangioma mimicking HCC-CC: A 59-year-old man was referred to our hospital for a hepatic lesion that was 4.7Ã—3.6 cm in size and located in segments 2 and 3 of the liver. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level increased from 17.03 ng/mL to 374.9 ng/mL. The patient was positive for hepatitis B.Diagnoses:Atypical hepatic hemangioma.Interventions:US, CT, MRI and Tc-99m RBC liver scans were performed. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI showed no uptake in the corresponding area during the arterial phase, peripheral nodular enhancement during the portal phase and delayed phase, and hypo-intensity in the central area. An initial diagnosis of HCC-CC was offered based on the history and imaging findings. Finally, percutaneous liver biopsy (PLB) was offered to the patient. Histopathologic examination of the liver lesions revealed nodular cirrhosis and atypical hyperplasia of liver cells with cavernous hemangioma, where numerous old Schistosoma japonicum eggs were found.Outcomes:Accurate diagnosis of the patient obviated the need for surgery. The patient's recovery after liver puncture was uneventful, and he was discharged on the seventh post-operative day.Lessons:In some cases, accurate preoperative imaging of focal hepatic lesions is essential but insufficient for diagnosis. PLB and histopathological examination are important, especially in patients with suspected malignancy.
