This prospective study aimed to estimate the efficacy of sorafenib therapy after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Between July 2011 and March 2013, 17 patients were enrolled, 11 of whom received sorafenib therapy. Patients who previously received TACE for HCC and whose disease progressed within a six-month period were given 400-800 mg sorafenib orally, once or twice daily, within the 3 weeks after a second TACE (sorafenib after TACE group). The response to treatment, time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Of the 113 patients who underwent initial TACE for unresectable HCC between January 1995 and January 2013, 23 patients were selected who were treated with TACE alone, and for whom the interval between the second and third TACE treatments was or 4 months prolonged TTP (5.7 months) significantly compared with use for 4 months (35.9 months) was longer than that of patients who received the drug for 4 months, TACE alone, and sorafenib for
hepatocellular carcinoma; sorafenib; transarterial chemoembolization.
