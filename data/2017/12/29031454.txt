Background:The ratio of serum Î³-glutamyl transferase (GGT) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (GGT/ALT) is a marker for evaluating effects to antivirotic treatment and a helpful predictive factor for the prognosis of Child-Pugh A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after surgery. The relationship between the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and preoperative GGT/ALT is studied in hepatectomized hepatitis B- or C- associated HCC patients.Methods:A total of 253 hepatitis B or C virus-related HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy between September 2012 and August 2016 at our hospital were included in the retrospective study. Serum ALT and GGT value were recorded, and the GGT/ALT was computed. AKI was defined that based on the "Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria".Results:AKI was observed in 22 (8.7%) patients. Mean GGT/ALT of patients with AKI was significantly higher than in those without it (6.0 vs 2.1, PConclusions:The GGT/ALT of patients with AKI was significantly higher than those without it. Evaluation of GGT/ALT before surgery can be a helpful predictive tool for postoperative AKI in hepatitis B- or C- associated HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy, particularly in patients with BCLC stage 0 or A staged HCC. Hepatitis B- or C- associated HCC patients with low ALT especially within the normal range may have a high risk of AKI. However, the reason remains to be elucidated.
