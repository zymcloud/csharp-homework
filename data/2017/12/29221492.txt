Objective:Coinfection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) with hepatitis D virus (HDV) has being reported to increase severity of progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis (LC). Beta microglobulin (2βM) which is present on the surfaces of blood cells in acceptable levels is a tumor marker which may become elevated in disease conditions. This study hence observed the prevalence of HBV and HDV coinfection in a rural population and their 2βM concentration.Results:Of the 368 samples, 66 (17.9%) were positive to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 33 (50%) were coinfected with HDV, 8 (2.1%) were monoinfected with HDV. 2βM concentration increased beyond the normal level in individuals coinfected with HBV and HDV as compared with the monoinfected individuals. Coinfection resulted in the increased concentration of 2βM in HBV and HDV coinfection and the likelihood of progression to HCC and LC may not be ruled out. Monoinfection with HDV also had high 2βM concentration but this is due to having being infected with a non-detected HBV or chronic infection in which HBV is clearing.
