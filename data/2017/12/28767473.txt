Acquired hemophilia is a rare but potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder caused by the development of autoantibodies (inhibitors) directed against plasma coagulation factors, most frequently factor VIII. We report a case of a 65-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma who bled massively after a hepatic Yttrium-90 radioembolization procedure (Selective Internal Radiation Therapy with Yttrium-90 Resin Microspheres [SIRTex]). An acquired deficiency of factor VIII was diagnosed and successfully treated with recombinant activated factor VII and immunosuppression.
