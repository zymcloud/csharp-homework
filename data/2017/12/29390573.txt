Rationale:Adequate future liver remnant (FLR) volume is often a concern for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure can rapidly lead to impressive growth of FLR. We describe the technique of an entirely laparoscopic radiofrequency-assisted liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (RALPP) in a cirrhotic patient with HCC.Patient concerns:A 33 year-old female cirrhotic patient with HCC in the right liver was indicated for RALPP as the predicted future liver remnant (FLR) was 21%.Diagnoses:HCC with liver cirrhosis.Interventions:The first surgery consisted of ligation of the right portal vein and radiofrequency ablation of the liver without parenchymal transection. Three weeks postoperatively, FLR reached 42%, and the patient underwent right hepatectomy.Outcomes:Operative times for the both surgeries were 60 and 240 minutes respectively, with negligeable blood loss. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and the FLR reached 53% 1 week after the second procedure. No recurrence occurred at 10 months.Lessons:Laparoscopic RALPP is feasible in some cirrhotic patients with liver cancer that in line with the indications and this method may be a superior choice for selected cirrhotic patients with HCC, as it decreases potential morbidity associated with open surgery.
