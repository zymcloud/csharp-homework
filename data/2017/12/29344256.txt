Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and the deregulation of apoptotic signaling, although its molecular pathogenesis is not fully characterized. The ability to inhibit excessive proliferation and induce the apoptosis of cancer cells are crucial characteristics of anticancer drugs. Pien Tze Huang (PZH) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various types of cancer, and has exhibited promising therapeutic effects in clinical trials of HCC. However, the underlying mechanisms for its action are unclear. In the present study, the aim was to explore the effect of PZH on the proliferation and apoptosis of the BEL-7402 HCC cell line, and the associated mechanisms. PZH treatment significantly inhibited BEL-7402 cell viability, confluence and clonogenicity, inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. In addition, PZH treatment suppressed the expression of the pro-proliferative genes cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. PZH treatment also upregulated the expression of a key microRNA (miR), miR-16. The study demonstrated that PZH can effectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in BEL-7402 HCC cells via the upregulation of the tumor suppressor miR-16.
