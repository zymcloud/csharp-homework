Background:Expanding patient selection beyond the Milan criteria in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has long been a matter for debate. We have used the Kyushu University Criteria - maximum tumor diameter Methods:The entire study period was divided into the pre-Kyushu era (July 1999-May 2007) and the Kyushu era (June 2007-November 2014). Eighty-nine and 90 patients underwent LDLT for HCC in the pre-Kyushu era and the Kyushu era, respectively.Results:In the pre-Kyushu era, there were significant differences in recurrence-free and disease-specific survival between the beyond-Milan and the within-Milan patients. In the Kyushu era, however, the differences in recurrence-free and disease-specific survival between the beyond-Milan and the within-Milan patients disappeared. The 5-year overall patient survival in the Kyushu era was 89.4%.Conclusion:Our selection criteria enabled a considerable number of beyond-Milan patients to undergo LDLT without jeopardizing the recurrence-free, and disease-specific, and overall patient survival.
