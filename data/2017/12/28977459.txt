Objective:The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization using miriplatin, a platinum-based anticancer drug, as a retreatment regimen for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) unresponsive to chemoembolization using epirubicin.Methods:Between April 2013 and December 2014, we enrolled 57 consecutive chamoembolization-na√Øve patients with unresectable HCC, and performed chemoembolization with epirubicin. Treatment effect, necrotizing rate of the target nodules, was evaluated at 1-3 months after treatment using contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. We subsequently included retreatment chemoembolization with miriplatin for patients whose treatment effect was Results:Eighteen patients of the 57 showed a treatment effect Conclusions:In unresectable HCC patients who were unresponsive to chemoembolization with epirubicin, switching the chemotherapeutic regimen to a platinum-based anticancer drug in retreatment chemoembolization should be considered as a treatment option.
