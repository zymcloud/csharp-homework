Immunodeficient mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been referred to as "Human Immune System" (HIS) mice and are a translational platform for studying human immune responses in vivo. Human HSC sources used in generating HIS mice include fetal liver (FL), umbilical cord blood (CB), and adult bone marrow (BM). Since HSCs from FL, CB, and BM are produced at various stages of human development, we tested whether mice transplanted with these three HSCs differ in their immune responses. We found that compared with CB HSCs or FL HSCs, adult BM HSCs reconstitute the immune system poorly. The resulting HIS mice do not mount an antibody response to Borrelia hermsii infection and as a consequence suffer persistently high levels of bacteremia. While both CB and FL HSCs yield comparable levels of immune reconstitution of HIS mice resulting in robust anti-B. hermsii immune responses, FL HSC-transplanted mice exhibited a discernable difference in their human B cell maturity as identified by an increased frequency of CD10+ immature B cells and relatively smaller lymphoid follicles compared with CB HSC-transplanted mice. Although CB HSC-transplanted mice generated robust antibody responses to B. hermsii and specific protein antigens of B. hermsii, they failed to respond to Salmonella typhi Vi polysaccharide, a classical T cell-independent antigen. This situation resembles that seen in human infants and young children. Therefore, CB HSC-transplanted mice may serve as a translation platform to explore approaches to overcome the impaired antipolysaccharide responses characteristic of human infants.
