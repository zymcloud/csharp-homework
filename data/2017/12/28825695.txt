Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly chemoresistant and therefore challenges both physicians and patients. Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), previously also known as 'hepatic stimulator substance', is reported to inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC, one of the frequent events that occur in cancer metastasis, suggesting that ALR is involved in HCC. In this study, we report for the first time that the transfection of ALR enhances the antitumor effect of chemotherapy with doxorubicin, a typical anticancer drug, on HCC in vitro and in vivo. The efflux of doxorubicin from ALR-transfected HCC cells is efficiently suppressed. This implies the intracellular retention of doxorubicin in tumor cells, which is at least partly attributable to the effective inhibition of ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporter expression in ALR-expressing cells. The downregulation of ALR expression by short hairpin RNA diminishes the antitumor effect of ALR. We further demonstrate that ALR inhibits the AKT/Snail signaling pathway, resulting in the downregulation of ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression. In conclusion, our results suggest that ALR is a potential chemotherapeutic agent against HCC.
