Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease with a wide spectrum of manifestations including simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver injury in ALD is caused by chronic inflammation, which has been actively investigated as a therapeutic target for the treatment of ALD for over the last four decades. In this review, we summarize a wide variety of inflammatory mediators that have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of ALD, and discuss the therapeutic potential of these mediators for the treatment of ALD.
