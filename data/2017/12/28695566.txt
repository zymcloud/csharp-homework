Background and objectives:Portal vein (PV) territory identification during liver resection may be performed using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging technique. However, the technical details of the fluorescence staining technique have not been fully elucidated. This study was performed to demonstrate the technical details of PV territory identification using fluorescence imaging and evaluates the short-term outcomes.Methods:From 2011 to 2015, 105 underwent liver resection at the University of Tokyo Hospital with one of the following fluorescence staining techniques by transhepatic PV injection or intravenous injection of ICG: single staining (n = 36), multiple staining (n = 31), counterstaining (n = 22), negative staining (n = 13), or paradoxical negative staining (n = 3).Results:The PV territory was identified as a region with fluorescence or a defect of fluorescence using one of the five staining techniques. ICG was administered by transhepatic PV injection in all but the negative staining technique, which employed intravenous injection. No adverse events associated with the ICG administration occurred. The mortality, postoperative total morbidity, and the major complication (Clavien-Dindo grade â‰¥III) rates were 0.0%, 14.3%, and 7.6%.Conclusions:We have demonstrated the technical details of five types of fluorescence staining techniques. These techniques are safe to perform and facilitate clear visualization of the PV territory in real time, enhancing the efficacy of anatomical removal of such territories.
