In this study, a xenogeneic DNA vaccine encoding for human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (hVEGFR-2) was evaluated in two murine tumor models, the B16-F10 melanoma and the EO771 breast carcinoma model. The vaccine was administered by intradermal injection followed by electroporation. The immunogenicity and the biological efficacy of the vaccine were tested in (1) a prophylactic setting, (2) a therapeutic setting, and (3) a therapeutic setting combined with surgical removal of the primary tumor. The tumor growth, survival, and development of an immune response were followed. The cellular immune response was measured by a bioluminescence-based cytotoxicity assay with vascular endothelial growth factor-2 (VEGFR-2)-expressing target cells. Humoral immune responses were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ex vivo bioluminescence imaging and immunohistological observation of organs were used to detect (micro)metastases. A cellular and humoral immune response was present in prophylactically and therapeutically vaccinated mice, in both tumor models. Nevertheless, survival in prophylactically vaccinated mice was only moderately increased, and no beneficial effect on survival in therapeutically vaccinated mice could be demonstrated. An influx of CD3+ cells and a slight decrease in VEGFR-2 were noticed in the tumors of vaccinated mice. Unexpectedly, the vaccine caused an increased quantity of early micrometastases in the liver. Lung metastases were not increased by the vaccine. These early liver micrometastases did however not grow into macroscopic metastases in either control or vaccinated mice when allowed to develop further after surgical removal of the primary tumor.
