Alcoholic liver disease remains a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality, which ranges from alcoholic steatohepatitis to fibrosis/cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and the related mechanisms are understood poorly. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-34a in alcohol-induced cellular senescence and liver fibrosis. We found that hepatic miR-34a expression was upregulated in ethanol-fed mice and heavy drinkers with steatohepatitis compared with respective controls. Mice treated with miR-34a Vivo-Morpholino developed less severe liver fibrosis than wild-type mice after 5 weeks of ethanol feeding. Further mechanism exploration showed that inhibition of miR-34a increased cellular senescence of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in ethanol-fed mice, although it decreased senescence in total liver and hepatocytes, which was verified by the changes of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and gene expression. Furthermore, enhanced cellular senescence was observed in liver tissues from steatohepatitis patients compared with healthy controls. In addition, the expression of transforming growth factor-β1, drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic protein 2 (Smad2), and Smad3 was decreased after inhibition of miR-34a in ethanol-fed mice. Our in vitro experiments showed that silencing of miR-34a partially blocked activation of HSCs by lipopolysaccharide and enhanced senescence of HSCs. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-34a decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced fibrotic gene expression in cultured hepatocytes. In conclusion, our data suggest that miR-34a functions as a profibrotic factor that promotes alcohol-induced liver fibrosis by reducing HSC senescence and increasing the senescence of hepatocytes.
