Background:Calvarial metastasis from liver cirrhosis in the absence of a primary focus is exceptionally rare. Few reports of metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma of an unknown primary focus have been published.Case description:A 66-year-old man with a history of Schistosoma japonicum infection presented to our hospital with a mass over the left occipital region associated with headache and dizziness. Imaging revealed a 6 Ã— 5-cm lesion supplied principally by the left occipital artery. The metastatic tumor was removed via super-selective embolization and craniotomy. Pathology revealed that circulating tumor cells from the liver had metastasized to the calvaria. Postoperatively, no primary foci was found over 9 months of follow-up.Conclusions:A calvarial mass may be an initial manifestation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Early diagnosis is important. A calvarial metastasis from the liver, although very rare, should be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with both cirrhosis and skull mass.
