This meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively assess the efficacy and safety of hepatic resection combined with radiofrequency ablation versus hepatic resection (HR) alone for the treatment of multifocal hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). A literature search was conducted from the database including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and China Biology Medicine (CBM) disc. The primary outcomes included the 1-, 3-, 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rate. The secondary outcomes contained the intraoperative parameters and postoperative adverse events (AEs). These parameters were all analyzed by RevMan 5.3 software. After carefully screening relevant studies, four retrospective studies of high quality involving 466 patients (197 in the combined group and 269 in the HR group) were included in this study. The pooled results showed that the 1-, 3-, 5-year OS rate in the combined group were comparable with those in the HR group (OR=0.77, 0.96, 0.88; P=0.33, 0.88, 0.70, respectively). Similarly, there was no significant difference in 1-, 3-, 5-year DFS rate between the combined group and the HR alone group (OR=0.57, 0.83, 0.72; P=0.17, 0.37, 0.32, respectively). And the intraoperative parameters and postoperative AEs were also comparable between the above two cohorts. However, two included studies reported that tumor often recurred in the ablation site in the combined group. The present meta-analysis indicated that the HR combined with RFA could reach a long-term survival outcome similar to curative HR for multifocal HCC patients. And this therapy may be a promising alternative for these patients with marginal liver function or complicated tumor distribution. Furthermore, high quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are imperative to verify this conclusion.
