Breast cancer in men is rare, accounting for approximately 1% of all breast cancers and less than 1% of all neoplasias in men. This study aimed to highlight the clinical histological, prognostic and therapeutic features of this rare tumor in order to contribute to improve the management of these patients. We conducted retrospective study of 40 patients whose data were collected at the Mohammed VI Center for Cancers Treatment in Casablanca from January 2000 to December 2012. The average age was 62 years, the mean consultation time was 12 months, self-exam of a peri-areolar nodul was the main reason for consultation in 90% of cases. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the predominant histological type in 90% of cases. Multimodal treatment was based on mastectomy followed by adjuvant therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and/or hormonal therapy, depending on tumor stage and its histological features. The mean follow-up time was 38 months, patient's evolution was characterized by complete remission in 16 patients (40%), local recurrence in 3 patients (7.5%) and metastatic recurrence in 5 patients (12.5%). Metastases mainly occurred in the bones (62%), followed by the lungs and the liver. 10 patients (25%) died. Breast cancer in men is similar to breast cancer in women. However it has its own peculiarities, hence the importance of conducting broader prospective randomised studies in order to improve the treatment and the prognosis of this disease with a high psychosocial impact.
