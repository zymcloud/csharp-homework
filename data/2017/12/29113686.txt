Background:To practically verify the clinical value of miR-26a-5p and thoroughly explore its target genes as well as its potential functions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:HCC and adjacent non-cancerous hepatic tissues of 95 HCC patients were collected for analysis using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). For the bioinformatics analysis, we identified potential target genes for miR-26a-5p from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets and miRWalk predicted database. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were applied to analyze the prospective mechanisms of the predicted target genes.Results:MiR-26a-5p showed a significantly lower expression level in HCC tissues (1.56±1.07) than adjacent benign liver tissues (2.28±1.06, PConclusion:Down-regulated miR-26a-5p was closely correlated with the status of metastasis and the progression of HCC. MiR-26a-5p might play protective roles by targeting diverse genes and pathways.
