Isocorydine (ICD), an aporphine alkaloid, is widely distributed in nature. Its ability to target side population (SP) cells found in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) makes it and its derivative 8-amino-isocorydine (NICD) promising chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of HCC. To improve the anticancer activity of isocorydine derivatives, twenty derivatives of NICD were designed and synthesized through chemical structure modifications of the aromatic amino group at C-8. The anti-proliferative activities of all synthesized compounds against human hepatocellular (HepG2), cervical (HeLa), and gastric (MGC-803) cancer cell lines were evaluated using an MTT assay. The results showed that all the synthetic compounds had some tumor cell growth inhibitory activity. The compound COM33 (24) was the most active with IC50 values under 10 μM (IC50 for HepG2 = 7.51 µM; IC50 for HeLa = 6.32 μM). FICD (12) and COM33 (24) were selected for further investigation of their in vitro and in vivo activities due to their relatively good antiproliferative properties. These two compounds significantly downregulated the expression of four key proteins (C-Myc, β-Catenin, CylinD1, and Ki67) in HepG2 cells. The tumor inhibition rate of COM33 (24) in vivo was 73.8% after a dose 100 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection and the combined inhibition rate of COM33 (24) (50 mg/kg) with sorafenib (50 mg/kg) was 66.5%. The results indicated that these isocorydine derivatives could potentially be used as targeted chemotherapy agents or could be further developed in combination with conventional chemotherapy drugs to target cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the main therapeutic targets in HCC.
