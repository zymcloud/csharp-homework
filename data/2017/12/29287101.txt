Background:Various immune-mediated diseases are associated with increased malignancy risks. However, the relationship between Beh√ßet's disease (BD) and cancer remains unclear. We conducted a nationwide, population-based study to determine the risk of cancer in patients with BD.Methods:Using National Health Insurance claims records, we collected data from 2402 patients diagnosed with BD between 2013 and 2014. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of overall and site-specific cancers in patients with BD in comparison with the general population were calculated.Results:The risks of overall cancer (SIR, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 2.35-5.11 in men and 2.17; 1.58-2.92 in women) and solid cancer (3.10; 1.94-4.69 in men and 2.13; 1.52-2.90 in women) were greater in patients with BD than in the general population. There were significantly increased risks for these solid cancers: colorectal (4.26; 1.38-9.94), liver (4.00; 1.09-10.25), bone/articular cartilage (55.66; 1.41-310.14), prostate (7.05; 1.45-20.60), and brain/central nervous system (28.32; 3.43-102.31) in men; and the lips/oral cavity/pharynx (13.97, 1.69-50.47), liver (12.78; 5.14-26.33), lungs (4.35; 1.18-11.13), other female genital organs (53.57; 1.36-298.49), and eyes (128.26; 3.24-714.59) in women. Patients with BD had a greater risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) than the general population did (65.72; 7.96-237.41 in men and 53.86; 11.11-157.40 in women), but not of hematological cancer.Conclusions:Compared to the general population, Korean patients with BD had greater risks of overall cancer, some solid cancers, and MDS, but not of hematological cancer.
