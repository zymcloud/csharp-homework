With the wide use of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), more and more patients with chronic hepatitis C achieve sustained virological response; however, no consensus has been reached on the application of DAAs in the treatment of hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This article summarizes and evaluates related issues in this field, including whether antiviral therapy with DAAs in patients with hepatitis C can increase the incidence or recurrence rate of HCC, as well as whether DAAs can be used for hepatitis C in HCC patients after antitumor treatment and the efficacy of DAAs in such patients.
