HBV quasispecies are closely related to the course and outcome of liver disease. However, whether the complexity and diversity of HBX quasispecies affects its integration in the liver cell and thereby enhances the resultant carcinogenesis is still not clear. 15 HCC patients were recruited; genomic DNA and HBV DNA were extracted from liver cancer tissue and serum respectively. The integrated HBX fragment in liver cancer tissue was amplified by Alu repeat sequence-polymerase chain reaction (Alu-PCR) and sequenced. The serum HBX gene was amplified by nested PCR and sequenced. Quasispecies complexity and diversity, phylogenetic characteristics, lymphocyte count and survival time between HBX-integrated and HBX-unintegrated patients were evaluated. Results showed that the integrated HBX fragment was detected in the tumor tissue of nine patients, and the integration rate was 60.00% (9/15). Compared with the HBX-unintegrated patients, the HBX-integrated patients had a higher quasispecies complexity (P=0.028 and 0.004, at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively). The HBX-integrated patients had a tendency of higher quasispecies diversity, lower lymphocyte count and the survival time. A total of 12 mutation sites were revealed in the HBX-integrated fragment after alignment with the reference sequence. In these, the HBX-integrated groups had significantly higher mutation frequencies at C1497T, A1630G, G1721A, A1762T/G1764A and A1774G. This study revealed influence factors of HBX integration both in virus and the host. The increased complexity and diversity of HBX quasispecies might destroy the host immune balance, and lead to HBX integration ultimately.
