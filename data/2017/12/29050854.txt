Purpose:To report the final analysis of the safety and efficacy of portal vein (PV) recanalization (PVR) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation (PVR-TIPS) in patients with PV thrombosis (PVT) in need of liver transplantation.Materials and methods:Sixty-one patients with cirrhosis and PVT underwent PVR-TIPS to improve transplantation candidacy. Median patient age was 58 years (range, 22-75 y), and median pre-TIPS Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 14 (range, 7-42). The most common etiologies of cirrhosis were nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in 18 patients (30%) and hepatitis C in 13 patients (21%). Twenty-seven patients (44%) had partial PVT, and 34 patients (56%) had complete thrombosis. Forty-nine patients (80%) had Yerdel grade 2 PVT, and 12 (20%) had Yerdel grade 3 PVT. Twenty-nine patients (48%) had cavernous transformation of the PV.Results:PVR-TIPS was technically successful in 60 of 61 patients (98%). PV/TIPS patency was maintained in 55 patients (92%) at a median follow-up of 19.2 months (range, 0-105.9 mo). Recurrent PV/TIPS thrombosis occurred in 5 patients (8%), all of whom initially presented with complete PVT. The most common adverse events were TIPS stenosis in 13 patients (22%) and transient encephalopathy in 11 patients (18%). Twenty-four patients (39%) underwent transplantation, 23 of whom (96%) received an end-to-end anastomosis. There were no cases of recurrent PVT following transplantation, with a median imaging follow-up of 32.5 months (range, 0.4-75.4 mo). Five-year overall survival rate was 82%.Conclusions:PVR-TIPS is a safe, effective, and durable treatment option for patients with chronic PVT who need liver transplantation.
