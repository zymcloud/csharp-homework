Cancer immunotherapy, as a new treatment modality, has been shown to be effective, especially in metastatic melanoma and lung cancer. Organ transplantation can be a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage diseases of lung, heart, kidney and liver. While ironically, as improvements in organ transplantation have extended patients' lives, new or recurrent postsurgical malignancies have become an increasing threat to their long-term survival, especially in patients after liver transplantation due to hepatocellular carcinoma. The feasibility of immunotherapy treatment for such patients is still to be investigated.
