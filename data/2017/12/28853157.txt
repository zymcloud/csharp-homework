Background and objectives:Although the globulin-to-albumin ratio (GAR) is useful for prognostication of patients with various cancers, its relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The study aims to investigate the relationship between GAR and postoperative survival among patients with HCC undergoing potentially curative liver resection (LR).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 368 patients with newly diagnosed HCC who underwent initial and potentially curative LR. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model were performed to detect clinical characteristics that correlated with overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test were used to compare OS and disease-free survival (DFS).Results:The result of multivariate analysis using 25 clinical characteristics selected by univariate analysis revealed that the GAR (≥0.918/4 /mm3 ) and portal vein invasion (presence/absence). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test demonstrated that the OS and DFS of patients with a high GAR (>0.918) were significantly worse than that of patients with a low GAR (≤0.918).Conclusions:The GAR is a useful predictor of postoperative survival among patients with HCC undergoing potentially curative LR.
