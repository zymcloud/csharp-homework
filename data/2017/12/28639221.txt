Human endogenous retrovirus W family (HERV-W) envelope (env) at chromosome 7 is highly expressed in the placenta and possesses fusogenic activity in trophoblast development. HERV-W env has been found to be overexpressed in some cancers and immune diseases. Viral transactivators can induce the overexpression of HERV-W env in human cell lines. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is believed to be a multifunctional oncogenic protein. Here, we reported that HBx could increase the promoter activity of HERV-W env and upregulate the mRNA levels of non-spliced and spliced HERV-W env and also its protein in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Interestingly, we found that the inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) using shRNA targeting NF-κB/p65 or PDTC (an inhibitor of NF-κB) could attenuate the upregulation of HERV-W env induced by HBx. These suggested that HBx might upregulate the expression of HERV-W env through NF-κB in HepG2 cells. This study might provide a new insight in HBV-associated liver diseases including HCC.
