A neoteric approach for the electrochemical analysis of brucine in biological environment has been developed. The glassy carbon electrode modified with single walled carbon nanotubes and nafion composite film is delineated for the first time to determine brucine employing square wave voltammetry. The quantification of brucine at physiological pH 7.2 manifests remarkable performance at the developed biosensor. The effect of several operational parameters has been studied in the present investigation. Under optimized conditions, a dynamic linear range from 1nM to 8µM with a high sensitivity of 340.8µAµM-1 and limit of detection corresponding to 0.11nM was achieved. The interfering effect of some coexisting metabolites on the current response of brucine has been reported. The method was successfully applied for the detection of brucine in traditional pharmaceutical formulations. The biological relevance of the present method has been demonstrated by the analysis of the alkaloid in human serum and urine samples. The analytical utility was further assessed by the selective determination of brucine in Strychnos nux-vomica seeds exhibiting considerable potential as a diagnostic tool.
