Background & aim:The need for a subclassification of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) intermediate-stage (BCLC B) has arisen because of its diversity. We evaluated the prognostic capability of the BCLC B subclassification proposed by Bolondi et al. in patients treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Furthermore, we introduce a new subclassification for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using a new parameter related to tumour burden (up-to-11 criteria).Methods:Of 3268 patients treated with TACE as first-line treatment, 821 patients with intermediate-stage HCC were included in this study.Results:According to the Bolondi subclassification, 208 (25.3%), 529 (64.5%), 43 (5.2%) and 41 (5%) patients were in B1, B2, B3 and B4 respectively. The B1, B2 and B3 subclasses in the Bolondi system showed significantly different survival between contiguous stages with median survival of 51.5, 26 and 14.8 months, respectively (both PConclusions:Our new BCLC B substaging system, with up-to-11 criteria and Child-Pugh class as main parameters, has excellent discriminatory power to subclassify TACE-treated patients into three prognostic substages.
Barcelona clinic liver cancer classification; Barcelona clinic liver cancer stage B subclassification; hepatocellular carcinoma; transarterial chemoembolization.
