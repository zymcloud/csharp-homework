Background:Metastatic cardiac tumors may cause different symptoms including angina, symptoms of heart failure and/or arrhythmia. In patients with concomitant coronary artery disease, it may be difficult to distinguish between angina caused by metastases to the heart, for example, by stealing perfusion from the coronary arteries, and angina caused by coronary stenosis. Identifying the origin of the symptoms is, however, essential for designing appropriate surgical strategies.Case presentation:A 69-year-old male with multifocal recurrence of a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presented with increasing ventricular arrhythmia and angina several weeks after posterior myocardial infarction and PCI of the RCA culprit lesion during which two further lesions present in the distal RCX and a posterolateral branch, and a chronically occluded LAD had not been addressed. MRI showed a large metastatic tumor infiltrating the walls of both ventricles as well as the interventricular septum. His debilitating symptoms were attributed to steal phenomena and/or perivascular compression caused by the metastatic tumor rather than the remaining coronary lesions, and he was offered a restrictive surgical approach consisting of debulking of the metastasis with an option for subsequent coronary intervention. The palliative surgical procedure resulted in a reduction of the tumor mass by half and sufficiently reduced the patient's symptoms so that further coronary intervention was not required.Conclusions:Palliative surgery for metastases to the heart may benefit patients, provided that the origin of symptoms is identified correctly. It goes without saying that in a palliative setting, surgery should be limited to treating symptoms rather than performing extensive procedures addressing, for example, coronary artery or valve disease. Interventional cardiac procedures addressing not only CAD but also valve disease may supplement palliative tumor surgery.
