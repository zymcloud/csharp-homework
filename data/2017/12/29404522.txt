There are few effective therapies for unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent data have demonstrated efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in this difficult to treat disease; however, clinical experience is limited. We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma displaying pseudoprogression followed by a late response with novel magnetic resonance imaging features following treatment with the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 agent pembrolizumab. (Hepatology Communications 2018;2:148-151).
