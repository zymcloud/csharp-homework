The leaf of Aurea helianthus (A. helianthus Jinhuakui) is popularly used in China traditional medicine, however, scientific evidence on its antioxidant properties rarely studied. In this study, biological activities of A. helianthus leave's 80% ethanol extract (AHL) were investigated. The measured total polyphenol and flavonoid content of AHL was 184.24 ± 5.01 mg GAE/g and 102.53 ± 0.98 mg NAR/g. AHL showed the highest α, α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activities of 98.30 ± 0.18% at 1000 µg/mL. DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities significantly increased in a AHL concentration-dependent manner. AHL treatment significantly suppressed the generation of pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO), in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. AHL demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory activity that reduced NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. To test the potential protective effect of AHL, the antioxidant capacity, on the cell growth, viability of a human hepatoma cell (HepG2) and Raw 264.7 cell were investigated. AHL also enhanced cytotoxicity on the proliferation of HepG2 cells and was capable of inhibiting 56% against LPS at 400 µg/mL. The results of this study the potential of AHL as an excellent antioxidant substance for inhibiting inflammatory mediators. Therefore, AHL may be used as a therapeutic approach to various inflammatory diseases.
