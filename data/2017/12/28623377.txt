The terms composite and collision tumors have been used interchangeably throughout radiological literature. Both composite and collision tumors involve two morphologically and immunohistochemically distinct neoplasms coexisting within a single organ. However, collision tumors lack the histological cellular intermingling seen in composite tumors. Composite tumors often arise from a common driver mutation that induces a divergent histology from a common neoplastic source while collision tumors may arise from coincidental neoplastic change. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of abdominal composite and collision tumors by discussing hallmark radiographic and pathological presentations of rare hepatic, renal, and adrenal case studies. A better understanding of the presentation of each lesion is imperative for proper recognition, diagnosis, and management of these unique tumor presentations.
