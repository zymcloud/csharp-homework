Cytokine-induced killer cells (CIKs) adoptive immunotherapy for efficient antitumor ability is used clinically, but details regarding the proteins associated with CIK activity remain unclear. In the current study, the cytotoxicity of CIKs on hepatoma was identified to be significantly downregulated by 1.61-fold following gentamincin treatment. Further research revealed that a differentially expressed protein (P43) was significantly downregulated by 1.22-fold using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. Of these, the P43 was identified as human haptoglobin using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Western blotting demonstrated that the haptoglobin specifically reacted with rabbit anti-human-haptoglobin. Furthermore, western blotting results verified that the haptoglobin was significantly downregulated by 1.17-fold compared with the control group. In addition, the expression of haptoglobin mRNA was significantly downregulated by 1.73-fold following gentamincin treatment. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of haptoglobin protein was associated with the activity of CIKs, and the results will be beneficial to the further investigation of CIK activity-enhancement mechanism.
