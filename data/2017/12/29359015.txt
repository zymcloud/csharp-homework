Aim:To characterize the survival of cirrhotic patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to ascertain the factors predicting the achievement of disease control (DC).Methods:The cirrhotic patients with BCLC stage C HCC evaluated by the Hepatocatt multidisciplinary group were subjected to the investigation. Demographic, clinical and tumor features, along with the best tumor response and overall survival were recorded.Results:One hundred and ten BCLC stage C patients were included in the analysis; the median overall survival was 13.4 mo (95%CI: 10.6-17.0). Only alphafetoprotein (AFP) serum level > 200 ng/mL and DC could independently predict survival but in a time dependent manner, the former was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality within the first 6 mo of follow-up (HR = 5.073, 95%CI: 2.159-11.916, P = 0.0002), whereas the latter showed a protective effect against death after one year (HR = 0.110, 95%CI: 0.038-0.314, P < 0.0001). Only patients showing microvascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread recorded lower chances of achieving DC (OR = 0.263, 95%CI: 0.111-0.622, P = 0.002).Conclusion:The BCLC stage C HCC includes a wide heterogeneous group of cirrhotic patients suitable for potentially curative treatments. The reverse and time dependent effect of AFP serum level and DC on patients' survival confers them as useful predictive tools for treatment management and clinical decisions.
