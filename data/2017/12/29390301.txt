Rationale:Co-occurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in the same thyroid gland with liver metastasis is a rare condition. To our knowledge, the utility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to diagnose it is much less.Patient concerns:A 33-year-old female was referred to our hospital due to the increase in plasma calcitonin concentration and carcino-embryonic antigen 12 months after her total thyroidectomy. To find metastasis, she received laboratory tests, gray-scale US, and CEUS. In our paper, ethical approval was not necessary, as this article is a case report, which is based on the clinical information of the patient. Because our case does not refer to the patient's privacy, informed consent is not necessary.Diagnoses:Gray-scale abdominal ultrasound image demonstrated a mildly hyperechoic nodule in the liver. In CEUS, the nodules were hyperenhanced in the arterial phase. In the late arterial phase, the enhancement was washed out quickly. The nodules presented hypoenhancement in the portal and parenchymal phase, which conformed to the hepatic metastasis.Interventions:The patient received thyroid and liver surgery.Outcomes:She was free of disease for 10 months at the time of this report.Lessons:In this case, liver metastases from MTC can be detected and characterized reliably as hypoenhancing lesions during the portal venous and late phases of CEUS, washing out starts early, and is marked. We suspect MTC is a kind of tumor that tends to have rich blood supply and consider contrast-enhanced ultrasound as a suitable method for the follow-up of patients with MTC.
