Background:Drug resistance is a major concern in the current chemotherapeutic approaches and the combination with natural compounds may enhance the cytotoxic effects of the anticancer drugs. Therefore, this study evaluated the cytotoxicity of crude ethyl extracts of six marine-derived fungi - Neosartorya tsunodae KUFC 9213 (E1), Neosartorya laciniosa KUFC 7896 (E2), Neosartorya fischeri KUFC 6344 (E3), Aspergillus similanensis KUFA 0013 (E4), Neosartorya paulistensis KUFC 7894 (E5), and Talaromyces trachyspermum KUFC 0021 (E6) - when combined with doxorubicin (Dox), in seven human cancer cell lines.Materials and methods:The antiproliferative activity was primarily assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.Results:Two extracts, E1 and E2, demonstrated a significant enhancement of Dox's cytotoxicity in nonsmall cell lung cancer A549 cells. Accumulation of Dox in the nuclei increased when A549 cells were treated in combination with extracts E1 and E2, with induction of cell death observed by the nuclear condensation assay. The combination of E2 with Dox increased the DNA damage as detected by the comet assay. Ultrastructural observations by transmission electron microscopy suggest an autophagic cell death due to an increase of autophagic vesicles, namely with the combination of Dox with E1 and E2.Conclusion:These findings led to the conclusion that the fungal extracts E1 and E2 potentiate the anticancer action of Dox, through nuclear accumulation of Dox with induction of cell death mainly by cytotoxic autophagy.Summary:Fungal extracts increase the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin (Dox) in lung cancer cellsNuclear accumulation of Dox, DNA damage, and cell death as a mechanism of actionFungal extracts may potentiate the anticancer activity of conventional drugs.Abbreviations Used: A375: Human malignant melanoma cell line, A549: Human non small lung cancer cell line, DAPI: 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole, DMEM: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, DMSO: Dimethylsulfoxide, Dox: Doxorubicin, DSBs: DNA double-strand breaks, E1: Neosartorya tsunodae KUFC 9213, E2: Neosartorya laciniosa KUFC 7896, E3: Neosartorya fischeri KUFC 6344, E4: Aspergillus similanensis KUFA 0013, E5: Neosartorya paulistensis KUFC 7894, E6: Talaromyces trachyspermum KUFC 0021, FBS: Fetal bovine serum, HCT116: Human colorectal carcinoma cell line, HEPES: (N-[2-hydroxyethyl] piperazine-N'- [2-ethane-sulfonic acid]), HepG2: Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HT29: Human Caucasian colon adenocarcinoma Grade II cell line, IC50: Concentration of the extract or Dox that inhibits cell viability by 50%, LRP: Lung resistance-related protein, MCF7: Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, MEM: Minimum Essential Medium Eagle, MRPs: Multidrug resistance-associated proteins, MTT: 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, PBS: Phosphate-buffered saline, NSCLC: Nonsmall cell lung cancer, P-gp: P-glycoprotein, ROS: Reactive oxygen species, RPMI: Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium, TEM: Transmission electron microscopy, U251: Human glioblastoma astrocytoma cell line.
