Delisheng is a widely used antineoplastic agent in China. Although previous studies revealed that Delisheng exhibits numerous pharmacological effects including the inhibition of cancer cell differentiation and enhancement of immune function with the lowest toxicity, the precise anticancer mechanisms of Delisheng in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells remains largely unknown. The present study investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the anticancer properties of Delisheng on Hep3B cells. Delisheng demonstrated a strong anti-proliferation effect on Hep3B cells compared with normal liver HL-7702 cells, as detected by MTT assays. In addition, Delisheng arrested the cells in G/G1 phase. Furthermore, it exhibited a pro-apoptotic effect on Hep3B cells, as detected by ï¬‚ow cytometry. When exposed to Delisheng, Hep3B cells demonstrated decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and osteopontin (OPN) and increased endostatin (ES) protein expressions, as detected using immunocytochemistry staining and western blotting. These data suggest that Delisheng induces antiproliferation and apoptosis of Hep3B cells via modulation of VEGF, OPN and ES protein expression. It is hypothesized that Delisheng may be used as a novel anticancer therapeutic in HCC.
