Background/aim:There is no clear consensus on the type of adjuvant therapy that should be used for patients with extrahepatic bile duct cancer.Patients and methods:Two hundred and seventy-one patients that had undergone surgical resection for extrahepatic bile duct cancer composed the study cohort. Demographics, treatments, and relationships between the potential prognostic factors and survival rates were analyzed.Results:The overall 3-year and 5-year survival rates for post-surgery extrahepatic bile duct cancer patients were 49.0% and 35.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that regional lymph node metastasis was an independent negative prognostic factor. We observed a significant correlation between node-positive extrahepatic bile duct cancer and postoperative local recurrence, liver metastasis, peritoneal dissemination, and post-surgery lymph node metastasis. Adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy showed a favorable hazard ratio in patients with lymph node metastases or positive vascular invasion.Conclusion:We recommend the use of adjuvant S-1 therapy in patients with lymph node metastases or microvascular invasion.
