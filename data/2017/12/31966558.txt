Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevailing malignancies, and the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC tumorigenesis remain to be further clarified. The aim of our present study was to determine the biological functions and clinical significance of SATB2 in HCC. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect SATB2 mRNA expression in HCC tissues and cells. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were investigated by MTT assay and transwell assay. Western blotting was performed to evaluate the protein expression levels. Tumor xenografts were established to explore the effects of SATB2 on HCC tumor growth in vivo. Our results indicated that SATB2 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, and its high expression was closely correlated with aggressive clinical phenotypes and poor prognosis of HCC patients. Through gain- and loss-of function experiments, we found that SATB2 significantly promoted HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and HCC tumorigenicity in vivo. Furthermore, SATB2 was identified as an important regulator of stem-like properties and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells. In summary, our results suggested that SATB2 is a crucial upregulator of HCC, and SATB2 might be a potential prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for HCC.
