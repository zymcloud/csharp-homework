Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive cholestatic liver disease characterized by the presence of highly specific antimitochondrial antibodies, portal inflammation and lymphocyte-dominated destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts, which leads to cirrhosis. While its pathogenesis remains unclear, PBC that shows histological progression to fibrosis carries a high risk of carcinogenesis; the same is true of viral liver diseases. In patients with PBC, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare; the development of combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocellular carcinoma (cHCC-CCC) is extraordinary. Herein, we report a rare case of PBC metachronously complicated by cHCC-CCC and HCC, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been reported. We present a case report of a 74-year-old Japanese woman who was diagnosed as PBC in her 40's by using blood tests and was admitted to our department for further management of an asymptomatic liver mass. She had a tumor of 15 mm in size in segment 8 of the liver and underwent a partial resection of the liver. Subsequent pathological findings resulted in the diagnosis of cHCC-CCC, arising from stage 3 PBC. One year after the initial hepatectomy, a second tumor of 10 mm in diameter was found in segment 5 of the liver; a partial resection of the liver was performed. Subsequent pathological findings led to HCC diagnosis. The component of HCC in the initial tumor displayed a trabecular growth pattern while the second HCC showed a pseudoglandular growth pattern, suggesting that metachronous tumors that arise from PBC are multicentric.
