Myanmar is adjacent to India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos and China. In Myanmar, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections is 6.5% and accounts for 60% of hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV has nine genotypes that have been identified by molecular genetic analysis. HBV genotypes are associated with several clinical features. We reviewed the prevalence of HBV genotypes in Myanmar and neighboring countries. We also reviewed HBV genotypes in refugees from Myanmar. HBV subgenotype C1 is predominant in Myanmar. As HBV genotype C is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is important to screen for cirrhosis and HCC and to prevent their development in HBV-infected individuals of Myanmar.
