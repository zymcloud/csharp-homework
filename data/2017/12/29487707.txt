Accurate preoperative differentiation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the setting of cirrhotic liver is of great clinical significance because the treatment and prognosis of these entities differ markedly. Through a retrospectively research, we sought to determine the diagnostic performances of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) parameters in the differentiating of ICC and HCC. According to the results, we found that apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from mono-exponential model and true ADC (ADCslow) derived from bi-exponential model can be used to distinguish the ICC and HCC, and ADCslowentailed the higher diagnostic performance than ADC. However, pseudo-ADC (ADCfast) and perfusion fraction (f) can not be used to differentiate ICC and HCC. These results suggested that IVIM and DWI parameters can be useful in differentiating ICC and HCC and might be helpful in selecting the treatment plan and predicting prognosis.
