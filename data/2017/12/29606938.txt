The spontaneous seroclearance of hepatitis B upon development of a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare. To date, there has been one published case series reporting hepatitis B seroconversion following HCC resection. We describe two novel cases of spontaneous hepatitis B seroclearance following the development of HCC, prior to resection. Following resection, specimens were HBsAg- and HBcAg-negative in both tumor and peritumor tissues. Although the precise mechanism of this is poorly understood, nonuniform integration of hepatitis B virus DNA within the liver could lead to selective tumorigenesis of HBsAg-producing cells, explaining the observed clearance of serum HBsAg with the development of HCC.
