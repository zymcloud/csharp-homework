Aim:To evaluate whether radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or surgical resection (RES) has superior overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and Child-Pugh class A liver cirrhosis.Materials and methods:Meta-analysis was used to compare 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS and DFS between RFA and RES. Those studies meeting inclusion criteria and published prior to 1 June 2015 were included. The odds ratio (OR) was used as the treatment effect measure. A priori defined sensitivity analyses of study subgroups was performed.Results:Fifteen studies were included in this analysis. Subgroup analyses based on predetermined patient characteristics were performed to minimise bias. No difference in 1-year OS, 3-year OS, and 3-year DFS was found in analyses limited to studies where patients were equally eligible for both therapies. There was also not a significant difference in OS and DFS between RFA and RES when studies were limited to those with only solitary tumours or tumours Conclusion:The data suggest the equivalence of RFA and RES in patients with solitary tumours
