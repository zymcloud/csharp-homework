Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family members promote carcinogenesis and cancer progression. We assessed GST pi 1 (GSTP1) mRNA and protein levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using genome databases and tissue microarray (TMA) technology. We found that in cancerous tissues, GSTP1 mRNA was down-regulated in genome databases, and immunohistochemical staining of GSTP1 in 237 HCC cases varied from negative to strongly positive. GSTP1 levels correlated negatively with tumor size and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in HCC patients, and higher GSTP1 levels associated with longer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We also found that GSTP1 overexpression restrained HepG2 and Huh7 liver cancer cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. GSTP1 arrested the cell cycle at G1/S by up-regulating p21 and p27 and down-regulating p-Akt. Interrupting GSTP1 gene expression promoted liver cancer cell proliferation and increased the percentage of cells in S phase by decreasing levels of p21 and p27 and increasing p-Akt. These results suggest high GSTP1 levels provide a better prognosis through suppression of tumorigenesis in HCC.
