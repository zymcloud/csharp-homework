Objective:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to have crucial roles in the regulation of various tumors. Recently, lncRNA TCONS_00027978 (TCONS_00027978) was found to be downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims at analyzing the value of TCONS_00027978 in valuing the prognosis of HCC patients.Patients and methods:The expression of TCONS_00027978 was detected using qRT-PCR in 241 hepatocellular specimens and matched adjacent normal tissues. The association between TCONS_00027978 expression levels and clinicopathological factors was examined. Survival and Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses were performed to explore the association between TCONS_00027978 expression levels and prognosis in HCC patients.Results:We found that the TCONS_00027978 expression level was significantly decreased in HCC tissues compared with matched normal tissues (p Conclusions:Our study is the first to demonstrate the TCONS_00027978 expression as an independent prognostic factor in HCC.
