The association between serum testosterone level and liver fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is unclear. To clarify this association, we investigated the relationship between serum free testosterone concentration and markers of liver fibrosis in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus but no obvious features of alcohol consumption. This retrospective observational cross-sectional study enrolled 248 men with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The FIB-4 index was measured as a marker of liver fibrosis, and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine its association with serum free testosterone concentration. In addition, the 7S domain of type IV collagen (IV-7S) was examined in 140 of the 248 patients. The mean free testosterone concentration was 10.6 ± 6.8 pg/mL and the means of the FIB-4 index and IV-7S were 1.64 ± 1.19 and 4.02 ± 1.11 ng/mL, respectively. After adjusting for all relevant variables, serum free testosterone concentrations were inversely associated with both the FIB-4 index and IV-7S (β; -0.28, P
