The prediction of prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following partial hepatectomy is still an unresolved issue. The aim of this study is to identify the association between miRNA-29s family and the prognosis of patients with HCC in a large Asian cohort. We retrospectively reviewed 122 patients with HCC managed in our institution between 2008 and 2015. The expression of miRNA-29s was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Prognostic factors were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. For the entire cohort of 122 patients, the normalized real-time PCR results showed that miRNA-29s (miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c) were deregulated in tumor tissues as compared with corresponding nontumorous tissue samples. We then performed survival analysis to investigate the prognostic value of miRNA-29s. We found that low miR-29b was associated with a decreasing 5-year overall survival (OS) rate from 70.2% to 39.1% and low miR-29c was associated with a decreasing 5-year OS rate from 53.6% to 23.7%. We further conducted multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis adding the variable of combined low miR-29b and low miR-29c. The results demonstrated that combined low miR-29b and miR-29c was an independent prognostic factor of patients with HCC. In conclusion, we found that the miRNA-29s were down-regulated in tumor tissues as compared with corresponding nontumorous tissue samples. Combined low miR-29b and miR-29c was an independent prognostic factor of patients with HCC.
