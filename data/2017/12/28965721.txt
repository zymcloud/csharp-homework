The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) elastography with that of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography for pre-operative staging of hepatic fibrosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We prospectively enrolled 77 patients who were scheduled to undergo hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Pre-operative MRE and ARFI elastography examinations were performed on the same day, and liver stiffness/velocity values were determined. Fibrosis stage and necro-inflammatory activity of resected specimens were determined histopathologically using the METAVIR scoring system. Correlations between MRE and ARFI elastography findings and histologic findings were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Correlation of MRE was excellent and correlation of ARFI elastography was good with fibrosis stage. MRE had better diagnostic performance than ARFI elastography in estimating substantial fibrosis (F2), severe fibrosis (F3) and cirrhosis (F4). The optimal cutoff value and the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) were determined using ROC curve analysis. The highest Youden index was used as a criterion for selecting the optimal cutoff value. ROC analysis revealed that MRE discriminated advanced stages of fibrosis (F ≥ 2) well in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma at a cutoff value of 3.0 kPa with an AUROC value of 0.93, and ARFI elastography did so at a cutoff value of 1.77 m/s with an AUROC value of 0.81 for predicting advanced stages of fibrosis (F ≥ 2). In conclusion, MRE is a more accurate imaging modality than ARFI elastography in estimating advanced stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis.
