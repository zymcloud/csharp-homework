Accumulating evidence implicates innate immune activation in the pathobiology of myelodysplastic syndromes. A key myeloid-related inflammatory protein, S100A9, serves as a Toll-like receptor ligand regulating tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β production. The role of myelodysplastic syndrome-related inflammatory proteins in endogenous erythropoietin regulation and response to erythroid-stimulating agents or lenalidomide has not been investigated. The HepG2 hepatoma cell line was used to investigate in vitro erythropoietin elaboration. Serum samples collected from 311 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome were investigated (125 prior to treatment with erythroid-stimulating agents and 186 prior to lenalidomide therapy). Serum concentrations of S100A9, S100A8, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and erythropoietin were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using erythropoietin-producing HepG2 cells, we show that S100A9, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β suppress transcription and cellular elaboration of erythropoietin. Pre-incubation with lenalidomide significantly diminished suppression of erythropoietin production by S100A9 or tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, lenalidomide significantly reduced steady-state S100A9 generation (P=0.01) and lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α elaboration (P=0.002). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of serum from 316 patients with non-del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between tumor necrosis factor-α and erythropoietin concentrations (P=0.006), and between S100A9 and erythropoietin (P=0.01). Moreover, baseline serum tumor necrosis factor-α concentration was significantly higher in responders to erythroid-stimulating agents (P=0.03), whereas lenalidomide responders had significantly lower tumor necrosis factor-α and higher S100A9 serum concentrations (P=0.03). These findings suggest that S100A9 and its nuclear factor-κB transcriptional target, tumor necrosis factor-α, directly suppress erythropoietin elaboration in myelodysplastic syndromes. These cytokines may serve as rational biomarkers of response to lenalidomide and erythroid-stimulating agent treatments. Therapeutic strategies that either neutralize or suppress S100A9 may improve erythropoiesis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
