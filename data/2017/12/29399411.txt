We recently identified CXCR4 as a novel vascular marker for vessel sprouting in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. Thus, CXCR4+ endothelial cells (ECs) could serve as a potential predictor for patients who may benefit from sorafenib treatment; however, the mechanism that regulates vascular CXCR4 expression in HCC remains largely unknown. Here, we revealed a large number of monocytes/macrophages (Mo/Mϕ) to be selectively enriched in the perivascular areas of CXCR4+ vessels in HCC samples. The depletion of Mo/Mϕ with gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) or zoledronic acid (ZA) treatment significantly reduced vascular CXCR4 expression in HCC tumors. This phenomenon was also confirmed in CCR2-KO mice, which exhibited reduced infiltration of inflammatory Mo/Mϕ in tumor tissues. Mechanistic studies revealed that inflammatory cytokines derived from tumor conditioned Mo/Mϕ, especially TNF-α, could up-regulate CXCR4 expression on ECs. TNF-α-induced activation of the Raf-ERK pathway, but not Notch signaling, was responsible for the expression of CXCR4. Moreover, the combination treatment of sorafenib with ZA was associated with improved anti-tumor efficacy by significantly reducing vascular CXCR4 expression. These findings revealed that Mo/Mϕ could regulate CXCR4 expression in the tumor vasculature. Thus, the inhibition of Mo/Mϕ inflammation might enhance the treatment efficacy of sorafenib in HCC.
