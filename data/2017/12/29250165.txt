Network analysis is a useful approach in cancer biology as it provides information regarding the genes and proteins. In our previous study, a network analysis was performed on dysregulated genes in HepG2 cells, a hepatoblastoma cell line that lacks the viral infection, compared with normal hepatocytes, identifying the presence of 26 HUB genes. The present study aimed to identify whether these previously identified HUB genes participate in the network that controls the human circadian rhythms. The results of the present study demonstrated that 20/26 HUB genes were associated with the metabolic processes that control human circadian rhythms, which supports the hypothesis that a number of cancer types are dependent from circadian cycles. In addition, it was revealed that the CLOCK circadian regulator gene was associated, via cytoskeleton associated protein 5 (CKAP5), with the HUB genes of the HepG2 network, and that CKAP5 was associated with three other circadian genes (casein kinase 1ε, casein kinase 1δ and histone deacetylase 4) and 10 HepG2 genes (SH2 domain containing, ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein, aurora kinase B, cell division cycle 20, centromere protein A, inner centromere protein, mitotic arrest deficient 2 like 1, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5, SPC24 NDC80 kinetochore complex component and kinesin family member 2C). Furthermore, the genes that associate the circadian system with liver cancer were demonstrated to encode intrinsically disordered proteins. Finally, the results of the present study identified the microRNAs involved in the network formed by the overlapping of HepG2 and circadian genes.
