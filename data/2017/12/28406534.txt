Background and aim:A reliable, non-invasive biomarker for diagnosis of liver fibrosis in chronic liver disease patients is needed. The aim of this study was to assess by meta-analysis the efficacy of measuring serum levels of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein (WFA+ -M2BP), a novel and promising biomarker, for staging liver fibrosis and predicting the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and overall survival.Methods:We performed a meta-analysis using online journal database searches. We identified 39 studies, 21 of which met the criteria for meta-analysis. Sensitivity and specificity of WFA+ -M2BP for assessing liver fibrosis staging in chronic liver diseases with broad etiologies were determined. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were also used for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma development and overall survival.Results:With WFA+ -M2BP, the sensitivity and specificity for predicting significant fibrosis (≥ F2), advanced fibrosis (≥ F3), and liver cirrhosis (= F4) were 0.690 and 0.778, 0.764 and 0.758, and 0.818 and 0.839, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C virus were mostly higher than those in overall patients. However, sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B virus were lower than those in overall patients. Overall, hazard ratios for development of hepatocellular carcinoma and overall survival were 5.946 and 1.068, respectively.Conclusions:These results suggest that serum WFA+ -M2BP is a reliable predictor for liver fibrosis staging and a good substitute for liver biopsy. It is also useful for predicting both hepatocellular carcinoma development and overall survival.
