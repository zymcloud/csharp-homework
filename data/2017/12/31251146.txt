In this study, biotin grafted pullulan acetate (Bio-PA) copolymer were synthesized and Bio-PA nanoparticles (Bio-PA NPs) were prepared to be applied as a targeted and prolonged delivery system for anticancer drugs. Bio-PA NPs were fabricated by two strategies, dialysis method and solvent diffusion method. Bio-PA NPs were spherical shaped and had a smaller size and higher positive zeta potential which were fabricated by dialysis method. And the content of biotin on the surface of Bio-PA NPs prepared by dialysis was higher than that of by solvent diffusion method. Epirubicin (EPI), as a model drug, was encapsulated into Bio-PA NPs by dialysis method with a drug encapsulation efficiency of 79.8Â±3.0%. To study the effect of various cell uptake inhibitors on the uptake of Bio-PA NPs, human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2), human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) and human emborynic kidney cells (293T) were preincubated with the inhibitors individually. The results showed that the clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the cell macropinocytosis were involved in the cellular internalizations of Bio-PA NPs in three cells, but the biotin mediated endocytosis was only observed in the biotin-overexpressed HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. After intravenous injection to HepG2-bearing nude mice, Bio-PA NPs achieved the enhanced antitumor effects and the increased distributions in the tumor. In summary, Bio-PA NPs, being used as a novel carrier for EPI, displayed significantly enhanced anticancer activities, indicating their potential applications in cancer chemotherapy.
