Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a pancreatic mass in a 67-year-old man with diabetes mellitus. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration led to the histological diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma. The clinical stage was determined to be IVb based on findings of multiple metastatic lesions in the liver and lymph nodes, as well as splenic vein infiltration. Because the patient was not a surgical candidate, he underwent chemotherapy with modified FOLFIRINOX. In the absence of any severe adverse events, 12 courses of chemotherapy were delivered, resulting in marked shrinkage of both the primary and metastatic lesions. The outcome was judged to be a partial response, which was maintained even 9 months from the introduction of the chemotherapy. The results of this case suggest that modified FOLFIRINOX is safe and effective in the treatment of pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma.
