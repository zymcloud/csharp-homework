Background:Reflux esophagitis is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome; however, the relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and reflux esophagitis is unclear.Aim:We examined the association between NAFLD and the development of reflux esophagitis.Methods:Our cohort consisted of 117,377 Korean adults without reflux esophagitis at baseline who underwent a health checkup program including upper endoscopy between 2002 and 2014 and were followed annually or biennially until December 2014. NAFLD was defined as hepatic steatosis on ultrasonography in the absence of excessive alcohol use or any other identifiable cause.Results:Over 520,843.2 person-years of follow-up, 22,500 participants developed reflux esophagitis (incidence density, 43.2 per 1000 person-years). In models adjusted for age and sex, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for incident reflux esophagitis in subjects with NAFLD compared to those without was 1.16 (1.13-1.20). After further adjustment for confounders of center, year of visit, smoking status, alcohol intake, regular exercise, education level, and body mass index, the association between NAFLD and incident reflux esophagitis was attenuated, but remained significant (aHR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10).Conclusions:In this large cohort of Korean men and women, participants with NAFLD exhibited increased incidence of reflux esophagitis independent of possible confounders, suggesting that NAFLD contributes to the development of reflux esophagitis.
