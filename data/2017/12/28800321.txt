Background and objective:The association of chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin and survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving adjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain. We sought to explore the prognostic value of chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin in CRC receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and the best cut point affecting prognosis.Methods:Three hundred and twenty stage II and III CRC patients receiving adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy from March 2003 to March 2012 were enrolled. The associations between chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin (the absolute levels of post-chemotherapy) or chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin change (change between the pre- and post-chemotherapy hemoglobins) and disease free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) of CRC, and the best cut point were investigated.Results:Log rank test showed the best cut points for chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin and chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin change were respectively 90 g/L, 30 g/L. Cox regression model showed chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin < 90 g/L was the independent prognostic factor for DFS (HR, 2.221; 95% CI = 1.157-4.262), OS (HR, 2.058; 95% CI = 1.009-4.197), respectively, but no association of chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin change â©¾ 30g/L and DFS (HR, 2.063; 95% CI = 0.929-4.583), OS (HR, 1.386; 95% CI = 0.553-3.471) was found.Conclusions:Chemotherapy-associated hemoglobin < 90 g/L has a significant prognostic value in CRC receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, which is a significant biomarker in the individualized management and may suggest the simple indication for the treatment of anemia in adjuvant chemotherapy in CRC.
