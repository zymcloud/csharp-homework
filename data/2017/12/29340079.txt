Background:Angiogenesis plays a critical role in tumor growth and metastasis. Angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (AGGF1) has been recently identified as a novel initiator of angiogenesis. However, the function and the prognostic values of AGGF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma remain poorly understood. Our aim is to provide more information to assist design the angiogenesis therapy that targets AGGF1 in HCC.Results:AGGF1-positive frequency in HCC tissues was significantly higher than in peritumor tissues. The high expression of AGGF1 expression in HCC tissue was well associated with the increased expression of VEGF and the high microvessel density (MVD). AGGF1 expression predicts a poor prognosis and AGGF1 was an independent prognostic factor for DFS.Methods:The expression levels of AGGF1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) were identified by immunohistochemistry in 79 HCC tumor tissues and 24 corresponding peritumor tissues. The expression level of AGGF1 and MVD were quantified by counting the positively stained endothelial cells in the HCC and the peritumor tissue on the immunohistochemically stained tissue slides. The prognostic value of AGGF1 was evaluated by survival analysis.Conclusions:Our study shows that AGGF1 is identified as the independent prognostic factor for the disease-free survival (DFS) of patients after the surgical resection. contribute to tumor angiogenesis in HCC, which indicates that AGGF1 may be a new potential therapeutic target for anti-angiogenesis treatment for patients with HCC.
