There is accumulating evidence that miRNA might serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers for various types of cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of malignant lesion but the significance of miRNAs in HCC remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to establish the diagnostic value of miR-101-3p/5p in HCC and then further investigate the prospective molecular mechanism via a bioinformatic analysis. First, the miR-101 expression profiles and parallel clinical parameters from 362 HCC patients and 50 adjacent non-HCC tissue samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Second, we aggregated all miR-101-3p/5p expression profiles collected from published literature and the Gene Expression Omnibus and TCGA databases. Subsequently, target genes of miR-101-3p and miR-101-5p were predicted by using the miRWalk database and then overlapped with the differentially expressed genes of HCC identified by natural language processing. Finally, bioinformatic analyses were conducted with the overlapping genes. The level of miR-101 was significantly lower in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-HCC tissues (P < 0.001), and the area under the curve of the low miR-101 level for HCC diagnosis was 0.925 (P < 0.001). The pooled summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) of miR-101-3p was 0.86, and the combined SROC curve of miR-101-5p was 0.80. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the target genes of both miR-101-3p and miR-101-5p are involved in several pathways that are associated with HCC. The hub genes for miR-101-3p and miR-101-5p were also found. Our results suggested that both miR-101-3p and miR-101-5p might be potential diagnostic markers in HCC, and that they exert their functions via targeting various prospective genes in the same pathways.
