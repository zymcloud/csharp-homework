Toxicity assessment of nitration/ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis (nitration/UF/RO) project, which has recently been widely used as an efficient process with applications in practical leachate treatment, was very limited. In the present study, DNA damage of leachates was investigated before and after the nitration/UF/RO process by a battery of assays with human hepatoma cells. Methyletrazolium assay showed a high cytotoxicity of 97.1% after being exposed to the highest concentration of raw leachate for 24 h, and a cytotoxicity of 26% in effluent at a concentration of 30% (v/v). Both comet assay (24 h) and γH2AX flow cytometer assay (3 h) showed increased levels of DNA damage in cells exposed to raw leachate and after nitration/UF-treated leachate followed by a significant increase of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity. However, the effluent after nitration/UF/RO treatment showed no significant difference compared to negative control for γH2AX flow cytometer assay but slight DNA damage at concentrations of 20% and 30% (v/v) as well as increase of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase. Analysis showed that nitration/UF/RO process exhibited high removal of physicochemical indexes and significant reduction of toxic and genotoxic effects of leachate, but still demands an improvement to reduce all possible negative risks to the environment and humans.
