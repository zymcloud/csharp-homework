Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers types. Niu-Huang-Shen (NHS), a Chinese medicine, has been reported to exert antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and vasodilatation effects. However, whether NHS has inhibitory effects on HCC cell phenotypes has remained elusive. In the present study, Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Transwell assays were used to evaluate the effect of NHS on cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The results indicated that NHS suppressed cell proliferation and invasion, inhibited cell apoptosis, and induced cell cycle arrest. In addition, NHS significantly suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP). It was concluded that NHS downregulated YAP expression and inhibited the Hippo signaling pathway as well as HCC cell growth and invasion. NHS may be a novel potential therapeutic for HCC patients.
