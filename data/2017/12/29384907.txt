Background:There has always been a controversy on the hepatectomy for huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, we aim to explore the hepatectomy efficacy of huge HCC and its risk factors.Methods:A systematic research was performed using PubMed, MedLine, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library from their establishment to August 2017. The major endpoints were overall survival (OS) rate and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, and the secondary ones were the morbidity of complications and mortality of hepatectomy.Results:About 13 studies with a total of 7609 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The hepatectomy efficacy of huge HCC was inferior to non-huge HCC both in OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.90-2.50, P Conclusion:The hepatectomy efficacy of huge HCC was inferior to non-huge HCC, but its survival benefits and feasibility were confirmed in this meta-analysis. In addition, higher level of AFP, positive margin, lower clinical or pathological stage, incomplete capsule, incorporate satellite metastasis and MVI were significantly correlated with poor OS.
