It has been reported that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the relationship between the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and EMT of HCC was not fully elucidated. In the present work, we found that the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail1, Snail2, and Twist1 was positively associated with IGF-1R expression, while E-cadherin expression was negatively associated with IGF-1 expression in human HCC samples. Furthermore, we observed that IGF-1 up-regulated the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail1, Snail2 and Twist1, and down-regulated the expression of E-cadherin. In addition, Stat5 was induced in IGF-1-treated HepG2 and Hep3B cells, and Stat5 inhibition or siRNA significantly affected IGF-1-induced EMT in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. In conclusion, IGF-1 induces EMT of HCC via Stat5 signaling pathway. Thus, IGF-1/Stat5 can be recommended as a potential and novel therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.
