Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes nonalcoholic simple fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer and is the most common liver disease in the world. The complex pathogenesis of NAFLD is a major concern among researchers. CD36 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that takes up fatty acid and binds to oxidized low-density lipoprotein in the liver, and therefore, it is involved in the development and progression of NAFLD. With reference to the latest research findings, this article reviews the association between CD36 and NAFLD and the role of CD36.
