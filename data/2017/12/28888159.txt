In recent years, naturally occurring phytochemicals with antioxidant capacity have generated surmount interest in their therapeutic usage against a wide range of pathological and toxicological conditions. The present study was designed to evaluate potential of É£-oryzanol (OZ), a bio-active natural antioxidant against hepatocellular carcinoma effect of the carcinogen N-nitrosodiethylamine in Balb/c mice. OZ inhibited the proliferation of Hep-3B cell line in concentration dependent manner. Administration of OZ to N-nitrosodiethylamine induced Balb/c mice for 16 and 32 weeks showed reduction in levels of liver injury markers, restored the levels of liver tumor markers, suppressed the hepatic nodular incidence and multiplicity, and favorably modulated the liver antioxidant status in a time dependent manner. Histologically, no obvious signs of neoplasia in the liver tissues were observed in OZ supplemented rats with N-nitrosodiethylamine induced liver tumerogenesis. OZ was found to be effective for reduction of N-nitrosodiethylamine induced hepatocellular carcinoma.
