Introduction:The aim of this study was to determine the impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) on primary liver cancer (PLC) in China north areas.Methods:A total of 2172 histologically confirmed PLC patients attending the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences during the period January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2014 were enrolled. Details of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies against HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), and antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) status were recorded. Sequencing of the HBV PreS-S gene and the C/E1 and NS5B fragments of HCV was performed and the genotypes were analyzed for some of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:Among the 2172 histologically confirmed PLC cases, 1823 (83.9%) had HCC and 238 (11.0%) had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Among HCC cases, HBV infection alone, indicated by HBsAg-neg/pos+anti-HBc-pos, was found in 1567 (86.0%) cases; of these, 18.2% (331/1823) were HBsAg-neg+anti-HBc-pos. Serum HBV-DNA was detectable in 70% of HBsAg-neg+anti-HBc-pos HCC cases. The dominant HBV genotype was HBV-C2 (94.4%). HCV infection alone, indicated by anti-HCV-pos, was found in 2.5% (46/1823) of cases; HCV-1b (72.1%) was the dominant genotype. HBV+HCV co-infection markers were found in 6.7% (122/1823) of cases. Only 88 (4.8%) cases had no HBV and no HCV markers. Among the 238 iCCA cases, 54 (22.7%) were HBsAg-pos+anti-HBc-pos; none was anti-HCV-pos alone.Conclusions:HBV remains the major contributor to PLC in China north areas Individuals with occult HBV infection should not be ignored in liver cancer screening.
