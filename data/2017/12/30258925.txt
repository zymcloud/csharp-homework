Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common lethal types of tumor all over the world. The lethality of HCC accounts for many reasons. One of them, the lack of reliable diagnostic markers at the early stage, in this context, serum miRNAs became promising diagnostic biomarkers. Herein, we aimed to identify the predictive value of two miRNAs (miR-122 and miR-224) in plasma of patients with HCC preceded by chronic HCV infection. Taqman miRNA assays specific for hsa-miR-122 and hsa-miR-224 were used to assess the expression levels of the chosen miRNAs in plasma samples collected from three groups; 40 patients with HCC related to HCV, 40 with CHC patients and 20 healthy volunteers. This study revealed that the mean plasma values of miRNA-122 were significantly lower among HCC group when compared to CHC and control groups (P 1.2 (RQ) and (AUC = 0.93, P P = 0.06). In conclusion, the expression plasma of miR-122 and miR-224 could be used as noninvasive biomarkers for the early prediction of developing HCC at the early stage.
