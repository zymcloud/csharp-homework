Pancreatic cancer has poor prognosis because of its rapid progression and treatment resistance. Based on the results of the Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial (MPACT), a combination regimen of gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel is currently used as standard therapy for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, because studies in Asian populations are lacking, we investigated the treatment efficacy and safety of this combination therapy in Korean population. Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (n=81) treated with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (1,000 and 125 mg/m2, respectively) as the first-line chemotherapy from January 2016 were identified using the Severance Hospital Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Registry. Treatment efficacy and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 10.7 months (range, 1.5-23.3 months). Median overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rates were 12.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.7-not estimable), 8.4 months (95% CI, 5.0-11.8), and 46.9%, respectively. The incidence of grade ≥3 neurotoxicity and neutropenia were 18.5% and 46.9%, respectively. Febrile neutropenia and grade ≥3 gastrointestinal AEs occurred in 13 (16.0%) and 16 (19.8%) patients, respectively. Dose reductions because of AEs were required in 60.5% of patients. The combination of gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel is an effective anti-cancer regimen in Korean population of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, careful monitoring and management are required because of occurrence of treatment-related AEs.
