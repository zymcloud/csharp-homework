Recent evidence suggests that m6A modifications regulate the progressions of several types of tumors. YTHDF2, an m6A reader, has been implicated in the regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-493-3p has been defined as tumor suppressor that inhibits the progressions of several types of cancers. However, the functions and mechanisms of YTHDF2 and the indirect m6A regulated role of miR-493-3p in prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be elusive. In this study, immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) were performed to find YTHDF2 was frequently upregulated but miR-493-3p was downregulated in both PCa tissues and cell lines (DU-145 and PC3) which was negatively correlated with each other. Knock down of YTHDF2 significantly elevated m6A levels, and inhibited the cell proliferation and migration of DU-145 and PC3 cell lines. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed YTHDF2 as the direct target of miR-493-3p. In addition, forced expression of miR-493-3p consistently elevated the m6A levels and inhibited proliferation and migration with the knock down of YTHDF2. In contrast, overexpression of YTHDF2 and inhibition of miR-493-3p conversely reduced m6A levels. Additionally, the rescue experiments revealed that inhibition of miR-493-3p abrogated the suppression of proliferation and migration induced by si-YTHDF2. To conclude, YTHDF2 and miR-493-3p, as two crucial m6A regulators, are involved in the progression of PCa by indirectly modulating m6A levels. In view of these promising results, YTHDF2 and miR-493-3p may provide new insights into the carcinogenesis and new potential therapeutic targets for PCa.
