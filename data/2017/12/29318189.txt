Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical (including VEGF, Akt, HSP70, and HSP20 expression) factors that affect the overall and disease-free survival of HCC patients following surgical resection.Methods:234 patients with HCC following surgical resection were enrolled. Clinicopathological and survival data were analyzed, and immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue microarray sections using the anti-VEGF, anti-Akt, anti-HSP70, and anti-HSP27 antibodies.Results:The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 86.5 and 81.54%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that VEGF expression (P = 0.017, HR = 2.573) and T stage (P 400 ng/mL, capsule invasion, and microvascular invasion.Conclusion:VEGF overexpression was associated with capsule invasion, microvascular invasion, and a poor overall survival rate.
