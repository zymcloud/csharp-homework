Background:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The significance of pre-treatment AFP (pt-AFP) in non-viral HCC (nvHCC) is not clear.Methods:Patients with nvHCC, referred to a Hepatobiliary Clinic from September 2011-2015 were screened. HCC was diagnosed using American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines, and TNM staged. nvHCC was diagnosed when HBsAg and anti-HCVAb was negative. Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were calculated. AFP level was evaluated against patient characteristics, tumour characteristics and survival.Results:Three hundred eighty-nine patients with nvHCC [age 64(12-88) years; 344(88.4%) males] were screened. Median AFP was 25.46 ng/ml (1.16-100,000). 41.2% (n = 160) Of patients had normal AFP level. 22.9% (n = 89) had AFP over 400 ng/ml. Female gender (P Conclusion:Pre treatment AFP has a limited value In diagnosing nvHCC, Having a AFP value over 400 ng/ml was associated with aggressive tumour behaviour and poor prognosis.
