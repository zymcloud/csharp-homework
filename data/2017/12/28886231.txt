Early detection of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions can improve longterm patient survival. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) was performed in diagnosing small HCCs measuring up to 2 cm (≤2 cm). Two investigators searched multiple databases for studies in which the performances of either Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI or MDCT were reported with sufficient data to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables for diagnosing HCCs up to 2 cm on a per-lesion or per-patient level. Diagnostic performances were quantitatively pooled by a bivariate random-effect model with further meta-regression and subgroup analyses. A total of 27 studies (14 on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, 9 on MDCT, and 4 on both) were included, enrolling a total of 1735 patients on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and 1781 patients on MDCT. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI demonstrated significantly higher overall sensitivity than did MDCT (0.96 versus 0.65; P 0.05). Area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.97 with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and 0.85 with MDCT. Regarding Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, sensitivity was significantly higher for studies from non-Asian countries than Asian countries (0.96 versus 0.93; P
