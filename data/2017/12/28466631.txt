Introduction:The latest studies have shown that the long non-coding RNAs seemed to be qualified markers of cancer. So we sought to assess the prognostic value of SNHG and UCA1 as predictive markers of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Evidence acquisition:Relevant literatures were collected in PubMed and Embase. Measuring the expression of specific SNHG or UCA1 in tissue or serum and studying their association with survival outcome. Survival outcome was further explored considering the hazard ratio (HR) with confidence interval (CI).Evidence synthesis:We found that patients with higher expression of pooled SNHG/UCA1 had significant poor overall survival (HR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.05-2.89), and also significant for only SNHG (HR 2.05; 95% CI: 1.06-3.96). Over-expression of UCA1 may predict meaningless overall survival (HR 1.31; 95% CI: 0.57-3.03; P=0.53).Conclusions:Our meta-analysis demonstrated that SNHG and UCA1 may serve as prognostic biomarkers for HCC prognosis.
