Rationale and objectives:This study aimed to investigate the potential of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging features to differentiate between mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic livers.Materials and methods:This study, performed between 2001 and 2013, included 64 baseline magnetic resonance imaging examinations with pathohistologically proven liver cirrhosis, presenting with either ICC (n = 32) or HCC (n = 32) tumors. To distinguish ICC form HCC tumors, 20 qualitative single-lesion descriptors were evaluated by two readers, in consensus, and statistically classified using the chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) methodology. Diagnostic performance was assessed by a receiver operating characteristic analysis.Results:The CHAID algorithm identified three independent categorical lesion descriptors, including (1) liver capsular retraction; (2) progressive or persistent enhancement pattern or wash-out on the T1-weighted delayed phase; and (3) signal intensity appearance on T2-weighted images that could help to reliably differentiate ICC from HCC, which resulted in an AUC of 0.807, and a sensitivity and specificity of 68.8 and 90.6 (95% confidence interval 75.0-98.0), respectively.Conclusions:The proposed CHAID algorithm provides a simple and robust step-by-step classification tool for a reliable and solid differentiation between ICC and HCC tumors in cirrhotic livers.
