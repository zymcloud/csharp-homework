Background:Antiviral treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic HBV infection is still controversial. We assessed whether antiviral treatment reduces the risk of liver disease progression in these patients.Methods:This study included consecutive patients in 8 large-volume hospitals in Korea who tested positive for HBeAg and had an HBV DNA level of >20000 IU/mL, an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of Results:A total of 484 patients were included: 87 were in the antiviral treatment group, and 397 were in the control group. Baseline liver function was significantly more favorable for the control group. After matching for propensity score to overcome those differences, the antiviral treatment group had a significantly reduced risk for HCC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.234; log-rank P = .046) and cirrhosis (HR, 0.235; log-rank P = .015), compared with the control group. After balancing the baseline characteristics by using inverse probability weighting, antiviral therapy significantly decreased the risk of HCC (HR, 0.189; log-rank P = .004) and cirrhosis (HR, 0.347; log-rank P = .036).Conclusion:Antiviral therapy for patients with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection and have a high HBV load reduces the risk of HCC, even if the ALT level is below the upper limit of normal.
