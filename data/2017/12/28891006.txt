Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with rising incidence in the USA. Bone metastases with HCC, in particular, have an extremely poor prognosis. We present prevalence, treatment, and survival of patients with bone and more specifically spinal metastases from HCC.Methods:A retrospective analysis was done at a single tertiary care institution of patients with bone metastases from HCC between January 2005 and December 2015.Results:Among 1017 patients with HCC, 20 were found to have bone metastases of which 11 had spinal metastases. Seventeen (85%) were male, with median age of 58 years at time of HCC diagnosis. Systemic chemotherapy and sorafenib were used in 12 (60%) patients, and 12 (60%) received radiation therapy. Among patients who did not receive therapy, median survival was 76 days. Median survival after diagnosis of metastasis in patients on sorafenib and radiation were 106 and 100 days, respectively.Conclusion:Bone metastases in HCC are very rare and aggressive. Due to its rarity, optimal treatment strategies are not well defined. Early diagnosis is important for optimal therapy and improved survival.
