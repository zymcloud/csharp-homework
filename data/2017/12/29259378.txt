Aim:To analyze the homogeneity of pathologic response to preoperative chemotherapy (PRPC) after chemotherapy in patients with multiple liver metastases (LM).Methods:From September 2011 to August 2014, patients with at least two LM undergoing preoperative chemotherapy prior to resection were included in this retrospective, single-center study. The endpoints were PRPC homogeneity (according to both the Rubbia-Brandt and MD Anderson classifications), the impact of PRPC on the MDT decision, factors associated with homogeneous PRPC and overall survival of patients with vs. without homogeneous PRPC.Results:seventy-three patients with a total of 88 liver resections (including 15 two-stage procedures) were included in the study. The homogeneous PRPC rate was 55% according to the Rubbia-Brandt classification and 53% according to the MD Anderson classification. The MDT decision was modified by the PRPC in only 2.7% of patients (n = 2).Conclusion:The PRPC was homogeneous in only one half of patients and had very little influence on the MDT decision.
