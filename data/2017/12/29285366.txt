Although sorafenib and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) have been proven to improve prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI), the most appropriate approach remains unclear. The present multicenter, non-randomized, prospective cohort study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of HAIC and sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC and MVI, without extra-hepatic spread (EHS) and Child-Pugh class A disease. The present study was performed between April 2008 and March 2014, and 64 HCC patients with MVI, without EHS and Child-Pugh class A disease were registered. Of these patients, 44 were treated with HAIC and 20 with sorafenib. HAIC involved cisplatin (50 mg fine powder in 5-10 ml lipiodol) and a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (FU) (1,500 mg/5 days), which is referred to as new 5-FU and cisplatin therapy (NFP). The primary outcome was progression-free survival, and the secondary outcome was overall survival (OS). Clinical factors influencing OS and the therapeutic effect were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses. There were no differences in clinical factors between the two groups. The median progression-free survival was 5.1 and 9.5 months in the sorafenib and NFP groups, respectively (P=0.001). The complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) rates were 10 and 71% in the sorafenib and NFP groups, respectively (P
