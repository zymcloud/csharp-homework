Combretastatin A4 (CA4) is a natural product characterized by a powerful inhibition of tubulin polymerization and a potential anticancer activity. However, therapeutic application of CA4 is substantially hindered due to geometric isomerization. In the current study, new cis-restricted Combretastatin A4 analogues containing 1,2,4-triazle in place of the olefinic bond were designed and synthesized. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antiproliferative activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and leukemia HL-60 cell lines using MTT assay. Moreover, fourteen compounds were selected and tested for their antiproliferative activity by the National Cancer Institute. Some of the tested compounds showed moderate activity against sixty cell lines. In vitro tubulin polymerization inhibitory activity was evaluated on HepG2 cells. The assay revealed that 6a showed a remarkable tubulin inhibition compared to CA4. Moreover, the cell cycle analysis revealed significant G2/M cell cycle arrest of the analogue 6c in HepG2 cells. Molecular docking combined with AMBER-based molecular mechanical minimization results showed several noncovalent interactions, including van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding with several amino acids within the colchicine binding site of Î²-subunit of tubulin.
