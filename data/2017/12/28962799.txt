Multifunctional capsules have great applications in biomedical fields. In this study, novel polysaccharide-based nanocapsules were prepared via a layer-by-layer technique using silica as the templates. The shell was constructed based on the electrostatic interactions between pectin and chitosan. The pectin-chitosan nanocapsules ((Pec/Cs)3Pec) could keep good colloidal stability within 96h in PBS solution and 48h in BSA solution. Meanwhile, the nanocapsules exhibited a high drug loading and pH-sensitive release property for doxorubicin hydrochloride. Moreover, (Pec/Cs)3Pec nanocapsules had no cytotoxicity to both human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 cells) and mouse fibroblast cells (L929 cells). More importantly, (Pec/Cs)3Pec nanocapsules could be more easily uptaken by HepG2 cells when compared with L929 cells. In vitro anticancer activity tests indicated the carriers could effectively kill HepG2 cells. Overall, (Pec/Cs)3Pec nanocapsules have great potential as a novel anticancer drug carrier as a result of their pH-sensitivity, good colloidal stability and anticancer activity.
