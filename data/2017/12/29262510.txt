Objective: To carry out a prospective cohort study of combined intra-operative radiotherapy for centrally located hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and to observe the safety and postoperative complications. Methods: A total of 79 patients with centrally located HCC who underwent hepatectomy were divided into two groups: experimental group (combined with targeted intra-operative radiotherapy, 32 cases) and control group (single surgical operation, 47 cases). Patients in the experimental group received intra-operative electron radiotherapy after tumor resection, while patients in the control group received to intra-operative electron radiotherapy.The haemorrhagia amount and operation time during the operation, intra-operative liver function and the recovery of liver and gastrointestinal tract of patients in these two groups were compared. Results: No postoperative 30-day mortality was observed in all of the patients. The average total operation time of patients in the experimental group was (319±76) min, significantly longer than (233±76) min of the control group (P<0.001). The average aspartate transaminase (AST) level of patients in the experimental group at postoperative day 1 was 562.5 U/L, significantly higher than 347.0 U/L of control group (P=0.031). However, the average prothrombin activity levels of patients in the experimental group at postoperative day 3 and day 7 were (68.3±17.9)% and (73.4±10.2)%, respectively, significantly lower than (78.9±15.9)% and (80.0±10.6)% of control group (both P<0.05). There were no significant differences of tumor volume, differentiation degree, satellite lesion, dorsal membrane invasion, microvascular invasion between these two groups (all P>0.05). There were no significant differences of hospital stay, ventilation time, the incidence of hepatic insufficiency, ascites, pleural effusion, infection, biliary fistula between these two groups (all P>0.05). There were no significant differences of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, total bilirubin between these two groups at postoperative day 1, 3, 5 and 7 (all of P>0.05). Conclusion: The resection of centrally located HCC combined with intra-operative radiotherapy may increase the total operation time, delay the early postoperative recovery of liver function, but it is still safe and feasible.
