This report describes a case of hepatocellular carcinoma in an adolescent with perinatally acquired HIV and hepatitis B virus coinfection, arising despite more than a decade of suppressive antiretroviral therapy for both HIV and hepatitis B virus. This case raises important questions regarding optimal hepatocellular carcinoma screening in this high-risk group and the oncogenic potential of even very well-controlled viral infection.
