Sphingosine-1-phospate is a potent bioactive lipid metabolite that regulates cancer progression. Because sphingosine kinase 1 and sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK 1/2) are both essential for sphingosine-1-phospate production, they could be a therapeutic target in various cancers. Peretinoin, an acyclic retinoid, inhibits post-therapeutic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma via unclear mechanisms. In this study, we assessed effects of peretinoin on SPHK expression and liver cancer development in vitro and in vivo. We examined effects of peretinoin on expression, enzymatic and promoter activity of SPHK1 in a human hepatoma cell line, Huh-7. We also investigated effects of SPHK1 on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethylnitrosamine using SPHK1 knockout mice. Peretinoin treatment of Huh-7 cells reduced mRNA levels, protein expression and enzymatic activity of SPHK1. Peretinoin reduced SPHK1 promoter activity; this effect of peretinoin was blocked by overexpression of Sp1, a transcription factor. Deletion of all Sp1 binding sites within the SPHK1 promoter region abolished SPHK1 promoter activity, suggesting that peretinoin reduced mRNA levels of SPHK1 via Sp1. Additionally, diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatoma was fewer and less frequent in SPHK1 knockout compared to wild-type mice. Our data showed crucial roles of SPHK1 in hepatocarcinogenesis and suggests that peretinoin prevents hepatocarcinogenesis by suppressing mRNA levels of SPHK1.
