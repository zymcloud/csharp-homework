WWC family proteins negatively regulate HEK293 cell proliferation and organ growth by suppressing the transcriptional activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a major effector of the Hippo pathway. The function of the scaffolding protein WWC1 (also called KIBRA) has been intensively studied in cells and animal models. However, the expression and clinicopathologic significance of WWC2 in cancer are poorly characterized. This study aimed to clarify the biological function and mechanism of action of WWC2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Retrospective analysis revealed WWC2 was significantly down-regulated in 95 clinical HCC tissues compared to the paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Moreover, loss of WWC2 expression was significantly associated with advanced clinicopathological features, including venous infiltration, larger tumour size and advanced TNM stage. Positive WWC2 expression was associated with significantly better 5-year overall survival, and WWC2 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC. Moreover, we confirmed WWC2 inhibits HCC cell invasive ability in vitro. Elevated YAP expression was also observed in the same cohort of HCC tissues. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis indicated WWC2 expression correlated inversely with nuclear YAP protein expression in HCC. Mechanistically, we confirmed overexpression of WWC2 suppresses the invasive and metastatic potential of HCC cells by activating large tumour suppressor 1 and 2 kinases (LATS1/2), which in turn phosphorylates the transcriptional co-activator YAP. Overall, this study indicates WWC2 functions as a tumour suppressor by negatively regulating the Hippo signalling pathway and may serve as a prognostic marker in HCC.
