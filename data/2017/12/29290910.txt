Aim:To investigate the prevalence, clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) in patients with non-B, non-C (NBNC) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This study retrospectively examined the cases of 78 NBNC patients with curative resection for HCC for whom DNA could be extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. OBI was determined by the HBV-DNA amplification of at least two different sets of primers by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. Possibly carcinogenetic factors such as alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were examined. Surgical outcomes were evaluated according to disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).Results:OBI was found in 27/78 patients (34.6%) with NBNC HCC. The OBI patients were significantly younger than the non-OBI cases at the time of surgery (average age 63.0 vs 68.1, P = 0.0334) and the OBI cases overlapped with other etiologies significantly more frequently compared to the non-OBI cases (P = 0.0057). OBI had no impact on the DFS, OS or DSS. Only tumor-related factors affected these surgical outcomes.Conclusion:Our findings indicate that OBI had no impact on surgical outcomes. The surgical outcomes of NBNC HCC depend on early tumor detection; this reconfirms the importance of a periodic medical examination for individuals who have NBNC HCC risk factors.
