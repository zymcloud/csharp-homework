It is often difficult to control perioperative bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis and concurrent thrombocytopenia and coagulation factor deficiency. Partial splenic embolization (PSE), an auxiliary treatment strategy in management of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, can not only increase platelets but also improve liver function. With advances in interventional radiology, PSE is a safer and more reliable procedure compared to a splenectomy. We present the case of a 69-year-old man diagnosed with left lung cancer, with thrombocytopenia, and hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. Although he was administered prophylactic platelet transfusion prior to operation, he was noted to be refractory to platelet transfusion. PSE was performed to improve his thrombocytopenia, following which we could safely perform left upper lobectomy of the lung and ND2a-1 lymph node dissection without any major bleeding. PSE is useful induction therapy to provide a wider choice of treatment options for patients with thrombocytopenia.
