The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of 10 SNPs in different microRNAs (miRNAs) with susceptibility to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV clearance, persistence of chronic HBV infection, and progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients were categorized into the following groups: inactive HBV carrier, active HBV carrier, HBV-cleared subject and cirrhosis+HCC. Samples were analysed for 10 SNPs in microRNAs using either PCR-based genotyping or the TaqMan assay. We found that rs1358379 was associated with susceptibility to HBV infection, HBV clearance, persistent chronic HBV infection and liver cirrhosis+HCC. In addition, we found that rs2292832 and rs11614913 were associated with risk of HBV infection, viral clearance and cirrhosis+HCC, whereas rs2910164 was associated with proneness to HBV infection, and ability to clear the virus. There was evidence of associations between rs6505162 and HBV clearance and the development of liver disease, whereas a single association was found between rs2289030 and HBV clearance. Similarly, rs7372209 and rs4919510 were specifically associated with the development of HBV-induced liver complications. SNPs in miRNAs affect the susceptibility, clearance and progression of HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. We found, using Gene Ontology or pathway analyses, that these genes may contribute to the pathophysiology of HBV infection and related liver complications. However, differences in the association of examined SNPs with various clinical stages indicate variations in the respective functional roles of these polymorphisms and their miRNAs, and thus, further investigation to fully explore their therapeutic potential is warranted.
