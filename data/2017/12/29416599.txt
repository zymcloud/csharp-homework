Hepatitis B is one of the most common infectious diseases, which leads to public health problems in the world, especially in Asian counties. In recent years, extensive human genetic association studies have been carried out to identify susceptible genes and genetic polymorphisms to understand the genetic contributions to the disease progression of HBV infection. HLA-DQ gene variations have been reported to be associated with HBV infection/clearance, disease progression and the development of hepatitis B-related complications, including liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results are either inconclusive or controversial. Therefore, to derive a more precise estimation of the association, a meta-analysis was performed. Our data revealed that the HLA-DQ alleles rs2856718-G, rs7453920-A and rs9275319-G were significantly associated with decreased risk of HBV infection and HBV natural clearance. Logistic regression analyses showed that HLA-DQ alleles rs9275572-A significantly increased HBV infection clearance, and decreased HBV natural clearance. However, rs2856718-G and rs9275572-A were not associated with development of cirrhosis. The HLA-DQ polymorphisms (rs2856718 and rs9275572) were associated with a decreased HBV-related HCC risk in all genetic models, but rs9272105-A increased the risk of HBV-related HCC. In addition, no significant association was observed between HLA-DQ rs9275319-G polymorphism and HBV-related HCC. These stratified analyses were limited due to relatively modest size of correlational studies. In future, further investigation on a large population and different ethnicities are warranted. Our findings contribute to the personalized care and prognosis in hepatitis B.
