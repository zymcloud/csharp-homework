Introduction:The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in a variety of solid tumors including oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and has been implicated in the resistance of these tumors to cisplatin. This study was performed to determine if the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib could enhance the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on OSCC cells in vitro.Methods:The expression of EGFR and the phosphorylation of its downstream signaling to ERK, and AKT pathway were detected by Western blotting. Cell proliferation and survival were determined by AlamarBlue and colony formation assay respectively. Cells apoptosis were determined by Western blotting for cleaved PARP protein and by flowcytometry of cells stained with Annexin V and PI.Results:Cal27, OSC19, and SCC25 cells treated with gefitinib 1 μM demonstrated reduced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, and ERK proteins with very limited inhibition of proliferation. Cisplatin inhibited proliferation of the same cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration producing 50% inhibition (IC50) for cisplatin decreased in the presence of gefitinib 1 μM, and a combination of cisplatin 5 µM and gefitinib 1 µM caused synergistic growth inhibition and synergistic reduction in cell survival. The growth inhibitory effect of the combination was associated with reduced ERK and AKT activation, increased poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and increased apoptosis.Conclusion:Thus, in OSCC cells in vitro, inhibition of EGFR activity with gefitinib enhances the apoptotic effect of cisplatin. This has potential implications for enhancement of cisplatin effectiveness in tumors that over-express the EGFR.
