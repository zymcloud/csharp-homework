Liver disorders such as hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are a series of the most life threatening diseases along with extensive inflammatory cellular infiltrations. Macrophage has been proved to be key regulators and initiators of inflammation, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are recommended to play critical roles in the occurrence and development of a variety of diseases. To uncover the role of macrophage in liver disorders via lncRNA sequencing method, we first applied a lncRNA classification pipeline to identify 1247 lncRNAs represented on the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430/430A 2.0 array. We then analyzed the lncRNA expression patterns in a set of previously published gene expression profiles of silica particle exposed macrophages and liver respectively, and identified and validated sets of differentially expressed lncRNAs shared by macrophages and liver. The functional enrichment analysis of these lncRNAs was processed on the basis of their expression signatures, three aspects including cis, trans and co-acting proteins were proposed. This is the first time to correlate macrophage with liver disorders via co-expressed lncRNAs. Our findings indicated that roles of macrophage in liver disorders were double-edged, the differentially expressed lncRNAs and their corresponding regulatory genes or proteins may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
