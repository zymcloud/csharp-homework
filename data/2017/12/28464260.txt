Extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides have emerged as important elements regulating tissue homeostasis. Acting through specific receptors, have the ability to control gene expression patterns to direct cellular fate. We observed that SKOV-3 cells express the ectonucleotidases: ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase 1 (ENPP1), ecto-5'-nucleotidase (NT5E), and liver alkaline phosphatase (ALPL). Strikingly, in pulse and chase experiments supplemented with ATP, SKOV-3 cells exhibited low catabolic efficiency in the conversion of ADP into AMP, but they were efficient in converting AMP into adenosine. Since these cells release ATP, we proposed that the conversion of ADP into AMP is a regulatory node associated with the migratory ability and the mesenchymal characteristics shown by SKOV-3 cells under basal conditions. The landscape of gene expression profiles of SKOV-3 cell cultures treated with apyrase or adenosine demonstrated similarities (e.g., decrease FGF16 transcript) and differences (e.g., the negative regulation of Wnt 2, and 10B by adenosine). Thus, in SKOV-3 we analyzed the migratory ability and the expression of epithelium to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in response to apyrase. Apyrase-treatment favored the epithelial-like phenotype, as revealed by the re-location of E-cadherin to the cell to cell junctions. Pharmacological approaches strongly suggested that the effect of Apyrase involved the accumulation of extracellular adenosine; this notion was strengthened when the incubation of the SKOV-3 cell with α,β-methylene ADP (CD73 inhibitor) or adenosine deaminase was sufficient to abolish the effect of apyrase on cell migration. Overall, adenosine signaling is a fine tune mechanism in the control of cell phenotype in cancer. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 4468-4478, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
