Purpose:To prospectively assess feasibility, safety, and cytoreductive effect of transarterial chemoembolization on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using drug-eluting embolic agent (DEE) saturated with doxorubicin compared with transarterial embolization (TAE).Materials and methods:Between 2012 and 2015, 12 patients (male/female = 5/7, age 66 y ± 9.8) with biopsy-verified RCC eligible for nephron-sparing surgery or radical nephrectomy were recruited. Mean tumor size was 3.2 cm ± 0.62. Patients were randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive either DEE transarterial chemoembolization or TAE before planned surgery. A microcatheter was used to inject particles selectively into arteries feeding the tumors. Response was evaluated by CT according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors and by microscopy of excised tumors. Complications were scored according to the Society of Interventional Radiology classification.Results:DEE transarterial chemoembolization (n = 6) resulted in a significantly (P = .018) higher degree of necrosis with an average of 88.3% (range, 70%-100%) compared with TAE (n = 5), which resulted in an average of 29.4% (range, 0-77%), as evaluated by CT. Histopathologic evaluation showed similar results (P = .016) with an average necrosis of 87.5% (range, 80%-95%) for DEE transarterial chemoembolization (n = 4) versus 26% (range, 0-70%) for TAE (n = 5). Percentage of necrosis seen on microscopy correlated significantly (P = .0005) with radiologic findings, as 4 tumors in each arm were evaluated by both CT and microscopy. No major complications were observed in either group.Conclusions:DEE transarterial chemoembolization is safe for treating localized RCC and has a significantly superior cytoreductive effect compared with TAE.
