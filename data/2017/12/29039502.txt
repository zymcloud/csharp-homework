HOTTIP functions as an independent biomarker in multiple cancers. However, the role of HOTTIP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In this study, we sought to investigate the HOTTIP expression in HCC and normal liver. We combined quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT‑PCR), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Multi Experiment Matrix (MEM) and Oncomine database to assess the clinical role and the potential molecular mechanism of HOTTIP in HCC. Furthermore, a meta‑analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between HOTTIP and HCC tumorigenesis and development. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis, which contained Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and network analysis, were applied to investigate the underlying functions, pathways and networks of the potential genes. HOTTIP was obviously upregulated in HCC. A statistically significant higher expression of HOTTIP was found in TNM (III +Ⅳ), age (≥60), sex (male), race (white) and cirrhosis (no) compared to the control groups (P
