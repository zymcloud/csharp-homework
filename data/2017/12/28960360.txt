Background:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is expected to become a leading aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related mortality in the United States. HCC treatments with curative intent (OLT, orthotopic liver transplantation; resection; RFA, radiofrequency ablation) can improve survival in carefully selected patients.Aim:To compare survival after receipt of curative treatment for NAFLD and non-NAFLD-HCC aetiologies (HCV, chronic hepatitis C; HBV, chronic hepatitis B; ALD, alcoholic liver disease) and by treatment was performed.Methods:A cohort of 17 664 patients was assembled using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare data from 1991 to 2011 with confirmed diagnosis of HCC.Results:The cohort was mostly male, aged 70 (21-106) years, without cardiovascular disease, and had liver cirrhosis without decompensation, metastatic HCC or large tumour size (>5 cm). The NAFLD-HCC group was mostly female and older with more cardiovascular disease, metastatic HCC, and large tumour size and less cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease than the non-NAFLD-HCC groups. The NAFLD group was 47% less likely to receive any curative treatment as compared with non-NAFLD aetiologies (OR 0.53, P Conclusion:Patients with NAFLD-HCC had worse survival after OLT but favourable survival after resection, particularly in the absence of cirrhosis, as compared with non-NAFLD-HCC aetiologies.
