Members of the reticulon protein family are predominantly distributed within the endoplasmic reticulum. The neurite outgrowth inhibitor (Nogo) has three subtypes, including Nogo-A (200 kDa), Nogo-B (55 kDa), and Nogo-C (25 kDa). Nogo-A and Nogo-C are potent Nogos that are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. Nogo-B, the splice variant of reticulon-4, is expressed widely in multiple human organ systems, including the liver, lung, kidney, blood vessels, and inflammatory cells. Moreover, the Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) can interact with Nogo-B and can independently affect nervous system regeneration, the chemotaxis of endothelial cells, proliferation, and apoptosis. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that NgBR plays an important role in human pathophysiological processes, including lipid metabolism, angiogenesis, N-glycosylation, cell apoptosis, chemoresistance in human hepatocellular carcinoma, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The pathophysiologic effects of NgBR have garnered increased attention, and the detection and enhancement of NgBR expression may be a novel approach to monitor the development and to improve the prognosis of relevant human clinical diseases.
