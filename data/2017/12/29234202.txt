Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteinases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix and numerous nonmatrix proteins. MMPs along with tissue inhibitors of MMPs, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. Although, the precise mechanism-of-actions of MMPs in various liver related disorders is largely unknown, however, data from diverse experimental models indicate that these proteinases influence cellular activities including proliferation and survival, gene expression, as well as multiple aspects of inflammation. Hence, MMP's are likely key players in the outcomes related to liver disease.
