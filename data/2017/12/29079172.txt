Cystic pancreatic tumors account for 10% of cystic lesions in the pancreas. Evaluation focuses on identifying lesions that require surgical resection due to actual or potential malignancy. Cystic tumors with malignant potential include mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and cystic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The sensitivity of endoscopic fine needle aspiration (FNA) to diagnose such lesions is low, and a more accurate marker of malignant potential is needed. Aldo-keto reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) was originally found in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Since then, it has been identified in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Because there is difficulty in determining the malignant potential of cystic pancreatic tumors, we set out to examine the expression of AKR1B10 in these lesions as a potential biomarker of malignancy. AKR1B10 expression was analyzed in cell blocks from FNAs and surgical resection specimens using immunohistochemistry. We examined MCN (n=28), IPMN (n=18), and cystic NET (n=20) as well as nonmucinous cysts including pseudocysts (n=13) and serous cystadenomas (n=16). AKR1B10 expression was seen in 45 of 46 (98%) mucinous lesions evaluated. Strong staining (2+-3+/60%-100% staining) was seen in 16 of 18 (89%) IPMNs and 25 of 28 (90%) MCNs. No staining was seen in the nonmucinous lesions (n=49). In conclusion, AKR1B10 is upregulated in mucinous cystic pancreatic tumors, and this staining can be accomplished in cytology FNA material, making AKR1B10 a promising biomarker of malignant potential. Most importantly, this application could impact the clinical management of these patients by determining the best candidates for surgical resection.
