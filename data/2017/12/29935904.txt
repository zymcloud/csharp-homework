Disruption of liver immune tolerance allows for the development of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AIH rarely progresses to HCC but the diseases similarly induce the production of IL-18 and matrix metalloproteinases. These molecules have distinct effects on the immune response, including the programmed cell-death 1 (PD-1) axis. In this review, differences in PD-1 function and possible cell signals in AIH and HCC are highlighted.
