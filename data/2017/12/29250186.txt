Long non-coding RNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) has been demonstrated to exhibit oncogenic activity in several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the association between HOTAIR and HCC multidrug resistance remains uncertain. The present study aimed to investigate the role of HOTAIR in HCC chemoresistance; it was found that knockdown of HOTAIR expression in HCC Huh7 cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Furthermore, expression levels of ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) mRNA and protein were decreased in Huh7 cells upon HOTAIR-knockdown. In addition, HOTAIR-knockdown reduced the levels of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation reduced HOTAIR-mediated ABCB1 expression. Together, these findings indicated that knockdown of HOTAIR in Huh7 cells decreased STAT3 activity and ABCB1 expression, and increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Thus HOTAIR could serve as a novel potential therapeutic target to reverse multidrug resistance in HCC.
