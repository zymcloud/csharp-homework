Background and purpose:To report the clinical usefulness of coiled fiducial markers as an internal surrogate in gated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a real-time tumor-tracking radiotherapy (RTRT) system.Materials and methods:Seventeen HCC patients with Child-Pugh (CP) scores of A or B received gated SBRT (45-50Gy in 5-10 fractions) using an RTRT system and Visicoil markers. Local control (LC), progression-free (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicities were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0.Results:Of the 17 patients, 14 had a CP score A. The mean planning target volume was 54.6cc. Only 1 patient developed pneumothorax after marker implantation. Visicoil tracking during SBRT was possible in all cases. With a median follow-up of 16months, 1-year LC, PFS, and OS rates were 100%, 53%, and 82%, respectively. Gradeâ‰¥2 late toxicity was observed in 2 patients (grade 2 duodenal ulcer and grade 3 temporary transaminase elevation).Conclusions:Using an RTRT system and Visicoil markers, gated SBRT was well tolerated in patients with HCC. This can be considered a safe treatment strategy with potential for delivering favorable outcomes.
