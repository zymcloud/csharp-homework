Hepatocellular carcinoma related protein 1 (HCRP1), which is essential for internalization and degradation of ubiquitinated membrane receptors, is downregulated in several tumors and strongly affects the outcomes of cancer patients. It is reported the expression of HCRP1 is inversely related to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in breast cancer and lead to resistance to cetuximab in ovarian cancer. However, its exact mechanism in the progression of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Herein, HCRP1 expression and its clinical significance were examined in 101 HCC patients using immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays were conducted in HCC cell lines. EGFR activation and degradation were then observed after EGF inducing in HCRP1 knockdown HepG2 cells. In addition, we also detected whether epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was involved in the malignancy promoted by HCRP1. The results showed that 59 of the 101 HCC cases exhibited downregulation of HCRP1 expression (P
