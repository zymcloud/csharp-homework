Secondary or metastatic cardiac tumors are about 20-40 times more common than primary benign or malignant cardiac tumors. Cardiac metastases are more frequent in carcinomas, they usually appear in patients over 50 years and the involvement by gender is similar. Any tumor can cause cardiac or pericardial metastasis, although isolated or combined tumor invasion of the pericardium is more common. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the primary diagnostic procedure, followed by computed tomography (CT) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to verify positive findings and to analyze other structures of the mediastinum and chest. Treatment of such tumors is generally associated with poor results and unfavorable prognosis. We report the case of an unusual cardiac metastasis.
