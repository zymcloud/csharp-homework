Objective:To evaluate the detection accuracy of the biomarkers dickkopf-1, DCP and AFP as a serum biomarker panel by comparing the sensitivity of the panel with those of the individual biomarkers.Methods:The study was composed of three groups, one with HCC patients, one with non-HCC liver diseases and one with healthy controls. Serum AFP was measured using a chemiluminescence assay and serum dickkopf-1 and DCP were measured with ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of the biomarkers were analyzed as single parameters and as a serum panel.Results:The HCC group showed higher levels of dickkopf-1, DCP and AFP than the other two groups (P 0.05). The combination of the biomarkers as a serum panel produced much better sensitivity (93.02%) and specificity (78.00%) than each of the markers individually (P Conclusion:The combination of AFP, DCP and dickkopf-1 as a biomarker panel can significantly improve the detection power with much higher sensitivity and specificity for HCC than any of the biomarkers alone. The tests are convenient and inexpensive, and may serve as a valuable addition to current options for the diagnosis of HCC.
