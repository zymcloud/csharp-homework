Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of malignant tumour and has poor prognosis. Currently, systematic chemotherapy is the only approach to prolong survival. Thus the development of new treatment regimens is urgently needed to improve the therapeutic efficacy. Our study intended to assess the combination of dasatinib and irinotecan against HCC and made an effort to develop a potential medical choice for advanced HCC patients.Methods:We used SRB colorimetric assay and clonogenic assay to assess antitumour effect in vitro and HCC xenograft model to assess antitumour effect in vivo. We applied flow cytometry and western blotting to explore the mechanism of the combined therapy. Knockdown and overexpression of PLK1 are also applied for validation.Results:We confirmed that dasatinib has synergistic effect with irinotecan (or SN38) on HCC both in vitro and in vivo. The effect is due to arisen apoptosis rate of HCC cells that is accompanied by mitochondria dysfunction. The enhanced antitumour efficacy of SN38 could be explained by additional inhibition of PLK1, which is triggered by dasatinib. Unlike existed PLK1 inhibitors, dasatinib does not inhibit PLK1 activity in a direct way. Instead, we found that dasatinib reduces PLK1 level by interfering with its protein synthesis progress. We validated that this kind of downregulation of PLK1 level has a key role in the synergistic effect of the two agents.Conclusions:Dasatinib is able to reinforce the anti-HCC efficacy of irinotecan/SN38 by downregulation of PLK1 synthesis. The combination of the two agents might be a potential medical choice for HCC therapy.
