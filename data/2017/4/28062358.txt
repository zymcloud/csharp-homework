Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is the most common and toxic hepatotoxin and it could induce human hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the route of drinking water. The aim of the present study was to determine the expressions of oncogenes c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, c-met, and N-ras and tumor suppressor gene PTEN in HepG2 cells following MC-LR-exposure to understand the possible mechanism of MC-LR-related human primary liver cancer. The results of qPCR and Western blotting showed that MC-LR-exposure at non- or sub-cytotoxic concentrations promoted the expressions of oncogenes c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, c-met, and N-ras while suppressed tumor-suppressor gene PTEN in HepG2 cells at both transcription and protein levels. This result suggests that HCC-related genes may be involved in human hepatitis and primary liver cancer caused by MC-LR. The work might be useful for evaluating the human health risk resulted from the long-term of MC-LR-exposure at low dose via drinking water route.
