High Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) has been associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung, ovarian, colorectal and renal cancer, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of GPS in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) undergoing partial hepatectomy. A total of 72 patients with pathologically confirmed ICC were classified according to their GPS scores assigned based on the preoperative levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin. Their clinicopathological data were retrospectively assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis to determine their association with overall survival and recurrence. High GPS scores in ICC patients were associated with preoperative levels of CRP (P
