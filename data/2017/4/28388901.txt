Background:Abnormal Savda Munziq (ASMq) is a traditional prescription in Uyghur Medicine, and its treatment of complex diseases such as tumors and asthma has been proven to be effective in Uyghur medical clinical practice. The efficacy-enhancing and toxicity-reducing properties of ASMq were studied on mice with transplanted cervical cancer (U27) tumors, which were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in this work.Methods:To investigate the synergistic effect of ASMq and 5-FU on U27 cells, inhibitory effects on cell proliferation were determined through a MTT assay. 48 Kunming mice which were randomly divided in to 6 groups: control group, model group, 5-FU group, 5-FU combine with ASMq low-dose group, 5-FU combine with ASMq medium-dose group, and 5-FU combine with ASMq high- dose group, the inhibition rate of the tumor, the viscera indexes, and the content of serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined. The expression levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and human papillomavirus type 16 E2 (HPV16 E2) protein were assessed by Western blot. Pathological changes in the liver were observed.Result:The inhibition rates of tumors, the 5-FU + ASMq.H group(80.64%), 5-FU + ASMq.M group (90.67%), 5-FU + ASMq.L group (72.03%) and 5-FU group (66.89%), clearly indicated that the effects of tumor inhibition. The thymus index and spleen index were increased, and the serum concentration of TNF-α increased while ALT and AST concentrations were decreased, and TNF-α protein expression were increased while TGF-β1 and HPV16 E2 were decreased. ASMq might can improve livers central vein hyperemia and interstitial edema, and preserve the radial structure of the hepatic cords.Conclusions:The results suggested that ASMq might reduce toxicity and enhance the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of cervical carcinoma.
