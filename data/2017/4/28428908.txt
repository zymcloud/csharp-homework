Background:Esophageal cancer including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma represents 4% of all cancers in the United States. Patients with esophageal cancer frequently present with locally advanced disease, and about 40% of patients have evidence of metastatic disease on presentation. Common sites of metastasis include liver, lung and bone. Here, we present a rare case of colonic metastasis from primary esophageal SCC.Case presentation:A 60-year-old Caucasian male with a history of 20-pack-year cigarette smoking received surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced SCC of larynx. Approximately 9 months later, he developed dysphagia, and found to have a esophageal SCC in the mid-esophagus with regional lymph node involvement. He underwent chemoradiation treatment with good response and improved symptoms but declined subsequent surgical resection for esophageal cancer. About 1 year after the diagnosis of esophageal cancer, he developed blood streaked bowel movement and severe anemia. Colonoscopy showed a 3-cm mass in the proximal ascending colon; biopsy showed metastatic SCC, consistent with metastasis from esophageal primary. He subsequently received palliative radiation to the ascending colon metastatic tumor with improvement of anemia, and remained transfusion independent for more than 3 months.Conclusions:Colonic metastasis from esophageal SCC is rare, and associated with poor prognosis. There are no definite features in terms of location, histological differentiation etc. that contribute to colonic metastasis from primary esophageal SCC. The goal of treatment is palliative and data from our and other case reports support the use of chemotherapy and radiation for symptom improvement and disease control.
