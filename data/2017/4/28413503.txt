Hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality. Angiogenesis is an important contributor to HCC progression and metastasis; therefore, inhibiting angiogenesis may be an effective method of treating HCC. Tumstatin is a novel type of efficient endogenous vascular endothelial cell growth inhibiting factor. The anti-angiogenic activity of tumstatin is localized to the 54-132 amino acid region (Tum-5). In a previous study performed by our group, the gene fragment encoding Tum-5 was cloned and inserted into a pLXSN retroviral vector. In the present study, the anti-angiogenic effects of Tum-5 and the antitumor effects exerted by the pLXSN-Tum-5 vector in vivo were investigated. The results demonstrated that pLXSN-Tum-5 significantly inhibited the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells compared with pLXSN, but had no obvious effect on HepG2 cell growth. Moreover, the antitumor and anti-angiogenic activity of Tum-5 was examined in vivo using a xenograft of H22 HCC cells. The results indicated that pLXSN-Tum-5 significantly inhibited tumor growth following 5 injections over 10 days. The size and weight of tumors in the pLXSN-Tum-5 group were lower than those in the saline and pLXSN groups. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis with CD31 antibodies indicated that the average microvessel density in the pLXSN-Tum-5 group were significantly lower than that in the saline and pLXSN groups. These results suggested that Tum-5 exerts its antitumor activity by suppressing vascular endothelial cells. The gene fragment of Tum-5 may be developed as an effective inhibitor of angiogenesis and used to treat patients with HCC.
