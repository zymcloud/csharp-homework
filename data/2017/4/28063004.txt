Tubulin alpha 8 (TUBA8) is highly abundant in murine liver tumors suggesting a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a risk factor for HCC. In mice that are fed with a methionine-choline deficient diet for two weeks to induce advanced murine NASH, we do see increased hepatic levels of TUBA8 protein. In animals given a high-fat diet for 14 weeks or an atherogenic diet for 12 weeks, hepatic TUBA8 is unchanged. TUBA8 is highly expressed in human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and co-localizes with the HSC marker desmin in the murine liver. Inflammatory (TNF, LPS, IL-6) and profibrotic mediators (TGF-beta) do not regulate TUBA8 in HepG2 cells, primary HSC and the HSC cell line LX-2, when stimulated for 24 h. Agonists of the farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, which are nuclear receptors involved in NASH and HCC pathophysiology, have no effect on TUBA8 in HepG2 and LX-2 cells. In human HCC tissues of 18 patients TUBA8 is significantly upregulated when compared to the corresponding non-tumorous tissues. Compared to non-transformed hepatocytes, TUBA8 protein is strongly expressed in transformed cells. Thus, TUBA8 is a marker of HSC whose cell number is increased in NASH, while higher levels in HCC may be related to induction of TUBA8 in parenchymal cells.
