Objectives:The effect of portal vein thrombosis on the progression of liver disease is controversial, with no consensus on optimal treatment. We aimed to assess how portal vein thrombosis affects wait list outcomes, identify risk factors associated with its development while on a wait list, and assess its effects on patient and graft survival.Materials and methods:This US-based retrospective cohort study analyzed 134 109 adult patients on wait lists for or undergoing primary orthotopic liver transplant between January 2002 and June 2014. Rate of portal vein thrombosis development, time from entry on wait list to transplant, comparisons of wait list drop-off rates between patients with versus those without portal vein thrombosis, risk factors associated with its development while on a wait list, and its effects on patient and graft survival were analyzed.Results:We found that the rate of portal vein thrombosis at listing increased. Patients with the disease at listing were more likely to be removed from wait lists because of being too sick. Portal vein thrombosis at listing was an independent risk factor for being removed from a wait list. Of 63 265 patients who underwent primary orthotopic liver transplant, those with the disease were more likely to have higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores and incidence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetes mellitus. Portal vein thrombosis had a negative effect on patient and graft survival. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, body mass index, diabetes, and hepatocellular carcinoma were identified as risk factors for its development.Conclusions:Portal vein thrombosis represents an increasing management and outcome burden in liver transplant. Having this disease at listing and/or at time of transplant is associated with worse patient and graft survival. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma are among the biggest risk factors for its development while on a wait list.
