The purpose of this article is to analyze longitudinal trends in locoregional therapy (LRT) use and review locoregional therapy's role in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma prior to orthotropic liver transplantation Porrett et al. (2006) . LRT has a role in both bridge to transplantation and downstaging of patients not initially meeting Milan or UCSF Criteria. Due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, no specific bridging LRT modality is recommended over another for treating patients on the waiting list, however each modality has unique and patient-specific advantages. Pre-transplant LRT use in the United States has increased dramatically over the last two decades with more than 50% of the currently listed patients receiving LRT Freeman et al. (2008) . Despite these national trends, significant differences in LRT utilization, referral patterns, recurrence rates and survival have been observed among UNOS regions, socioeconomic levels and races. The use of LRT as a biologic selection tool based on response to treatment has shown promising results in its ability to predict successful post-transplant outcomes.
