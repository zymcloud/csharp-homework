Purpose:RO5323441 is a humanized anti-placental growth factor (PlGF) monoclonal antibody that has shown preclinical activity in several cancer models. The objective of this analysis is to examine the pharmacokinetic (PK) results from four Phase I studies that have been conducted with RO5323441 (n = 61) and to report an apparent drug-drug interaction observed when RO5323441 was administered in combination with bevacizumab.Methods:The four Phase I studies were a multiple-ascending dose study in 23 patients with solid tumors (Study 1), an open-label study in seven patients with colorectal/ovarian cancer (Study 2), a sorafenib combination study in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (Study 3), and a bevacizumab combination study in 22 patients with recurrent glioblastoma (Study 4). A two-compartment linear population PK model was developed from these four studies to characterize the PK of RO5323441 in patients with cancer.Results:The PK properties of RO5323441 were similar in the first three studies. However, substantially higher RO5323441 exposures were observed in Study 4 when RO5323441 was administered in combination with bevacizumab. A linear two-compartmental population PK model indicated that the co-administration of bevacizumab would decrease the clearance of RO5323441 by 53%. Clinical data suggested that the decrease in RO5323441 clearance was inversely associated with bevacizumab exposure.Conclusions:The exact reason for the increase in RO5323441 exposure following bevacizumab co-administration is not currently known. One possibility is a drug-drug interaction via a target-trapping mechanism that is mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1).
