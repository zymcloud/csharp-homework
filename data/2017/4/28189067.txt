Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is actively involved in the pathogenesis and tumorigenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-489 was found to play either oncogenic or tumor suppressive roles in human cancers. Recent study reported that the levels of miR-489 in late recurrent HCC patients were evidently higher than that in early recurrent cases, suggesting that miR-489 may function as a tumor suppressive miRNA in HCC. Yet, the clinical value and biological function of miR-489 remain rarely known in HCC. Here, we presented that miR-489 level in HCC tissues was notably reduced compared to matched non-cancerous specimens. Its decreased level was evidently correlated with adverse clinical parameters and poor prognosis of HCC patients. Accordingly, the levels of miR-489 were obviously down-regulated in HCC cells. Ectopic expression of miR-489 in HCCLM3 and MHCC97H cells prominently inhibits the migration and invasion of tumor cells and reduced lung metastases in vivo, while miR-489 knockdown increased these behaviors of HepG2 and MHCC97L cells. Mechanically, miR-489 negatively regulated matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) abundance in HCC cells. Herein, MMP7 was found to be a downstream molecule of miR-489 in HCC. An inversely correlation between miR-489 and MMP7 was confirmed in HCC specimens. MMP7 knockdown prohibited cell migration and invasion while MMP7 overexpression showed opposite effects on HCC cells. Furthermore, restoration of MMP7 expression could abrogate the anti-metastatic effects of miR-489 on HCCLM3 cells with enhanced cell migration and invasion. Altogether, miR-489 potentially acts as a prognostic predictor and a drug-target for HCC patients.
