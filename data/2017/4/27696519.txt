Background and aim:The severity of liver dysfunction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often estimated with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification or model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. We aim to investigate the performance of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) and platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI) grade, which are recently reported to be simple and objective measurements for liver reserve in HCC.Methods:Between 2002 and 2014, consecutive 3182 HCC patients were enrolled to follow up their survival. The area under receiver-operator-characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to test the discriminatory powers over 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival.Results:Significant survival differences were found across all ALBI and PALBI grades (both P Conclusions:Both ALBI and PALBI grade are adequate models to assess liver dysfunction in HCC. The PALBI grade is consistently better in all patients, in patients with minimally decreased liver function, and in patients receiving different aggressive therapies.
