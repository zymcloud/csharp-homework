Objectives:We conducted a phase I study of sorafenib and intermittent hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy using cisplatin for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Sorafenib was administered continuously, whereas cisplatin was administered once every 3 weeks. We estimated the safety and efficacy.Results:Fifteen patients were enrolled into this study. The dose-limiting toxicities occurred at sorafenib 800 mg and cisplatin 20 mg/m2. The recommended dose was at sorafenib 400 mg and cisplatin 30 mg/m2. The disease control rate was 73.3%.Conclusions:This treatment is feasible for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Further evaluation of the regimen in a randomized controlled trial is warranted.
