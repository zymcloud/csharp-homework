Purpose:To identify Heptocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated antigens by proteomics, and validate whether autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) could be used for diagnosis and conditional monitoring.Results:The 78 kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78) was selected as a candidate TAA. The titers of autoantibodies against 78 kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78) from patients with HCC, liver cirrhosis (LC), and chronic hepatitis (CH) were significantly higher than that from normal controls (PMaterials and methods:HCC serum with high titer of autoantibodies against TAAs were screened and used for a proteome-based approach to identify HCC associated antigens. Indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was used to detect the corresponding autoantibodies against TAAs.Conclusion:GRP78 is an autoantigen that could stimulate autoimmune responses and serve as a potential marker for recurrent and metastatic progression in HCC.
