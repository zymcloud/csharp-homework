Single-port laparoscopic surgery has the advantage of a hidden scar and reduced abdominal wall trauma. Although single-port laparoscopic surgery is widely performed for other organs, its application is very limited for liver resection. Here, we report our experience with nine patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic liver resection. Nine patients underwent single-port laparoscopic liver resection for the indications of hydatid cyst, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer liver metastasis. Nine patients were successfully treated with single-port laparoscopic surgery. The operative time was between 60 and 240 min. The only operative complication was bleeding up to 650 mL in a patient with cirrhosis. No postoperative complications occurred. All patients were discharged earlier than usual. Single-port laparoscopic liver surgery is a challenging surgery. Surgeon with the experience of laparoscopic liver surgery should perform the single-port laparoscopic liver surgery. It is technically feasible with a good outcome in well-selected patients. Initial cases must be benign lesions to avoid jeopardizing oncological safety.
