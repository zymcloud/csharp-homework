Objective To investigate the underlying mechanism by which interleukin-37 (IL-37) induces the apoptosis and autophagy in SMMC-7721 cells. Methods SMMC-7721 cells were incubated in vitro and divided into two groups, IL-37 treated group and control group. The cells were treated with (50, 100, 200) ng/mL of recombinant human interleukin-37 (rhIL-37). CCK-8 assay was used to detect the cell proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to examine the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins, Bax, Bcl-2, and autophagy related proteins, microtubule-associated proteins 1 light chain 3 (LC3), beclin 1 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe the ultrastructures of autophagosomes. Results The rhIL-37 inhibited the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. It induced the apoptosis and autophagy in SMMC-7721 cells. In the IL-37 treated group, the levels of Bax, LC3 and beclin 1 increased but Bcl-2 decreased. The phosphorylation of mTOR was inhibited in the IL-37 treated group. Autophagosome was obvious in the IL-37 treated group. Conclusion IL-37 induces the apoptosis and autophagy in SMMC-7721 cells, which may be related to the phosphorylation of mTOR.
