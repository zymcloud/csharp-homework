Cirrhosis has become the focus of greater attention in recent years largely because of the increasing prevalence of 2 of its most common causes: chronic viral hepatitis and steatohepatitis (a subset of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]). Cirrhosis is the result of progressive destruction and regeneration of the liver parenchyma due to chronic liver disease (CLD).
