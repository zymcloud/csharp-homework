Background:Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and need for liver transplantation (LT). It is unclear if HCV-related LT outcomes vary by race/ethnicity.Aims:We aim to evaluate ethnic disparities specifically among patients with chronic HCV in the USA.Methods:Using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing 2003-2013 LT registry, we evaluated race/ethnicity-specific disparities in LT waitlist survival and probability of receiving LT among chronic HCV patients listed for LT.Results:Among 43,478 HCV patients listed for LT (70.0% non-Hispanic white, 10.8% black, 16.3% Hispanic, 2.9% Asian), HCV-related LT waitlist registrations increased by 21.5% from 2003 to 2013. During this period, the proportion of HCV patients with HCC increased by 237%, and in 2013, HCV patients with HCC accounted for 33.0% of HCV-related waitlist registrations. When stratified by race/ethnicity, Hispanics with HCV had significantly lower waitlist mortality (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74-0.94; p Conclusion:Among patients with chronic HCV in the USA, the MELD score has reduced race/ethnicity-specific disparities in waitlist mortality. However, Hispanic HCV patients had significantly better waitlist survival and lower probability of receiving LT, possibly reflecting slower disease progression compared to non-Hispanic whites with chronic HCV.
