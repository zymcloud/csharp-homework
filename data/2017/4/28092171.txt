Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects nearly 170 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of progressive liver damage, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Curative therapies have historically relied on interferon-based treatments and were limited by significant toxicity and poor response rates, particularly among patients with prior treatment failure and advanced hepatic fibrosis. The recent advent of direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents which target key steps in the HCV viral life cycle has transformed the landscape of HCV treatment by offering highly effective and well tolerated interferon-free treatments. However, current therapies are genotype-specific and have variable efficacy amongst less prevalent HCV variants. Areas covered: This review covers the preclinical and clinical development of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), an interferon-free, once daily, pangenotypic treatment for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. All relevant literature from 2014 through September of 2016 is included. Expert opinion: SOF/VEL offers the promise of a single tablet, interferon- and ribavirin-free treatment that has extremely high efficacy in persons with chronic HCV infection regardless of genotype, subtype, treatment history or fibrosis status. It is expected to play a major role on a global scale in the therapeutic armamentarium against this ubiquitous threat to human health.
