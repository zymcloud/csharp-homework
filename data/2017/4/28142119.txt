Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide and has continuously increased. NAFLD refers to a spectrum of diseases ranging from fatty liver to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and even to hepatocyte carcinoma. Excessive fatty acid enters the cell and the mitochondria undergo stress and unremoved ROS can trigger a form of cell apoptosis known as 'lipoapoptosis'. NASH arises from damaged liver hepatocytes due to lipotoxicity. NASH not only involves lipid accumulation and apoptosis but also inflammation. Ginkgo biloba has been tested clinical trials as a traditional medicine for asthma, bronchitis and cardiovascular disease. The effects of Ginkgolide A (GA), derived from the ginkgo biloba leaf, are still unknown in NAFLD. To determine the protective effects of GA in NAFLD, we examined the fatty liver disease condition in the non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA)-induced HepG2 cell line and in a high fat diet mouse model. The findings of this study suggest that GA is non-toxic at high concentrations in hepatocytes. Moreover, GA was found to inhibit cellular lipogenesis and lipid accumulation by causing mitochondrial oxidative stress. GA showed hepatoprotective efficacy by inducing cellular lipoapoptosis and by inhibiting cellular inflammation. The results demonstrated that GA may be feasible as a therapeutic agent for NAFLD patients.
