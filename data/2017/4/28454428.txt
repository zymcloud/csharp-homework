Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major malignant disease worldwide, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the primary causes for this type of cancer. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a non-structural protein encoded by the viral genome that has significant effects on the pathogenesis of HCC. With the development of high-throughput assays and technologies, the abnormal HBx-induced expression of certain cellular proteins with assorted biological functions has been investigated. These target proteins identified by various methods include specific proteins associated with the cellular cytoskeleton, which contribute to HBx-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. In addition, the cytoskeletal proteins deregulated by HBx are involved in cell morphogenesis, adhesion, migration and proliferation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the expression profiles of HBx-associated cytoskeletal proteins, as well as their complex functions and underlying mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis. Considering that the potential therapeutics for various types of tumors may function through the stabilization of cytoskeletal proteins in order to restrict cellular movement and limit intracellular processes, clarifying the mechanisms underlying protein-associated cytoskeleton dysregulation by HBx may provide novel possibilities and potent therapeutic targets for HBV-associated HCC.
