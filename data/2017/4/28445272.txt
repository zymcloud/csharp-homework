Hyperfibrinogenemia has been reported to be a predictor of poor prognosis in cancer patients, and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, survival remains uncertain and unpredictable. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between the level of plasma fibrinogen and overall survival in HCC patients.Overall, 308 patients with histologically proven HCC were included in our study. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictive risk factors for the rates of overall survival and tumor recurrence.Patients in the high-fibrinogen-level group were more likely to have advanced stage HCC, portal vein invasion, and tumors that were greater in number and larger in diameter than were patients in the low-fibrinogen-level group (all P
