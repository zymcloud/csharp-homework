Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) often present at stages where patients have limited treatment options. Use of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with yttrium-90 (Y-90) resin microspheres has progressed as data increasingly speak to its utility in patients with both intermediate and late stage disease in these cancers. In anticipation of the pending completion of several prospective randomized controlled multicenter studies exploring the use of Y-90 resin microspheres in primary liver cancers, this article outlines mechanisms involved in SIRT administration and reviews key efficacy and safety data that are currently available in the literature involving use of this therapy in both HCC and ICC.
