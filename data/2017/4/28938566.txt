Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been emerged as an indispensable part of endogenous RNA network. However, the expression significance of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rarely revealed. The aim of this study was to determine the circRNA expression profile in HCC, and to investigate their clinical significances and relevant mechanisms for cancer progression. The global circRNA expression profile in HCC was measured by circRNA microarray. Levels of one representative circRNAs, hsa_circ_0004018, were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of hsa_circ_0004018 in HCC were significantly lower compared with para-tumorous tissue (P<0.001). Our data further showed that lower expression of hsa_circ_0004018 was correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, tumor diameters, differentiation, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage and Tumor-node-metastasis stage. More importantly, we detected liver tissues from chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC patients; and found that hsa_circ_0004018 harbored HCC-stage-specific expression features in diverse chronic liver diseases (P<0.001). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve was up to 0.848 (95% CI=0.803-0.894, P<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 0.716 and 0.815, respectively. Finally, hsa_circ_0004018 might be involved in cancer-related pathways via interactions with miRNAs.
