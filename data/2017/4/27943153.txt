Background:Angiogenesis has been a major target of novel drug development in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is hypothesized that the combination of two antiangiogenic agents, sorafenib and bevacizumab, will provide greater blockade of angiogenesis.Objective:To determine the optimal dose, safety, and effectiveness of dual anti-angiogenic therapy with sorafenib and bevacizumab in patients with advanced HCC.Patients and methods:Patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC not amenable for surgery or liver transplant were eligible. The phase I starting dose level was bevacizumab 1.25 mg/kg day 1 and 15 plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (BID) days 1-28. In the phase II portion, patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or sorafenib 400 mg BID.Results:Seventen patients were enrolled in the phase I component. Dose-limiting toxicities included grade 3 hand/foot skin reaction, fatigue, hypertension, alanine/aspartate aminotransferase increase, dehydration, hypophosphatemia, creatinine increase, hypoglycemia, nausea/vomiting, and grade 4 hyponatremia. Seven patients were enrolled in the phase II component at the MTD: sorafenib 200 mg BID days 1-28 and bevacizumab 2.5 mg/kg every other week; 57% (4/7) had grade 3 AEs at least possibly related to treatment. No responses were observed in the phase II portion. Estimated median time to progression and survival were 8.6 months (95% CI: 0.4-16.3) and 13.3 months (95% CI 4.4 - not estimable), respectively.Conclusions:The MTD of the combination is sorafenib 200 mg twice daily on days 1-28 plus bevacizumab 2.5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. In the phase II portion of the trial, concerns regarding excessive toxicity, low efficacy, and slow enrollment led to discontinuation of the trial. (Clinical Trials ID: NCT00867321.).
