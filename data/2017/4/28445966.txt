Alpha virus M1 is an oncolytic virus that targets zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP)-defective cancer cells, and may be useful for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most of HCC patients have hepatitis and need long-term antiviral medication. Thus, it is necessary to clarify whether anti-virus medicines influence oncolytic effect of M1. We examined the effect of drugs used to treat hepatitis B/C on M1-mediated oncolysis in vitro and in vivo. Interferon (IFN)-α induces expression of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in HCC cells with moderate sensitivity to M1 virus. This leads to reduced replication of M1, and blocking of M1-mediated apoptosis. The antagonistic effect of IFN-α is positively related with the expressive level of ISGs. We also examined a population of 147 HCC patients. A total of 107 patients (73%) had low ZAP expression in liver tissues relative to adjacent tissues. Among these 107 patients, 77% were positive for hepatitis B and 2% were positive for hepatitis C. A combination of M1 virus and IFN should be avoided in those patients with HBV or HCV infection, of who ZAP expression is low but ISGs expression is moderate. In conclusion, this study provides a basis for anti-viral regimens for HCC patients with hepatitis B or C who are given oncolytic virus M1.
