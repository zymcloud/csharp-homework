Background:The incidence of brain metastases in breast cancer patients has increased in the last years. However, the knowledge about tumor cell invasion in the brain is still very limited. Based on our recent study on cDNA microarray data of breast cancer patients, we hypothesized that two enzymes involved in the hyaluronan metabolism, namely, hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) and hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1) are associated with brain metastases formation.Methods:Protein expression levels of hyaluronan, HAS2, and HYAL1 were analyzed in primary breast cancer, and metastatic tissue samples from different localizations (brain, bone, skin, liver, and lung) were included in four different cohorts by immunohistochemistry. Correlations of expression levels with clinical and pathological parameters were performed within the individual cohorts.Results:Higher HYAL1 expression was detected among primary tumors from patients with subsequent brain metastases compared with those without brain metastases (p = 0.011). Interestingly, brain metastatic tissue showed a significantly reduced HYAL1 expression compared with the corresponding primary tumor (p = 0.003). HYAL1 expression in brain metastases was also significantly lower than in skin, liver, and lung metastases. Further, hyaluronan staining in brain metastases was mainly located on the surface of the tumor cells, whereas in all other metastatic sites hyaluronan was only detected in the extracellular matrix. We could not show an association of HAS2 with the formation of brain metastases.Conclusions:In conclusion, our results suggest that the enzyme HYAL1 plays a role in tumor dissemination and brain-specific colonization, rather than in subsequent metastatic out-growth.
