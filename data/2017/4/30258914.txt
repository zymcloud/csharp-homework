The purpose of this study is to measure the expression of microRNA-4463 and microRNA-6087 between normal persons and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to clarify the meaning of them in the prognosis evaluation in HCC. Forty-five samples from healthy people and patients, who had been diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma before any treatment, were collected to study respectively. Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of miRNA-4463 and miRNA-6087 in the serum of control group and hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The expression of miR-4463 in the serum of HCC patients was significantly higher than that in control group (P 0.05). But there was a significant difference of different level of AFP in HCC (P
