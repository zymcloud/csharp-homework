One of the main difficulties in the management of patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is their poor response to available chemotherapy. This is the result of powerful mechanisms of chemoresistance (MOC) of quite diverse nature that usually act synergistically. The problem is often worsened by altered MOC gene expression in response to pharmacological treatment. Since CCA includes a heterogeneous group of cancers their genetic signature coding for MOC genes is also diverse; however, several shared traits have been defined. Some of these characteristics are shared with other types of liver cancer, namely hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoblastoma. An important goal in modern oncologic pharmacology is to develop novel strategies to overcome CCA chemoresistance either by increasing drug specificity, such as in targeted therapies aimed to inhibit receptors with tyrosine kinase activity, or to increase the amounts of active agents inside CCA cells by enhancing drug uptake or reducing efflux through export pumps.
