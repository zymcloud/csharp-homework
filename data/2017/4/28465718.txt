Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a system for interpreting and reporting of imaging features on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance (MR) studies in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). American College of Radiology (ACR) sustained the spread of LI-RADS to homogenizing the interpreting and reporting data of HCC patients. Diagnosis of HCC is due to the presence of major imaging features. Major features are imaging data used to categorize LI-RADS-3, LI-RADS-4, and LI-RADS-5 and include arterial-phase hyperenhancement, tumor diameter, washout appearance, capsule appearance and threshold growth. Ancillary are features that can be used to modify the LI-RADS classification. Ancillary features supporting malignancy (diffusion restriction, moderate T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity on hapatospecifc phase) can be used to upgrade category by one or more categories, but not beyond LI-RADS-4. Our purpose is reporting an overview and update of major and ancillary MR imaging features in assessment of HCC.
