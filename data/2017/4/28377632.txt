Identification of driver genes contributes to the understanding of cancer etiology and is imperative for the development of individualized therapies. Gene amplification is a major event in oncogenesis. Driver genes with tumor-specific amplification-dependent overexpression can be therapeutic targets. In this study, we aimed to identify amplification-dependent driver genes in 1,454 solid tumors, across more than 15 cancer types, by integrative analysis of gene expression and copy number. Amplification-dependent overexpression of 64 known driver oncogenes were found in 587 tumors (40%); genes frequently observed were MYC (25%) and MET (18%) in colorectal cancer; SKP2 (21%) in lung squamous cell carcinoma; HIST1H3B (19%) and MYCN (13%) in liver cancer; KIT (57%) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors; and FOXL2 (12%) in squamous cell carcinoma across tissues. Genomic aberrations in 138 known cancer driver genes and 491 established fusion genes were found in 1,127 tumors (78%). Further analyses of 820 cancer-related genes revealed 16 as potential driver genes, with amplification-dependent overexpression restricted to the remaining 22% of samples (327 tumors) initially undetermined genetic drivers. Among them, AXL, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, was recurrently overexpressed and amplified in sarcomas. Our studies of amplification-dependent overexpression identified potential drug targets in individual tumors.
