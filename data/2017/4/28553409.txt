Introduction:Three series of pyrazole, thiazole and 1,3,4-oxadiazole, derivatives were synthesized starting from 5-amino-4-(hydrazinocarbonyl)-3-methylthiophene-2-carboxamide (2).Methods:All compounds were investigated for their preliminary antimicrobial activity. They were proved to exhibit remarkable antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with insignificant activity towards Gram positive bacterial strains and fungi.Results:In-vitro testing of the new compounds on hepatitis-C virus (HCV) replication in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 infected with the virus utilizing the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCR) generally showed inhibition of the replication of HCV RNA (-) strands at low concentration, while, eight compounds; 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 9a, 9b, 10a and 11b proved to inhibit the replication of HCV RNA (+) and (-) strands at very low concentration range 0.08-0.36 Î¼g/mL.Conclusion:Compounds 7b and 11b displayed the highest anti-HCV and antimicrobial activities in this study.
