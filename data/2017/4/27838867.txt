Background The risk of pharmacokinetic interaction is important in HIV-infected cancer patients receiving concomitantly highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and anti-cancer systemic treatments. We aimed to evaluate the safety profile of raltegravir-based HAART in cancer patients receiving multi-kinase inhibitors (MKIs). Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective medical record review of adult, HIV-infected cancer patients treated in our institutions from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients eligible for the present analysis were those receiving a raltegravir-based HAART at the time of the initiation of a MKI for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Treatment-related toxicity, virological outcomes and pharmacokinetic profile of MKIs were examined. Results Twelve patients (7 males, median age 55 years) were identified. Seven had sarcoma/GIST, 3 had hepatocellular carcinoma, one had pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, and one had NSCLC. Patients received the following MKIs: imatinib (n = 3), sorafenib (n = 3), pazopanib (n = 3), sunitinib (n = 2) and erlotinib (n = 1). The mean CD4+ count at baseline was 929 cells/mm3, and 860 cells/mm3 after completion of MKI treatment. In all patients, HIV viral loads remained below the limit of detection (40 copies/ mm3) during the whole MKI treatment. No virological failure occurred. No unexpected or serious adverse event related either to raltegravir-based HAART or to MKIs was observed. The trough plasma concentrations of MKIs were assessed in 8 patients, and were found normal in all but one case (not related to raltegravir-based HAART). Conclusions The present data represent the first documentation of the concomitant use of raltegravir-containing HAART and MKIs in HIV-infected adult patients with advanced non-AIDS defining malignancies, with a reassuring safety profile.
