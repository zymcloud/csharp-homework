Background:For advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), surgical treatment after sorafenib induction has rarely been reported. We examined the survival benefit of additional surgical treatment in sorafenib-treated patients.Methods:Thirty-two advanced HCC patients were given sorafenib from July 2009 to July 2012, and we statistically analyzed the relevant predictive factors of the long-term survival. The institutional review board of Kumamoto University Hospital approved this study (Approval number 1038).Results:The median duration of sorafenib administration was 56.5 days (range 5-945). The cumulative overall survival rate was 44.6, 33.4, 26.0 and 17.8% at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years, respectively. The median survival time was 11.2 months. A survival of more than 3 years after the initiation of sorafenib induction was observed in seven patients, five of whom were subjected to additional surgical intervention. Additional surgery was the most significant factor predicting a survival exceeding 3 years (P Conclusions:A long-term survival might be obtained for select HCC patients given adequate additional surgical treatment, even after sorafenib induction.
