Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is an aggressive cancer. We investigated genetic response predictors for patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A cohort of 108 patients was recruited. Survival analysis showed that lower esophageal location of tumor, more advanced metastasis stage, and longer length of tumor were associated with poorer overall survival (adjusted P = 0.001, < 0.001, and 0.045, respectively), while the presence of complete/partial response to concurrent chemoradiotherapy was independently associated with better overall survival (adjusted P < 0.001). The GALNT14-rs9679162 "GG" genotype was associated with a lower rate of response (P = 0.014). Multivariate Cox-proportional hazards models also showed that the "GG" genotype was associated with a longer time to complete/partial response (adjusted P = 0.022), independent of leukocyte counts and gender. In conclusion, the presence of a complete/partial response to chemoradiotherapy was critical for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients to achieve better overall survival. The GALNT14-rs9679162 "GG" genotype was associated with a longer time to complete/partial response of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
