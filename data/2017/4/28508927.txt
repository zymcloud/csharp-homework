Liver X receptor (LXR) activation exerts an anti-tumor effect. However, whether the tumor LXR expression has prognostic significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient has not been addressed yet. Primary HCC and the adjacent non-tumor tissues were obtained from 169 patients who underwent routine curative surgical treatment. All patients were followed for prognosis analyses. Tumor LXR was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. In in vitro study, several HCC cell lines were cultured for cellular protein detection of LXR and other cytokines, including nuclear factor kappa (NFκB), Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and -9). Meanwhile, the invasion ability of cultured HCC cell lines was performed. We found that LXR expression status in tumor samples is associated with the clinical characteristics, such as tumor stage and metastasis, of HCC patients. Prognosis analysis shows that tumor LXR expression status is closely related to the post-operative outcome in HCC patients who underwent surgical treatment. Patients with low LXR expression have a significantly lower mean 5-year overall survival rate and mean overall survival period than those with high LXR level. Our in vitro data reveal that HCC cell lines had increased NF-κB, MMP2, MMP9 and invasive ability than normal cell line, which are suppressed by LXR activation via NFκB pathway. Our data suggest that LXR could be used as a biomarker for HCC prognosis. Further study is warranted to explore the molecular mechanism under which LXR regulates tumor behaves.
