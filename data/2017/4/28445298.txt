Barcelona clinic liver cancer-stage C (BCLC-C) encompasses a broad spectrum of tumor burdens, liver function statuses, patient prognoses, and treatment strategies. Currently, sorafenib is the only recommended treatment for patients with BCLC-C and outcomes remain suboptimal. The aims of this study were to assess the heterogeneity of BCLC-C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases, propose a novel subclassification for these cases, and suggest optimal treatment strategies other than sorafenib.We retrospectively analyzed 196 consecutive BCLC-C HCC patients who were diagnosed and treated between January 2008 and December 2015.All 196 patients were classified according to the modified Union for International Cancer Control (Stage I, 0.0%; Stage II, 8.2%; Stage III, 64.3%; Stage IVA, 21.9%; and Stage IVB, 5.6%) and American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging systems (Stage I, 0.0%; Stage II, 16.3%; Stage IIIA, 27.6%; Stage IIIB, 49.5%; Stage IIIC, 1.5%; Stage IVA, 1.0%; and Stage IVB, 4.1%). First-line treatment modalities included surgical resection (8.7%), transarterial chemoembolization (49.5%), hepatic arterial infusion therapy (5.6%), sorafenib therapy (9.2%), radiotherapy (9.2%), and best supportive care (10.7%). In univariate analysis, Child-Pugh score, tumor size, distant metastasis, multinodular or infiltrative/diffuse type of HCC, main portal vein invasion, hepatic vein invasion, and bile duct invasion were significantly associated with survival (P
