Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of HCC. Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of the tumor inhibitor miR-340 is significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues. However, the precise biological role of miR-340-5p in HBV-HCC and its molecular mechanism of action remain unknown.Results:Expression of miR-340-5p was downregulated in HBV-associated HCC liver tissue and HBV-infected cells, facilitating migration of liver cancer cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 was found to be a direct functional target of miR-340-5p. The regulation of STAT3 expression by miR-340-5p was assessed using qRT-PCR and western blotting, and the effects of exogenous miR-340-5p and STAT3 on the migration of HBV-infected cells were evaluated in vitro using Transwell® and wound-healing assays. The expression of E-cadherin and vimentin, associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, was also assessed using Western blotting after transfection of miR-340-5p mimics and/or STAT3 expression vectors. Overexpression of STAT3 resulted in rescue of HBV effects, decreased E-cadherin expression, increased vimentin expression, and ultimately, enhanced cell migration. Re-introduction of the STAT3 CDS led to marked reversal of the inhibition of cell migration in HBV-infected cells mediated by miR-340-5p.Conclusions:Hepatitis B virus promotes the migration of liver cancer cells by downregulating miR-340-5p expression to induce STAT3 overexpression. Our results show that STAT3 plays a key role in regulating cell migration in HBV-HCC involving miR-340-5p.
