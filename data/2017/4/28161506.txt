The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade is a key oncogenic signal transduction pathway activated in many types of tumours in humans. Sorafenib, the medical treatment of reference against advanced stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), inhibits the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade in HCC cells. Based on previous studies suggesting that this cascade is an important target of sorafenib in HCC cells, we explored its regulation using mathematical modelling and ordinary differential equations. We analysed the dynamic regulation of the core components of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade in three human HCC cell lines (Huh7, Hep3B and PLC/PRF5) with heterogeneous responses to sorafenib. In silico predictions derived from our mathematical model suggested that the disappearance of phosphorylated MEK and ERK proteins catalysed by cellular phosphatases is an essential mechanism underlying the anti-ERK efficacy of sorafenib in HCC cells. This prediction was experimentally validated using specific inhibitors of the phosphatases PP2A (Protein Phosphatase 2A) and DUSP1/6 (Dual-specificity phosphatases 1/6). These findings highlight an unexpected mode of action of sorafenib on the kinome of HCC cells, and open new perspectives regarding the therapeutic targeting of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade in this context.
