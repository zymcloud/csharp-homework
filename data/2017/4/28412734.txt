Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the third most deadly disease worldwide and HBV is the major factor in Asia and Africa. We conducted 9 WGS (whole genome sequencing) analyses for matched samples of tumor, adjacent non-tumor tissues and normal blood samples of HCC patients from three HBV positive patients. We then validated the mutations identified in a larger cohort of 177 HCC patients. We found that the number of the unique somatic mutations (average of 59,136) in tumor samples is significantly less than that in adjacent non-tumor tissues (average 83, 633). We discovered that the TP53 R249S mutation occurred in 7.7% of the HCC patients, and it was significantly associated with poor diagnosis. In addition, we found that the L104P mutation in the VCX gene (Variable charge, X-linked) was absent in white blood cell samples, but present at 11.1% frequency in the adjacent tissues and increased to 14.6% in HCC tissues, suggesting that this mutation might be a tumor driver gene driving HCC carcinogenesis. Finally, we identified a TK1-RNU7 fusion, which would result in a deletion of 103 amino acids from its C-terminal. The frequencies of this fusion event decreased from the adjacent tissues (29.2%) to the tumors (16.7%), suggesting that a truncated thymidine Kinase1 (TK1) caused by the fusion event might be deleterious and be selected against during tumor progression. The three-way comparisons allow the identification of potential driver mutations of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our dataset provides the research community a valuable dataset for identifying dynamic changes of mutation profiles and driver mutations for HCC.
