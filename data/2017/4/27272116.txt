Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of yttrium-90 radioembolization on the outcome of Asian patients with early to advanced stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Sixty-two patients were screened and 50 patients (80.6%) were eligible. Response was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage was A in 40% of patients, B in 24%, and C in 36%; 66% of patients had hepatitis B virus infections. According to RECIST criteria, partial responses occurred in 40% of patients, and stable disease was achieved in 46%. Tumor response was significantly associated with BCLC stage (P = 0.003). The median overall time to progression was 5.8 months (range, 0.9-46.1 months). Follow-up treatments after radioembolization were carried out in 31 patients due to remnant HCC (n = 18) or HCC progression (n = 13). The median overall survival was 40.9 months (95% confidence interval, 10.2-71.6 months). Treatment was tolerable except for one lung toxicity and two hepatic toxicities.Conclusion:Yttrium-90 radioembolization appears to be well tolerated and effective in Asian patients with BCLC stage A-C HCC. Follow-up treatments after radioembolization can be safely provided.
