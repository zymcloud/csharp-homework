There is diversity in clinical outcome of Helicobacter pylori infection in different regions. Microbial, host and environmental factors seem to be reason of such variation. Considering microbial factors, we studied H. pylori genotypes and their association with clinical feature of the infection. Overall 160 H. pylori-positive patients were enrolled in this study. Clinical information and biopsy were collected from each patient. The presence of the major virulence genes were determined by PCR. Regardless to clinical outcomes, vacA, cagA, cagE, oipA, iceA1, babA2 and babB genes was positive in 100%, 69%, 51%, 55%, 26%,78% and 28% of 160 strains respectively. The s1m2 was more common vacA allels and s1a and m1a were predominant s and m regions. In patient with gastric cancer (GC), the oipA was less frequent while the iceA1 was the most common. The babA2 was common in all patient groups. The babB was significantly observed in strains isolated from patients with GC. There were significant association among cagA status with presence of vacAs1, vacAm2, cagE, oipA, iceA1 and babA2. Presence of the babB and oipA was connected with higher and lower risk for GC respectively. There was no association between the cagA, vacA, cagE or iceA status and clinical outcome in patients in Iran. We showed that presence of the babB and iceA1 were significantly connected with higher risk for gastric cancer development in Iranian dyspeptic patients while H. pylori isolates with positive oipA had little threat for leading patients to cancer.
