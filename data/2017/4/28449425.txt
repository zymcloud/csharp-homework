Background/aims:Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) measurement is commonly included in a health check-up program in Korea. However, its benefits remain uncertain. We analyzed whether AFP measurement should be included in a general health check-up program to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 36,552 adults aged 18 years or older-who participated in a routine health examination including AFP determination between January 2009 and December 2009 at the Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical Center, South Korea-were analyzed. High risk of HCC was defined as positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C virus antibody or having liver cirrhosis.Results:AFP level >10 ng/mL was observed in 27 participants (0.1%) and primary liver cancer was diagnosed in 9 patients (6 HCC and 3 cholangiocarcinoma). Among 1,619 participants with high risk factors of HCC, AFP level >10 ng/mL was observed in 16 participants, of which, 4 diagnoses were made. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of AFP for HCC was 0.66, 0.99, 0.25 and 0.99, respectively, for high risk participants. Among 34,933 participants without risk factors for HCC, 11 patients (Conclusions:AFP elevation was rare in participants without risk factors for HCC, and was unable to screen for HCC in this population. We discourage routine AFP measurements for asymptomatic adults without risk factors of HCC.
