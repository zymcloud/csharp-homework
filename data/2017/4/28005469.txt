Programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression has been revealed to be upregulated on T cells and contributes to T cell exhaustion in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this study, we investigated the dynamic expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), the ligand of PD-1, on circulating CD14+ monocytes and CD19+ B cells of HBV-infected patients at the stages of chronic HBV (CHB) infection, liver cirrhosis (LC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. The results showed that compared with healthy controls, the levels of PD-L1 expression on CD14+ and CD19+ populations were both upregulated in CHB, LC, and HCC groups. Although there was no significant difference of PD-L1 expression on CD14+ population among three disease groups, further analysis demonstrated that the frequency of CD14+PD-L1+ population was negatively correlated with HBV DNA load, the levels of alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), respectively, at CHB stage, while it did not present significant correlation with such parameters at LC stage and was only positively correlated with HBV DNA load at HCC stage. Similarly, the levels of PD-L1 expression on CD19+ population also did not present much difference among three disease groups. Intriguingly, the frequencies of CD19+PD-L1+ population at CHB and LCC stages were both positively correlated with the levels of ALT and AST, but they were not significantly correlated with HBV DNA load. Thereby, the current study elucidated the dynamics of PD-L1 expression on monocytes and B cells, along with the dynamic regulation of PD-1 on T cells, which had a close relationship during the progression of HBV infection. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that in the course of HBV infection development, PD-L1 expression on CD14+ monocytes and CD19+ B cells varied and significantly correlated with clinical parameters, which could be utilized as a potential clinical indicator.
