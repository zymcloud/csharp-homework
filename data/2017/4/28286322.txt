Several studies have shown that secreted phosphoprotein 24kD (Spp24) inhibits tumor growth. However, the effects of spp24 on hepatocellular carcinoma are not quite clear. In this study, we observed the inhibitory effect of spp24 on hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo. A subcutaneous hepatocellular carcinoma mice model was established by using Hep G2 cells. After sacrifice at day 40, tumor growth was assessed and tumor cell apoptosis and tumor cells proliferation were assessed by TUNEL assay and immunochemical analysis, respectively. BMP2 slightly stimulated the subcutaneous tumor growth compared with the control. Spp24 significantly inhibited the tumor growth and also abolished the BMP2-induced tumor growth (p
