Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare in New World primates. We report the gross, microscopical, and immunocytochemical features of a spontaneous HCC in a free-living marmoset (Callithrix sp.). Hepatitis B and C virus and aflatoxin immunohistochemistry were negative; however, concomitant intra- and extrahepatic biliary trematodiasis could have played a role.
