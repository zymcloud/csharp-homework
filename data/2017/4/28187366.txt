We sought to determine whether a combination of purified n-3 fatty acids (n-3) and SC-560 (SC), a cyclooxygenase-1-specific inhibitor, is effective in ameliorating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in obesity. Female wild-type mice were fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HF) supplemented with n-3 in the presence or absence of SC. Mice treated with SC alone exhibited no change in liver lipids, whereas n-3-fed mice tended to have lower hepatic lipids. Mice given n-3+SC had significantly lower liver lipids compared with HF controls indicating enhanced lipid clearance. Total and sulfated bile acids were significantly higher only in n-3+SC-treated mice compared with chow diet (CD) controls. Regarding mechanisms, the level of pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor regulating drug/bile detoxification, was significantly higher in mice given n-3 or n-3+SC. Studies in precision-cut liver slices and in cultured hepatoma cells showed that n-3+SC enhanced not only the expression/activation of PXR and its target genes but also the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), another regulator of bile synthesis/clearance, indicating that n-3+SC can induce both PXR and FXR. The mRNA level of FGFR4 which inhibits bile formation showed a significant reduction in Huh 7 cells upon n-3 and n-3+SC treatment. PXR overexpression in hepatoma cells confirmed that n-3 or SC each induced the expression of PXR target genes and in combination had an enhanced effect. Our findings suggest that combining SC with n-3 potentiates its lipid-lowering effect, in part, by enhanced PXR and/or altered FXR/FGFR4 signaling.
