Sorafenib (NexavarÂ®) is currently the only systemic agent approved for use in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its approval was based on the results of the pivotal SHARP and Sorafenib Asia-Pacific (AP) trials in Child-Pugh (CP) class A patients with advanced HCC, which showed significantly longer median overall survival (OS) and time to radiological progression (TTP) with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily than with placebo, with no significant between-group difference in the median time to symptomatic progression (TTSP). Subsequent results from real-world studies such as GIDEON also support the use of sorafenib in HCC, including in carefully selected CP class B patients, although the median OS achieved in these patients appears relatively short. Sorafenib has a well characterized tolerability and safety profile, with strategies available to prevent and manage adverse effects such as hand-foot skin reactions. In conclusion, sorafenib remains an important option for the treatment of HCC.
