The present study investigated ubiquitin specific peptidase 39 (USP39) gene knockdown on SMMC-7721 cells in vitro and in vivo, and the role of USP39 in regulating the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were constructed, which targeted the USP39 gene and control sequences were synthesized and inserted into a pGCSIL-GFP lentiviral vector. The full length of USP39 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into pEGFP-N2, and the recombinant plasmids were transfected into cells. Knockdown efficiency and upregulation of USP39 was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. The impact of USP39 on the growth of SMMC-7721 cells in vitro was examined using an MTT assay, colony formation, flow cytometry (FCM) and immunohistochemical staining. The impact of USP39 on the growth of SMMC-7721 cells in vivo was examined by assessing tumorigenicity in nude mice. Western blotting was performed to examine the mechanism of USP39 regulation on SMMC-7721 cell growth. Recombinant vectors containing specific and scrambled USP39 siRNA sequences were constructed and transfected into SMMC-7721 cells. USP39 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in SMMC-7721 cells, while upregulation of USP39 promoted the growth of tumor cells. FCM indicated that USP39 knockdown led to G2/M arrest and induced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. USP39 knockdown inhibited xenograft tumor growth in nude mice and led to the downregulation of the transcription factor Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1). Gene expression of FoxM1 targets, including polo-like kinase 1, cyclin B1 and centromere protein A also decreased following USP39 knockdown. The results suggest that knockdown of USP39 inhibits the growth of HCC in vitro and in vivo, potentially through the induction of G2/M arrest by regulating the pre-mRNA splicing of FoxM1.
