Methotrexate (MTX) has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and other dermatological diseases for more than 50 years. However, there is limited evidence regarding its effect, dose and monitoring, and a lack of consensus regarding how the drug should be used in daily practice. Although the use of MTX is governed by guidelines, such as the European S3-Guidelines and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, it is important to discuss and adjust these guidelines to national standards. An expert meeting was held in Denmark at the end of 2014, in order to reach consensus regarding the use of MTX in dermatological practice in Denmark. Participants included dermatologists, hepatologists, paediatricians, clinical biochemists and a rheumatologist. Topics discussed were: liver disease monitoring, teratogenic effects of MTX, risk of cancer, and use of MTX in children. We report here the conclusions of this expert meeting regarding use of MTX in dermatological practice.
