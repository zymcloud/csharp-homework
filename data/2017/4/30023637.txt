In recent years, the use of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in biomedical applications has shown an unprecedented boost along with simultaneous expansion of rapid, high-yielding, and sustainable AgNP synthesis methods that can deliver particles with well-defined characteristics. The present study demonstrates the potential of metal-tolerant soil fungal isolate Penicillium shearii AJP05 for the synthesis of protein-capped AgNPs. The particles were characterized using standard techniques, namely, UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The anticancer activity of the biosynthesized AgNPs was analyzed in two different cell types with varied origin, for example, epithelial (hepatoma) and mesenchymal (osteosarcoma). The biological NPs (bAgNPs) with fungal-derived outer protein coat were found to be more cytotoxic than bare bAgNPs or chemically synthesized AgNPs (cAgNPs). Elucidation of the molecular mechanism revealed that bAgNPs induce cytotoxicity through elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and induction of apoptosis. Upregulation of autophagy and activation of JNK signaling were found to act as a prosurvival strategy upon bAgNP treatment, whereas ERK signaling served as a prodeath signal. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy increased the production of ROS, resulting in enhanced cell death. Finally, bAgNPs were also found to sensitize cells with acquired resistance to cisplatin, providing valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of bAgNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a holistic idea about the molecular mechanisms behind the cytotoxic activity of protein-capped AgNPs synthesized using a metal-tolerant soil fungus.
