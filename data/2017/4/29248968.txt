We found a HLA class II histocompatibility antigen gene, DQ alpha 1 chain (HLA-DQA1), that was expressed more than 9-fold higher in high-load hepatitis C virus (HCV) livers than low-load HCV livers using transcriptomics of chronic HCV-infected livers. To further investigate this finding, we examined which cells were positive for HLA-DQA1 and what liver immune responses were different between HCV-high and -low livers. HLA-DQA1-positive cells were significantly increased in the HCV-high group, and most positive cells were identified as non-parenchymal sinusoid cells and lymphocytic infiltrates in the portal area. Parenchymal hepatocytes were negative for HLA-DQA1. HLA-DQA1-positive cells in the liver sinusoid were positive for CD68 (macrophages or Kupffer cells); those in the lymphocytic infiltrates were positive for CD20 (B cells) or CD3 (T cells). mRNA levels of antigen-presenting cell (APC) markers such as CD68 and CD11c were significantly upregulated in the HCV-high group and were correlated with HLA-DQA mRNA levels. CD8B mRNA (CD8+ T cells) was upregulated in both HCV-positive livers compared with HCV-negative livers, whereas CD154 mRNA (CD4+ T helper cell) was upregulated in the HCV-high group compared with the HCV-low group. The immune regulatory molecules FOXP3 mRNA (regulatory T cell, T reg) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) mRNA were significantly increased in the HCV-high group. HCV-high livers had two molecular immune responses: increased APC numbers and adaptive immunity and the induction of immune tolerance. The local hepatic imbalance of contradictory immune responses might be responsible for high HCV loads.
