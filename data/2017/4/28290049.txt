Purpose of review:This review aims to assess the epidemiological evidence for a link between type 2 diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma and to investigate possible pathophysiological mechanisms.Recent findings:The presence of type 2 diabetes significantly increases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, and treatment with metformin may be associated with a lower risk. Treatment with insulin and sulphonylureas may be associated with increased risk. The pathophysiology underlying development of hepatocellular carcinoma in this context is complex and is likely to involve increased proinflammatory mediators, oxidative stress, JNK-1 activation, increased IGF-1 activity, altered gut microbiota and immunomodulation. Hepatocellular carcinoma incidence is increasing and this is likely to be linked to the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes, obesity and the metabolic syndrome. These conditions increase the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, and a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology may help with the development of novel treatments.
