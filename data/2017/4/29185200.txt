Background:Methylenetetrahyfrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the key enzyme for one carbon and folate metabolism. Previous studies have drawn different conclusions about the relationship between the mutation of MTHFR and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence. MTHFR polymorphisms' influence on liver transplantation for HCC recurrence has yet not been reported. Aim of this study was to clarify the impact of MTHFR polymorphism on hepatocarcinogenesis and the prognosis of liver transplant recipient with HCC.Methods:This study enrolled 244 HCC patients and 487 healthy individuals in Chinese Han population to analyze the influence of MTHFR polymorphism on HCC susceptibility first. Furthermore, this research choose another 100 donors' and 104 recipients' specimens to detect the association between polymorphism of MTHFR and post-transplant HCC recurrence.Result:rs1801131 polymorphism A to C was associated with the occurrence of HCC in Chinese Han population (p Conclusion:This study demonstrated that MTHFR polymorphism was associated with HCC occurrence and post-transplant HCC recurrence. rs1801131 mutation A to C is a valuable molecular biomarker for predicting HCC occurrence in Chinese Han population. Donor MTHFR rs1801133 C to T polymorphism could present as a promising prognostic biomarkers for HCC recurrence in liver transplant recipients.
