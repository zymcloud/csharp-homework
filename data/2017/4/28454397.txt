Sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) is an oncogenic kinase that is responsible for the phosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Mounting evidence suggests that Sphk1 serves a crucial role in the proliferation and development of a variety of human cancer cells. However, the role of Sphk1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the expression of Sphk1 was examined in 127 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HCC tissues using immunohistochemistry, and its clinical implications and prognostic significance were analyzed. As a result, the expression of Sphk1 in HCC tissue was revealed to be significantly higher than in normal tissue (P
