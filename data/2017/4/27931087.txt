We report the case of a 40-year-old woman who recovered from a diffuse metastatic renal cell carcinoma that developed from a kidney allograft. She was successfully treated by the induction of tumor rejection. Immunosuppression was discontinued, and transplant nephrectomy was deliberately delayed based on the expectation that the tumor mass would trigger the alloimmune response, which was stimulated with pegylated interferon-Î±-2a. Three years later, the patient remained in complete remission. Despite this severe context, the present case shows that the poor prognosis of allograft metastatic renal cell carcinoma could be dramatically reversed by taking advantage of the donor tumor origin to actively induce a specific alloimmune rejection of the tumor.
