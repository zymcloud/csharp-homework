Esophageal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and it has a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms of esophageal cancer progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance and biological function of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in esophageal cancer. Expression of TRAF6 in esophageal cancer was examined, and its correlation with clinicopathological factors and patient prognosis was analyzed. A series of functional and mechanism assays were performed to further investigate the function and underlying mechanisms in esophageal cancer. Expression of TRAF6 was highly elevated in esophageal cancer tissues, and patients with high TRAF6 expression have a significantly shorter survival time than those with low TRAF6 expression. Furthermore, loss-of-function experiments showed that knockdown of TRAF6 significantly reduced the migration and invasion abilities of esophageal cancer cells. Moreover, the pro-oncogenic effects of TRAF6 in esophageal cancer were mediated by the upregulation of AEP and MMP2. Altogether, our data suggest that high expression of TRAF6 is significant for esophageal cancer progression, and TRAF6 indicates poor prognosis in esophageal cancer patients, which might be a novel prognostic biomarker or potential therapeutic target in esophageal cancer.
