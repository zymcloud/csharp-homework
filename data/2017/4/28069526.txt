Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with Medicaid or no health insurance have inferior survival compared with privately insured patients. Safety-net hospitals that care for these patients are often criticized for their inferior outcomes. We hypothesized that HCC survival was related to appropriate surgical management.Study design:The American College of Surgeons National Cancer Database was queried for patients diagnosed with HCC (n = 111,481) from 1998 to 2010. Hospitals were stratified according to safety-net burden, defined as the percentage of patients with Medicaid or no insurance. The highest quartile, representing safety-net hospitals, was compared with lower-burden hospitals with regard to patient demographics, cancer presentation, surgical management, and survival.Results:Patients at safety-net hospitals were less often white, had less income and education, but presented with similar stage HCC. Safety-net hospital patients were less likely to receive surgery (odds ratio 0.77; p Conclusions:Vulnerable patients with HCC are commonly treated at safety-net hospitals, are less likely to receive curative surgery, and have worse short-term outcomes. However, safety-net patients who can endure liver surgery have a similar prognosis as patients at nonsafety-net hospitals. Providing equal access to surgery may improve survival for vulnerable populations of HCC patients.
