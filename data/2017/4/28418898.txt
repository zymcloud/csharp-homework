Polymorphisms in the phospholipase C epsilon (PLCE) 1 gene play a crucial role in the development and progression of several types of cancer. The present study investigated the prognostic significance of PLCE1 gene polymorphisms and expression combined with serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) level in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by sequencing DNA isolated from surgically resected tumor samples of 421 HBV-related HCC patients, and expression profiles were generated based on the GSE14520 dataset. A joint-effects analysis of PLCE1 haplotypes (Ars2274223Crs3765524; Grs2274223Trs3765524) with AFP level stratified at 20 ng/ml showed a significant association with overall survival(OS) of HBV-related HCC patients(log-rank P=0.0003). Patients with AC and GT haplotypes with AFP level ≥ 20 ng/ml had an increased risk of death as compared to those with the AC haplotype and AFP level
