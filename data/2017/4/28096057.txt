Background:Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a widely accepted procedure for superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN) because of a high complete resection rate. However, there were a few reports about the long-term outcomes of these patients due to short follow-up periods.Aims:We aimed to evaluate the 5-year survival after ESD for superficial ESCN.Methods:This was a retrospective cohort study performed at a single institution. Between 2006 and 2009, 94 patients with superficial ESCN underwent ESD. Eighty-three patients (93.3%) who had completed an extended period of observation of at least 5 years were enrolled. The main outcomes were the 5-year survival rates. The secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence rate of metachronous ESCN, and the clinical outcomes.Results:The 5-year relative overall survival rate was 99.0%, whereas the cause specific survival rate was 100% during 72.9 months of median follow up period. Subgroup analysis showed that the 5year survival of patients with EP/LPM and MM/SM1 (submucosal invasion ≤200μm) were 100% and 89.0%, respectively. The cumulative incidence rate of metachronous ESCN at 5 years was 16.8%.Conclusion:ESD for superficial ESCN is a curative treatment with a favorable 5-year survival rate.
