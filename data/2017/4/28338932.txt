Advanced renal cell carcinoma and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are malignancies without effective therapeutics currently. Ursolic acid (UA) has been previously reported to have anti-cancer effects in multiple solid tumors. In order to develop more potent anti-cancer reagents, FZU-03,010 based on the chemical structure of UA were synthesized. The results demonstrated that, compared with UA, FZU-03,010 could suppress renal cancer cell 786-0 and TNBC cell HCC1806 cell viability more potently. Furthermore, FZU-03,010 could induce G1 cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis more efficiently than UA. FZU-03,010 could also inhibit signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation, induce the expression of cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21 and p27) and promote cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that the UA derivative FZU-03,010 is more potent in inhibiting cancer cell survival, and FZU-03,010 has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic for renal cell cancers and TNBCs.
