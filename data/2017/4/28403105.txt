This study aims to refine the designation for single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) >5 cm by comparing the postresection prognosis of these patients with those who have a single-tumor ≤5 cm and those with stage B.Patients with a single-tumor were classified into subgroups based on diameter. Of the 1132 patients analyzed, 426 had a single-tumor >2 and ≤5 cm; 229, a single-tumor >5 and ≤8 cm; 52, a single-tumor >8 and 5 cm was significantly lower than among patients with a single-tumor >2 and ≤5 cm (P ≤ .001), but significantly higher than among patients with clearly stage B (P ≤ .001). Patients with a single-tumor >5 and ≤8 cm showed lower OS than patients with a single-tumor >2 and ≤5 cm (P 8 and 5 and ≤8 cm (P = .033 and .006), and similar OS to patients with stage B (P = .323).Patients with a single-tumor >5 and ≤8 cm may be assigned to a new stage between early and intermediate. Patients with a single-tumor >8 cm may be assigned to intermediate stage.
