Two new xanthones, gambogollic acid (1), epigambogollic acid (2), together with three rare compounds, gambogellic acid (3), epigambogellic acid (4) and gambogic acid (5), were isolated from the processed gamboge. The new structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis. And the cytotoxicity of these five compounds was evaluated against human hepatoma carcinoma and human lung adenocarcinoma cell. Two new compounds showed excellent antitumor activity. All five compounds exhibited inhibitory effect against SMMC-7221cell and A549 cell.
