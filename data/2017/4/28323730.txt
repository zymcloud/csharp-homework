Malignant neoplasms frequently cause vertebral metastases. Traditionally, either image-guided percutaneous biopsy or open biopsy has been performed for sampling specimens for the definitive diagnosis. We herein report a case with suspected multiple metastases but unknown primary, who underwent endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal lymph nodes with negative results by rapid onsite cytologic evaluation, followed by the transesophageal approach with the ultrasound bronchoscope for the vertebral body lesion at the same setting that provided a definitive diagnosis of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.
