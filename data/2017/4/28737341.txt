Objective: Only limited recent information is available concerning the regional incidence and prevalence of chronic hepatitis C (CHC), but this information is critical for optimal definition of public health policies for the management of hepatitis C. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of mapping potential regional differences in the prevalence of CHC and its complications using data from a health administrative database. Methods: The 2012 PMSI MCO hospital database contains information on diagnosis and healthcare resource use, essentially related to all hospitalisations in France. Hospital stays related to CHC were identified on the basis of ICD-10 disease codes. Hospital stays were classified according to stage of liver disease: non-cirrhotic liver disease, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All study variables were documented for each French administrative region in 2012. Results: In 2012, 12,040 patients were hospitalised in France for a reason related to CHC, corresponding to a standardised age- and gender- adjusted prevalence rate of 19.3/100,000 persons. The highest prevalences of CHC and HCC were observed in the Ile de France, Alsace and Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur regions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the PMSI database to identify regional differences in the prevalence of CHC. This information may be useful for planning regional healthcare resource provision for CHC.
