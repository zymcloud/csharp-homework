Introduction:Hepatobiliary disease is becoming a major public health problem, and recent data suggest that the burden of liver disease is higher than previously thought. Our aim was to quantify the mortality from hepatobiliary disease in Portugal and to compare this with the mortality related o other causes over a 7-year period (2006-2012).Materials and methods:A statistical analysis of mortality data according to cause, sex, age, and region from the National Statistics Institute in Portugal was carried out. The data related to 14 causes of death, the most frequent of which were alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (International Classification of Diseases code K70), unspecified cirrhosis of liver (UCL) (K74.6), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (C22.0), unspecified malignant neoplasm of liver (C22.9), and cholangiocarcinoma (C22.1).Results:Between 2006 and 2012, 18,279 deaths (24.5/100,000) from hepatobiliary disease were registered in Portugal, constituting the 8th leading cause of death. The main causes of death from hepatobiliary disease were ALD (7.1/100,000), UCL (5.5/100,000), and HCC (4.3/100,000), with a male predominance (72%). ALD was the main aetiology in younger age groups (40-65 years), while primary neoplasms of the liver and the intrahepatic bile ducts were predominant in the elderly (>80 years). The mortality related to HCC increased by 66% between 2006 and 2012.Conclusion:These data outline the burden of hepatobiliary disease in Portugal (8th cause of death) and highlight a potential impact on economic productivity.
