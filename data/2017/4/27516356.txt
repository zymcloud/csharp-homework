Objectives:To evaluate the clinical outcome and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with segmental or subsegmental portal vein tumour thrombus (sPVTT) in patients with preserved hepatic function, and to address the efficacy of additional chemoinfusion after TACE (TACE+CI).Methods:From January 2003 to December 2012, TACE was conducted on 81 patients with Child-Pugh score ≤7 who had HCC with sPVTT. Thirty-one of them underwent TACE+CI. The overall survival (OS) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were evaluated. The efficacy of TACE+CI was appraised after adjustment with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).Results:The OS after TACE (median, 15.5 months) was significantly related with aspartate aminotransferase (hazard ratio [HR], 1.011), modified Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage D (HR, 2.841), extrahepatic spread (HR, 4.862), and TACE+CI (HR, .367). The SAE incidence was significantly associated with modified BCLC stages (HR, 10.174 [proper-C] and 24.000 [D]). After IPTW adjustment, TACE+CI significantly improved OS (p = .028; HR, .511), but the SAE incidence was not significantly altered (p = .737; HR, .819).Conclusions:TACE can be an effective and safe treatment option for HCC with sPVTT in patients with preserved hepatic function. Furthermore, additional chemoinfusion can enhance the therapeutic efficacy while maintaining the safety.Key points:• TACE is effective and safe for treating HCC with sPVTT. • Modified BCLC stages can stratify the risk and benefit of TACE. • Additional chemoinfusion can enhance the therapeutic efficacy while maintaining the safety.
