Background/aim:The behavior of tumor markers in biliary tract malignancies is not well-known and has been scarcely studied. Such markers could play important roles in diagnostic and prognostic schemes as well as in decision-making about the best treatment strategies. This study analyzed the preoperative serum levels of conventional tumor markers (AFP, CEA, CA 19-9, CA 72-4), proliferative marker thymidine kinase (TK) and cytokeratins (TPA, TPS and CYFRA 21.1) in patients with gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma (Klatskin) and cholangiocellular carcinoma, in relation to the patient prognosis. The study aimed in finding the role of tumor markers in not properly investigated diseases, where their importance is often marginalized.Materials and methods:The study included 43 patients, who underwent either radical surgical procedure (n=21) or explorative laparotomy without any surgical treatment (n=22) for gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma (Klatskin tumor) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (24, 8 and 11 patients, respectively) between 2003 and 2010 at our Department. The association of serum tumor markers and patients' prognosis were assessed for the entire cohort and for each cancer type and also with regard to treatment (radical surgery versus explorative laparotomy). Overall survival (OS) and disease-free interval (DFI) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and statistically evaluated using the LogRank test. DFI was computed only in the subgroup of patients treated by radical surgery.Results:The statistical analysis of tumor markers revealed TK as a poor prognostic factor for shorter DFI (HR=3.5, 95%CI=0.6-21.3, p<0.05) and also OS (HR=4.6, 95%CI=1.0-4.7, p<0.05) in patients with gallbladder carcinoma treated with radical surgery. TPS was demonstrated as a poor prognostic factor for OS in patients with gallbladder carcinoma (HR=12.7, 95%CI=1.4-117.7, p<0.05). CEA was proven to be a factor of poor prognosis with shorter OS in patients after explorative laparotomy for all cumulated studied diagnoses (HR=9.8, 95%CI=1.05-92.7, p<0.05).Conclusion:The results of this study suggested the importance of tumor markers for assessment of prognosis (OS or DFI) in patients with gallbladder carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, and cholangiocellular carcinoma.
