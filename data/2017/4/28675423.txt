The advent of mass spectrometry-based analytical technologies coupled with multivariate statistical methods offer tremendous new opportunities for understanding the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of multicomponent herbal medicines (HMs). We recently proposed a poly-PK strategy to characterize the concentration-time profile and the metabolic response profile of multicomponent HMs using an integrated phytochemical and metabolomics approach. Here, we provided the first example of the poly-PK strategy, in which we simultaneously characterized the PK as well as the metabolic response profiles of a Chinese HM, Huangqi decoction (HQD, consisting of Radix Astragali and Radix Glycyrrhizae), in healthy Chinese volunteers. Using the poly-PK approach, we identified 56 HQD-derived compounds and 292 biotransformed HQD metabolites in human plasma. Additionally, we acquired the concentration-time profiles of these plasma HQD metabolites and correlated them with a plasma metabolomics profile consisting of 166 human endogenous metabolites that were significantly altered in response to HQD intervention.
