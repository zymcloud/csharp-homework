Clinical observations have shown that the boundary of tumor ablation is often less than safe border and that the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may probably accelerate its recurrence and metastasis. RFA can cause the formation of a transition zone between normal liver tissues and necrotic coagulation, where blood stagnation and thrombosis expose residual cancer cells to a hypoxic microenvironment. As the blocked vessels are slowly reperfused, the oxygen supply is gradually restored. Here, HCC cells underwent heat treatment and were cultured under hypoxic conditions to mimic the aforementioned situation, and morphological changes were observed in the surviving cells. Compared with their parental cells, hypoxic HCC cells showed changes that include enhanced invasive, metastatic, and chemoresistant abilities as well as mesenchymal characteristics. There was also a higher percentage of stem-like cells. However, either improving the hypoxic microenvironment or silencing hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α signaling significantly reduced the invasive, metastatic, and chemoresistant potential and reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition to varying degrees. Together, these results indicated that a sustained hypoxic microenvironment after RFA may exert a negative impact on the prognosis of HCC patients, and minimizing exposure to a hypoxic microenvironment and targeting HIF-1α signaling might be effective strategies for patients who experience insufficient RFA therapy.
