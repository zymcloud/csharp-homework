Side population (SP) cells are a small subset of cells isolated from a cultured cancer cell line with characteristics similar to those of cancer stem cells, such as high metastatic and tumorigenic potentials. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear for the malignant properties of SP cells. In this study, SP cells were isolated by staining cultured HCCLM3 cells with fluorescent DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 and sorted by flow cytometry. The proportion of SP cells was 2.79%Â±0.19% in the HCCLM3 cell line. Compared with non-SP cells, SP cells possessed stronger capability of sphere formation and tumorigenicity, and expressed higher levels of CD133 and CD90. Then, we found that SP cells possessed 25 upregulated and 34 downregulated microRNAs with differences of >3-fold. As one of the upregulated microRNAs, miR-192-5p was computationally predicted to target semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), a potent suppressor of tumor angiogenesis in various cancer models. Luciferase reporter assay showed that SEMA3A was a direct target of miR-192-5p. Overexpression of miR-192-5p promoted cell proliferation and metastasis targeting SEMA3A in HCCLM3 cells. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that SEMA3A expression was significantly reverse associated with metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. The results indicate that miR-192-5p contributes to targeting SEMA3A in HCCLM3 cells, and this may be used as a target in targeted therapy and a marker for cancer behavior and prognosis.
