Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cell (MDSC) has been raised to be a novel target for multiple cancers. However, target agents on MDSC have not display promising efficacy. One of the critical reasons shall be less optimal patient selection. In the present study, we aimed to identify clinical parameters relevant to MDSC level in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for future MDSC targeted therapy. In the present study, a series of 55 HCC patients (testing group) and 20 healthy donors were analyzed investigating frequencies of MDSC in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). As a result, we found that MDSC level was increased in HCC patients compared to healthy donors (10.33% vs 1.54%, p
