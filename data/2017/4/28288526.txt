Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among patients with malignancy. The Khorana risk score (KRS) is currently the best validated risk assessment model to stratify risks of VTE development in ambulatory patients with cancer. In the current study, we assessed the performance of KRS in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We retrospectively analyzed patients with diagnosis of HCC (screened by International Classification of Diseases [ ICD-9] and ICD-10 code, confirmed with radiographic examination and/or histopathology) at a large public hospital over 15 years (January 2000 through July 2015). Cases with VTE were identified through radiographic examination and blindly adjudicated. Khorana risk score was calculated for each patient, and its association with VTE development and mortality was assessed. Among 270 patients with HCC, 16 (5.9%) cases of VTE were identified, including 7 (43.8%) pulmonary embolism, 4 (25%) peripheral deep vein thrombosis, and 6 (37.5%) intra-abdominal thrombosis. One hundred eighty-four (68.1%) patients had a KRS of 0 and 86 (31.9%) patients had a KRS >0. Most of the thrombotic (n = 9, 56%) events occurred in the low-risk group. In univariate analysis, only prechemotherapy leukocyte count equal to or greater than 11 000/Î¼L was statistically significant in the prediction of VTE incidence. After adjusting for confounding factors in multivariate analysis, KRS >0 was not predictive of VTE (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81-4.15, P = .15) or mortality (HR = 1.61, 95% CI = 0.92-2.81, P = .09). Khorana risk score did not predict VTE development or mortality in patients with HCC. Design of HCC-specific risk assessment model for VTE development is necessary.
