Aim:A genome-wide association study (GWAS) had identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), GALNT14-rs9679162, capable of predicting chemotherapy responses in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we revisited the GWAS database to search for necessary SNPs that could improve our outcome prediction.Methods:A cohort of 116 HCC patients receiving split-dose chemotherapy composed of 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone and cisplatin was enrolled. The GALNT14-rs9679162 together with four other leading candidate SNPs (rs6025211, rs715171, LOC105369482-rs1955024 and WWOX-rs13338697) was genotyped and correlated with time-to-tumor progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS).Results:GALNT14-rs9679162-TT genotype remained an effective predictor for favorable TTP and OS (P = 0.012 and 0.002). Additionally, it was found that WWOX-rs13338697-CT genotype was associated with unfavorable TTP (P = 0.031), independent of GALNT14-rs9679162 genotype (adjusted P = 0.045), and rs6025211-CT genotype was associated with unfavorable OS (P = 0.014), independent of GALNT14-rs9679162 genotype (adjusted P = 0.025). Combinations of these SNPs stratified patients into three groups with differential treatment outcomes. Patients with GALNT14-rs9679162-TT/WWOX-rs13338697-non-CT genotypes achieved the most favorable treatment outcomes (n = 19; median TTP, median OS and response rate were 3.9 months, 6.8 months and 4/19 [21.1%], respectively); whereas patients with GALNT14-rs9679162-non-TT/rs6025211-CT genotypes associated with the most unfavorable treatment outcomes (n = 40; median TTP, median OS and response rate were 1.9 months, 3.5 months and 1/40 [2.5%], respectively). The remaining patients constituted a third subgroup with intermediate clinical outcomes.Conclusions:Three genetic variants, GALNT14-rs9679162, WWOX-rs13338697 and rs6025211, stratified advanced HCC patients into three groups with differential treatment outcomes.
