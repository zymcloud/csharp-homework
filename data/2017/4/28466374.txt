Sorafenib is not recommended for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with Vp4 (portal invasion at the main trunk) by the Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH) due to a risk of hepatic failure. This study aimed to elucidate the safety and efficacy of sorafenib monotherapy on HCC with macro-vascular invasion (MVI). A total of 415 consecutive advanced HCC patients received sorafenib in our hospital. Patients with only MVI and sorafenib monotherapy were retrospectively enrolled. We enrolled 113 (27.2%) patients, including 56 (49.5%) Vp3 (portal invasion at the first branch) and 57 (50.5%) Vp4. Their median intervals of follow-up and sorafenib-use were 7.8 months and 2.7 months respectively. Using sorafenib, more Vp4 had hepatic decompensation (HD) (37% VS 18.2%, p = 0.028) than Vp3 patients. The multivariate analysis showed Vp4 (Odds ratio: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.02-8.3, p = 0.041) and baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) â‰¥ 200 ng/ml were associated with HD. Dividing our patients into four subgroups as Vp3 + AFP
Alpha-fetoprotein; Hepatic decompensation; JSH guideline; Sorafenib; Vp4.
