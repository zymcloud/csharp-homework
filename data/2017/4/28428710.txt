Aim:To investigate the mechanism of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-induced resistance to irradiation-triggered apoptosis through regulation of the p53 protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Firstly, we detected expression of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a (Lamp-2a), which is the key protein of CMA, by western blot in HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells after irradiation. We further used shRNA Lamp-2a HCC cells to verify the radioresistance induced by CMA. Next, we detected the HMGB1 and p53 expression after irradiation by western blot, and we further used RNA interference and ethyl pyruvate (EP), as a HMGB1 inhibitor, to observe changes of p53 expression. Finally, an immunoprecipitation assay was conducted to explore the interaction between Lamp-2a and HMGB1, and the data were analyzed.Results:We found the expression of Lamp-2a was increased on irradiation while apoptosis decreased in HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. The apoptosis was increased markedly in the shRNA Lamp-2a HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells as detected by western blot and colony formation assay. Next, we found p53 expression was gradually reduced on irradiation but obviously increased in shRNA Lamp-2a cells. Furthermore, p53 increased the cell apoptosis on irradiation in Hep3B (p53-/-) cells. Finally, p53 levels were regulated by HMGB1 as measured through RNA interference and the EP treatment. HMGB1 was able to combine with Lamp-2a as seen by immunoprecipitation assay and was degraded via the CMA pathway. The decreased HMGB1 inhibited p53 expression induced by irradiation and further reduced the apoptosis in HCC cells.Conclusion:CMA pathway activation appears to down-regulate the susceptibility of HCC to irradiation by degrading HMGB1 with further impact on p53 expression. These findings have clinical relevance for radiotherapy of HCC.
