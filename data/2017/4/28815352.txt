Spontaneous rupture is a life-threatening complication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Detecting active bleeding is critical. Color Doppler and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Levovist® are reported to be useful for detecting active bleeding. A few reports have described using Sonazoid® to detect bleeding in ruptured HCC. This report describes two distinctive patterns of bleeding from ruptured HCC observed in CEUS with Sonazoid®. Four patients with suspected HCC rupture were examined by gray-scale ultrasonography (US) and then CEUS with Sonazoid®. Two patterns of bleeding were observed with CEUS: jet-like extravasation (n = 2) and bubble leakage (n = 2). While contrast-enhanced computed tomography and angiography revealed active bleeding in only one patient, CEUS detected active bleeding and enabled the bleeding site to be estimated in all patients. Transcatheter arterial embolization was performed based on the findings of CEUS, and hemostasis was achieved in all patients. CEUS using Sonazoid® could demonstrate active bleeding as two patterns, and these findings enabled us to detect the rupture site of HCC more confidently than with other modalities.
