USP22, a member of the deubiquitinases (DUBs) family, is known to be a key subunit of the human Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (hSAGA) transcriptional cofactor complex. Within hSAGA, USP22 removes ubiquitin from histone proteins, thus regulating the transcription and expression of downstream genes. USP22 plays important roles in many cancers; however, its effect and the mechanism underlying HCC chemoresistance remain unclear. In the present study, we found that USP22 was highly expressed in chemoresistant HCC tissues and cells and was correlated with the prognosis of HCC patients who received chemotherapy. Silencing USP22 in chemoresistant HCC Bel/Fu cells dramatically inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro; suppressed tumorigenic and metastatic capacities in vivo; and inhibited drug resistance-related proteins (MDR1, LRP, MRP1). Mechanistically, we found that USP22 knockdown exerts its function through down-regulating PI3K and activating Smad4, which inhibited phosphorylation of Akt. Silencing Smad4 blocked USP22 knockdown-induced Akt inhibition in Bel/Fu cells. Our results, for the first time, provide evidence that USP22 plays a critical role in the development of chemoresistant HCC cells and that high USP22 expression serves as a molecular marker for the prognosis of HCC patients who undergo chemotherapy.
