Whole slide imaging (WSI) offers a convenient, tractable platform for measuring features of routine and special-stain histology or in immunohistochemistry staining by using digital image analysis (IA). We now routinely use IA for quantitative and qualitative analysis of theranostic markers such as human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2/neu), estrogen and progesterone receptors, and Ki-67. Quantitative IA requires extensive validation, however, and may not always be the best approach, with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors being one example in which a semiautomated approach may be preferable for patient care. We find that IA has great utility for objective assessment of gastrointestinal tract dysplasia, microvessel density in hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, renal fibrosis, and general quality analysis/quality control, although the applications of these to daily practice are still in development. Collaborations with bioinformatics specialists have explored novel applications to gliomas, including in silico approaches for mining histologic data and correlating with molecular and radiologic findings. We and many others are using WSI for rapid, remote-access slide reviews (telepathology), though technical factors currently limit its utility for routine, high-volume diagnostics. In our experience, the greatest current practical impact of WSI lies in facilitating long-term storage and retrieval of images while obviating the need to keep slides on site. Once the existing barriers of capital cost, validation, operator training, software design, and storage/back-up concerns are overcome, these technologies appear destined to be a cornerstone of precision medicine and personalized patient care, and to become a routine part of pathology practice.
