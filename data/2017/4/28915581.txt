Accumulating evidence suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in various biological processes, including tumorigenesis. Aberrant expression of LINC00161 has been reported in some cancer types, however, the association of LINC00161 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been evaluated. Here, we measured the expression of LINC00161 in HCC tissues and corresponding normal liver tissues using real-time PCR. The result showed that the expression level of LINC00161 was significantly higher in HCC tissues. Further analysis indicated that HCC patients with higher LINC00161 expression have shorter survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that LINC00161 expression was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival. Furthermore, our result indicated that knock-down of LINC00161 can significantly inhibit liver cancer cell migration and invasion. The present work indicated that LINC00161 might serve as an oncogenic gene and play a pivotal role in promoting tumor migration and invasion in HCC. Our work implicates the promising effect of LINC00161 on the prognosis of HCC.
