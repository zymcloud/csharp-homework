Background:The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of dosage and type (intramuscular [IM] vs intravenous [IV]) of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) on hepatitis antibody level in liver transplant recipients.Methods:Between September 2000 and August 2016, patients who underwent orthotropic liver transplantation for chronic liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma secondary to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. The analyses of risk factors for postoperative short- and long-term anti-hepatitis B surface antibody levels (as classified level I: 0 to 100 U; II: 100 to 500 U; III: 500 to 1000 U; IV: >1000 U) were performed based on demographic characteristics, hepatitis B envelope antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, HBV DNA, delta antigen, HBIG administration dosage during unhepatic phase (5000 or 10,000 I/U; IM or IV), and type of administration in post-transplant period. Patients who were followed for less than 12 months were excluded from long-term analysis.Results:The mean follow-up of 58 orthotropic liver transplant patients was 72 (Â±45) months. No adverse events were observed during both IM and IV type of administration. Compared with IM type, IV administration was associated with a significantly higher HBV antibody level in the short term (for IM and IV: level I: 24% vs 6%; II: 49% vs 18%; III: 12% vs 35%; IV: 15% vs 41%, respectively, P = .007). In the long term, IV administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) was reported as the sole factor causing higher antibody level (P = .002). Longer follow-up was associated with decreased levels of anti-hepatitis B surface antibody.Conclusion:IV HBIG administration in preoperative anhepatic phase and postoperative prophylaxis is associated with higher antibody level both the short and long term without any adverse event.
