Background:Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of clinicopathological manifestations. The outcome of liver surgery in metabolic syndrome-related hepatocellular carcinoma (MetS-HCC) still needs to be evaluated. We aim to clarify the outcomes following liver resection in patients with MetS-HCC compared those with hepatitis B virus-related HCC (HBV-HCC).Methods:All the consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC between January 2009 and December 2012 were retrospectively considered. Patients were divided into three groups: MetS-HCC, MetS-HBV-HCC, and HBV-HCC. Data on clinical characteristics, postoperative complications, and long-term outcome were collected and analyzed.Results:A total of 1352 patients were included in this study. In MetS-HCC group, the severe morbidity rate was 33.33%, which was higher than that of HBV-HCC group (15.68%). In subgroup analysis, patients with MetS-HCC in American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I had superior DFS and OS when compared with those of the other two groups.Conclusions:We should pay more attention to patients with MetS-HCC perioperatively due to the high rate of surgical complications. Nevertheless, curative treatment should be provided to patients with MetS.
