Objective:To discuss the influences of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with hepatic arterial chemoembolization on the expression level of immunity and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1a) and early growth response protein2 (EGR2) of patients with hepatocarcinoma.Patients and methods:Patients with primary hepatic carcinoma treated in our hospital from 2011 to 2014 were divided into research group (RFA+TACE) and control group (TACE) according to different therapy methods, with 72 patients in each group. Then, the immunity functions were detected before treatment and 3 months after treatment, the expression level of HIF-1a, EGR-2, the alpha fetal protein (AFP), the therapeutic effect, and incidence of adverse reaction in near and specific future were compared between two groups.Results:After treatment, the ratio of CD3+ and CD4+T cells, specific vale of CD4/CD8, and NK cell population in research group were more than those in control group, while the ratio of CD8+T cells was less than that in control group with statistical significance. Meanwhile, the expression levels of HIF-1a (F between-group*time point = 5.353, p = 0.043), EGR-2 (F between-group*time point = 4.385, p = 0.044), and AFP (F between-group*time point = 4.205, p = 0.045) had difference with statistical significance. Moreover, the recent therapy response rate in research group was 76.4%, which was higher than that in control group (50.0%), with significant difference (χ2 = 10.784, p = 0.029), while the difference of long-term therapeutic effect between two groups has statistical significance (χ2 = 7.439, p = 0.005).Conclusions:The treatment of primary hepatic carcinoma by TACE combined with RAF therapeutic schedule was helpful in improving organic immunity, decreasing tumor angiogenesis and reducing tumor cell proliferation speed to improve the short- and long-term therapeutic effects.
