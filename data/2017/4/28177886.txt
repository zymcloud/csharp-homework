Background:The benefits of transarterial chemoembolization plus sorafenib (TACE-S) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) remain controversial. We compared the effectiveness and safety of TACE-S and TACE for HCC with PVTT.Methods:The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, Wan Fang, and Sino Med databases were systematically searched for studies of HCC with PVTT treated using TACE-S. Two authors independently extracted study outcomes, including overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), objective response (tumor response) and adverse events (AEs).Results:Eight high-quality, retrospective studies with 1091 patients (TACE-S=356, TACE=735) were included in the review. Five retrospective studies with 973 patients (TACE-S=238, TACE=735) were included in the meta-analysis. The objective response rate (ORR, OR=3.59, 95% CI=1.74-7.39; I2=21%, P=0.0005 ) and disease control rate (DCR, OR=4.72, 95% CI=1.75-12.72; I2=56%, P=0.002) favored TACE-S. TACE-S significantly increased 6-month OS (OR=3.47; 95% CI=2.47-4.89; I2=0%, P Conclusions:TACE-S may improve OS, ORR, TTP and DCR for HCC patients with PVTT compared to TACE.
