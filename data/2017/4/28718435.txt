Agrin is utilized by motor neurons to stimulate the LRP4-MuSK receptor in muscles for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation. Recent studies of cancer have identified novel functions of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4-muscle-specific kinase (LRP4-MuSK) pathway. Agrin may act as a mechanotransduction signal in the extracellular matrix (ECM) to coordinate the cross-talk between the LRP4-MuSK pathway and integrin-focal adhesion pathway. Ensuing Yes-associated protein (YAP) activation promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we discuss the implications of the converged pathways in NMJ formation and liver cancer.
