Sorafenib (SOF; an angiogenesis inhibitor) and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA; a contrast agent for computed tomography imaging)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres (MSs) were fabricated. Embolization, drug delivery, and tracing the distribution of MSs for liver cancer therapy were accomplished with the developed MSs after their intra-arterial (IA) administration. SOF/TIBA/PLGA MSs with 24.8-28.5 Âµm mean diameters were prepared, and the sustained release of SOF from MSs was observed. Lower systemic exposure (represented as the area under the curve [AUC]) and maximum drug concentration in plasma (Cmax) values of the SOF/TIBA/PLGA MSs group (IA administration, 1 mg/kg) in the results of the pharmacokinetic study imply alleviated unwanted systemic effects (e.g., hand and foot syndrome), compared to the SOF solution group (oral administration, 10 mg/kg). In a rat hepatoma model, the increase of microvessel density (MVD) following arterial embolization (i.e., reactive angiogenesis) was partially limited by SOF/TIBA/PLGA MSs. This resulted in the SOF/TIBA/PLGA MSs group (IA administration, single dosing, 1 mg/kg) showing a smaller tumor size increase and viable tumor portion compared to the TIBA/PLGA MSs group. These findings suggest that a developed SOF/TIBA/PLGA MS can be a promising therapeutic system for liver cancer using a transarterial embolization strategy.
