Background:To review the outcome of using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for patients with close resection margin during hepatectomy.Methods:From Oct 2004 to Sept 2013, 862 patients received hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the Department of Surgery, Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. Fourteen patients received additional RFA because of close resection margin (Results:In the RFA group (n=14), the median age of the patients was 58.5 (range, 25-78 years). The median tumor size was 2.25 cm (range, 1.2-12 cm). In the resection alone group (n=28), the median age for the patients was 61 (range, 36-79 years). The median tumor size was 2.7 cm (range, 1-11 cm). There was no difference in terms of liver function assessment between the two groups. There was no RFA related complication recorded during the study period. There was no hospital mortality in both groups. The 1- and 3-year disease free survival was 38.3% and 25.5% respectively in the RFA group vs. 57.4% and 39.3% respectively in the liver resection alone group (P=0.563). The 1- and 3-year overall survival was 81.5% and 69.8% respectively in the RFA group vs .88.4% and 59.9% respectively in the liver resection alone group (P=0.83).Conclusions:RFA to hepatectomy resection surface in patients with close margin is a safe treatment option but its effectiveness on prevention of local recurrence has yet to be confirmed.
