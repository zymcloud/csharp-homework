The composition of the essential oil isolated from leaves and flowers of Pulicaria incisa sub. candolleana E. Gamal-Eldin, growing in Egypt, was analysed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-nine and 68 compounds were identified from the oils of the leaves and flowers accounting for 86.69 and 84.29%, respectively of the total detected constituents. Both leaves and flowers oils were characterized by the high content of carvotanacetone with 66.01, 50.87 and chrysanthenone 13.26, 24.3%, respectively. The cytotoxic activity of both essential oils was evaluated against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HEPG-2, using MTT assay and vinblastine as a reference drug. Leaf oil showed higher activity with IC50 11.4 μg/ml compared with 37.4 μg/ml for flower oil. The antimicrobial activity of both oils was evaluated using agar well diffusion method towards two representatives for each of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as well as four representatives for fungi. The minimum inhibitory concentration of both essential oils against bacterial and fungal strains was obtained in the range of 0.49 - 15.63 μg/ml.
