Aim:To evaluate the performance of novel virtual parenchymal perfusion (VPP) software in conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:VPP was retrospectively applied to 43 hepatocellular carcinomas treated with cTACE. The virtual embolized area (VEA) was estimated after positioning a virtual injection point on images of non-selective cone-beam computed tomography during hepatic arteriography, at the same position in superselective cTACE. The real embolized area (REA) was defined as the area where iodized oil was retained on 1-week computed tomography after cTACE. Three dimensions across the tumor (maximum [a] and minimum [b] in the axial and craniocaudal [c]) directions, and the volume of the VEA and REA were compared using linear regression analysis. It was also evaluated whether an adequate safety margin ≥5 mm could be predicted by VPP.Results:The mean lengths of a, b, and c of the VEA and REA were 54.6 ± 15.9 mm (range 24.9-91.0 mm) and 55.0 ± 15.7 mm (range 23.9-92.8 mm; r = 0.9448, P Conclusion:The VEA estimated using VPP showed a good correlation with the REA of cTACE.
