Overexpression of Rabl3 is associated with some malignancies. However, their relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. In this study, the expression of Rabl3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and four pairs of matched hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and their adjacent normal hepatic tissues were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot. In addition, the protein expression of Rabl3 was examined in 162 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma by immunohistochemistry. Rabl3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines was elevated at both messenger RNA and protein levels, and the Rabl3 protein was significantly upregulated by upto 3.3-fold in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with the paired normal hepatic tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that overexpressions of Rabl3 were 80.2% in hepatocellular carcinoma. Rabl3 is expressed at significantly higher rates in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with adjacent normal hepatic tissue (p
