Purpose:We previously reported that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) changes to a phenotype producing des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) during epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro. To confirm this change in vivo, we evaluated the association between DCP production and HCC hemodynamics in patients undergoing resection as EMT and hemodynamic changes are closely associated with each other.Methods:We evaluated HCC hemodynamics by employing Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasound (SEUS) before surgical resection, and sought associations with histological grade and immunohistochemical staining of DCP in 19 areas from 11 patients.Results:In 10 HCC areas showing early washout (3 min ≥) using SEUS, three areas corresponded to poorly differentiated HCC and the remaining seven areas corresponded to moderately differentiated HCC, and positive DCP staining was observed in only two of the seven moderately differentiated HCC areas, whereas no staining was observed in poorly differentiated HCC areas. Six HCC areas showing intermediate washout (3-10 min) using SEUS were moderately differentiated, of which five demonstrated positive DCP staining (83.3%, 5/6). However, all HCC areas without enhancement in the arterial phase were well-differentiated and did not show DCP staining.Conclusion:Our preliminary findings suggest that HCC hemodynamics evaluated by SEUS are associated with histological grade and/or DCP production.
