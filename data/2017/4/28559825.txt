Testicular metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, only 33 cases have been described in the literature. Most of the reported cases are of unilateral testicular metastasis from RCC. We report a case of metachronous ipsilateral testicular metastasis from RCC in a 78-year-old man 6 years after nephrectomy. Scrotal ultrasonography showed a 4 Ã— 5 cm mass in the right testis. Right inguinal orchiectomy was performed for diagnosis. Computed tomography revealed liver and lung metastases. First-line therapy with sunitinib was started in November 2016 for metastatic RCC.
