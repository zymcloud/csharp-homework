Purpose:Data are lacking on the appropriate risk stratification of patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to evaluate the predictive factors for perioperative morbidity and oncological outcomes in CRC patients with liver cirrhosis (LC).Methods:A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted. A total of 161 LC patients who underwent surgery for CRC were identified between January 2001 and December 2010.Results:The mean patient age was 60 Â± 10 years, and the median follow-up period was 54.0 months (range 0.5-170.0). The proportions of patients with Child-Pugh classifications for LC were as follows: A (n = 118; 73.3%), B (n = 39; 24.2%), and C (n = 4; 2.5%). The median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 8 (range 6-21). The postoperative morbidity rate was 37.3% (60/161). Hyperbilirubinemia (p = 0.002), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation (p = 0.020), and intraoperative transfusion (p = 0.003) were the significant factors for postoperative morbidity in multivariate analysis. The postoperative mortality rate was 3.1% (5/161), and the 5-year cancer-specific and 5-year overall survival rates were 86.1 and 59.9%, respectively. The significant clinical risk factors by multivariate analysis that influenced overall survival were the TNM stage of CRC (p = 0.035), MELD score (>8 points) (p Conclusions:Hyperbilirubinemia, PT prolongation, and intraoperative transfusion are significant risk factors for postoperative morbidity in LC patients who undergo surgery for CRC. Additionally, not only advanced TNM stage but also a high MELD score and the coexistence of HCC are associated with poor overall survival in CRC patients with LC.
