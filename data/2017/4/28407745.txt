Background:Fibronectin (Fn) plays a major role in the attachment of Staphylococcus aureus to host cells by bridging staphylococcal fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) and cell-surface integrins. A previous study demonstrated that the phagocytosis of S. aureus by macrophages is enhanced in the presence of exogenous Fn. We recently found that FnBPs overexpression also enhances phagocytic activity. The effect of S. aureus infection on the expression of macrophage Fn was investigated.Result:The level of Fn secreted by monocytes (THP-1), macrophages, human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in response to S. aureus infection was determined by Western blotting and it was significantly suppressed only in macrophages. The activation of signaling pathways associated with Fn regulation in macrophages and HepG2 cells was also investigated by Western blotting. Erk was activated in both macrophages and HepG2 cells, whereas Src-JNK-c-Jun signaling was only activated in macrophages. A significant decrease in macrophage viability was observed in response to S. aureus infection in the presence of exogenous Fn.Conclusion:The Src-JNK-c-Jun signaling pathway was activated in macrophages in response to S. aureus infection and resulted in the suppression of Fn expression. This suppression may play a protective role in macrophages against S. aureus infection. This study provides the first demonstration that Fn is suppressed in macrophages by S. aureus infection.
