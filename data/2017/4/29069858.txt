We investigated the rates and predictors of mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who were or were not undergoing long-term hemodialysis. The participants in this retrospective observational study were 1298 HCC patients (60.0 ± 12.1 years old, 72% male), of whom 172 were undergoing hemodialysis and 1126 were not. HCC patients on hemodialysis exhibited a higher hepatitis C virus carrier rate (49.4% versus 39.3%, P = 0.012), lower hepatitis B virus carrier rate (37.2% versus 58.3%, P < 0.001) and lower hepatitis B or C virus carrier rate (77.9% versus 89.3%, P < 0.001) than those not on hemodialysis. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were higher in the hemodialysis than non-hemodialysis group (162.8 ± 141.1 u/l versus 124.6 ± 102.5 u/l, P < 0.001). By the end of the analysis, 32.0% of HCC patients on hemodialysis and 28.0% of those not on hemodialysis had died. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that cumulative survival was poorer in HCC patients on hemodialysis (P = 0.004). In a multivariate Cox regression model, hemodialysis (P < 0.001), older age (P < 0.001) and advanced tumor stages (P < 0.001) were found to be risk factors for mortality. HCC patients on hemodialysis had a 2.036-fold greater chance of death than HCC patients not on hemodialysis. Prospective studies with longer follow-ups and larger samples are warranted.
