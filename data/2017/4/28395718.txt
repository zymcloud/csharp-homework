Objective To investigate the uracil glycosidic enzyme activity of uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2) and study the role of UNG2 in the resistance of antioxidant stress of HepG2 cells. Methods The UNG2-expressing vector was built. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of UNG2. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to observe the cellular location of UNG2. Oligonucleotide was used as substrate for the determination of the UNG2 glycosidic enzyme activity. H2O2 toxicity assay was done to study the function of UNG2 in the antioxidant resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Results UNG2 was successfully over-expressed in HEK293FT cells, and UNG2 was found to be mainly located in nucleus. Enzyme activity assay showed that UNG2 had significant oligonucleotide dU glycosidic enzyme activity. H2O2 toxicity assay showed that over-expressed UNG2 could remarkably increase the survival of HepG2 cells after exposed to H2O2. Conclusion UNG2 possesses specific DNA glycosidic enzyme activity, and it can protect HepG2 cells against oxidative stress damage.
