Aim:Postoperative recurrence beyond the Milan criteria is a poor prognostic factor for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with various therapies. We investigated the most useful inflammation-based prognostic score for predicting recurrence beyond the Milan criteria after initial liver resection.Methods:From January 2007 to December 2012, 271 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent curative liver resection were enrolled. Patients were divided according to the initial recurrence pattern: recurrence beyond the Milan criteria; and recurrence within the Milan criteria, or no recurrence. The patients were classified into two groups, low platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (Results:Fifty-five (20.2%) patients had recurrence beyond the Milan criteria. The 5-year survival rate in patients with recurrence beyond the Milan criteria (41.6%) was significantly lower than in those with other recurrence patterns (79.7%). High PLR level was observed in 15.5% of the patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that PLR was the only independent predictive factor of recurrence patterns (odds ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.49; P = 0.018). The high PLR level was significantly associated with higher serum des-Î³-carboxy prothrombin level, larger tumor size, and poor histological differentiation.Conclusion:Among several inflammatory indices, PLR is a good indicator to predict recurrence beyond the Milan criteria after liver resection for patients with HCC.
