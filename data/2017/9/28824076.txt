A 78-year-old man presented with cutaneous blisters of the limbs and abdominal distension. He had been treated for various diseases, including liver cirrhosis. He had begun receiving sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, for diabetes mellitus three years before the hospitalization. A skin biopsy demonstrated bullous pemphigoid. Ultrasonography (US) revealed multiple liver tumors, although he had been receiving regular US studies. We stopped sitagliptin and started insulin and corticosteroids. However, his renal dysfunction progressed, and he died 14 days after the hospitalization. We should therefore be careful of various complications, including bullous pemphigoid and progression of tumors, when using DPP-4 inhibitors.
bullous pemphigoid; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor; hepatocellular carcinoma; nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2); progression; sitagliptin.
