MicroRNAs (miRs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, are key gene regulators through inducing translational repression or degradation of their target genes. However, the regulatory mechanism of miR-133b underlying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth and metastasis remains largely unclear. Here we found that miR-133b was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, low miR-133b levels were significantly associated with the malignant progression of HCC. LASP1, upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, was then identified as a novel target of miR-133b in HCC HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Moreover, the increased expression of LASP1 was associated with HCC progression. An in vitro study showed that overexpression of miR-133b inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Similarly, knockdown of LASP1 reduced HepG2 and Hep3B cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, overexpression of LASP1 attenuated the suppressive effect of miR-133b on the malignant phenotypes of HepG2 and Hep3B cells, suggesting that miR-133b may inhibit HCC growth and metastasis via targeting LASP1. In addition, overexpression of miR-133b inhibits tumor growth of HepG2 and Hep3B cells in vivo. Therefore, the miR-133b/LASP1 axis may become a potential target for the treatment of HCC.
