Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of mortality related to cancer all over the world. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of HCC metastasis, we analyzed the proteome of three HCC cell lines with different metastasis potentials by quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. As a result, we identified 378 cellular proteins potentially associated to HCC metastasis, and constructed a highly connected protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Functional annotation of the network uncovered prominent pathways and key roles of these proteins, suggesting that the metabolism and cytoskeleton biological processes are greatly involved with HCC metastasis. Furthermore, the integrative network analysis revealed a rich-club organization within the PPI network, indicating a hub center of connections. The rich-club nodes include several well-known cancer-related proteins, such as proto-oncogene non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Moreover, the differential expressions of two identified proteins, including PKM2 and actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (ARPC4), were validated using Western blotting. These two proteins were revealed as potential prognostic markers for HCC as shown by survival rate analysis.
