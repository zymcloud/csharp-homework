The aim of this study was to determine the role remaxol in complex intensive therapy of various jorms gipoergosis dur- ing the perioperative period in patients with hepatopancreatoduodenal zone malignancies. The treatment of 48 patients was analyzed. Immediately prior to surgery, at random, patients were divided into primary (n = 26) and control group (n = 22). In the study group for compensation the energy deficient states and organ hypoxia in the pancreas and the liver during the intra- and postoperative periods remaxol was included in the infusion therapy, the introduction ofwhich had been began before the start of anesthesia. In the control group antihypoxants weren't used. Integral assessment of prognosis and severity on a scale SAPS II and APACHE II. Status of energy and the type of energy deficit was estimated by the transport of oxygen and the concentration of lactate. In order to determine the level of stress exposure and the for- mation of adaptive reactions examined quantitative and qualitative composition of the peripheral blood. The study was conducted prior to surgery, on the 2nd and 5th day perioperative period. Inclusion in the scheme of metabolic remaxol program in the perioperative period in patients with malignant diseases of hepatopancreatoduodenal zone promotes the reduction of different types ofgipoergosis, efficient delivery and oxygen consumption, the adequacy of tissue oxygenation and restoration of adaptive physiological reactions such as.
