Recent studies have shown that circulating microRNAs are potential biomarkers for various types of malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using serum exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel serological biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis and prognosis. Exosomes are small membranous vesicles (30-100 nm). Exosomal miR-665 levels in HCC patients were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects (P < 0.05), and exosomal miR-665 levels were significantly upregulated in tumours larger in size (> 5 cm), in tumours with local invasion and in those at an advanced clinical stage (stage III/IV) of HCC (P = 0.0042, 0.0197, and 0.0276, respectively). The survival time of the exosomal miR-665 high-expression group (n = 17) was significantly shorter than that of the low-expression group (n = 13) (P = 0.036). In addition, we found that HCC cell-derived exosomes promoted hepatoma cell proliferation and upregulated the expression level of proteins in the MAPK/ERK pathway in vitro and in vivo. This study suggests that serum exosomal miR-665 may be a novel minimally invasive biomarker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis.
