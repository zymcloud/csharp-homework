The non‑SMC condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG) that organizes the coiling topology of individual chromatids, represents an overexpressed antigen in various types of cancer, and also contributes to restructuring chromatin into rod‑shaped mitotic chromosomes and ensuring the segregation of sister chromatid during cell division. In this study, we investigated the association between NCAPG expression and the biological behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to further explore the potential of NCAPG as a therapeutic target. The expression of NCAPG was detected in human HCC cell lines and tumor samples. The effects of NCAPG on the cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis were investigated by various assays. NCAPG was found to be overexpressed in HCC compared with the adjacent normal tissue (P
