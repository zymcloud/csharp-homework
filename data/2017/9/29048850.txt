Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer with extremely low five year survival rate. Early diagnosis is of great importance for cancer therapy. In this work, stable isotope labeling-based relative quantitative proteomics and parallel reaction monitoring-based target proteomics were combined for cancer biomarker screening and validation. By using this strategy, 70 significantly changed proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were obtained, among which seven proteins were further validated. The validated proteins contain the clinically used hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and the reported biomarker candidates Heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90), fatty acid-binding protein, epidermal (FABP5) and alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4), which demonstrated the robustness of the strategy. The proteins identified in this work could be benefit for further HCC biomarker screening and clinical validation. Moreover, this strategy could be further applied to other cancer types.
