Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a frequently observed complication in liver cirrhosis patients. This study aimed to investigate the microbiological characteristics and outcomes of BSIs in patients with liver cirrhosis. We retrospectively studied 852 patients with liver cirrhosis who developed a BSI. Patient outcome was evaluated using 30-day mortality and assessed using multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Antibiotic sensitivity of the pathogens was tested. Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 59.6% of BSIs, and Gram-positive bacteria caused 40.4% of the episodes among liver cirrhosis patients. The bacterial distribution significantly differed between hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections, especially in cases caused by Gram-negative pathogens. The results of the drug sensitivity test suggested that amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and piperacillin/tazobactam highly suppressed Gram-negative infections, while vancomycin and teicoplanin strongly inhibited Gram-positive BSIs. Liver failure, liver cancer, complications, Child-Pugh grade, septic shock, administration of appropriate antibiotics within 24 h, ICU admission, nosocomial infection, and Gram nature of the bacteria were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality (P < 0.05). The choice of initial empirical antibiotics should be based on the type, severity and origin of infection and on the local epidemiological data on antibiotic resistance. Accurate evaluation of risk factors for mortality may improve appropriate therapeutic choice.
