Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent type of liver malignancy. Most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma are secondary to either viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C) or alcoholic cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis due to any other causes is considered as a risk factor for development of hepatocellular carcinoma; however, hepatocellular carcinoma in non cirrhotic livers remains a rare condition. The present case report describes a 59-year-old woman patient admitted to explore right hypochondriac and epigastric pain, with no evidence of pre-existing liver disease and with a good general condition. The computed tomography was very suggestive of a gastro-intestinal stromal tumor. But, at laparotomy, a huge hepatic tumor was discovered. Histopathological study confirmed the presence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs more frequently on a cirrhotic liver. However, it can occur on a non cirrhotic liver and remains and extremely rare case.
