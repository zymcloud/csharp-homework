Purpose:To evaluate the prognostic performance of the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated using stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR).Methods and materials:This retrospective study evaluated the data of patients with HCC who underwent SABR between December 2007 and June 2015. We collected pretreatment CTP and ALBI scores and analyzed their correlation with survival and liver toxicity.Results:This study included 152 HCC patients: 78.3% of CTP class A and 21.7% of CTP class B. The median ALBI score was -2.49 (range, -3.67 to -0.84) with 39.5% of grade 1, 56.6% of grade 2, and 3.9% of grade 3. The CTP classification and ALBI grade were significantly associated with overall survival (PConclusion:Albumin-bilirubin score is a potential predictor for both survival and liver toxicity. Complementary use of CTP and ALBI score could predict the risk of post-SABR liver toxicity. Further prospective studies are necessary before use of the ALBI score can become part of daily practice.
