Esophageal cancer-related gene 4 (ECRG4) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene, which is involved in cell apoptosis, migration, infection and inflammation responsiveness; however, its expression level and clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In the present study, the authors aim to evaluate the clinical significance and potential role of ECRG4 in HCC. Level of ECRG4 protein expression in HCC and peripheral tissues was investigated in tissue specimens obtained from 56 consecutive HCC patients by immunohistochemistry. Cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion regulations were examined by MTT curves, flow cytometry, Transwell assays and western blotting. ECRG4 expression was weak positive in normal liver cells but was downregulated in HCC cells in vivo or in vitro. A decreased expression of ECRG4 was associated with the age of the patients, metastasis and Ki-67 proliferation index. However, decreased ECRG4 expression was not associated with differentiation, tumor size, the presence of portal vein tumor thrombosis, satellite lesions, tumor relapse or mortality. Further investigations revealed that ectopic expression of ECRG4 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells, which was mediated by the regulation of BAX and B cell lymphoma-2, in addition to the upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that ECRG4 was downregulated in HCC and served important roles in promoting cell proliferation and migration.
