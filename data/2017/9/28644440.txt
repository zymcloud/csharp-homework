While the androgen receptor (AR) might promote renal cell carcinoma (RCC) initiation and progression, the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unclear. Here, we discovered the novel LncRNA-SARCC, which was suppressed and associated with better prognosis in RCC. Preclinical studies using multiple RCC cells and in vivo mouse model indicated that LncRNA-SARCC could attenuate RCC cell invasion, migration and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LncRNA-SARCC bound and destabilized AR protein with an inhibition of AR function, which led to transcriptionally de-repress miR-143-3p expression, thus inhibition of its downstream signals including AKT, MMP-13, K-RAS and P-ERK. In addition, bisulfite sequencing analysis substantiated that LncRNA-SARCC promoter was highly methylated in renal cancer tissues compared with paired non-cancerous renal tissues. Notably, treating with Sunitinib, the multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, increased the expression of LncRNA-SARCC, which decreased RCC cells resistance to Sunitinib. Thus, our study presented a road map for targeting this newly identified LncRNA-SARCC and its pathway, which expands potential therapeutic strategies for RCC treatment.
