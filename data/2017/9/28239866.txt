This study investigated the effect of epinephrine (a vasoconstrictor) and hydralazine (a vasodilator) on the hepatic disposition of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) after application to the surface of the liver in rats. Normal livers were compared with a Walker 256 carcinoma cell tumor model. A cylindrical diffusion cell was attached to the liver surface. 5-Fluorouracil was added into the diffusion cell in combination with vasomodulators or after pretreatment with epinephrine. After selected treatment times, the 5-FU concentrations were assayed at three sites in the excised livers. The 5-FU concentration in the region under the cell attachment site (site 1) was significantly higher after concomitant application of 5-FU and epinephrine, compared with 5-FU alone, and increased in an epinephrine dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, preferential distribution of 5-FU at site 1 was not seen when applied in combination with hydralazine. After 10 min of epinephrine pretreatment, the concentration of 5-FU at site 1 was approximately two times higher than that for the control. Furthermore, the 5-FU concentration at site 1 of the tumor model was greatly increased compared with the normal liver. These results suggest that application of epinephrine to the liver surface might enhance the accumulation of 5-FU at the desired target site.
