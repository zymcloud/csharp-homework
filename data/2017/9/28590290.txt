Fungal inflammatory pseudotumor (FIPT) of the liver is a rare disease that may be mistaken for a malignant tumor. It is difficult to diagnose because of its nonspecific clinical and imaging features. We report the case of a 46-year-old Asian man who presented with a mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The patient had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization therapy at another institution 6 months earlier, but the mass had continued to enlarge. He had no history of chronic hepatitis B, and the serum Î±-fetoprotein was negative. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and computed tomography images were suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed features of chronic inflammation. The mass was resected and found to be an FIPT. We discuss the details of the case and review related articles.
