Aim:It has been shown that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) negatively regulates the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signalling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of GRK2 and IGF1R in HCC.Methods:Expression of GRK2 and IGF1R was first detected by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry in 156 patients with HCC. Staining results, termed the H-score, were then correlated with clinicopathological variables and patient survival. Finally, the prognostic value of GRK2 and IGF1R was validated in the publically available TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) RNA-sequencing database.Results:The H-score of GRK2 staining (which was significantly lower in tumour than non-tumour tissue) was negatively associated with that of IGF1R with a reverse trend. No clinicopathological significance of the proteins was found except for a relationship between tumoral IGF1R expression and tumour-node-metastasis stage. In univariate analysis, high IGF1R expression predicted poor overall and disease-free survival, whereas GRK2 was not prognostic. In multivariate analysis, IGF1R was significant for overall survival. Furthermore, IGF1R was also of prognostic value in the TCGA database.Conclusions:Our data indicate that GRK2 and IGF1R show a negative correlation in HCC. IGF1R could be a potential marker of poor prognosis for this malignancy.
