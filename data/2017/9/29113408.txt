The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients with multiple hepatocellular carcinoma (HCCs) after liver resection (LR) versus liver transplantation (LT). Patients who had multiple HCCs without macrovascular invasion and who underwent LT or LR between 2007 and 2013 were reviewed. A propensity score matching model was used to adjust baseline differences between the two groups. A total of 204 patients were selected for the current study, including 137 LR patients and 67 LT patients. During follow-up, 100 patients experienced recurrence, and 78 patients died. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 71.1% for the LT group and 31.1% for the LR group (P
