The overexpression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a major stress-inducible heat shock protein, has been identified to enhance the proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis of diverse types of human cancer. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poorly understood. The present study demonstrated that HSP70 expression was higher in tested HCC cell lines, compared with the normal hepatocyte LO2, and the suppression of HSP70 significantly inhibited the proliferation of SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells. The growth inhibitory effect was mediated by cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase with reduced cyclin D1 and increased p27Kip1 expression. Furthermore, HSP70 knockdown significantly inhibited the migration and invasion abilities of HCC cells. In conclusion, HSP70 is a key regulator involved in the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC, and it may be used as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
