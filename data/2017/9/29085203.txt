We report the first case of a patient with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), who later developed acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (AAMT), with autoantibodies to the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (c-Mpl). A 64-year-old woman, with chronic hepatitis C, developed severe thrombocytopenia and was diagnosed with ITP. She died of liver failure. Autopsy revealed cirrhosis and liver carcinoma. In the bone marrow, a marked reduction in the number of megakaryocytes was observed, while other cell lineages were preserved. Therefore, she was diagnosed with AAMT. Additionally, autoantibodies to c-Mpl were detected in her serum. Autoantibodies to c-Mpl are one of the causes of AAMT, acting through inhibition of TPO function, megakaryocytic maturation, and platelet formation. HCV infection induces several autoantibodies. HCV infection might also induce autoantibodies to c-Mpl, resulting in the development of AAMT. This mechanism may be one of the causes of thrombocytopenia in patients with HCV infection.
