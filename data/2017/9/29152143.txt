PGPIPN is a therapeutic hexapeptide derived from bovine β-casein. Here we investigated the role and mechanism of this peptide on alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). We took human hepatic cell line LO2 and hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 to establish the models of steatosis hepatocyte induced by alcohol, taken PGPIPN as pharmacological intervention. And we also established the model of AFLD mice, taken PGPIPN as therapeutic drug and glutathione (GSH) as positive control. We assayed the biochemical materials related to liver injury, lipid metabolism and oxidation, and observed morphology change and fat accumulation of hepatocyte. The gene expressions and/or activities related to liver injury, lipid metabolism and oxidation, such as ACC, PPAR-γ, CHOP and Caspase-3, were assessed by real time PCR and western blot. Our results showed PGPIPN alleviated hepatic steatosis in both model cells and AFLD model mice. PGPIPN can effectively reduce the lipid accumulation and oxidative stress of hepatocyte in a dose-dependent manner. PGPIPN alleviated alcohol-induced cell steatosis and injuries by regulating the gene expressions and/or activities of ACC, PPAR-γ, CHOP and Caspase-3. Our results demonstrated PGPIPN had the protective and therapeutic effect on AFLD, which may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for AFLD.
