Aim:To develop and validate a risk estimation of tumor recurrence following curative resection of operable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Data for 128 patients with operable HCC (according to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer imaging criteria) who underwent preoperative computed tomography (CT) evaluation at our hospital from May 1, 2013 through May 30, 2014 were included in this study. Follow-up data were obtained from hospital medical records. Follow-up data through May 30, 2016 were used to retrospectively analyze preoperative multiphasic CT findings, surgical histopathology results, and serum α-fetoprotein and thymidine kinase-1 levels. The χ2 test, independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze data. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results:During the follow-up period, 38 of 128 patients (29.7%) had a postoperative HCC recurrence. Microvascular invasion (MVI) was associated with HCC recurrence (χ2 = 13.253, P < 0.001). Despite postoperative antiviral therapy and chemotherapy, 22 of 44 patients with MVI experienced recurrence after surgical resection. The presence of MVI was 57.9% sensitive, 75.6% specific and 70.3% accurate in predicting postoperative recurrence. Of 84 tumors without MVI, univariate analysis confirmed that tumor margins, tumor margin grade, and tumor capsule detection on multiphasic CT were associated with HCC recurrence (P < 0.05). Univariate analyses showed no difference between groups with respect to hepatic capsular invasion, Ki-67 proliferation marker value, Edmondson-Steiner grade, largest tumor diameter, necrosis, arterial phase enhanced ratio, portovenous phase enhanced ratio, peritumoral enhancement, or serum α-fetoprotein level.Conclusion:Non-smooth tumor margins, incomplete tumor capsules and missing tumor capsules correlated with postoperative HCC recurrence. HCC recurrence following curative resection may be predicted using CT.
