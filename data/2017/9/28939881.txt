Type I-interferon (IFN) is considered to exert antitumor effects through the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Based on the species-specific biological activity of IFN, we evaluated each antitumor mechanism separately. We further examined the antitumor effects of type I-IFN combined with sorafenib. Human IFN (hIFN) significantly inhibited the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Hep3B cells and the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. Although mouse IFN (mIFN) did not inhibit the proliferation of Hep3B cells in vitro, mIFN, as well as hIFN, showed significant antitumor effects in mouse Hep3B cell-xenograft model. Furthermore, mIFN treatment amplified the antitumor effects of sorafenib in vivo with the suppression of angiogenesis. The DNA chip analysis showed that the mIFN treatment promoted the antitumor signal pathways of sorafenib, including anti-angiogenic effects. Unlike the effects observed in in vitro experiments, mIFN showed an antitumor effect in the mouse Hep3B cell-xenograft model, suggesting a role of the anti-angiogenic activity in the in vivo tumoricidal effects of type I-IFN. In addition, our findings suggested the clinical utility of combination therapy with type Ð†-IFN and sorafenib for HCC.
