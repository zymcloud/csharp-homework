Purpose:To investigate the feasibility and value of three-dimensional ultrasound/contrast-enhanced ultrasound (3D US-CEUS) fusion imaging for the immediate evaluation of technical success and the guidance of supplementary ablation during the liver cancer thermal ablation procedure.Materials and methods:Patients diagnosed with malignant liver cancer intending to receive thermal ablation including radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) were enrolled. 3D US-CEUS fusion imaging was used to immediately assess the technical success and guide supplementary ablation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CECT/CEMRI) was performed one month after ablation to assess the technique effectiveness of the ablation. The registration success rate, duration time of 3D US-CEUS fusion imaging, technique effectiveness rate and major complications were recorded.Results:In total, 76 patients with 95 tumours who underwent RFA or MWA and assessed by 3D US-CEUS fusion imaging were enrolled. The registration success rate of 3D US-CEUS fusion imaging was 93.7% (89/95), and the duration time was 4.0 Â± 1.1 min. Thirty lesions received supplementary ablation immediately during the procedure. The technique effectiveness rate of the ablation was 98.8% (81/82). There were no major complications related to ablation.Conclusions:3D US-CEUS fusion imaging is a feasible and valuable technique for the immediate evaluation and guidance of supplementary ablation during the liver cancer thermal ablation procedure.
