Hepatocellular carcinoma is a major public health problem with one of the highest overall mortality compared to other cancers. The median overall survival in France in a hospital population with hepatocellular carcinoma is 9.4 months. Several publications reported a positive impact of hepatocellular carcinoma screening on diagnosis at an early-stage, eligibility for curative treatment and overall survival. However, the identification of patients to be included in a hepatocellular carcinoma screening program and the application of screening recommendations are not optimal. Other studies suggest a potentially negative impact of delayed diagnosis or treatment initiation on the patient's prognosis. Finally, marked variations between French regions and departments have been described in terms of access to curative treatment and overall survival. In this review article, we propose a state of play of the hepatocellular carcinoma patient's care pathway in France with the aim of identifying potential breaking points with negative impact on prognosis and of developing proposals for improvement.
