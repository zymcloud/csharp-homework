We developed a novel inflammation-nutrition scope (INS) based on systemic inflammatory response and nutritional status, and explored its prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially for those with early-stage disease.The INS was developed based on a retrospective study of 185 patients with HCC undergoing hepatectomy between 2006 and 2007, and validated in a prospective study of 131 patients enrolled from 2009 to 2010. Prediction accuracy was evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs).The INS was constructed as follows: patients with both an elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW, ≥13.25%) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR, ≥1.1) were allocated a score of 2. Patients in whom only 1 or none of these biochemical abnormalities was present were allocated a score of 1 or 0, respectively. An elevated INS was associated with larger tumor size, tumor thrombus, and high tumor lymph nodes metastasis (TNM) stage. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the INS was an independent predictor for overall survival, and a prognostic factor for patients with TNM I stage. The AUCs of the INS for survival were higher than other conventional clinical indices.The INS is a promising predictor of poor outcome in patients with HCC, especially for those with early-stage disease, and is a promising tool for HCC treatment strategy decisions for future clinical trials targeting nutritional decline.
