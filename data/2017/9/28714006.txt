Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 (ALDH1L1) is downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors, and its decreased expression is associated with the poor prognosis of HCC patients. We, therefore, evaluated the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ALDH1L1, and its mRNA expression on the survival of hepatitis B virus (HBV)â€‘related HCC patients and the association with tumor protein p53 (TP53) expression. ALDH1L1 SNPs in 415 HBV-related HCC patients were genotyped via direct sequencing. Expression profile chip datasets and survival information were obtained from GSE14520. The C allele (CT/CC) carriers of rs2276724 were significantly associated with a favorable prognosis [adjusted P=0.040; adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=0.725; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.533-0.986]. Joint-effect analyses suggested that the CT/CC genotype of rs2276724 in TP53-negative patients was significantly associated with a decreased risk of death, compared to the TT genotype of rs2276724 in TP53-positive patients (adjusted P=0.037; adjusted HR=0.621; 95% CI=0.396-0.973). Furthermore, low expression of ALDH1L1 predicted a poor prognosis for the HBV-related HCC patients (adjusted P=0.04 for disease-free survival; adjusted P=0.001 for overall survival). Patients with high ALDH1L1 expression and low TP53 expression were significantly associated with a decreased risk of recurrence and death, and patients with a high TP53 expression were also significantly associated with a decreased risk of death in HBV-related HCC, compared with low ALDH1L1 and low TP53 expression. Our results suggest that ALDH1L1 may be a biomarker for predicting postoperative clinical outcomes. Moreover, ALDH1L1-rs2276724 and mRNA expression were associated with TP53 expression in HBV-related HCC patients.
