Background:Current guidelines for the management of indeterminate nodules discovered on surveillance imaging recommend alternate imaging modality or biopsy. This study evaluates the use of short interval MRI rather than immediate CT or biopsy.Method:This retrospective cohort study examines outcomes of 111 patients with indeterminate nodules reviewed by a single institution's Liver Tumor Board 2011-2016. Analysis was focused on outcomes stratified by management decision.Results:The tumor board recommended biopsy or immediate repeat CT imaging in 13 (12%), 3-month interval MRI in 64 (58%) and 6-month interval MRI for 34 (30%) patients. Twenty-eight (29%) patients in the interval MRI subgroups were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during the period of follow-up, and 21 (75%) of these were located within the original indeterminate nodule. The median time to diagnosis was 6.5 months. Twenty-three (82%) were eligible for potentially curative therapy at the time of HCC diagnosis. Delay in HCC diagnosis was not the reason for inability to provide potentially curative therapy in any patient.Conclusion:This study supports the judicious use of interval MRI at 3 or 6 months in patients with liver cirrhosis and an indeterminate liver nodule rather than immediate CT scan or biopsy.
