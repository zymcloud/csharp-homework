Aim:The stromal invasion has been regarded as the most valuable clue to distinguish high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDNs) and well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinomas (WD-SHCCs). The purposes of this study are to explore the stromal morphological changes for the differential diagnosis of these two equivocal lesions.Results:Based on the systemic studies of histological characteristics of HGDNs and WD-SHCCs, the stromal morphological changes, including sinusoid capillarization, ductular reaction and solitary artery, were performed to make a differential diagnosis between them. Separately, the solitary artery had the best sensitivity (93.75%) and accuracy (88.89%), and the sinusoid capillarization had the best specificity of 90.32%. On the whole, when at least 2 stromal morphological changes were abnormal, no matter what combination, the diagnostic performance was favorable and optimal with the highest accuracy of 92.06%, balancing the sensitivity (93.75%) and specificity (90.32%). The diagnostic performances were prior to the classical immunohistochemical panel comprising heat shock protein 70, glypican 3 and glutamine synthetase with the best sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 62.50%, 80.65% and 71.43%, respectively.Materials and methods:A retrospective case-control study was conducted on 63 patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for uninodular HGDNs or WD-SHCCs at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital from 2005 to 2015.Conclusions:The stromal morphological changes, containing sinusoid capillarization, ductular reaction and solitary artery could provide a more considerable diagnostic and differential diagnostic performance between HGDNs and WD-SHCCs. And they should be the key points during the histopathological diagnosis.
