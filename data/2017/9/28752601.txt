Introduction:Prior to the introduction of viral inactivation of factor concentrates and screening of blood, 225 people with haemophilia became infected with hepatitis C (HCV) in Ireland.Aim:Our aim was to assess liver disease progression and mortality in this population after 30 years of infection.Methods:Demographic and clinical data were collected from medical records in five hepatology units and one infectious disease unit retrospectively in 2005, and on four subsequent occasions.Results:The participation rate was 73% (165/225). Eighty three percent of patients, who had been tested for RNA (n = 106/128), developed chronic HCV infection. Thirty four percent were co-infected with HIV. All-cause mortality, after approximately 30 years of infection with chronic HCV, was 44% in HIV positive patients and 29% in HIV negative patients. Liver-related mortality was 12.5% and did not vary significantly by HIV status. Thirty seven percent of patients had developed advanced liver disease, including 20% with cirrhosis and 9% with hepatocellular carcinoma. In the pre-interferon-free direct acting antivirals era, 57% (n = 60/106) of patients were treated for HCV, 65% of whom achieved a sustained virological response. Successfully treated patients had few adverse liver outcomes.Conclusion:After 30 years of infection, 40% of the patients who had evidence of chronic HCV had developed advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis and HCC, or had died from liver-related causes. This proportion is high relative to similar international cohorts despite good anti-HCV treatment uptake and responses.
