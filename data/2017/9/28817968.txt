Insulin-like growth factor-2 binding proteins (IGF2BPs) are oncogenic RNA-binding proteins, highly up-regulated in HCC, and were recently validated as direct targets of the tumour suppressor miR-1275. It is worth noting that around 47% of FDA approved anticancer drugs are derived from plants. Modulation by miRNAs and their cellular signalling cascades could constitute new pathways by which these phytochemicals exert their effects. This study aimed to investigate the potential use of Tamarix articulata, quercetin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in HCC and how these phytochemicals could epigenetically modulate the IGF axis using their impact on miR-1275. T. articulata ethyl acetate fraction significantly reduced the viability of Huh-7 cells compared to control cells. Treatment with T. articulata ethyl acetate fraction, quercetin and EGCG significantly enhanced miR-1275, while suppressed IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3 mRNA expression levels. In summary, T. articulata, quercetin and EGCG have important implications for HCC molecular-targeted therapy through destabilizing the interplay between miR-1275 and the IGF axis.
