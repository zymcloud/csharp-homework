Clinical and experimental data suggest that salicylic acid (SA) is tumor preventive and NO has a multitude of effects on tumor biology. Therefore, firstly, the aim of our study is to explore the important role of SA in apoptotic induction of liver cancer cells. Secondly, we investigate whether SA mediates the anti-tumor effects by NO signaling pathway. The liver cancer cell line was treated with different concentrations of SA. Cell proliferation was tested using MTS assay and cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. NO content and NOS activities were measured by biochemical assay. The anti- or pro-apoptotic regulator gene expressions were analyzed by real-time PCR. Our data illustrated that high concentration of SA significantly inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation accompanied by apoptosis induction. In addition, SA led to the release of NO and the increase of NOS activities in above process. Importantly, SA up-regulated a series of apoptosis-related gene expression and reduced the mRNA level of HMGB1. Meanwhile, we also found that NOS inhibitor L-NAME and NO scavenger cPTIO attenuated the above SA-induced effects. Thus, we provided the evidence that SA exerted anti-tumor effects in liver cancer cell in part mediated by the NO pathway.
