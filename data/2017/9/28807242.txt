Background and objectives:Combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become an effective alternative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In clinical practice, the choice of time interval between TACE and RFA is a key point for curative effect, but optimal time interval is uncertain in guidelines. We aim to explore the optimal time interval for HCC patients of Child-Pugh classification A or B.Methods:Two hundred and thirty-three HCC patients of Child A or B who had undergone TACE and RFA were enrolled and divided into seven groups according to different time intervals (1-7weeks). Tumor damage, liver function, complications and survival time of patients after treatment were analyzed.Results:Complete remission rate and total effective rate decreased in groups with the prolonged time interval (p 0.1). Median survival time in groups four and five were 42 months, longer than other groups (p Conclusion:A period of 3-5 weeks is the optimal time interval between TACE and RFA for HCC patients of Child-Pugh classification A or B.
