Background:Several studies have found benefits of radiotherapy for adrenal metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the efficacy, safety and outcome issues have not yet been fully addressed. Therefore, we performed this study to further elucidate the feasibility and outcome of radiotherapy in treating adrenal metastasis from HCC.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 81 patients with adrenal metastasis from HCC between 2001 and 2015. Eighteen patients received helical tomotherapy and 63 patients received conventional radiotherapy, including two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT). The median radiation dose was 50 Gy (range 26-64 Gy) with median fraction size of 2.0 Gy (range 2.0-5.0 Gy). Tumor responses, adverse effects, patient outcomes and prognostic factors were analyzed.Results:An objective response (complete and partial response) was achieved in 55.6% patients. The helical tomotherapy group showed higher objective response rate than the conventional radiotherapy group (P = 0.031). The major adverse effects were anorexia (51.8%), nausea (41.9%), and fatigue (35.8%). Similar toxicity profile occurred in the 2-D, 3-D CRT and helical tomotherapy groups. The overall survival (OS) rate at 1, 2 and 5 years was 59.9, 35.0, and 12.9%, respectively, with a median survival of 15 months. Patients who received helical tomotherapy achieved a better OS compared to the conventional radiotherapy group (P = 0.047). However, multivariate analysis indicated that radiotherapy technique was not an independent prognostic factor for patient outcome.Conclusion:These results suggest that radiotherapy offers a noninvasive approach in controlling adrenal metastasis from HCC with promising local control and acceptable tolerability.
