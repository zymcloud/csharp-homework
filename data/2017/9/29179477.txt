Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been tested to act as important regulator in liver cancer genesis and progression. LncRNA Nicotinamide Nucleotide Transhydrogenase-antisense RNA1 (NNT-AS1) has been reported to participate in the tumorigenesis. However, the exact molecular mechanism of NNT-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown. In present study, our team identified the up-regulated expression of NNT-AS1 in HCC tissue and cell lines compared with adjacent noncancerous tissue and normal cells. Moreover, HCC patients with high NNT-AS1 levels had poor prognosis than that with low NNT-AS1 level (p=0.0089). In vitro, gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that enhanced NNT-AS1 expression promoted the proliferation ability and alleviated the cycle arrest and apoptosis, while NNT-AS1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and induced G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis. In vivo, NNT-AS1 knockdown inhibited the HCC neoplastic tumor volume and weight. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay validated that miR-363 targeted NNT-AS1 and CDK6 3'-UTR. MiR-363 was down-regulated in HCC tissue and cells. NNT-AS1 competed with CDK6 for miR-363 binding and could increase CDK6 expression. In summary, our results suggest the oncogenic role of NNT-AS1 in HCC tumorigenesis through miR-363/CDK6 axis, providing a novel therapeutic target for human HCC.
