Nonalcoholic fatty liver is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes, resulting in a steatotic liver. Glucagon-like peptide 1 and its analog exendin-4 can ameliorate certain aspects of this syndrome by inducing weight loss and reducing hepatic triglyceride accumulation, but it is unclear whether these effects result from the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 on the pancreas, or from direct action on the liver. This study investigated the direct action and putative cellular mechanism of exendin-4 on steatotic hepatocytes in culture. Steatosis was induced in cultured HepG2 human hepatoma cells by incubation in media supplemented with 2 mM each of linoleic acid and oleic acid. Steatotic hepatocytes were then pre-incubated in the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 for 30 min, then treated with exendin-4 over a period of 24 h. Cell viability and triglyceride content were characterized by a TUNEL assay and AdipoRed staining, respectively. Our results showed that steatotic cells maintained high levels of intracellular triglycerides (80%) compared to lean controls (25%). Exendin-4 treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular triglyceride content after 12 h that persisted through 24 h, while protein kinase A inhibitors abolished the effects of exendin-4. The results demonstrate the exendin-4 induces a partial reduction in triglycerides in steatotic hepatocytes within 12 h via the GLP-1 receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase A. Thus, the reduction in hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation is likely driven primarily by downregulation of lipogenesis and upregulation of Î²-oxidation of free fatty acids.
