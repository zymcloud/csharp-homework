While most patients in Western countries who are diagnosed with HCC are in their 50s and 60s, HCCs diagnosed at extremes of the age spectrum (i.e., TP53 mutations were the most frequent alteration in young adults (19%), whereas CTNNB1 mutations occurred in 30-33% of patients â‰¥ 40 years' old. The overall frequency of pathogenic and presumed pathogenic mutations was observed to increase significantly with advancing age. To our knowledge, these data represent one of the only studies to analyze age-specific molecular profiles in HCC, and provide a basis for further exploration and validation of these findings with respect to their clinical and therapeutic implications.
