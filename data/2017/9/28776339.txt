Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the life span of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS (PWHA) has been extended significantly. Therefore, the importance of non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs), as well as AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) has increased. There is little information concerning the epidemiology of malignancies in PWHA in Korea. A descriptive epidemiologic study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Korea. PWHA who visited Pusan National University Hospital from January 2000 to October 2014 were included. Demographics and clinical data were obtained from the medical records and analyzed. A total of 950 PWHA were observed for 4,439.71 person-years. Forty-eight episodes (5.05%) of cancers were diagnosed in 47 patients. Mean age of the enrolled patients was 40.66 Â± 12.15 years and 88% were male. Among the 48 cancer episodes, 20 (42%) were ADCs and 28 were NADCs. The most common ADCs was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (53.6%), followed by Kaposi's sarcoma (17.9%). The most common NADCs were lung cancer (25%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (25%). The overall incidence of total cancers, ADCs, and NADCs was 10.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-14.3), 4.5 (95% CI, 2.8-7.0), and 6.3 (95% CI, 4.2-9.1)/1,000 person-years, respectively. NADCs accounted for 12/15 (80%) of cancers among PWHA with good adherence to care. The 5-year survival rate of PWHA and NADC was 26.3%. NADCs have become the main type of malignancy among Korean PWHA with good adherence to care. Effective strategies to improve screening of NADCs among PWHA are required in Korea.
