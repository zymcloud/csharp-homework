Aim:To identify the association between the expression of lncRNA NEAT1 and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with HCC, and to explore the prognostic significance of lncRNA NEAT1 in predicting prognosis of HCC.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 86 patients with HCC (35 female, 51 male) managed in our institution between 2009 and 2014. The expression level of lncRNA NEAT1 was detected by real-time PCR. Prognostic factors were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models.Results:For the entire cohort of 86 patients, we showed that the expression level of NEAT1 was significantly higher in HCC tissues compared with non-tumorous tissues and NEAT1 was increased obviously in the HCC cell lines including SMMC-7721, Huh-7 and Hep3B (P Conclusions:In this study, we found NEAT1 expressed significantly higher in HCC tissues compared with non-tumorous tissues. Overexpression of lncRNA NEAT1 was an independently risk factor associated with the prognosis of patients with HCC.
