Introduction:Carcinoma cervix is the leading cause of cancer in Indian women. Recurrent/metastatic cervix is the most aggressive form of the disease. There is paucity of data in this setting in Indian women regarding outcomes with palliative chemotherapy.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed hospital registry data between January 2013 and December 2014 for recurrent/metastatic carcinoma cervix patients who were planned for palliative chemotherapy and assessed their demographic parameters, response and survival outcomes with chemotherapy.Results:We identified 165 cases of recurrent/metastatic carcinoma cervix. Median age at presentation was 48 years. Most common symptoms at presentation were bleeding or white discharge per vagina and lower abdominal pain. Majority of the patients were multiparous. Histologically squamous cell carcinoma was found most commonly (93.3%) with adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma being exceedingly uncommon (3.63% each). 38% of patients were upfront metastatic while rest were recurrent disease. Most common sites of metastasis were retroperitoneal lymph nodes (21.21%), liver (11.51%), lung (9.69%), supraclavicular lymph nodes (8.48%) and bone (7.27%). After a median of 6 cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin based chemotherapy, overall response rate (ORR) was 26.7% with 10.5% complete remission (CR) and 16.4% partial remission (PR) rates. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 6 months while median overall survival (OS) was 11 months.Conclusion:Recurrent/metastatic cervical carcinoma is an aggressive disease. Our patients showed an ORR of 26.7% to palliative chemotherapy with median PFS of 6 months and median OS of 11 months. Further research is required related to novel targeted agents and nonplatinum doublets.
