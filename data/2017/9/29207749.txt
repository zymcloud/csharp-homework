Introduction:Cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes mellitus are two chronic illnesses with significant impact on the quality of life. Studies from different part of the world have shown the combination to be associated with higher incidence of complications of cirrhosis and reduced survival. However, data on the impact of pre-cirrhotic and post-cirrhotic diabetes on cirrhosis is minimal.Aim:The aim of the study was to determine the complications of cirrhosis patients with and without co-existent DM and to compare the relation between cirrhosis patients with antecedent DM and hepatogenous DM.Materials and methods:The present prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Kerala, India, over a period of three years. Cirrhosis patients with and without diabetes, along with subcategorization as antecedent and hepatogenous diabetes, were studied for various complications and outcome including death. Chi-square and Mann-whitney tests were used for comparing data.Results:Patients with cirrhosis and diabetes had higher incidence of gall stones (27.6% versus 13.2%; p=0.008) and urinary infection (29.3% versus 7.5%; p=Conclusion:Coexistent diabetes mellitus increases the incidence of complications and hospitalizations in cirrhosis patients but without impact on mortality rates. There is no significant morbidity or mortality difference between cirrhotics with antecedent diabetes and hepatogenous diabetes.
