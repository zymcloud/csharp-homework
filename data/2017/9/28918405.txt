Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 2%-3% of all malignancies in adults. It spreads via direct extension, lymphatic route as well as haematogenous route. Lymph nodes, lungs, bone, liver and brain are the usual sites for its metastatic spread. In the presence of limited metastatic disease with potentially resectable metastases, surgery offers the best chances of cure. In the present case, we describe a case of renal cell carcinoma with a solitary metastasis to the sigmoid mesentery in a patient with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. There was no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or tumour thrombus in the renal vein. The patient was managed with laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and excision of the sigmoid mesentery mass. At 6 months of follow-up, there is no evidence of recurrent disease.
