The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway and multidrug resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to determine the drug sensitivity of HepG2 and HepG2/ADM hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in combination with the MAPK/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the rate of apoptosis. The reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) mRNA expression following treatment with various concentrations of U0126. P-gp and MRP1 expression levels were measured using Western blot analysis. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration was markedly decreased in combination with U0126. RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the expression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and MRP1 in HepG2/ADM cells was increased 5.37- and 6-14-fold compared with that in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the expression levels in HepG2/ADM cells were decreased following U0126 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of P-gp and MRP1 in HepG2/ADM cells was increased 2.68- and 2.76-fold compared with that in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the expression levels in HepG/ADM cells were decreased following U0126 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the present study indicate that the MEK inhibitor U0126 enhances sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs by downregulating P-gp and MRP1 expression in resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The combination of MEK inhibitor and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs may provide novel therapeutic prospects for the treatment of drug-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma.
