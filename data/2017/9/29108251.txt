Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a worldwide health problem and it is important to understand the mechanistic roles of the biomolecules involved in its pathogenesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are frequently and aberrantly expressed in various human cancers and are known to play a role in cancer pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of lncRNA-ATB in HCC and investigate the implications for prognoses. In total, 100 samples of HCC tissues and their corresponding, adjacent, non-cancerous liver tissues were collected. Total RNAs were extracted and the expression levels of lncRNA-ATB were measured by qRT-PCR. The association of lncRNA expression with clinicopathological features and patient survival were then analyzed. LncRNA-ATB was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with the levels in corresponding non-cancerous tissues. Expression of lncRNA-ATB was significantly associated with portal vein thrombosis, intrahepatic or extrahepatic metastases, mUICC stage, and the BCLC stage. Large tumors (> 5 cm, HR = 3.851, 95% CI = 1.431-10.364, p = 0.008) and higher lncRNA-ATB expression (HR = 4.158, 95% CI = 1.226-14.107, p = 0.022) were the significant prognostic factors for overall survival. With this novel evidence of the involvement of lncRNA-ATB in HCC pathogenesis and clinical features, lncRNA-ATB can be concluded to have potential as a biomarker for the prognosis of HCC and as a targeted therapy for afflicted patients.
