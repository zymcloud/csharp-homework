Purpose:To compare therapeutic outcomes of radiofrequency (RF) ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization vs surgical resection (SR) for single 2-3 cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Seventy patients underwent combined chemoembolization/RF ablation therapy and 84 underwent SR. Local tumor progression (LTP), intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates, as well as major complications and duration of hospital stay, were compared between groups before and after propensity-score matching.Results:LTP and IDR had developed in 9 (12.9%) and 24 (34.3%) patients in the combined treatment group and in 7 (8.3%) and 24 (28.6%) patients in the SR group (P = .262 and P = .252, respectively). The 1-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year DFS rates were similar between groups (82.6%, 53.2%, 53.2%, and 37.6%, respectively, vs 84.5%, 63.6%, 59.2%, and 52.1%, respectively; P = .278), and 1-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year OS rates were also comparable (94.2%, 81.2%, 74.1%, and 59.4%, respectively, vs 95.2%, 86.3%, 84.0%, and 80.3%, respectively; P = .081). After matching (n = 98), LTP, IDR, DFS, and OS rates were still similar (P = .725, P = .826, P = .484, and P = .578, respectively). Major complication rate was not significantly different (2.9% vs. 6.0%; P = .596); however, after matching, major complication rate was higher in SR group (2.0% vs. 6.1%; P Conclusions:Before and after matching, there were no significant differences in long-term therapeutic outcomes between combined chemoembolization/RF ablation and SR groups. Therefore, combined chemoembolization/RF ablation therapy may be an alternative treatment for single 2-3 cm HCCs.
