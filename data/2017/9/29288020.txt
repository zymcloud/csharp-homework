Objective:To investigate the long-term incidence and predictors for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss after nucleoside analogue therapy.Methods:The study included 411 noncirrhotic chronic hepatitis B patients (148 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and 263 HBeAg-negative patients) who were treated with lamivudine (n = 110) or entecavir (n = 301) with posttreatment follow-up of at least 12 months.Results:In HBeAg-positive patients, the 8-year cumulative rates of virologic relapse, clinical relapse and HBsAg loss were 55.6%, 47.7% and 19.6%, respectively. In HBeAg-negative patients, the rates were 69.3%, 58.9% and 33.1%, respectively. Cox regression analysis showed that hepatitis B virus genotype C and lower end-of-treatment HBsAg levels were independent predictors of HBsAg loss in HBeAg-positive and -negative patients. The 5-year HBsAg loss rate was 47.3% in HBeAg-positive patients with end-of-treatment HBsAg levels Conclusions:The rate of HBsAg loss was relatively high and the rate of hepatic events was low in noncirrhotic patients who discontinued nucleoside analogue therapy.
