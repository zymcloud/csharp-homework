Centrosomal proteins have been implicated in the progression of human diseases. CEP131 plays important roles in centrosome duplication and genome stability, but its role in cancers remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that CEP131 expression was increased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to the paracarcinoma tissues, at both mRNA and protein levels. High CEP131 expression was closely associated with tumor size (P=0.020), tumor capsule (P=0.043), TNM stage (P=0.007) and tumor differentiation (P=0.019). Furthermore, patients with high expression of CEP131 were accompanied with worse overall and disease-free survivals in our and TCGA cohorts consisting of a total of 802 cases. The prognostic value of CEP131 was further confirmed by stratified survival analysis. Multivariate cox regression model indicated that CEP131 was an independent factor for overall survival (hazard ratio=1.762, 95% confident interval: 1.443-2.151, P
