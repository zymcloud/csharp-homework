Accumulating evidence demonstrates that aberrant miRNAs contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and progression. However, the roles of various miRNAs in HCC remain to be determined. In present research, we confirmed that a reduced miR-542-3p expression was present in HCC tissues and cell lines. Our clinical analysis revealed that the down-regulated miR-542-3p expression was significantly correlated with poor prognostic features including advanced TNM stage and venous infiltration. Moreover, we confirmed that miR-542-3p was a novel independent prognostic marker for predicting 5-year survival of HCC patients. The ectopic overexpression of miR-542-3p inhibited cell migration, invasion and EMT progress, while down-regulated miR-542-3p reversed the effect. In addition, miR-542-3p could regulate UBE3C by directly binding to its 3'-UTR. In clinical samples of HCC, miR-542-3p inversely correlated with UBE3C, which was upregulated in HCC. Alternation of UBE3C expression at least partially abolished the migration, invasion and EMT progress effects of miR-542-3p on HCC cells. In conclusion, our results indicated that miR-542-3p functioned as a tumor suppressor gene in regulating the EMT and metastasis of HCC via targeting UBE3C, and may represent a novel potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for HCC.
