Among HIV-infected patients worldwide, 2-4 million are chronically infected with HBV. We report a 15-year, real-life story of a patient with HBV-HIV coinfection, who developed HCC despite high treatment adherence and complete viral suppression. The aim of our report is to alert the infectious diseases community to monitor the possible development of HCC regardless of high treatment adherence and complete viral suppression.
