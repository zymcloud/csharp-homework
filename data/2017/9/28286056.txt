Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers include HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and HBV antigens. The former involves HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) as well as total HBV DNA, whereas the latter involves HBsAg, HBcAg, and HBx.Methods:Samples of tumor and adjacent non-tumor liver tissue were collected from 28 HBV-associated HCC patients. Intrahepatic total HBV DNA and cccDNA were measured using the real-time PCR Taqman assay. HBV antigens in hepatocytes were detected using immunohistochemical staining. Intrahepatic levels of total HBV DNA or cccDNA in HCC patients with different intrahepatic HBV antigen expression patterns were compared, and the correlation between serum HBV DNA and intrahepatic HBV DNA was analyzed.Results:No significant differences in intrahepatic cccDNA levels were observed between tumor and non-tumor liver tissue (median -3.00 vs. -2.30 log copies/cell, P=0.298). However, the tumor tissue had significantly higher levels of total HBV DNA (median -0.60 vs. -1.24 log copies/cell, P=0.045) but significantly lower proportion of intrahepatic HBV DNA in the form of cccDNA (median 0.25% vs. 4%, P=0.023) than the corresponding values in the non-tumor tissue. Also, HBV antigen levels were lower in the tumor tissue than in the non-tumor tissue. Analysis of the correlation between serum HBV DNA and intrahepatic HBV DNA indicated that the viral status in the tumor tissue was more complicated in HBV-HCC patients-the detected serum HBV DNA failed to accurately reflect intrahepatic viral load.Conclusion:HBV DNA may play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis, and cccDNA was not the predominant form of HBV DNA in the tumor tissue.
