Aim of the study:The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between June 2012 and November 2014, patients with HCC, negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody, were included in this study. All patients were assessed for risk factors for NAFLD such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and obesity.Results:Forty-seven patients with non-B non-C HCC (males, 37; age, 60±10 years; mean±SD) were studied. Model for end-stage liver disease score was 11±4. Twenty-five patients were in Child's class A. History of significant alcohol intake was noted in 11 (23%) patients. Prevalence of risk factors for NAFLD were obesity 24 (51%), DM 22 (47%), metabolic syndrome 21 (45%), hypertension 16 (34%), and dyslipidemia 13 (28%). Forty (85%) patients had at least one risk factor for NAFLD. The mean duration of at least one NAFLD risk factor was 7.5 years, prior to diagnosis of HCC. Thirteen (28%) patients were positive for anti-HBc; however, none of the study patients had detectable HBV DNA in blood.Conclusions:Eighty-five percent of the patients with non-B non-C HCC had at least one risk factor for NAFLD. None of the study patients had occult hepatitis B infection. NAFLD is emerging as the major etiological contributing factor for non-B non-C HCC in India.
