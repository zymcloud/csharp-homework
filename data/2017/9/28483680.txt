Background & aims:This study aimed to identify preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging biomarkers for predicting microvascular invasion (MVI), to determine their diagnostic performance and to evaluate whether they are associated with early recurrence after surgery for single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The study included 197 patients with surgically resected HCC (â‰¤5cm) who underwent preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging. Significant MR imaging findings for predicting MVI were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. Early recurrence rates (Results:Three MR imaging features were independently associated with MVI: arterial peritumoral enhancement (odds ratio [OR]=5.184; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.228, 12.063; pConclusions:A combination of two or more of the following; arterial peritumoral enhancement, non-smooth tumor margin, and peritumoral hypointensity on HBP, can be used as a preoperative imaging biomarker for predicting MVI, with specificity >90%, and is associated with early recurrence after surgery of single HCC. Lay summary: A combination of two or more of the following; arterial peritumoral enhancement, non-smooth tumor margin, and peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase, can be used as a preoperative imaging biomarker for predicting microvascular invasion, with specificity >90%, and is associated with early recurrence after curative resection of single HCC.
