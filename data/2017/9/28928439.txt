Recently, the MICA rs2596542 and DEPDC5 rs1012068 variants in Japanese individuals as well as the HCP5 rs2244546 and PNPLA3 rs738409 variants in European individuals have been found associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study determined which single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most predictive for developing hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC in a Japanese cohort. Of the 4 SNPs analysed, only the MICA genotypes were significantly associated with development of HCC (p = 0.0185). The major (MA), hetero (HE), and minor (MI) genotypes occurred in 40%, 41%, and 19% of HCC patients and in 43%, 47%, and 10% of non-HCC patients, respectively. Interestingly, the MICA genotype was significantly correlated with MICA mRNA and soluble protein levels. In patients older than 70 years, the MI genotype was significantly associated with HCC development. In addition, the MI genotype was related to HCC development when the platelet count range was 10-15 × 104/μL, corresponding with the fibrosis stage; but not when the range was less than 10, indicating advanced fibrosis; or greater than 15 × 104/μL, as mild fibrosis. Thus, polymorphisms in MICA, but not in DEPDC5, HCP5 or PNPLA3, are associated with HCC development in Japanese patients with chronic HCV infection.
