Background and aims:Delays in diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) may be more common among underserved safety-net populations, contributing to more advanced disease at presentation. We aim to evaluate rates of and predictors of cirrhosis and cirrhosis-related complications among adults with chronic HBV.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated consecutive chronic HBV adults from gastroenterology clinics from July 2014 to May 2016 at a community-based safety-net hospital. Prevalence of cirrhosis or cirrhosis-related complications (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) at initial presentation was stratified by sex and race/ethnicity. Predictors of cirrhosis or cirrhosis-related complications at presentation were evaluated with multivariate logistic regression.Results:Among 329 chronic HBV patients (mean age 49.1 years, 55.3% male, 66.5% Asian, 18.6% HBeAg positive) 27.7% had cirrhosis at presentation, 4.3% ascites, 3.7% variceal bleeding, 4.9% HE, and 4.0% HCC. Compared to women, men were more likely to have cirrhosis (34.6% vs. 19.1%, P < 0.01) and variceal bleeding (5.6% vs. 1.4%, P < 0.05) at presentation. On multivariate regression, older age at presentation (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = 0.003) and positive HBeAg (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.20-5.51; P = 0.015) were associated with higher odds of cirrhosis at presentation, whereas men had a non-significant trend toward higher odds of cirrhosis (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.99-3.58; P = 0.055).Conclusion:Among adults with chronic HBV at an ethnically diverse safety-net hospital system, nearly 30% of patients had cirrhosis at initial presentation, with the greatest risk seen among patients of male sex, older age, and with positive HBeAg.
