This study was designed to investigate the associations between TERT overexpression and the clinicopathologic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 291 patients with HCC were enrolled. The site of first recurrence (anywhere in the liver) was classified as intrahepatic recurrence (IHR). Recurrence was then sub classified as either early or late IHR according to whether it was discovered within 2 years of resection, or after, respectively. TERT overexpression was not significantly correlated with previously recognized prognostic factors. During follow-up, early IHR occurred in 126 (63.6%) patients, while late IHR was detected in 59 patients among 145 patients who remained free of HCC recurrence for â‰¥ 2 years after surgery. Multivariate analysis showed late IHR was significantly correlated with TERT overexpression (P
