Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with percutaneous iohexol-ethanol injection (PIEI), compared with RFA plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with primary liver cancer(PLC)in high-risk locations. Methods: From January 2012 to December 2014, 54 patients with PLC in high-risk locations were enrolled. They were divided into Group A (RFA combined with PIEI) and Group B (RFA plus TACE). The efficacy and adverse events were assessed. Results: 54 patients had 74 lesions in high-risk locations. There were 26 cases with 40 lesions in Group A, and 28 cases with 34 lesions in Group B. The complete ablation rate of Group A was significantly higher than that of Group B (92.5% vs 70.6%, P=0.014). The two-year local tumor progressionrateand two-year overall survival rate were similar between these two groups (Group A 20.0% vs Group B 38.2%, P=0.083; 90.3% vs 84.3%, P=0.523). Furthermore, the surgery-related severe adverse events of Group A (7.1%, one case of liver abscess and one case ofhematobilia) were more common than that of Group B (0%, P=0.491). No significant differences were found in common adverse events including fever, pain, elevation of aminotransferase and bilirubin. Conclusions: Compared with RFA plus TACE, RFA plus PIEI resulted inbetter complete ablation rate in patients with primary liver cancer in high risk locations. Prospective, randomized, controlled trials are warranted for further evaluation.
