The use of radiation therapy has been increasing over recent years for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Proton beam therapy (PBT) has emerged as a promising treatment option for HCC patients due to its dosimetric advantages of sparing more normal liver tissue from radiation at low to moderate doses compared to photon-based treatments while still delivering high doses of radiation to tumors. The PBT therapy may be particularly beneficial in high-risk HCC cirrhotic patients with large, bulky tumors and/or vascular invasion complicated by surrounding perfusion abnormalities. We present a case of a 62-year-old male with an unresectable 13 cm diffusely infiltrative HCC tumor with main portal vein invasion and elevated alpha-feta protein (AFP) of 37,200 that was intolerant of standard sorafenib treatment. He was treated with hypofractionated PBT to 67.5 GyE in 15 fractions using a novel combination of simultaneously integrated boost intensity modulated proton therapy (SIB-IMPT), breath hold technique, and functional liver imaging with technetium-99m [99mTc] sulfur colloid single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) to assist in the differentiation of tumor and normal liver. He had a complete radiographic and biochemical response by AFP normalization by seven months post-treatment without evidence of radiation hepatotoxicity.
