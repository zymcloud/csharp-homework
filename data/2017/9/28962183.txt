An extract from a traditional Chinese herb, Marsdeniae tenacissima (trade name, Xiao-Ai-Ping) has been approved for use on the Chinese market as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent for decades. Previous studies have demonstrated the cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects of M. tenacissima extract (MTE) in multiple cancer cells. However, the contributions of MTE to the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatoma carcinoma cells and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, Bel-7402 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of MTE ranging from 0-320 µl/ml to explore the effects and potential mechanisms of MTE on the proliferation and apoptosis of Bel-7402 cells. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfopheny)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt and propidium iodide (PI)-stained flow cytometry assays demonstrated that MTE significantly suppressed the proliferation of Bel-7402 cells in a dose-dependent manner by arresting the cell cycle at S phase (P<0.05). Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate PI-stained flow cytometry confirmed the significantly pro-apoptotic effect of MTE at both 160 and 240 µl/ml (P<0.001). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis demonstrated that MTE (both 160 and 240 µl/ml) induced a significant downregulation of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 (P<0.01), upregulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (P<0.01) and activation of caspase-3 (P<0.05). Furthermore, a significant downregulation of murine double minute-2 (MDM2) (P<0.001) and activation of p53 (P<0.001) in Bel-7402 cells following treatment with 160 or 240 µl/ml MTE was observed, accompanied by the inhibition of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway (P<0.001). These results suggested that MTE inhibited growth and exhibited pro-apoptotic effects in Bel-7402 cells, which was mediated by downregulation of the MDM2-induced p53-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and blocking the NF-κB pathway. Overall, these data serve as preliminary identification of the significant roles of MTE in hepatic carcinoma cells, and suggest that MTE may be a promising candidate for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.
