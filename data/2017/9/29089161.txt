Background/purpose:Prdevious meta-analyses assess whether or not patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) (rs738409 C > G) was associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Caucasians patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis, these meta-analyses did not provide firm conclusions. Only one cross-sectional study involving Asian patients has previously been conducted to explore this issue. We aim to investigate this in a longitudinal cohort of Asian chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients.Methods:We consecutively enrolled 1011 CHC patients who underwent liver biopsy before initiating interferon-based therapy. These patients were followed-up and screened for HCC up to a median of 6.9 years. The influence of rs738409 (GG) genotype on the occurrence of HCC was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, then according to the multivariate Cox model.Results:During follow-up, 143 (14.1%) patients developed HCC. rs738409 (GG) genotype was not associated with time-to-HCC development on multivariate Cox regression (P = 0.634). When considering the occurrence of these events over time, rs738409 (GG) genotype did not influence the risk of HCC development (log-rank = 0.12). Among 261 patients with liver cirrhosis, rs738409 (GG) genotype was not associated with time-to-HCC development on multivariate Cox regression (P = 0.737). When considering the occurrence of these events over time, rs738409 (GG) genotype did not influence the risk of HCC development (log-rank = 0.72).Conclusion:In this longitudinal study with liver biopsy to stage liver fibrosis, we affirm there is no influence of the rs738409 (GG) genotype on the occurrence of HCC in Asian CHC patients, including cirrhotic patients.
