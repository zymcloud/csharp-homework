Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an effective, standard therapy against small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is debate regarding the effectiveness of RFA combined with TACE (RFA/TACE) compared with RFA alone. These two approaches were compared for the treatment of early HCC. The present study examined 83 HCC tumors in 83 patients treated with RFA between April 2007 and August 2014 at three medical institutions. All HCCs were single hypervascular tumors, with a median diameter of 16 mm (range, 6-30 mm). The overall survival (OS) rate of all patients (n=83) was 97.5% at 1 year, 82.8% at 3 years and 48.6% at 5 years, and the local recurrence rate of all patients was 14.3% at 1 year, 32.3% at 3 years and 36.5% at 5 years. The tumor-free survival (TFS) rate of all patients was 95.1% at 1 year, 56.3% at 3 years and 23.4% at 5 years. Compared with RFA alone, RFA/TACE significantly improved OS (P10×104/µl (P=0.05) were associated with a high survival rate. Multivariate analysis identified RFA/TACE [hazard ratio (HR), 0.108; P=0.001] as an independent prognostic indicator. RFA/TACE was identified as the only independent indicator of IDR (HR: 0.467; P=0.042) and TFS (HR: 0.452; P=0.012). RFA/TACE improved OS rate, IDR and TFS compared with RFA alone. The data suggested that RFA/TACE should be considered for the treatment of single hypervascular HCC.
