Purpose:Hepatic metastasis from melanoma represents a therapeutic dilemma, with limited effective options for the 85% of cases deemed unresectable. Systemic agents confer toxicity and, along with traditional local hepatic arterial-directed therapies such as transarterial chemoembolization, have not led to a significant increase in survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and dose-limiting toxicity of DEBDOX for the treatment of unresectable hepatic metastases from melanoma.Methods:A multicenter (University of Louisville, Thomas Jefferson University, MD Anderson Cancer Center), prospective, non-controlled treatment trial (NCT01010984) of hepatic-directed therapy with DEBDOX for the treatment of melanoma liver metastasis was reviewed. Primary endpoints were response rates by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, hepatic progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).Results:Twenty patients received a total of 61 DEBDOX treatments from January 2010 to March 2013. The median hepatic tumor burden was 40% (range 20-55), 18 patients (90%) had bilobar disease, and 13 patients (65%) had concomitant extrahepatic disease. At median assessment of 2.5 months, 11 patients (55%) exhibited a tumor response and 16 (80%) exhibited disease control. Median follow-up was 5 months (range 1.1-34.3 months). Median hepatic PFS was 3 months (95% CI 1.4, 3.4), and OS was 5 months (95% CI 3.3, 10.5).Conclusions:Directed arterial therapy with DEBDOX is effective in managing unresectable liver-dominant metastasis from melanoma and should be considered a therapeutic option in the multidisciplinary treatment of this disease. Concurrent systemic therapy is merited given the high rate of extrahepatic progression.Clinical trial:NCT01010984.
