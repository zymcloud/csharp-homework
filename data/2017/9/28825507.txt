Sorafenib is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor currently used in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is associated with a significant risk of skin toxicity, which nevertheless represents a clinical marker of good response to treatment. Hand-and-foot skin reaction, alopecia, mucositis, xerosis, skin discoloration, and nail involvement occur frequently in course of therapy. More rarely, sorafenib can target hair follicles. We report the case of a patient who developed painful inflamed nodular-cystic lesions in both pubic and axillary regions in course of treatment with sorafenib. Because of the limited therapeutic options, the patient underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT), a topical treatment which combines a photosensitizing drug applied on lesional skin and a source of light, and had no systemic side effects. At the end of the treatment period, the patient experienced progressive clinical improvement, with relief of the symptoms. PDT may be helpful to limit suffering in patients affected by recalcitrant skin toxicity of the pilosebaceous unit who are not candidates for, or not responsive to, standard therapies.
