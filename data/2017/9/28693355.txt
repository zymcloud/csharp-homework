The search for systemic therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma has been characterized by difficulties and failures. Despite recent progresses, many issues are still to be settled. In particular, the development of drugs inhibiting different neoplastic pathways remains a priority for patients intolerant or resistant to antiangiogenic drugs. This task may be daunting, as previous failures extensively demonstrated. We aimed to identify the future perspective of postsorafenib trials analyzing the strengths and the critical points of past and currently undergoing studies, in the light of the most recent evidences in the field. We identified various points (including stratification, biomarkers, end points, radiologic criteria of response, treatment beyond radiologic progression) that should be considered by future trials to reduce the risks of failure.
