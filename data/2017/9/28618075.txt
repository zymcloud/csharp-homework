The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system recommends a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sorafenib) as standard therapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Sorafenib has been shown to prolong median overall survival (OS) by approximately 3 months in advanced HCC patients with PVTT (8.1 vs. 4.9 months). However, its clinical effectiveness is still controversial and standard treatment with sorafenib is not established in Japan. Surgical resection is considered a potentially curative treatment and provides an acceptable outcome for carefully selected patients. The surgical mortality rate in patients with PVTT who receive surgical resection ranges from 0% to 10%. The median survival time and 1-year OS rate in HCC patients with PVTT who undergo surgical resection have been found to range from 8 to 22 months and 21.7% to 69.6%, respectively. But improvement in therapeutic outcome is difficult with surgical treatment alone. Combination treatment in conjunction with such methods as transarterial chemoembolization, hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy, and radiotherapy has been found to improve the prognosis (median survival time, 11.5-37 months; 1-year OS rate, 46.8-100%). Yet, many problems remain, such as surgical indications and surgical techniques. After resolving these points, a multidisciplinary strategy based on surgical treatment should be established for advanced HCC with PVTT.
