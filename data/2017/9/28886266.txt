Primary small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus is characterized by high malignancy with a tendency to metastasize early through lymph and blood circulation. Metastasis of esophageal SCC frequently occurs to distant organs such as liver and lung. However, few cases of appendiceal metastasis have been reported. This paper first presents a pathologically confirmed case with metastasis of esophageal SCC to the appendix. This particular case highlights the importance of pathological diagnosis and provides new evidence of appendiceal metastasis from esophageal SCC.
