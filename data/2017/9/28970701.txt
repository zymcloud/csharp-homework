Background:Recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been a serious problem after liver transplantation (LT). We report our experience of 24-week therapy with sofosbuvir (SOF) and ribavirin (RBV) in post-LT recurrent HCV in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) setting in South Asia.Methods:Data from all patients treated for post-transplantation HCV recurrence in a single center were analyzed. Treatment regimen was 24 weeks of SOF 400 mg daily and RBV (starting at 800 mg daily, increased as tolerated). Sustained virological response (SVR) was assessed 12 weeks and 24 weeks after completion of treatment.Results:63 patients (median age 52 [range 30-69] years; 80% males) were treated. Most (76.2%) were treatment experienced and predominant HCV genotype was 3 (77.7%) followed by 1 (20.6%). Median transient elastography (Fibroscan) score was 7 (range 3-11) kPa and none of the patients had cirrhosis. SVR12 was achieved in 60 of 63 patients (95.2%) while SVR24 was noted in 59 (93.7%). SVR12 rates were as good in genotype-3 as in genotype-1. Older age, longer period after transplantation, higher Fibroscan value and higher need for erythropoietin were likely to be associated with relapse. Adverse effects were noted in 34 patients and weakness and fatigue were the commonest side effects. Significant drop in hemoglobin (Conclusions:SOF + RBV combination therapy for 24 weeks was safe and effective in treatment of for post-LT recurrent HCV in a single LT center and remains relevant due to its low cost and lack of drug interactions.
