The expression of Rabl3 and Cullin7 is relevant to the carcinogenesis of certain cancers. However, the relationship of this expression with hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. To study the protein expression of Rabl3 and Cullin7 and to evaluate their role in hepatocarcinogenesis, in 162 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of Rabl3 and Cullin7 in both the cancer tissues and the normal hepatic tissues around the hepatocellular carcinoma. The results demonstrated that the rates of positive Rabl3 and Cullin7 expression were 80.2% and 69.1%, respectively, in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. However, the rates of positive Rabl3 and Cullin7 expression were 31.5% and 29.0%, respectively, in adjacent normal hepatic tissues. Rabl3 and Cullin7 were expressed at significantly higher rates in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with adjacent normal hepatic tissues (P
