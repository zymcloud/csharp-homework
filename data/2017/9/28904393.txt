Among solid tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) emerges as a prototypical therapy-resistant tumor. Considering the emerging sorafenib resistance crisis in HCC, future studies are urgently required to overcome resistance. Recently noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as significant regulators in signalling pathways involved in cancer drug resistance and pharmacologically targeting these ncRNAs might be a novel stratagem to reverse drug resistance. In the current study, using a hybrid Petri net based computational model, we have investigated the harmonious effect of miR-17-92 cluster inhibitors/mimics and circular RNAs on sorafenib resistant HCC cells in order to explore potential resistance mechanisms and to identify putative targets for sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. An integrated model was developed that incorporates seven miRNAs belonging to miR-17-92 cluster (hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-17-3p, hsa-miR-19a, hsa-miR-19b, hsa-miR-18a, hsa-miR-20a and hsa-miR-92) and crosstalk of two signaling pathways (EGFR and IL-6) that are differentially regulated by these miRNAs. The mechanistic connection was proposed by the correlation between members belonging to miR-17-92 cluster and corresponding changes in the protein levels of their targets in HCC, specifically those targets that have verified importance in sorafenib resistance. Current findings uncovered potential pathway features, underlining the significance of developing modulators of this cluster to combat drug resistance in HCC.
