Objective: To investigate the prognostic value of quantitative parameters of dynamic contrast-enhangced MR (DCE-MR) on short-term efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Methods: 79 patients with HCC underwent non-enhanced MR imaging and DCE on a 3.0T MR scanner before and one month after TACE. The quantitative parameters were measured on the maximal tumor region, including maximal tumor diameter(MTD), ADC, K(trans,) K(ep) and V(e) value before and after TACE. All patients were divided into stable group (36 patients) and progressive group (43 patients) based on follow-up. The quantitative data of the two groups before and after TACE was collected for analysis. Results: Among the 79 lesions in 79 patients, 21 were located in the left lobe of the liver, 53 in the right lobe of the liver and 5 in the junction area of the hepatic lobe. The maximum tumor diameter (MTD) was 2.2-9.9 cm, the median MTD was 5.1 cm. There were significant differences between progressive group and the stable group in MTD, K(trans,) K(ep) values of the tumor before TACE (P<0.05). One month after TACE, the MTD, K(trans,) K(ep,)ΔMTD, ΔK(trans) and ΔK(ep) values of the tumor in progressive group were statistically different with the stable group (P<0.05, respectively). For all the patients, the pre-TACE MTD, AFP, K(trans) and K(ep) values of tumors were statistically different with the post-TACE values (P<0.05). Conclusion: The quantitative parameters (K(trans,) K(ep,)ΔK(trans) and ΔK(ep) values) of the DCE-MR could predict and evaluate the short-term efficacy of TACE on HCC.
