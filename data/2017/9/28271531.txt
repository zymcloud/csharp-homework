Background:We aimed to determine the value of contrast-enhanced sonography (CEUS) with Sonazoid prior to percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of small (Methods:This prospective study was approved by our institutional review board and informed consent was obtained. The following criteria were used for study enrollment: (1) cirrhotic patients with HCCs found by contrast-enhanced CT or Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI; (2) a single HCC Results:A total of 38 patients with 43 HCCs (mean size, 1.6 cm; range, 0.5-2.9 cm) were enrolled. The vascular phase of Sonazoid-enhanced ultrasonography showed good tumor enhancement in 30/43 HCCs (70%). The Kupffer phase increased lesion conspicuity and operator's diagnostic confidence in 29 patients with 31 HCCs (31/43, 72%) compared with conventional US.Conclusions:CEUS with Sonazoid is useful for detection and targeting of small HCC prior to RFA.
