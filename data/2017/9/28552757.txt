The low redox potential of selenide and selenol is physiologically important, as it confers efficient catalytic abilities to selenoproteins. Quantitative determination of selenol and selenide provide important clues for understanding the metabolism and physiological function of selenium. However, selective detection of selenol and selenide is extremely difficult because of their chemical similarity to thiol and sulfide. In this study, we established a highly sensitive, selective, quantitative, and simple method for detection of selenol and selenide, using a reaction with monochlorobimane (MCB), followed by ethyl acetate extraction of the product syn-(methyl,methyl)bimane. We analyzed selenide production from selenite, catalyzed by human glutathione reductase, and also determined selenide and selenol concentrations in Hepa1-6 cells using the MCB method, to demonstrate its practical applications. This study provides a new tool for selenium detection in biology.
