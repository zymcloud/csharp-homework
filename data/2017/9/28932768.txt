Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a benign liver tumor most frequently occurring in women using oral contraception. HCA develops in normal or nearly normal livers and is extremely rare in cirrhosis. The authors present magnetic resonance imaging and histopathologic findings in a 57-year-old man with liver cirrhosis and hepatic adenomatosis. As the differentiation between HCA and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be difficult with imaging, we would like to highlight the importance of ancillary findings such as the presence of iron on MRI, which can be observed in HCA.
