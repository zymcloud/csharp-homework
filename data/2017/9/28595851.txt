We compared a quasi-static ultrasound elastography technique, referred to as electrode displacement elastography (EDE), with acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) for monitoring microwave ablation (MWA) procedures on patients diagnosed with liver neoplasms. Forty-nine patients recruited to this study underwent EDE and ARFI with a Siemens Acuson S2000 system after an MWA procedure. On the basis of visualization results from two observers, the ablated region in ARFI images was recognizable on 20 patients on average in conjunction with B-mode imaging, whereas delineable ablation boundaries could be generated on 4 patients on average. With EDE, the ablated region was delineable on 40 patients on average, with less imaging depth dependence. Study of tissue-mimicking phantoms revealed that the ablation region dimensions measured on EDE and ARFI images were within 8%, whereas the image contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio with EDE was two to three times higher than that obtained with ARFI. This study indicated that EDE provided improved monitoring results for minimally invasive MWA in clinical procedures for liver cancer and metastases.
