Liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is strategically challenging because the very good mid-term outcomes of this treatment jar with the risk of cancer recurrence. Although Milan criteria (MC) tap the balance on the safe side, they tend to be considered too restrictive and new, enlarged criteria have been conceived in order to enlarge the pool of potential recipients. Some extended criteria are more audacious then others, but they seem to be well tailored on the local reality they are applied to. Being HCC epidemiology and organs availability very variable between regions, a universally valid 'upper limit' is yet to be determinable.
