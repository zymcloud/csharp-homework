Background:Peritoneum metastasis of lung cancer is a rare event which, in addition to the peritoneum, usually involves multiple metastatic tissues. Here we report a case of a patient with lung adenosquamous cell carcinoma with the peritoneum as the sole distant metastatic site.Case presentation:An 82-year-old Han Chinese man, in the teaching profession, was diagnosed with lung adenosquamous cell carcinoma in the upper lobe of his left lung with the involvement of ipsilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and was initially staged as IIIa (cT2N2M0). Molecular testing identified a mutation at KRAS G12A. Due to his poor physical condition, our patient was given gamma knife radiotherapy with a total dose of 28.0 Gy. Two weeks later, our patient was diagnosed as peritoneal metastasis identified by using magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed with ascitic cytology and peritoneal histology. No other distant metastatic sites such as liver, brain, bone, paranephroi, and lungs were found. Subsequently, our patient received palliative intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and died within 2 months.Conclusions:Our patient represented a rare case of lung adenosquamous cell carcinoma harboring the KRAS G12A mutation, which metastasized distantly to the peritoneum only, and progressed rapidly.
