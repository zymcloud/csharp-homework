The levels of the products of RNA polymerase III-dependent genes (Pol III genes), including tRNAs and 5S rRNA, are elevated in transformed and tumor cells, which potentiate tumorigenesis. TFIIB-related factor 1 (Brf1) is a key transcription factor and specifically regulates the transcription of Pol III genes. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that a decrease in Brf1 reduces Pol III gene transcription and is sufficient for inhibiting cell transformation and tumor formation. Emerging evidence indicates that dysregulation of Brf1 and Pol III genes is linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans and animals. We have reported that Brf1 is overexpressed in human liver cancer patients and that those with high Brf1 levels have shorter survivals. This review summarizes the effects of dysregulation of these genes on HCC and their regulation by signaling pathways and epigenetics. These novel data should help us determine the molecular mechanisms of HCC from a different perspective and guide the development of therapeutic approaches for HCC patients.
