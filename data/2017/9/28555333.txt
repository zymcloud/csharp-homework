Purpose:This prospective study was to investigate the value of [11C]-acetate PET and [18F]-FDG PET in the evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before and after treatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody (bevacizumab).Methods:Twenty-two patients (three women, 19 men; 62 ± 8 years) with HCC verified by histopathology were treated with TACE and bevacizumab (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11). [11C]-acetate PET and [18F]-FDG PET were performed before and after TACE with bevacizumab or placebo. Comparisons between groups were performed with t-tests and Chi-squared tests, where appropriate. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from start of bevacizumab or placebo until the date of death/last follow-up, respectively.Results:The patient-related sensitivity of [11C]-acetate PET, [18F]-FDG PET, and combined [11C]-acetate and [18F]-FDG PET was 68%, 45%, and 73%, respectively. There was a significantly higher rate of conversion from [11C]-acetate positive lesions to negative lesions in patients treated with TACE and bevacizumab as compared with that in patients with TACE and placebo (p < 0.05). In patients with negative acetate PET, the mean OS in patients treated with TACE and bevacizumab was 259 ± 118 days and was markedly shorter as compared with that (668 ± 217 days) in patients treated with TACE and placebo (p < 0.05). In patients treated with TACE and placebo, there was significant difference in mean OS in patients with positive FDG PET as compared with that in patients with negative FDG PET (p < 0.05). The HCC lesions had different tracer avidities showing the heterogeneity of HCC.Conclusions:Our study suggests that combining [18F]-FDG with [11C]-acetate PET could be useful for the management of HCC patients and might also provide relevant prognostic and molecular heterogeneity information.
