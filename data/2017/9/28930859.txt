Background:Loss of tumor suppressor gene p16 expression via promoter methylation has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlation between p16 methylation and HCC. Additionally, we also analyzed the potential prognostic role of p16 methylation, expression or alteration-associated HCC.Methods:Online databases based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline were performed to analyze the role of p16 gene in HCC. The combined odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were summarized.Results:Final 3105 HCCs and 808 non-tumor controls (chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis) were performed in this meta-analysis. p16 promoter methylation in HCC was significantly higher than in chronic hepatitis and chronic hepatitis in tissue and blood samples. In addition, p16 promoter methylation was notably higher in patients >50 years' old than in patients aged
