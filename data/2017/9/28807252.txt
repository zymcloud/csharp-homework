Background:Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with underlying cirrhosis poses a major operative challenge. Patients have a dismal prognosis without curative resection. The role of hepatic trisectionectomy in these patients is not established. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the perioperative outcome and prognosis of patients undergoing trisectionectomy with hepatic resection of a lesser extent.Methods:From 2000 to 2014, 48 patients underwent hepatic trisectionectomy for HCC with background cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis (Group A). Another (Group B) 520 patients underwent liver resection of a lesser extent. Patient demographics, clinicopathological data, perioperative outcome and long-term survival were compared between the 2 groups.Results:Intraoperative bloodloss, operating time and total hospital stay were significantly higher in trisectionectomy patients. Tumors were larger and more advanced in group A. The morbidity rate was 43.8% in group A compared to 27.5% in group B, p = 0.027. In-hospital mortality was 6.3% for group A. Group A had a significantly shorter time to recurrence (4.5months vs 6.2months, p = 0.036), as well as a poorer disease-free survival (DFS) than group B (6.3 months vs 15.7 months, p = 0.02). Overall survival was comparable. Tumor number, size, albumin, INR, microvascular invasions and positive resection margins were predictors of disease-free survival.Conclusion:Hepatic trisectionectomy may be associated with a higher morbidity and lower DFS. However, these patients would not be suitable candidates for ablative therapy or liver transplantation. With careful patient selection and meticulous surgical technique, trisectionectomy is feasible and gives these patients the only hope of cure.
