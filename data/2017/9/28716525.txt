Fibroblasts have been reported to play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of fibroblasts have not been fully understood. Conditioned medium collected from human peri-tumor tissue-derived fibroblasts (CM-pTAFs) showed high metastasis ability than human HCC tissues-derived fibroblasts (CM-TAFs). To determine what component was secreted from fibroblasts, we used Bio-Plex analysis system and compared the factors secreted from CM-pTAFs and CM-TAFs, found a series of up-regulated cytokines in the CM-pTAFs, including IL-6, CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL8, SCGF-β, HGF and VEGF. Pretreatment of IL-6 inhibitor Tocilizumab could inhibit metastasis the HCC cell treated with CM-pTAFs in vitro and in vivo. The expression of CCR2 and CXCR1 were up-regulated after CM-pTAFs treatment in HCC cell line SMMC-7721. Flow cytometric analysis experiment showed that most CCR2 or CXCR1 positive cells were also EpCAM positive. In vitro studies also showed that CM-pTAFs could increase stemness of SMMC-7721. In addition, neutralization of SCGF-β and HGF could significantly reduce metastasis and viability of cancer stem cells treated with CM-pTAFs. Taken together, these results indicated that the peri-tumor tissues derived fibroblasts may promote development of HCC by recruiting cancer stem cells and maintaining their stemness characteristic.
