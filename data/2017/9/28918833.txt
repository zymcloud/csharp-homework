Background:The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is widely used to classify hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was performed to investigate the prognostic factors for patients with BCLC stage A HCC after R0 hepatectomy.Methods:A total of 592 patients with BCLC stage A HCC following R0 hepatectomy from 1997-2012 were enrolled in this study. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression were used to analyze the risk factors associated with recurrence. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to establish a new scoring system to evaluate the independent risk factors for recurrence. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate surgical margins on tumor recurrence between the anatomic and nonanatomic resection group.Results:Independent risk factors for BCLC stage A HCC recurrence were preoperative alanine transaminase >40U/L, liver cirrhosis, surgical margin 5cm. Based on these 5 risk factors, we established a new scoring system, named "HCC recurrence scoring system." Patients with a high score (≥3 points, 1 point for each factor) composed the high recurrence risk group. Moreover, the subgroup analyses demonstrated that different surgical margins had no significant effect on tumor recurrence in the anatomic resection group (P = 0.408), while it had a significant effect in the nonanatomic resection group (P = 0.000).Conclusions:For patients with BCLC stage A with scores ≥3 points, close postoperative follow-up and positive measures to prevent recurrence are particularly important. Anatomic resection is preferred for patients with BCLC stage A. Adequate surgical margins are necessary for patients with poor liver function.
