Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is an antioxidant protein containing selenium. Owing to the limitations of native GPx, considerable efforts have been made to develop GPx mimics. Here, a short 5-mer peptides (5P) was synthesized and characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Enzyme coupled assays were used to evaluate GPx activity. The cell viability and apoptosis of H22 cells were tested, and mice bearing H22 cell-derived tumors were used to determine the effects of 5P on tumor inhibition. In comparison with other enzyme models, 5P provided a suitable substrate with proper catalytic site positions, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity. In our mouse model, 5P showed excellent inhibition of tumor growth and improved immunity. In summary, our findings demonstrated the design and synthesis of the small 5P molecule, which inhibited tumor growth and improved immunity. Notably, 5P could inhibit tumor growth without affecting normal growth. Based on these advantages, the novel mimic may have several clinical applications.
