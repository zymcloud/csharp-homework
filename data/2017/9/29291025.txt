Background:Numerous articles reported that dysregulated expression levels of miRNAs correlated with survival time of HCC patients. However, there has not been a comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate the accurate prognostic value of miRNAs in HCC.Design:Meta-analysis.Materials and methods:Studies, published in English, estimating expression levels of miRNAs with any survival curves in HCC were identified up until 15 April, 2017 by performing online searches in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews by two independent authors. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the correlation between miRNA expression and overall survival (OS).Results:54 relevant articles about 16 miRNAs, with 6464 patients, were ultimately included. HCC patients with high expression of tissue miR-9 (HR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.46-3.76), miR-21 (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.29-2.41), miR-34c (HR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.05-2.57), miR-155 (HR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.46-5.51), miR-221 (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.02-3.04) or low expression of tissue miR-22 (HR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.63-3.21), miR-29c (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.10-1.65), miR-34a (HR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.30-2.59), miR-199a (HR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.89-4.08), miR-200a (HR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.86-3.77), miR-203 (HR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.61-3.00) have significantly poor OS (P < 0.05). Likewise, HCC patients with high expression of blood miR-21 (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.07-2.80), miR-192 (HR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.15-5.10), miR-224 (HR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.14-2.12) or low expression of blood miR-148a (HR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.11-4.59) have significantly short OS (P < 0.05).Conclusions:In conclusion, tissue miR-9, miR-21, miR-22, miR-29c, miR-34a, miR-34c, miR-155, miR-199a, miR-200a, miR-203, miR-221 and blood miR-21, miR-148a, miR-192, miR-224 demonstrate significantly prognostic value. Among them, tissue miR-9, miR-22, miR-155, miR-199a, miR-200a, miR-203 and blood miR-148a, miR-192 are potential prognostic candidates for predicting OS in HCC.
