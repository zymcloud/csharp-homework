Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph) Receptor, as a family member of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), plays a critical role in modulating different cell behaviors. It is also closely related to tumorigenesis. However, little has been known about its prognostic values in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Thus, we studied the expression levels of EphB1/2 and p-EphB1/2 in both NSCLC tissue and normal lung tissue, and analyzed their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics as well as NSCLC patients' survival. In the present study, 156 NSCLC tissue samples and 28 distal normal lung tissue samples were collected from 156 NSCLC patients. Afterwards, the protein levels of EphB1/2 and p-EphB1/2 were detected by immunohistochemistry. Their prognostic values were also evaluated using both univariate and multivariate survival analysis. According to the results, 44.87% (70/156) NSCLC samples were detected with positive EphB1/2 expression, significantly higher than that in distal normal lung tissue (16%, 4/25); but no difference was found regarding to p-EphB1/2 expression. With respect to the clinicopathological characteristics, there was no significant correlation between protein levels and age, gender, histological type, differentiation status as well as TNM stage. Intriguingly, it showed a clear trend of increased EphB1/2-positive rate when tumor differentiation grade developed. In the survival analysis, a positive correlation was found between positive p-EphB1/2 expression and poor survival in female (P=0.001). Then N stage (P=0.001) and TNM stage (P
