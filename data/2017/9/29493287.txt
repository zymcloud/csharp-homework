Aim:Vitamin D is involved in antiviral/antitumor activities. Its associations to hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unclear.Materials & methods:A retrospective study was conducted on 232 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 72 HIV-infected patients. The correlation between serum 25(OH)D3 and 25 vitamin D receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms to disease progression and interferons were evaluated.Results:The 25(OH)D3 was associated with HBV infection and progression. In HIV, it was linked to treatment responsiveness. In CHB, cirrhotic and HCC patients, it was associated with viral load. Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms were related to disease progression in HBV infection. In HCC, IFN-λ levels were associated with 25(OH)D3 levels negatively.Conclusion:Serum vitamin D level and vitamin D receptor genetic polymorphisms are associated with CHB and HIV disease progression and IFN-λs.
