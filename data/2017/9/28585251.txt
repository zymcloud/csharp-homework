A recurrent YAP1-TFE3 gene fusion has been identified in WWTR1-CAMTA1-negative epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas arising in soft tissue, bone, and lung, but not in liver. We present the first case of TFE3-rearranged hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in a 39-year-old Taiwanese woman. Computed tomography scan revealed multifocal, ill-defined nodules involving both hepatic lobes. She then underwent deceased donor liver transplantation. Histologically, the tumors in the liver explant showed a biphasic growth pattern. One component was composed of dilated and well-formed blood vessels lined by epithelioid cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, mimicking an alveolar pattern, whereas the other component was composed of cords and single cells, featuring intracytoplasmic vacuoles, separated by a myxoid stroma. The tumor cells showed vesicular nuclei and small indistinct nucleoli with mild to moderate cytologic atypia. Most tumor cells showed factor VIII, CD34, CD31, and TFE3 positivity in immunohistochemical study. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for the tumor cells exhibited TFE3 gene rearrangement. The patient is currently alive, and no post-operative tumor recurrence developed during a 13-year follow-up. Awareness of this rare vasoformative variant and identification of the gene rearrangement would be helpful on differential diagnosis with other high-grade carcinoma and angiosarcoma of liver.
