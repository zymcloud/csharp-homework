Purpose:To determine the value of radioembolization (RE) for treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Records of patients undergoing RE for unresectable HCC were retrospectively reviewed. Biochemical and clinical toxicities, imaging response (according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors), time-to-progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Data were stratified according to clinical and procedural parameters. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.Results:One hundred and fifteen patients (89 male, mean age 69.3 years) underwent 158 REs (119 resin-, 39 glass-based) (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC]-A: 6.1%, B: 33.9%, C: 60.0%). Median clinical follow-up was 5.9 (0.9-83.5) months. No grade 4 or 5 clinical toxicities were noted. Objective response rate was 35.6%; disease control rate was 76.7%. Median TTP of the treated part of the liver was 4 (0.9-45.4) months. 108/115 patients died during follow-up (median OS 8.4 [0.3-82.8] months after first RE [BCLC-A: 52.8 months, BCLC-B: 12.4 months, BCLC-C: 6.1 months]). On multivariate analysis, baseline Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group status Conclusions:RE is safe and effective in carefully selected patients suffering from HCC with a low complication rate. Low baseline Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group status and absence of ascites prior to RE are positive prognostic factors.
