Objective:The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between preoperative Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) categories and prognosis after curative resection of single hepatic malignancies in patients with chronic liver disease.Materials and methods:Between January 2008 and December 2010, 225 patients with chronic liver disease underwent resection of single hepatic malignant tumors (218 hepatocellular carcinomas, three cholangiocarcinomas, four biphenotypic carcinomas) after undergoing gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. Two radiologists retrospectively categorized the tumors into LI-RADS categories. Differences in disease-free survival duration between categories were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test.Results:Reviewer 1 categorized two (0.9%) patients as having LR-3, 53 (23.6%) LR-4, 159 (70.7%) LR-5, and 11 (4.9%) LR-M lesions. The corresponding numbers for reviewer 2 were six (2.7%) LR-3, 30 (13.3%) LR-4, 178 (79.1%) LR-5, and 11 (4.9%) LR-M. The 2-year cumulative recurrence or death rates were 15.1% for lesions categorized LR-3 or LR-4 by reviewer 1, 31.7% for LR-5, and 60% for LR-M. For lesions categorized by reviewer 2 the corresponding rates were 20.6% for LR-3 or LR-4, 29% for LR-5, and 54.5% for LR-M. Disease-free survival was significantly worse among patients with lesions categorized as LR-M than for lesions categorized as LR-3 or LR-4 or as LR-5 (p Conclusion:Patients with tumors preoperatively categorized as LR-M may have a worse prognosis than those with tumors categorized LR-3, LR-4, or LR-5 after curative resection of single hepatic malignancy.
