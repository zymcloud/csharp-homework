Objective:The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical implications of lactate concentrations in patients with hepatitis B with or without cirrhosis during treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues.Patients and methods:One hundred and seven consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B and median age 57 (24-85) years were prospectively included. Lactate concentrations were measured at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months following the baseline measurements. Eight (n=8, 7.5%) patients received lamivudine, 38 (n=38, 35.5%) patients received tenofovir, 34 (n=34, 31.8%) patients received entecavir, and 27 (n=27, 25.2%) patients received combined therapy.Results:None of the patients developed lactic acidosis during follow-up [median: 58 (6-155) months]. Overall, no trends of the lactic acid evolution were observed over time; however, there was a nonsignificant increasing trend in patients with cirrhosis up to 24 months of treatment. This increasing trend was significant in female patients with cirrhosis (P=0.016). The age of the patients, the presence of cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma were strongly associated with the survival of all patients. In the group of cirrhotic patients, the only independent prognostic factor that was associated with patients' survival was the Child-Pugh class.Conclusion:None of the patients developed lactic acidosis. There is an indication of an increasing trend of lactic acid levels up to 24 months of therapy in female cirrhotic patients.
