Background:Sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) are recommended therapies for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but their combined efficacy remains unclear.Methods:Between August 2004 and November 2014, 104 patients with BCLC stage B/C HCC were enrolled at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, China. Forty-eight patients were treated with sorafenib alone (sorafenib group) and 56 with TACE plus sorafenib (TACE + sorafenib group). Baseline demographic/clinical data were collected. The primary outcomes were median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes were overall response rate (ORR) and sorafenib-related adverse events (AEs). Baseline characteristics associated with disease prognosis were identified using multivariate Cox hazards regression.Results:The mean age of the 104 patients (94 males; 90.38%) was 49.02 Â± 12.29 years. Of the baseline data, only albumin level (P = 0.028) and Child-Pugh class (P = 0.017) differed significantly between groups. Median OS did not differ significantly between the sorafenib and TACE + sorafenib groups (18.0 vs. 22.0 months, P = 0.223). Median PFS was significantly shorter in the sorafenib group than that in the TACE + sorafenib group (6.0 vs. 8.0 months, P = 0.004). Six months after treatments, the ORRs were similar between the sorafenib and TACE + sorafenib groups (12.50% vs. 18.75%, P = 0.425). The rates of grade III-IV adverse events in sorafenib and TACE + sorafenib groups were 29.2% vs. 23.2%, respectively. TACE plus sorafenib treatment (HR = 0.498, 95% CI = 0.278-0.892), no vascular invasion (HR = 0.354, 95% CI = 0.183-0.685) and Child-Pugh class A (HR = 0.308, 95% CI = 0.141-0.674) were significantly associated with better OS, while a larger tumor number was predictive of poorer OS (HR = 1.286, 95% CI = 1.031-1.604). TACE plus sorafenib treatment (HR = 0.461, 95% CI = 0.273-0.780) and no vascular invasion (HR = 0.557, 95% CI = 0.314-0.988) were significantly associated with better PFS.Conclusions:Compared with sorafenib alone, combining TACE with sorafenib might prolong survival and delay disease progression in patients with advanced HCC.
