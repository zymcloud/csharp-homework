Background:Hohla et al. suggested that female gender could positively predict response to FOLFIRINOX in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In this study, we explored the response to the FOLFIRINOX regimen by gender within the trial PRODIGE4/ACCORD 11.Patients and methods:Data were described by gender, both in FOLFIRINOX group and in the intention-to-treat population of the trial. The relative effect of gender (females in comparison to males) on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival was estimated by using a Cox proportional hazard model and was presented with the Hazard Ratio and their 95% confidence interval. The analysis of prognostic factors of OS included also: age (older than 65 years), ECOG performance status, primary tumor location, synchronous metastases, number of metastatic sites, hepatic metastasis, pulmonary metastases, lymph node metastases, level of Albumin and level of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and three domains from the EORTC Quality of Life QLQC-30 questionnaire.Results:The FOLFIRINOX group (N = 171 patients) included 106 women (62%) and 65 men. No significant differences were observed between genders regarding demographic and clinical parameters, excepted for lymph nodes metastasis (17% and 35% in women and men respectively; p = 0.012). Median OS was longer for females as compared to males in FOLFIRINOX group (13.1 versus 10.3 months respectively; HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.06). Similarly, median PFS was superior (7.2 versus 5.9 months; HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.10). Nevertheless, in both cases, the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.10 et p = 0.169, respectively).Conclusions:In this study, the overall survival and progression-free survival rates were not significantly higher for females than for males in FOLFIRINOX group (HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.06 and HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.10 respectively). Even if the percentage of patients with lymph node metastasis is higher for males than for females, the interaction between gender and lymph node metastasis was non-significant. Our exploratory analysis did not permit to definitively conclude about a possible effect of gender on the prognosis of patients under FOLFIRINOX. This subject deserves further evaluation.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00112658.Key message:Our analysis suggests that FOLFIRINOX, as first-line option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who are younger than 76 years and who have a good performance status (ECOG 0 or 1), no cardiac ischemia and normal or nearly normal bilirubin levels, is beneficial, but not particularly in female patients.
