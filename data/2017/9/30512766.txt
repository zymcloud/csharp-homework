Management and surveillance of compensated Cirrhosis. Patients with compensated cirrhosis are now identified early using non-invasive fibrosis tests. Therapeutic advances in hepatology, in particular antiviral agents, have changed their prognosis by dramatically reducing the occurrence of liver complications, whether hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, the latter, when managed early, have also been the subject of major therapeutic advances, thus explaining the longer survival of cirrhotic patients. Finally, management of comorbidities frequently encountered in these patients, is also key in their follow-up. Thus, surveillance and early detection of life-threatening complications such as portal hypertension or liver cancer are major stakes in these patients, who will benefit from a multidisciplinary management.
