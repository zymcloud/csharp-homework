Aims:To identify predictors of a therapeutic effect after transarterial chemoembolisation using drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Between January 2015 and July 2015, tumour variables and angiographic data were collected for 25 patients (49 target lesions) after they had undergone the DEB-TACE procedure for HCC. The therapeutic effect was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Cancer of the Liver at follow-up dynamic computed tomography (CT) performed within 1-4 months after the procedure. A pResults:On a target lesion basis, the objective response (TE3/4) rate was 63.3% (31 of 49). On univariate analysis, larger size (â‰¥2 cm) was a predictor of an objective response (p=0.029). The tumour location of the medial (segment 4) or caudate (segment 1) lobe also indicated a poor therapeutic effect (TE1/2), but not at the level of significance (p=0.051). Multivariate analysis identified tumour size (odds ratio, 8.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.87-62.8) and tumour location (odds ratio, 12.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.12-129.8) as significant factors associated with a therapeutic effect. On a patient basis, 10 of 25 (40%) patients showed complete response/partial response. There were no significant differences between complete response/partial response and stable disease/progressive disease regarding age, gender, tumour markers, history of previous treatment, Child-Pugh class, T-stage, or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging.Conclusion:A short-term therapeutic effect was associated with tumour size and location on a target lesion basis.
