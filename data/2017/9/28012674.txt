Background/purpose:Occult hepatitis B infection (OHB) is not rare in countries that are endemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Notably, OHB has been shown to play a role in the progression of liver diseases, including the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the data is inconsistent. We aim to clarify the contribution of concurrent OHB to the progression of liver diseases in a long-term cohort of patients with HCV infection and to investigate the value of total anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc) antibody as a surrogate OHB biomarker.Methods:We included 250 chronic anti-HCV-positive patients who had resolved HBV infection (anti-HBc positive and hepatitis B surface antigen negative). OHB was then detected using a sensitive commercial assay for serum HBV DNA with a low limit of detection of 6 IU/mL. Clinical outcomes, including the development of liver cirrhosis, HCC, and all-cause deaths, were compared between OHB-positive and OHB-negative patients.Results:At baseline, only 183 (73.20%) patients had positive HCV ribonucleic acid, and 56 (30.60%) of these 183 patients with active HCV infection had OHB. The presence of OHB did not correlate with any adverse clinical outcome in multivariate analyses. In addition, chronic hepatitis C patients with OHB did not have a higher level of serum total anti-HBc.Conclusion:OHB infection may not contribute to the development of adverse liver outcomes in patients with chronic HCV.
