Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant disease of the liver in China and Japan. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of HCC patients after hepatectomy between two regional medical centers in China and Japan.Methods:Data on HCC after hepatectomy were collected from January 2005 to December 2014 from Nagasaki University Hospital in Nagasaki, Japan and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University in Nanchang, China. The patient and tumor characteristics, HCC etiology, and overall survival rates after hepatectomy were investigated.Results:Two hundred patients in the Nagasaki group and 238 patients in the Nanchang group were diagnosed with HCC and underwent hepatectomy. The major underlying liver diseases were hepatitis C infection (32%, 64/200) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (34.5%, 69/200) in the Nagasaki group, while in the Nanchang group, hepatitis B infection (79.4%, 189/238) was the dominant etiology. Large tumors (> 5 cm), the presence of a tumor capsule and a high alpha-fetoprotein value (â‰¥ 400 U/L) were more frequently observed in the Nanchang group as compared with the Nagasaki group (p Conclusion:There are significant differences in the clinicopathologic features and outcomes of HCC patients from Japan and China. These differences may impact the eligibility for potentially curative therapy and the prognosis of patients with HCC.
