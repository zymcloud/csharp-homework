Objective To screen the differentially expressed key molecules of HAb18G/CD147 signal transduction pathway in human hepatoma cells. Methods The total RNA was extracted from SMMC-7721 and T7721 cells, which were stably transfected and overexpressed HAb18G/CD147, and then detected by signal transduction-related microarray to identify differentially expressed key molecules. Results The microarray data indicated that there were 13 differentially expressed genes between T7721 and SMMC-7721 cells. In T7721 cell line which overexpressed HAb18G/CD147, the down-regulated genes included bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), BMP-5, endothelin-1 (ET-1), Wnt1-induced signaling proteins-2/CCN5 (WISP-2), cysteine-rich 61/CCN1 (Cyr61), prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and the up-regulated genes included interleukin-10 receptor α (IL-10Rα), IL-6, IL-8, CXCL2, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), B factor and βig-h3.Conclusion The study identified totally 13 differentially expressed genes which were related to HAb18G/CD147 signal transduction pathway. These genes are involved in the regulation of various hepatoma biological processes, such as immune microenvironment remolding, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis.
