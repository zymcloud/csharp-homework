High levels of triacylglycerols (TGs) have been linked to cardiovascular disease and liver diseases. Comprehensively analyzing TGs is helpful to understand the TGs functions in these diseases. However, due to the existence of a large number of isomers TGs and the lack of commercial standards, precise analysis of individual triacylglycerol (TG) with specific fatty acid chain composition is full of challenge. In this work, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) were employed for comprehensive qualification and quantification of TGs with specific fatty acid chain composition in horse adipose tissue, human plasma and liver tissues including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and para-carcinoma tissues. Multiple MS detection modes from QTRAP MS and FT-ICR MS were utilized, and hundreds of TG species (including many oxidized TG species) with their specific fatty acid chain compositions have been qualified and quantified. The isomer TGs interference, the isobaric interference, and oxidized TG species interference were firstly indicated. Several isomer TGs, for example, 18:1/20:1/18:2 TG and 20:3/18:1/18:0 TG, which were all 56:4 TG, demonstrated different trends in HCC tissue compared with para-carcinoma tissue, which showed the importance of analysis of TG with specific fatty acid chain composition. In addition, 10 TGs with the degree of unsaturation beyond three were significantly decreased, while 16:0/17:0/18:0 TG, no double bond, was significantly increased in the HCC tissue, which firstly revealed aberrant specific TG metabolism in HCC. This is a systematic report about comprehensive analysis of TGs by UPLC-ESI-MS, which is of significance for accurate analysis of these lipids.
