Purpose:To review the initial imaging responses after drug-eluting embolic trans-arterial chemoembolization (DEE-TACE) delivered with the Surefire Infusion System Â® for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Single center retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent DEE-TACE for HCC, delivered with SIS. Information was gathered from available medical records. Treatment response rates were assessed using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Assessment of adverse events was categorized per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.Results:Twenty-two patients with 39 hepatocellular carcinoma lesions were treated with the surefire infusion system. Complete response was demonstrated in 32% of patients and 54% of lesions after a single treatment session. Overall disease response was demonstrated in 91% of patients and 85% of lesions after a single treatment. No grade 3 or higher elevations in liver function tests were demonstrated in the short-term.Conclusion:SIS delivered DEE-TACE leads to a higher than expected initial response in patients with HCC.
