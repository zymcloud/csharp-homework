Objective:The aim of this study was to devise the quantitative scoring system for Chromosomal instability (CIN) based on morphological indicators like MPM, NB, NPB, CS, La and MN in cancer cell line and to correlate it with cell viability and death.Methods:Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were treated with drugs like Diethylstilbestrol 0-100μM, Griseofulvin 0-40μg/ml, Vincristine sulphate 0-25μg/ml, Mitomycin C 0-600ng/ml, Bleomycin 0-10μg/ml, Doxorubicin 0-30μg/ml for 24h. Following this, the CIN was assessed by counting the morphological indicators like Micronuclei (MN), Nuclear Buds (NB), Nucleoplasmic bridges, Laggards, Multipolar mitosis and chromatin strings/1000 cells in Giemsa stained smears by light microscopy and by determining the percentage of aneuploid cells by flow cytometry. The cell viability was assessed by MTT assay and percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry.Results:The MN and NB were most frequently seen indicators and main determinants of morphological CIN. However, the morphological CIN score did not show any correlation with cell viability and apoptosis. Aneuploidy however was found to correlate positively with cell viability and NB score in our study (P-value Conclusions:The study for the 1st time attempted to develop a scoring system for CIN based on morphological parameters. However, a no correlation was observed between the later and cell viability or apoptosis. More robust techniques to quantify CIN may perhaps be more helpful in exploring the true link between CIN and cell viability in future.
