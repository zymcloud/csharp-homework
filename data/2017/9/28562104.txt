Objectives:Long-term antiviral therapy decreases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), however, it cannot eliminate the risk. We investigated the incidence of HCC at different stages of liver cirrhosis (LC) and identified clinical predictors for HCC development during antiviral therapy.Methods:The data from 356 treatment-naïve patients aged 40 to 69 years without a history of HCC who had received entecavir for ≥6 months were collected retrospectively. The incidence of HCC was evaluated in patients with CHB only, with LC without varices (stage 1), with varices (stage 2), and with ascites (stage 3).Results:The median follow-up period was 3.6 years. In total, 45 patients (12.6%) developed HCC. The annual incidence rates of HCC in patients with CHB only or LC in stages 1, 2, and 3 were 0.4%, 2.6%, 9.8%, and 6.7%, respectively. In multivariate analyzes, LC at stage 2 (hazard ratio [HR] 17.16, 95% confidence interval [C.I.] 3.93-75.01, p Conclusions:LC with significant portal hypertension (varices or ascites), alcohol consumption, and older age at the time of starting antiviral therapy are independent predictors for future HCC development.
