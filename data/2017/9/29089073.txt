Objective To analyze the expression profile of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and explore its possible mechanism and clinical value in the occurrence and development of HCC. Methods TLRs expression data and HCC clinical information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Statistical analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between TLRs expression and clinicopathological factors of HCC, as well as the effect on the prognosis of patients. Results Compared with normal tissues, TLRs expression in cancer tissues was down-regulated except for TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9; the expression level of TLRs was not associated with patients' TNM stages or prognosis. Correlation analysis showed that all the TLRs were positively correlated with caspase-1 and interleukin 1β (IL-1β); TLR3 did not show any significant correlation with IL-18; TLR3, TLR4 and TLR6 did not show any significant correlation with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). Conclusion The expressions of some TLRs are down-regulated in HCC tissues, and there is a positive correlation between TLRs and inflammasome-associated cytokines.
