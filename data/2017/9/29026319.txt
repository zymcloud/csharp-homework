Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) >200 nucleotides in length that govern diverse biological processes. Recent evidence suggests that lncRNAs are involved in cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and metastasis. Dysregulation of lncRNAs has been observed in various tumors, and lncRNAs act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in these malignancies. It has been revealed that lncRNA highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) is tightly correlated with a number of cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, osteosarcoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Depletion of HULC suppressed cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced apoptosis. Additionally, HULC may function as a diagnostic biomarker and prognostic indicator for some tumors. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the role of HULC in cancer progression and the clinical management of human cancers.
