Purpose:To assess the impact of a Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) structured template on quality of reports for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A departmental structured LI-RADS template was adopted in April 2015. CT and MRI reports from September 2014 to February 2016 with probable or definite HCC were reviewed. Reporting of the following was recorded for each lesion and compared between template and free-text reports: (1) LI-RADS category, (2) Couinaud segment, and (3) unequivocal description of presence or absence of major LI-RADS HCC features: arterial phase hyperenhancement, "washout," diameter, threshold growth, and "capsule."Results:There were 306 definite or probable HCCs, 125 (40.8%) reported with free text and 181 (59.2%) with the template. LI-RADS category was reported in 23 of 125 (18.4%) HCCs with free text and in 178 of 181 (98.3%) HCCs with the template (P Conclusions:Use of structured LI-RADS template resulted in more comprehensive and consistent reporting of major HCC features and LI-RADS category compared with free-text reporting.
