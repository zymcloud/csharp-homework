Comprehensively investigate the association of CT morphology and clinical findings of adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation status. Retrospectively included 282 patients who was pathologically proved as lung adenocarcinoma with known EGFR mutation status (mutations: 138 patients, female: 86, median age: 66 years; wildtype: 144 patients, female: 67, median age: 62 years) and their pre-treatment CT scans were analyzed. CT findings and clinical information were collected. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed. Adjusted for age, gender and smoking history of two groups, significantly more patients with pleural tags, pleural and liver metastases were found in the EGFR mutated group (P = 0.007, 0.004, and 0.043, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that the model included age, gender, smoking history, air bronchogram, pleural tags, pleural and liver metastasis had a moderate predictive value for EGFR mutation status (AUC = 0.741, P < .0001). Exon-19 deletion was associated with air bronchogram which adjusted for age, gender and smoking history (P = 0.007, OR: 2.91, 95%CI: 1.25-7.79). The evidence of pleural tags, pleural and liver metastases go along with a higher probability of EGFR mutation in adenocarcinoma patients and air bronchogram is positively associated with Exon-19 deletion mutation.
