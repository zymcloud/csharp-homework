In this study genotyping of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients was conducted to detect polymorphisms on the X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) and xeroderma pigmentosum complementary group D (XPD) genes and analyze the relationship of their presence with the clinical features of the cancer. A total of 172 patients with HCC were selected in Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, from January 2010 to September 2011. All patients underwent resection of HCC and no tumor metastases were found. Peripheral venous blood samples (3-5 ml) were collected from the patients to extract genomic DNA. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and gene sequencing. During the five-year follow-up, the survival of patients with various genotypes of XRCC1 and XPD genes were observed and compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of XRCC1 and XPD genes and the prognosis of patients with HCC. Ï‡2 tests showed that XRCC1-194, XRCC1-280 and XPD-312 gene polymorphisms were significantly correlated with the number, location and diameter of the tumors (p<0.05). No significant difference was found in the survival curve of patients presenting different genotypes of the XRCC1-194 locus (p>0.05). Nevertheless, a significant difference was found in the survival curve of patients with AA and GG genotypes of the XRCC1-280 locus and in the patients with AA, GA and GG genotypes of the XPD-312 locus (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that the XRCC1-194 genotype was not an independent risk factor for HCC mortality risk (p>0.05), but XRCC1-280 (OR=1.815, p<0.01) and XPD-312 (OR=1.815, p<0.01) genotypes were independent risk factors for a poor prognosis. Taken together our results point to polymorphisms in XRCC1 and XPD genes as being related to the clinical characteristics of HCC, making them suitable prognostic markers of HCC.
