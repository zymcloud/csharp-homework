The present study investigated the effect of puerarin (Pu) on the sensitivity of HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to chemotherapeutic drugs to determine the possible mechanism. HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of Pu and cisplatin (CDDP), alone or in combination. MTT assay was used to determine the inhibitory effects of the different drugs on HepG2 cells. Cell morphology was observed by inverted microscopy. The expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bax protein was measured by western blot analysis. Pu and CDDP, alone or in combination, inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells. The inhibitory effect of CDDP combined with Pu on HepG2 cells was significantly higher than that of the single drug treatments (p
