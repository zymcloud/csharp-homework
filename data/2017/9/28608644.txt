Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks in the top of cancers leading to death. Early diagnosis is the big challenge in the case of HCC. Our in vitro study showed that Ezrin expression in lymphatic metastasis hepatocellular carcinoma (LNM-HCC) was associated with the metastatic rate. Here we aim to evaluate Ezrin expression as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker of LNM-HCC in mice. Chinese inbred 615 mice, Hca-F and Hca-P cell lines were used in the study. Histological changes were determined by Hematoxylin and Eosin, while Ezrin expression was assessed by qRT-PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Ezrin expression in this study gives credit to our in vitro study which Ezrin expression was positively correlated with LNM-HCC and negatively with Annexin7 (A7) expression. The highest histological changes were observed in high metastatic primary/secondary tumors combined with high Ezrin expression. Ezrin and A7 are higher in total primary tumors than in total secondary tumors (P = 0.0001, P = 0.021), respectively. Ezrin expression was enhanced in Hca-P A7 down-regulated primary/secondary tumors (P = 0.004), whereas, Ezrin expression was suppressed in Hca-F A7 upregulated primary/secondary tumors. Serum ELISA indicated differential expression of Ezrin among the study groups (P ≤ 0.0001). Ezrin expression was higher in NC-Hca-F than NC-Hca-P (P ≤ 0.0001), suppressed in Hca-F A7 upregulation (P ≤ 0.0001) and in enhanced in Hca-P A7 down-regulation (P = 0.0001). In conclusion, Ezrin level may serve as a differential diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker for high and low LNM-HCC and may be beneficial in the diagnosis of HCC disease. © 2017 BioFactors, 43(5):662-672, 2017.
