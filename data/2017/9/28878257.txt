MicroRNA-125a-5p (miR-125a) is a vertebrate homolog of lin-4, the first discovered microRNA, and plays a fundamental role in embryo development by downregulating Lin-28 protein. MiR-125a is also expressed in differentiated cells where it generally acts as an antiproliferative factor by targeting membrane receptors or intracellular transductors of mitogenic signals. MiR-125a expression is downregulated in several tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) where it targets sirtuin-7, matrix metalloproteinase-11, VEGF-A, Zbtb7a, and c-Raf. In this study, we have isolated the transcription promoter of human miR-125a and characterized its activity in HCC cells. It is a TATA-less Pol II promoter provided with an initiator element and a downstream promoter element, located 3939 bp upstream the genomic sequence of the miRNA. The activity of the promoter is increased by the transcription factor NF-kB, a master regulator of inflammatory response, and miR-125a itself was found to strengthen this activation through inhibition of TNFAIP3, a negative regulator of NF-kB. This finding contributes to explain the increased levels of miR-125a observed in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B.
