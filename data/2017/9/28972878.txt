Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the world. The nutrients play important roles in the development and progression of NAFLD. High-calorie diet, especially the diet rich in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, as well as sugary drinks with high fructose content, induces hepatic steatosis and triggers progression of steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Disordered micronutrient status and gut microbiota are also involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Nutrients related NAFLD could be aggravated by a genetic predisposition, for instance, genetic mutations in patatinlike phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2). Reduction of caloric intake through lifestyle interventions and use of dietary supplements such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and probiotics may help alleviate liver injury in NAFLD.
