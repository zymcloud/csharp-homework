Background:The impact of additional extra-hepatic primary cancer (EHPC) on the outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncertain.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the cancer registration database from a tertiary hospital in Southern Taiwan. Patients who were diagnosed with HCC from 2008 to 2012 were enrolled. Overall survival (OS), HCC-specific survival and recurrence after curative therapy were analyzed and compared between the patients with and the patients without EHPC.Results:EHPC was found in 121/1506 (8.0%) patients. HCC patients with EHPC were older, more likely to be classified as Child-Pugh A, less likely to have viral hepatitis B or C, more likely to be single, had early stage HCC and received curative therapy for HCC. The OS did not significantly differ between the patients with and without EHPC(p = 0.061). However, significantly higher HCC-specific survival was observed in patients with EHPC (pConclusions:Our results implied that EHPC did not affect OS, but HCC-related survival was better in patients with EHPC. Based on these findings, the management of additional primary cancer is warranted.
