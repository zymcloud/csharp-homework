Deregulation of ubiquitin ligases contributes to the malignant progression of human cancers. Tripartite motif-containing protein 65 (TRIM65) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and has been implicated in human diseases, but its role and clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. Here, we showed that TRIM65 expression was increased in HCC tissues and associated with poor outcome in two independent cohorts containing 888 patients. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that overexpression of TRIM65 promoted cell growth and tumor metastasis, whereas knockdown of TRIM65 resulted in opposite phenotypes. Further studies revealed that TRIM65 exerted oncogenic activities via ubiquitylation of Axin1 to activate the β-catenin signaling pathway. TRIM65 directly bound to Axin1 and accelerated its degradation through ubiquitylation. Furthermore, HMGA1 was identified as an upstream regulator of TRIM65 in HCC cells. In clinical samples, TRIM65 expression was positively correlated with the expression of HMGA1 and nuclear β-catenin. Collectively, our data indicate that TRIM65 functions as an oncogene in HCC. The newly identified HMGA1/TRIM65/β-catenin axis serves as a promising prognostic factor and therapeutic target.
