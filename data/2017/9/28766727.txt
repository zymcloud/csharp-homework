Background:Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A sustained virological response (SVR) is associated with improved outcomes, however, its impact on different ethnic groups is unknown.Aim:To evaluate ethnic differences in the natural history of CHC and the impact of SVR.Methods:We conducted a cohort study of 8039 consecutive adult CHC patients seen at two medical centres in California between January 1997 and June 2016. Individual chart review confirmed CHC diagnosis.Results:Asian and Hispanic but not African American patients had significantly higher cirrhosis and HCC incidence than Caucasians. On multivariate analysis, Hispanic ethnicity was independently associated with increased cirrhosis (adjusted HR 1.37, CI, confidence interval 1.10-1.71, P=.006) and HCC risk (adjusted HR 1.47, CI 1.13-1.92, P=.004) compared to Caucasian. Asian ethnicity had a significant association with cirrhosis (adjusted HR 1.28, CI 1.02-1.61, P=.034) and HCC risk (adjusted HR 1.29, CI 0.94-1.77, P=.025). In patients who achieved SVR, Hispanic ethnicity was no longer independently associated with cirrhosis (adjusted HR 1.76, CI 0.66-4.71, P=.26) or HCC (adjusted HR 1.05, CI 0.27-4.08, P=.94); nor was Asian ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.62, CI 0.21-1.82, P=.38 for cirrhosis; 2.01, CI 0.63-6.36, P=.24 for HCC). Similar findings were observed with overall survival among the ethnicities by SVR status.Conclusion:Hispanic and Asian ethnicity was independently associated with increased cirrhosis and HCC risk. Achieving an SVR eliminates the ethnic disparity in liver disease progression and overall survival between Hispanic and Asian vs Caucasian CHC patients.
