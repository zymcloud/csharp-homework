Both mitochondrial morphology and the level of cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]c are actively changed and play critical roles in a number of malignancies. However, whether communications existed between these two processes to ingeniously control the malignant phenotype are far from clear. We investigated the reciprocal regulation between mitochondrial fission and cytosolic calcium signaling in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Furthermore, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the synergistic effect on autophagy were explored. Our results showed that mitochondrial fission increased the [Ca2+]c and calcium oscillation in HCC cells. We further found that mitochondrial fission-mediated calcium signaling was dependent on ROS-activated NF-ÎºB pathways, which facilitated the expression of STIM1 and subsequent store-operated calciumentry. Additionally, we also demonstrated that increase in [Ca2+]c promoted mitochondrial fission by up-regulating expression of Drp1 and FIS1 via transcription factors NFATC2 and c-Myc, respectively. Moreover, the positive feedback loop significantly promoted HCC cell global autophagy by Ca2+/CAMKK/AMPK pathway. Our data demonstrate a positive feedback loop between mitochondrial fission and cytosolic calcium signaling and their promoting role in autophagy of HCC cells, which provides evidence for this loop as a potential drug target in tumor treatment.
