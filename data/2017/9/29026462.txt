Aim:To establish a model to enrich and characterize stem-like cells from murine normal liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and to further investigate stem-like cell association with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Methods:In this study, we utilized a stem cell conditioned serum-free medium to enrich stem-like cells from mouse HCC and normal liver cell lines, Hepa 1-6 and AML12, respectively. We isolated the 3-dimensional spheres and assessed their stemness characteristics by evaluating the RNA levels of stemness genes and a cell surface stem cell marker by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR). Next, we examined the relationship between stem cells and EMT using qRT-PCR.Results:Three-dimensional spheres were enriched by culturing murine HCC and normal hepatocyte cell lines in stem cell conditioned serum-free medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and heparin sulfate. The 3-dimensional spheres had enhanced stemness markers such as Klf4 and Bmi1 and hepatic cancer stem cell (CSC) marker Cd44 compared to parental cells grown as adherent cultures. We report that epithelial markers E-cadherin and ZO-1 were downregulated, while mesenchymal markers Vimentin and Fibronectin were upregulated in 3-dimensional spheres. The 3-dimensional spheres also exhibited changes in expression of Snai, Zeb and Twist family of EMT transcription factors.Conclusion:Our novel method successfully enriched stem-like cells which possessed an EMT phenotype. The isolation and characterization of murine hepatic CSCs could establish a precise target for the development of more effective therapies for HCC.
