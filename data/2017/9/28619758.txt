Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most lethal human diseases and remains largely refractory to available drug treatments. Insufficient targeting of the known oncogenic drivers and activation of compensatory feedback loops and inability to prevent metastatic spread contribute to poor prognosis for this disease. The KRAS-driven MEK pathway is mutationally activated in most pancreatic cancers and is an important target for therapeutics. Using a two-dimensional monolayer culture system as well as three-dimensional spheroid culture system, we conducted a screen of a large panel of anticancer agents and found that MAP2K (MEK) inhibitors were most effective in targeting PDAC spheroids in comparison with monolayer cultures. Combination treatment with an MEK inhibitor and the multikinase inhibitor ponatinib was effective in targeting pancreatic cancer cells both in monolayer and spheroids by effectively blocking signaling via the PDGFRα and MEK kinases, while also preventing the activation of STAT3- and S6-mediated compensatory feedback loops in cancer cells. Furthermore, using xenograft models, we demonstrate that cotreatment with a MEK inhibitor and ponatinib causes significant tumor regression. PDAC patient samples also provided evidence of increased STAT3 activation in PDAC tumors and MAPK1 (ERK) activation in liver metastases, implicating STAT3 and ERK as key drivers in primary tumors and metastases, respectively. These results reveal a combination drug treatment strategy that may be effective in pancreatic cancer. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(9); 1729-38. ©2017 AACR.
