Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) is one of the major causes of cancer-associated mortality globally due to its high potential for distant metastasis. To understand hematogenous metastasis, the molecular expression profiles of weak metastatic PDC cell subline BxPC-3 and highly liver-metastatic cell subline LM-BxPC-3 were compared, and zinc finger protein 185 (ZNF185) was identified as a molecule that is upregulated in LM-BxPC-3 cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of ZNF185 in PDC. Using immunohistochemistry, ZNF185 expression was investigated in 182 patients with PDC, in association with numerous clinicopathological variables. The expression profile of ZNF185 was also characterized using xenograft models. In contrast to parent BxPC-3 cells in subcutaneous transplanted tumor foci, which only expressed ZNF185 on their plasma membrane (m)ZNF185, LM-BxPC-3 cells in liver-metastatic foci that were formed subsequent to transplantation all expressed cytoplasmic (c)ZNF185. Additionally, 51% of the cells at the periphery of the tumor foci expressed mZNF185. Expression of cZNF185, and of mZNF185 and cZNF185 combined was identified in 93 and 39% of clinical patients with PDC, respectively. Patients with mZNF185-negative and -positive PDC exhibited a median survival time of 30.2 months and 21.3 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that the expression of mZNF185 is closely associated with a shorter overall survival time. Increased marked venous invasion was more prevalent in patients who were mZNF185-positive, as compared with patients who were mZNF185-negative. These data suggest that the expression of mZNF185 is an independent and unfavorable prognosticator in patients with PDC. The results suggested that the amount and subcellular location of ZNF185 are correlated with the position of the cancer cells expressing it within the nests. Additionally, the subcellular location of ZNF185 may be important to its biological function.
