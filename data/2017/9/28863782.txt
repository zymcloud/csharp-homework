Background:Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence or Antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) is an efficient biomarker specific for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some researchers have proved that levels of PIVKA-II reflect HCC oncogenesis and progression. However, the effectiveness of PIVKA-II based on real-world clnical data has barely been studied.Methods:A total of 14,861 samples were tested in Southwest Hospital in over 2 years' time. Among them, 4073 samples were PIVKA-II positive. Finally, a total of 2070 patients with at least two image examinations were enrolled in this study. Levels of AFP and PIVKA-II were measured by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and chemiluminescent microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA), respectively.Results:A total of 1016 patients with HCC were detected by PIVKA-II in a real-world application. In all these cases, 88.7% cases primarily occurred and patients with advanced HCC covered 61.3%. Levels of PIVKA-II were significantly higher in advanced group (4650.0 mAU/ml, 667.0-33,438.0 mAU/ml) than early-stage group (104.5 mAU/ml, 61.0-348.8 mAU/ml; P Conclusions:Our data showed that PIVKA-II effectively increases the detection rate of HCC was a valid complement to AFP and image examination in HCC surveillance.
