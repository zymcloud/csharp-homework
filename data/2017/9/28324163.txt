Purpose:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) invading the portal trunk (Vp4) are poor surgical candidates because of the technical difficulties involved. To overcome the limitations, we developed a technique of back-flow thrombectomy (BFT) based on the inherent portal hemodynamics and the macroscopic form of PVTT.Methods:Forty-six patients with multiple HCC and Vp4 PVTT underwent hepatectomy with tumor thrombectomy. We used the BFT to treat 24 patients, 18 of whom had PVTT in the contralateral second portal branch. The form of PVTT was classified macroscopically into the floating and expansive types.Results:The rate of complete removal by BFT of PVTT in the contralateral second portal branch was 89%. The patency rates at the thrombectomy site in all 46 patients and in the 24 BFT patients, 3 months after hepatectomy were 93 and 90%, respectively. The median OS of all 46 patients was 15 months, with 1- and 3-year OS rates of 58.5 and 17.1%, respectively. The median OS of the 24 patients treated with BFT vs. the 22 not treated with BFT was 14 and 15 months, respectively.Conclusions:BFT can expand the therapeutic time window for patients with HCC and deep-seated PVTT and may improve their survival.
