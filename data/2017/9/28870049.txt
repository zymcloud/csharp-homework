Objective: To analyze the efficacy of branches portal vein embolization (TBPVE) combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on liver neoplasms. Methods: From August 2016 to May 2017, there were 13 patients including 11 males and 2 females with primary hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent TBPVE+ TACE , among whom there were 11 cases with a history of HBV infection.Average age of the 13 patients was (60.8±6.2)years. The live function of all patients were Child-Pugh A classification.The CT or MRI images of each patient was reconstructed and the standard liver volume(SLV) before TBPVE+ TACE was (1 181.2±49.3)ml, estimated future liver remnant(FLR) was (326.1±72.1)ml and FLR/SLV was (27.6±6.0)%.The puncture site for TBPVE was determined by the three-dimensional reconstruction of portal vein.CT scan or MRI, AFP and liver function test were repeated after one and two weeks after TBPVE+ TACE.FLR and FLR/SLV were calculated respectively.Hepatectomy would be performed if the patients agreed.The postoperative complications were analyzed. Results: On the 7thday after TBPVE+ TACE, the FLR/SLV was(42.6±8.0)% and the FLR increasement was(56.0±24.6)%.The level of AFP decreased from(87.9±81.8)μg/L to (29.7±20.9)μg/L.On the 14thday after TBPVE+ TACE, the FLR/SLV was(45.8±6.2)% and the FLR increasement was(71.8±29.0)%.Four patients underwent surgery which including 2 right hepatectomies and 2 right trisegmentectomies in 2 weeks after TBPVE+ TACE.Nine patients were performed with targeting intratumoral lactic acidosis TACE (TILA-TACE). No severe complication occurred in all patients. Conclusions: TBPVE could induce a rapid growth of the liver remnant but still with the concern of inducing the growth of neoplasms at the same time.To combine TACE in TBPVE therapy not also can the growth of neoplasms be prevented but also inducing its shrinking.This method might be a new mode for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
