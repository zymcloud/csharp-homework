This study aims to comprehensively analyze the diagnosis and prognosis of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). From the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we screened out and analyzed the differently expressed lncRNAs and related mRNAs using bioinformatics methods. The expressions of lncRNAs were validated in tumor tissues, cell lines and the Cancer Genome Atlas database. At the same time, we also conducted an exploratory analysis on the diagnostic and prognostic ability of lncRNAs in HCC. In this study, we found that most of the targeted mRNAs promote the biological process of cell division, cellular component of nucleoplasm, molecular function of protein binding, which were significantly associated with 12 KEGG pathways. LncRNA CRNDE and LINC01419 also had significant diagnostic value in HCC. In particular, the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of CRNDE were 71.0%, 87.1% and 0.701 (95% CI: 0.543-0.860), respectively. In addition, the high expression of CRNDE and GBAP1 predicated poor prognosis, while the high expression of LINC01093 suggested the opposite outcome. Through the comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs, it provided an important reference for the early diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, pathogenesis and targeted therapy of HCC.
