Detection of alpha-l-fucosidase has been shown to have relevance in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma. Few assays have been developed to measure this enzyme, with most relying on colorimetric techniques involving the enzyme's kinetics. While these assays are facile and quick, the sensitivity is not always sufficient for early tumor detection. To improve upon previous assays for alpha-l-fucosidase, a fluorescence based immunoassay was produced implementing an alpha-l-fucosidase specific antibody (FUCA2). The immobilization of the alpha-l-fucosidase-specific antibody onto a quartz slide was investigated with several bioconjugation approaches and an immunoassay for detection of alpha-l-fucosidase was produced. The immunoassay was utilized to produce calibration curves for quantifying alpha-l-fucosidase concentrations in both PBS and human blood serum. A detection limit of 10 nM was found using human blood serum, which is well below the diagnostic cutoff point of 80 nM.
