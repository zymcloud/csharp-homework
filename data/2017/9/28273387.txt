With effective antiviral therapies, rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and decompensated liver disease requiring liver transplantation (LT) are expected to decrease. We aim to evaluate overall trends in LT waitlist registrations, waitlist survival and likelihood of receiving LT among chronic HBV patients in the United States. Using the United Network for Organ Sharing database, we retrospectively evaluated adults (ageâ‰¥18) with chronic HBV (with and without HCC) listed for LT from 1992 to 1996 (Era 1) vs 1997 to 2004 (Era 2) vs 2005-2015 (Era 3). Multivariate Cox-regression models evaluated probability of waitlist survival and receiving LT. Overall, 6797 chronic HBV adults were listed for LT. While the total number of HBV patients listed for LT remained stable, the proportion of HBV patients with HCC increased from 5.4% in Era 1 to 39.0% in Era 3. Compared to Era 1, waitlist mortality was higher in Era 2 (HR: 4.55, P
