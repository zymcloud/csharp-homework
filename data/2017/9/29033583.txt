Background:Recent studies have showed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could reduce the risk of several types of cancer. However, epidemiological evidence of the association between NSAIDs intake and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial.Methods:To assess the preventive benefit of NSAIDs in HCC, we simultaneously searched the databases of PubMed, EmBase, Web of Science, and Scopus and screened eligible publications.Results:A total of twelve articles (published from 2000 to 2017) from five countries were identified by retrieval. We observed a significantly lower risk of HCC incidence among users of NSAIDs than among those who did not use NSAIDs (pooled hazard ratio [HR] value =0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.94). No evidence of publication bias was observed (Begg's test, P=0.755; Egger's test, P=0.564). However, when stratified according to the categories of NSAIDs, users of non-aspirin NSAIDs (HR =0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.94), but not aspirin (HR =0.77, 95% CI: 0.58-1.02), showed a statistically significant reduced HCC incidence. We also found that NSAIDs use significantly reduced the recurrent risk of HCC, with a HR value of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75-0.84), whereas there was no statistically significant association between NSAIDs use and HCC mortality, with a HR value 0.65 (95% CI: 0.40-1.06).Conclusion:Taken together, our meta-analysis demonstrates that NSAIDs significantly reduce the incident and recurrent risk of HCC.
