We have previously reported that Cezanne could be a prognostic biomarker for survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the role of Cezanne genes in HCC cells and its response to postoperative adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in HCC patients remains unknown. In this study, Cezanne expression was detected in human HCC using real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. The function of Cezanne in HCC cells was determined by Transwell invasion assays and nude mice metastasis assay. The response of Cezanne in patients who received adjuvant TACE after hepatectomy was evaluated. Functional study demonstrated that interference of Cezanne expression promoted the migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro and boosted metastasized HCC formation in mice. Upregulation of Cezanne diminished the adhesion and migration of hepatoma cells. Further study indicated that Cezanne might inhibit invasion of HCC cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, patients with low Cezanne expression had significant improvement in prognosis after receiving adjuvant TACE. In contrast, patients with high Cezanne expression had a poorer response to adjuvant TACE. Moreover, Cezanne status was associated with response to adjuvant TACE in patients subgroup stratified by vascular invasion, tumor size and tumor number. In conclusion, Cezanne may be a novel antioncogene that has a pivotal role in the invasion of HCC and contribute to the selection of patients who may benefit from adjuvant TACE to prevent recurrence.
