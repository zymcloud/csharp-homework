Background:Inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be treated with laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA), which is generally a more accurate and accessible procedure than percutaneous RFA (PRFA). However, few studies have compared survival outcomes between LRFA and PRFA in patients with HCC.Aims:This study aimed to compare the efficacy of LRFA and PRFA for HCC treatment.Methods:Patients who underwent PRFA or LRFA as an initial treatment modality between April 2005 and April 2016 were enrolled in this study. The overall and recurrence-free survival rates were examined for each patient. Additionally, propensity score matching was performed for both groups.Results:The baseline characteristics of patients in the PRFA and LRFA groups showed several minor differences. Multivariate analysis showed that the RFA method was not a critical determinant of recurrence-free or overall survival (p = 0.069 and p = 0.406). Among patients who underwent RFA as the initial treatment modality, there was no significant effect between either RFA procedures on survival. After propensity score matching, univariate analysis showed a significant difference in overall survival between PRFA and LRFA (p = 0.031). Multivariate analysis showed that LRFA is a strong factor that contributed to an improved overall survival in HCC patients (hazard ratio 0.108, p = 0.040). Furthermore, our data showed that LRFA was able to limit multiple intrahepatic recurrences, as well as prevent marginal recurrence.Conclusions:LRFA appears to be superior to PRFA in terms of survival. LRFA may help reduce mortality in HCC patients.
