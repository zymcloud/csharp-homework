Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer‑associated mortality worldwide. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are two common risk factors for HCC. The majority of patients with HCC present at an advanced stage and are refractory to therapy. It is important to identify a method for efficient diagnosis at early stage. In the present study gene expression profile data, generated from microarray data, were pretreated according to the annotation files. The genes were mapped to pathways of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Dysregulated pathways and dysregulated pathway pairs were identified and constructed into individual networks, and a main network was constructed from individual networks with several edges. Random Forest (RF) classification was introduced to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) value of this network. Subsequently, 50 runs of Monte Carlo cross‑validation were used to screen the optimal main network. The results indicated that a total of 4,929 genes were identified in the pathways and gene expression profile. By combining dysregulated pathways with Z
