Sarcopenia has been reported to be associated with the prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to determine whether sarcopenia was associated with the prognosis of patients with HCC treated with sorafenib. A total of 40 patients with HCC who were treated with sorafenib were evaluated. As an indicator of skeletal muscle mass, transverse psoas muscle thickness (TPMT) was measured on computed tomography images at the level of the umbilicus prior to treatment initiation and after 1-3 months of treatment. Pre-TPMT/height was not associated with progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). The change in TPMT/height prior to and following treatment was also not associated with PFS; however, the change of TPMT/height was an independent factor affecting OS (P=0.020). A total of 40 patients were divided into two groups depending on the degree of TPMT/height loss (mild and severe muscle atrophy groups). Patients with mild muscle atrophy exhibited a significantly longer OS compared with patients with severe muscle atrophy (P=0.045). Thus, the change in skeletal muscle thickness calculated as TPMT/height may be a simple predictor of survival for patients with HCC treated with sorafenib.
