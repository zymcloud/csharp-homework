Background:To investigate the expression of endothelin receptors in liver diseases and discuss its role in the process of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.Research design and methods:We examined the expressions of ETAR, ETBR and Î±-SMA in tissue samples using western blotting analysis. Furthermore, immunofluorescence was used to locate ETAR expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs), we calculated the percentage of positive cells and then analyzed its relation with clinical indexes.Results:According to the western blotting analysis, the expression of ETAR was high in hepatic hemangioma and liver cancer tissues and ETBR was highly expressed in cirrhosis tissues. The immunofluorescence results demonstrated that the expression of ETAR was elevated in hepatic hemangioma and liver cancer tissues. Moreover, ETAR expression was found in both HSCs and HSECs. Finally, the statistical analysis revealed that the number of positive ETAR cells was correlated with the clinical index platelets (PLT), alanine transaminase (ALT) and diameter of portal vein.Conclusion:Endothelin receptors express differently in liver cirrhosis and liver cancer tissues and play a role in hepatic diseases by affecting HSCs and HSECs.
