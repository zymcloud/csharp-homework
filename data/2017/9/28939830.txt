Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) represents the most common form of chronic liver injury and can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A "multi-hit" theory, involving high fat diet and signals from the gut-liver axis, has been hypothesized. The role of the NLRP3-inflammasome, which senses dangerous signals, is controversial. Nlrp3-/- and wild-type mice were fed a Western-lifestyle diet with fructose in drinking water (HFHC) or a chow diet. Nlrp3-/--HFHC showed higher hepatic expression of PPAR Î³2 (that regulates lipid uptake and storage) and triglyceride content, histological score of liver injury and greater adipose tissue inflammation. In Nlrp3-/--HFHC, dysregulation of gut immune response with impaired antimicrobial peptides expression, increased intestinal permeability and the occurrence of a dysbiotic microbiota led to bacterial translocation, associated with higher hepatic expression of TLR4 (an LPS receptor) and TLR9 (a receptor for double-stranded bacterial DNA). After antibiotic treatment, gram-negative species and bacterial translocation were reduced, and adverse effects restored both in liver and adipose tissue. In conclusion, the combination of a Western-lifestyle diet with innate immune dysfunction leads to NAFLD progression, mediated at least in part by dysbiosis and bacterial translocation, thus identifying new specific targets for NAFLD therapy.
