The tolerability and efficacy of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 were investigated under actual clinical conditions. A total of 208 patients with chronic HCV genotype 2 infection were treated with sofosbuvir 400 mg and ribavirin (weight-based dosing) for 12 weeks. Treatment discontinuation and sustained virological response 12 (SVR12) were evaluated. Moreover, factors associated with SVR12, hemoglobin decreasing to less than 10 g/dL during treatment, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) non-normalization after treatment were evaluated. In all patients, SVR12 responses were 96.1% (200/208). About 6 of 8 patients (3.8%) who did not achieve SVR12 were re-treatment patients, and eight patients who did not achieve SVR all had liver cirrhosis. Multivariate analysis also identified body mass index (OR = 0.79; P
ALT normalization; HCV genotype 2; carcinogenesis; sofosbuvir.
