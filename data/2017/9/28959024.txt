Studies indicate that the chemokine receptor is responsible for poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. In this study, we initially demonstrated that CCR4 is overexpressed in HCC specimens, and its elevation in HCC tissues positively correlates with tumor capsule breakthrough and vascular invasion. Although overexpression of CCR4 failed to influent proliferation of HCC cells in vitro apparently, the prominent acceleration on HCC tumor growth in vivo was remarkable. The underlying mechanism may be involved in neovascularization. Interestingly, different from effect on proliferation, CCR4 overexpression could trigger HCC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo also induced HCC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well. Then we identified matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) as a direct target of CCR4 which plays an important role in CCR4-mediated HCC cell invasion, which was up-regulated by ERK/AKT signaling. Positive correlation between CCR4 and MMP2 expression was also observed in HCC tissues. In conclusion, our study suggested that chemokine receptor CCR4 promotes HCC malignancy and facilitated HCC cell metastases via ERK/AKT/MMP2 pathway. These findings suggest that CCR4 may be a potential new diagnostic and prognostic marker in HCC, and targeting CCR4 may be a potential therapeutic option for blocking HCC metastasis.
