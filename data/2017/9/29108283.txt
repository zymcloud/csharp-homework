Purpose:This study aims to investigate the effect of sorafenib plus Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) treatment on inhibiting portal vein invasion in patients with intermediate stage HCC.Materials and methods:The consecutive medical records of patients with HCC were retrospectively analyzed from October 2009 to February 2015. The propensity score matching method was applied into group matching. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Log-Rank Test was used to estimate the median survival time, median time to progression and median time to portal vein invasion. Factors associated with survival benefits were identified by univariate and multivariate Cox-regression model analyses.Results:Of 97 patients enrolled, 19 patients received TACE-sorafenib treatment and 78 patients received TACE treatment. During the follow-up period of 15 months, the median time to portal vein invasion was 14.2 months vs 8.77 months, respectively (p=0.073). And the analysis of the cox's proportional hazard model revealed that patients treated with TACE treatment alone would run greater risk of portal vein invasion compared with TACE-sorafenib treatment (hr=7.49, p=0.021). Early administration of sorafenib was associated with lower risk of portal vein invasion (p=0.021) according to the univariate analysis. Adverse events (AEs) identified in the combined group were mostly classified as Grades 1 and 2, and skin-related reactions and fatigue were the most common.Conclusions:Sorafenib may could inhibit portal vein invasion of hepatoma carcinoma cells. Early administration of sorafenib may bring more survival benefits.
