Defective autophagy has been linked to lipotoxicity in several cellular models. We aimed to investigate autophagy in lipid-stimulated hepatoma (Huh7) cells and tested whether 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA), a chemical chaperone, has a beneficial role in hepatic fat accumulation and lipotoxicity. We report that long-term (24 h) exposure of hepatocytes to palmitate block autophagic flux that leads to lipid accumulation and cell death. Western blotting analysis showed increased accumulation of SQSTM1/p62, and decreased expression of Beclin1 and Atg7 in palmitate-treated cells. Autophagy inhibition by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) in palmitate-treated cells neither increased SQSTMI/p62 accumulation nor cell death, thus suggesting complete blockade of autophagy by palmitate. 4-PBA reduced lipid accumulation and cell death that were associated with restoration of autophagy. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Atg7 and presence of autophagy inhibitors, 3-MA and chloroquine, resulted in the decrease in lipid-lowering effect of 4-PBA, suggesting that 4-PBA mediates its lipid-lowering effect via autophagy. Apoptotic parameters, including altered Bcl2:Bax ratio and PARP1 cleavage induced by palmitate, were improved by 4-PBA. Our results indicate that palmitate impairs autophagy and increases lipid accumulation in Huh7 cells, whereas 4-PBA plays a protective role in lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity through activation of autophagy.
