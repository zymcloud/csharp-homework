Background:Limited data are currently available to address the safety and efficacy of combined resection of the liver and inferior vena cava (IVC) for hepatic malignancies.Methods:A systematic review was performed to identify relevant studies. Pooled individual data were examined for the clinical outcome of combined resection of the liver and IVC for hepatic malignancies.Results:A total of 258 patients were described in 38 articles eligible for inclusion. Resections were performed for colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) [n = 128 (50%)], intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) [n = 51 (20%)], hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [n = 48 (19%)], and other pathologies [n = 31 (11%)]. There were 14 (5%) perioperative deaths. The median survival duration was 34 months, and the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 79%, 46% and 33%, respectively. The 5-year OS rate was 26% for CLM, 37% for ICC, and 30% for HCC.Conclusion:Combined resection of the liver and IVC for hepatic malignancies is safe and applicable, and offers acceptable survival outcomes.
