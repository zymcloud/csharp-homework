Performing resection of a biliary tract malignancy with a hepatic artery aneurysm is very challenging. Resection of the extrahepatic bile duct and extra-anatomical reconstruction can be successfully performed using free radial artery autografts from the aorta to the right hepatic artery. Hepatic artery thrombosis can be prevented with intimal preservation.
