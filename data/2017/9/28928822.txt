Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve an important role in numerous human diseases, including cancer. Abnormal expression of lncRNAs has been associated with a number of tumor types; however, the underlying mechanisms through which lncRNA functions have yet to be elucidated. The present study primarily focuses on insulin-like growth factor 2 antisense 1 (Igf2as), a lncRNA reported to be differentially expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to determine the level of Igf2as in HCC cells and tissues. Flow cytometry was used to determine the level of cell apoptosis following Igf2as suppression and western blot analysis was used to identify altered protein expression levels. The results demonstrated that Igf2as was upregulated in HCC cells and tissues, and that the inhibition of Igf2as using a targeted small interfering RNA (si-Igf2as), significantly decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Western blot analysis identified that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway was inhibited in cells transfected with si-Igf2as. In addition, cell migration was markedly reduced by the knockdown of Igf2as. These results suggest that lncRNA Igf2as may control hepatocellular progression primarily through the regulation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway.
