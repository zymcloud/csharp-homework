Little is known about the mechanisms underlying hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some studies have focused on the role of HCV viral proteins in hepatocyte transformation. In this work we have compiled and analysed current articles regarding the impact of polymorphisms in the HCV core gene and protein on the development of HCC. An exhaustive search for fulltext articles until November 2016 in PubMed database was performed using the MeSH keywords: 'hepatitis C', 'polymorphisms', 'core', 'hepatocellular cancer' and 'hepatocarcinogenesis'. Nineteen full-text articles published between 2000 and 2016 were considered. Different articles associate not only the HCC development with polymorphisms at residues 70 and 91 in the core protein, but more with mortality and treatment response. Also, different polymorphisms were found in core and other viral proteins related to HCC development. Eleven articles reported that HCC development is significantly associated with Gln/His70, four associated it with Leu91 and two more associated it with both markers together. Additional studies are necessary, including those in different types of populations worldwide, to validate the possibility of the usability and influence in chronically HCV-infected patients as well as to observe their interaction with other risk factors or prognosis and genetic markers of the host.
