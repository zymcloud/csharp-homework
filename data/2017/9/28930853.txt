Rationale:Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE) is a potentially fatal and chronically progressive infestation that is caused by the multivesicular metacestode of Echinococcus multilocularis (EM). HAE behaves like a malignant tumor and has been referred to as "worm cancer." The main treatment method for HAE is surgical resection.Patient concerns:We present a 41-year-old Tibetan alveolar echinococcosis (AE) patient with AE lesions invading the right liver lobe and retrohepatic inferior vena cava (RHIVC).Diagnoses:The patient was diagnosed with HAE based on results obtained from ultrasound examination, computed tomography, liver 3-dimensional reconstruction, serology tests, clinical presentation, and surgical exploration. The final pathology report confirmed the diagnosis as HAE.Interventions:A radical surgery that combined resection of the liver and RHIVC was performed successfully.Outcomes:The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and a good prognosis.Lessons:When lesions of the liver significantly violate the RHIVC, resecting the RHIVC without reconstruction may be considered if possible.
