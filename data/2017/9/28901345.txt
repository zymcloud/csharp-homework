Chronic alcohol related liver disease is characterized by a cascade of events defined as follows: steatosis, steatohepatitis/steatofibrosi, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. On one of these histologic patterns may overlap acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAE) (mild, moderate, severe). Severe AAE can cause a severe clinical picture: jaundice with a duration of less than three months, jaundice in the first decompensation event, serum bilirubin higher than 5 mg/dL, ratio AST/ALT >2:1, AST less than 500 IU/L ALT 32 and MELD >21) with absence of contraindications, it is possible to use steroids therapy. If a positive answers cannot be obtained, an early liver transplantation is proposed. This possibility, after a careful selection, now is promoted by several authors.
