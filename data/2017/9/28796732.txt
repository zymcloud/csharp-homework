Background:The clinical efficacy of gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI as a routine preoperative procedure for all patients with colorectal cancer remains unclear.Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI for the diagnosis of liver metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer.Design:This was a retrospective analysis from a prospective cohort database.Settings:All of the patients were from a subspecialty practice at a tertiary referral hospital.Patients:Patients who received preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI after CT and attempted curative surgery for colorectal cancer were included.Main outcome measures:The number of equivocal hepatic lesions based on CT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI and diagnostic use of the gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI were measured.Results:We reviewed the records of 690 patients with colorectal cancer. Equivocal hepatic lesions were present in 17.2% of patients based on CT and in 4.5% based on gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI. Among 496 patients with no liver metastasis based on CT, gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI detected equivocal lesions in 15 patients and metastasis in 3 patients. Among 119 patients who had equivocal liver lesions on CT, gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI indicated hepatic lesions in 103 patients (86.6%), including 90 with no metastasis and 13 with metastasis. Among 75 patients who had liver metastasis on CT, gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI indicated that the hepatic lesions in 2 patients were benign, in contrast to CT findings. The initial surgical plans for hepatic lesions according to CT were changed in 17 patients (3%) after gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI.Limitations:This study was limited by its retrospective design.Conclusions:The clinical efficacy of gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI as a routine preoperative procedure for all patients with colorectal cancer is low, in spite of its high diagnostic value for detecting liver metastasis. However, this study showed gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI was helpful in characterizing equivocal hepatic lesions identified in CT and could lead to change in treatment plans for some patients.
