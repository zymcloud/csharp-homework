Background:The overall response rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to chemotherapy is poor. In our previous study, oxaliplatin-resistant HCC is found to exhibit an enhanced stemness, and increased levels of CCN2 and LRP6, while the role of CCN2 and LRP6 in the prognosis of HCC patients, and the interaction regulation mechanism between CCN2 and LRP6 are still unclear.Methods:The expression levels of CCN2 and LRP6 were detected in large cohorts of HCCs, and functional analyses of CCN2 and LRP6 were performed both in vitro and in vivo. The roles of cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in the mutual regulatory between CCN2 and LRP6 were verified in HCC, and the interventions of low molecular weight heparin sodium (LMWH) were explored.Results:CCN2 and LRP6 were overexpressed in HCCs, and the CCN2 and LRP6 levels were positively associated with the malignant phenotypes and poor prognosis of HCCs. LRP6 could significantly upregulate the expression of CCN2. Meanwhile, CCN2 was able to enhance malignant phenotype of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner through binding with LRP6; and knock-down of LRP6 expression, perturbation of HSPGs, co-incubation of CCN2 with LMWH could significantly block the adhesion of CCN2 to LRP6. LMWH enhanced the therapeutic effect of oxaliplatin on HCC with a high CCN2 expression.Conclusions:CCN2 plays a promoting role in HCC progression through activating LRP6 in a HSPGs-dependent manner. Heparin in combination with chemotherapy has a synergic effect and could be a treatment choice for HCCs with a high CCN2 expression.
