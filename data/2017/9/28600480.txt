Purpose: Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk for colorectal cancer, although mechanisms underlying neoplastic transformation are poorly understood. We sought to evaluate the role of microRNAs in neoplasia development in this high-risk population.Experimental Design: Tissue from 12 controls, 9 ulcerative colitis patients without neoplasia, and 11 ulcerative colitis patients with neoplasia was analyzed. miRNA array analysis was performed and select miRNAs assayed by real-time PCR on the discovery cohort and a validation cohort. DNA methylation of miR-193a was assessed. Following transfection of miR-193a-3p, proliferation, IL17RD expression, and luciferase activity of the 3'UTR of IL17RD were measured. Tumor growth in xenografts as well as EGFR signaling were assessed in HCT116 cells expressing IL17RD with either a mutant 3' untranslated region (UTR) or wild-type (WT) 3'UTR.Results: miR-31, miR-34a, miR-106b, and miR-193a-3p were significantly dysregulated in ulcerative colitis-neoplasia and adjacent tissue. Significant down-regulation of miR-193a-3p was also seen in an independent cohort of ulcerative colitis cancers. Changes in methylation of miR-193a or expression of pri-miR-193a were not observed in ulcerative colitis cancer. Transfection of miR-193a-3p resulted in decreased proliferation, and identified IL17RD as a direct target of miR-193a-3p. IL17RD expression was increased in ulcerative colitis cancers, and miR-193a-3p treatment decreased growth and EGFR signaling of HCT116 cells in xenografts expressing both IL17RD with WT 3'UTR compared with cells expressing IL17RD with mutant 3'UTR.Conclusions: miR-193a-3p is downregulated in ulcerative colitis neoplasia, and its loss promotes carcinogenesis through upregulation of IL17RD. These findings provide novel insight into inflammation-driven colorectal cancer and could suggest new therapeutic targets in this high-risk population. Clin Cancer Res; 23(17); 5281-91.
