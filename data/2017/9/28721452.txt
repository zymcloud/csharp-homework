Background:CKD-516 is a novel vascular disrupting agent that shuts down intratumoral blood flow. We therefore hypothesized that concomitant administration of CKD-516 would enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) by reducing heat sink effects. We assessed the effects of the combination of CKD-516 and RFA in a rat orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model.Methods:Rat HCC cells (N1-S1) were engrafted into the hepatic lobe of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Mice were randomly divided into two groups: RFA-only and CKD-RFA. In the CKD-RFA group, CKD-516 was administered by intraperitoneal injection 2 h before RFA. Ablation zone size was measured on triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained specimens. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to evaluate the area of apoptosis/necrosis in the ablation zone. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD31 antibody was performed to evaluate the effect of CKD-516 on tumor vessels.Results:Ablation zone size was significantly larger in the CKD-RFA group than in the RFA-only group (243.10 ± 74.39 versus 123.30 ± 28.17 mm2, p < 0.001). On TUNEL staining, the area of apoptosis/necrosis was also significantly larger in the CKD-RFA group than in the RFA-only group (274.44 ± 140.78 versus 143.74 ± 90.13 mm2; p = 0.006). Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD31 antibody revealed patent tumor vessels in the RFA-only group, while collapsed vessels were seen in the CKD-RFA group, indicating a vascular shutdown effect of CKD-516.Conclusion:Concomitant administration of CKD-516 during RFA can increase the ablation zone of tumors due to its vascular disrupting effect.
