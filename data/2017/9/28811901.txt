Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibit a high incidence of concomitant cirrhosis with leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. In the present study, perioperative changes in the white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) counts and associated complications were investigated to assess the safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for HCC patients with preprocedural leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. The records of 1,461 HCC patients who received TACE between January 2012 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence of complications during the perioperative period and changes in the WBC and PLT counts were recorded. A Chi-squared test was used to evaluate the associations between postoperative infection and preprocedural WBC count and between bleeding at the puncture site and preprocedural PLT count. The WBC count of the majority of the patients increased within 3 days and returned to the preprocedural level within 30 days after TACE. The PLT count decreased within 3 days and returned to the preprocedural level within 30 days after TACE. The major complications were liver decompensation (n=66), puncture site bleeding (n=45), infection (n=33), severe thrombocytopenia (n=8), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n=6), tumor bleeding (n=4) and agranulocytosis (n=3). A Chi-squared test revealed that postoperative infection was not associated with preprocedural WBC count and puncture site bleeding was not associated with decreased PLT count due to hypersplenism. Therefore, TACE was found to be safe for HCC patients with preprocedural thrombocytopenia or leukopenia due to hypersplenism, with a low incidence of major complications during the perioperative period.
