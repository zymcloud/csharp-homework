Objective:To describe accurately the oncological outcomes after hepatic resection (HR) in recurrent ovarian carcinoma (ROC) evaluating clinic-pathological variables and mutational status of BRCA1/2. Although HR is considered a challenging situation in ROC patients, assessment of BRCA1/2 mutational status seems to have a relevant clinical value to guide surgical therapy.Methods:Patients who underwent HR for ROC at the Catholic University of Rome, between June 2012 and October 2017 were included. Exclusion criteria were represented by extra-abdominal disease and presence of diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis requiring more than 2 bowel resections. Details relative to HR were collected and BRCA analysis was performed. Predictive factors of post-HR progression free survival (PHR-PFS) were assessed by univariate analyses using Cox-proportional hazard regression models.Results:Thirty-four patients undewent HR within secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS). Six patients (17.6%) presented with hepatic relapse only, while the remaining 28 patients (82.4%) had concomitant extra-hepatic disease. In the whole series, the 3-yr PHR-PFS was 49.1% and the 3-yr post-HR overall survival was 72.9%. Univariate analysis of variables conditioning PHR-PFS showed that only BRCA mutational status played a statistically significant favourable role: the 3-yr PHR-PFS rate was 81.0% in BRCA mutated patient compared to 15.2% in wild type ones (p value: 0.001).Conclusions:Our clinical analyses suggest that in ROC patients with liver disease the assessment of germline and somatic BRCA mutational status can help to select patients elegible for SCS.
