Methyl-Cantharidimide (MCA) is a derivative of cantharidin which has potential anticancer activity. This study investigates the effect of MCA on the growth and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Human HCC HepG2 and Hep3B2.1-7 cells, and normal hepatocytes (L02) were treated with a series of concentrations of MCA. The inhibition ability of these cells was examined by CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle and cell apoptosis were determined using Flow Cytometry. The effect of MCA on cell migration and invasion was evaluated through scratch wound healing and transwell migration assays. Furthermore, Western blot was used to evaluate biomarkers associated with cell cycle and apoptosis. It was found that: (i) MCA inhibited cell proliferation in HCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, especially in HepG2 cells; (ii) MCA arrested HCC cells in G-1 phase cell cycle; (iii) MCA induced HCC cells apoptosis; (iv) MCA inhibited the migration ability of HCC cells; and (v) MCA treatment significantly increased cleaved-caspase3 and decreased NF-ÎºB protein in HCC cells. These results suggest that MCA has cytotoxic effect on HCC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. MCA could be developed as an previous anticancer drug for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma.
