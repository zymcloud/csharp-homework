Purpose:This study aims to examine the health-related quality of life in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:181 patients attending a tertiary center outpatient clinic were interviewed and completed the short form 36 (SF36) questionnaire. The SF36 was used to assess health-related QoL. Cross-sectional analyses by group (age, gender, clinical scores, systemic, and local interventions) as well sequel questionnaires were conducted.Results:Participants included were 79% (143/181) men [mean age at first SF36: 63.8 (Â± 12.3; 18.4-85.8) years]. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stadium C was associated with significantly lower SF36 total scores, and elevated initial alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations were associated with lower SF36 functional and mental health sum scores throughout the course of the third questionnaire. Patients treated with sorafenib had within the sub-dimension scores a significantly lower result for role limitations due to physical health compared to patients without sorafenib treatment. Patients who underwent a transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) had within the sub-dimension scores a significantly higher result for control of pain compared to patients without TACE. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant survival benefits for patients who underwent any intervention at the first SF36 (mean survival in years 4.3 vs. 1.6; P Conclusion:Advanced tumor stages marked by BCLC stadium C and elevated initial AFP concentrations were associated with lower SF36 total scores and functional sum scores, respectively. During the course of sorafenib treatment, the sub-dimensional score for role limitations due to physical health decreased significantly, whereas TACE performance was associated with a significant improvement of the control of body pain.
