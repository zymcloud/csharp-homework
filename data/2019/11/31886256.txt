Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and is associated with a high mortality rate and poor treatment efficacy. In an attempt to investigate the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of HCC, bioinformatic analysis and validation by qRT-PCR were performed. Three circRNA GEO datasets and one miRNA GEO dataset were selected for this purpose. Upon combined biological prediction, a total of 11 differentially expressed circRNAs, 15 differentially expressed miRNAs, and 560 target genes were screened to construct a circRNA-related ceRNA network. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were performed for the 560 target genes. To further screen key genes, a protein-protein interaction network of the target genes was constructed using STRING, and the genes and modules with higher degree were identified by MCODE and CytoHubba plugins of Cytoscape. Subsequently, a module was screened out and subjected to GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis. This module included eight genes, which were further screened using TCGA. Finally, UBE2L3 was selected as a key gene and the hsa_circ_0009910-miR-1261-UBE2L3 regulatory axis was established. The relative expression of the regulatory axis members was confirmed by qRT-PCR in 30 pairs of samples, including HCC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues. The results suggested that hsa_circ_0009910, which was upregulated in HCC tissues, participates in the pathogenesis of HCC by acting as a sponge of miR-1261 to regulate the expression of UBE2L3. Overall, this study provides support for the possible mechanisms of progression in HCC.
