Objective:The aim of this study was to assess the effect of cancer-related genes and their mutations analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the oncological outcome after resection of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).Background:Traditional prognostic scores include clinical and pathological parameters of primary tumor and metastases. The modified clinical risk score (m-CS), based on size of metastases, primary tumor nodal status, and RAS mutation status outperformed traditional scores. We hypothesized to further improve the scoring system based on the results of NGS.Methods:Cancer tissues of 139 patients with CRLM were used for NGS. The work-up included the analysis of recurrent somatic mutations and copy number changes of 720 genes. Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively collected institutional liver database.Results:Depending on significance, the following cancer-related genes and their alterations (%) were further investigated: APC (86%), TP53 (78%), KRAS (29%), SMAD4 (15%), PIK3CA (14%), BRAF (8%), ERBB2 (6%), SMAD3 (5%), SMAD2 (4%), and NRAS (4%). The most predictive parameters for poor oncological outcome were alterations in the SMAD family (P = 0.0186) and RAS-RAF pathway (P = 0.032). Refining the m-CS by replacing RAS with RAS-RAF pathway and adding SMAD family resulted in an extended clinical risk score which is highly predictive for oncological outcome (P < 0.0001).Conclusion:In conclusion, mutations of the SMAD family revealed a strong prognostic effect after surgery for CRLM. Integration of alterations of the SMAD family as well as the RAS/RAF pathway resulted in a new, still simple but highly prognostic score.
