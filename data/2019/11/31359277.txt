Background:Little evidence exists regarding long-term survival after microwave ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study is to determine actual 10-year survival and clarify the clinicopathological features of patients surviving ≥ 10 years after surgical microwave ablation.Patients and methods:This retrospective study identified 459 patients who underwent surgical microwave ablation for HCC with curative intent between 2001 and 2008. We compared 100 patients who survived ≥ 10 years with 321 patients who died within 10 years.Results:Median overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates were 5.5 and 2.4 years, respectively. The actual 10-year overall survival rate was 23.8%, and the actual 10-year recurrence-free survival rate was 8.1%. Multivariate analysis showed that age > 70 years [odds ratio 1.87, P = 0.029], hepatitis C virus positivity (OR 2.30, P = 0.004), Child-Pugh class B (OR 3.28, P = 0.003), and platelet count 4 /µL (OR 1.93, P = 0.033) were independent risk factors for actual 10-year survival. During 10-year follow-up, 66% of the ≥ 10-year survivors developed recurrence, and 91% of these patients underwent further curative treatment, including hepatic resection or local ablation, for HCC recurrence.Conclusion:Ten-year survival after surgical microwave ablation for HCC can be expected in approximately 24% of patients, even though nearly 2/3 of our 10-year survival patients experienced recurrence. Close postoperative follow-up and further curative treatment for recurrence are important for improving long-term survival.
