RAS protein activator like 2 (RASAL2) belongs to the RAS GTPase-activating protein family and plays an important role in several cancers, including ovarian cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, malignant astrocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Traditionally, RASAL2 has been regarded as a tumor suppressor but recent studies have found that it is an oncogene in specific types of cancer, such as colorectal cancer, liver cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, triple-negative/estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. In this review, we summarize the latest findings regarding RASAL2 in cancers, which may be important and useful in clinical practice. We discussed the specific functions and mechanisms of RASAL2 in different kinds of cancer cells (including its inhibition of invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis and its opposite effects), which may provide new directions for cancer research and treatments. RASAL2 exhibits different relationship with clinical cancer stage, histological grade, prognosis and overall survival in different kinds of tumor. RASAL2 is a potential prognostic factor and a new therapeutic target for diagnosis and treatment.
