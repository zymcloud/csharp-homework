Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is responsible for 50% of liver cancer cases globally; this disease is one of the leading causes of cancer‑associated mortality. One reported mechanism underlying the development of liver cancer is the mutation of tumor suppressor genes induced by the overexpression of apolipoprotein B mRNA‑editing enzyme catalytic subunit 2 (APOBEC2) in hepatocytes. In addition, it has been observed that HBV inhibited microRNA (miR)‑122 expression in hepatocytes; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in liver cancer development remain unknown and further investigations are required. In the present study, the mechanistic roles of HBV infection in modulating the expression of miR‑122 and APOBEC2, and the development of liver cancer, were investigated. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blot analyses revealed that APOBEC2 expression was markedly upregulated following HBV infection. Of note, the expression profile of APOBEC2 in the Huh7 and HepG2 liver cancer cell lines opposed that of miR‑122; this miR is the most abundant miRNA in the liver and has been associated with hepatocarcinogenesis. Mechanistically, it was demonstrated via a dual‑luciferase assay that miR‑122 could specifically bind to the 3'‑untranslated region (3'UTR) of APOBEC2 mRNA, inhibiting its expression. Collectively, the findings of the present study may provide insight into the mechanistic role of HBV infection in modulating the expression of miR‑122, which targets the 3'UTR of APOBEC2 mRNA, subsequently inducing liver carcinogenesis.
