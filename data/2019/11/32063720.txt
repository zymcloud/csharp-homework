Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib (TACE-S) combined with microwave ablation (TACE-S-MWA) for the treatment of patients with advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between January 2015 and December 2018, 152 consecutive advanced HCC patients, who underwent TACE-S-MWA (MWA group, n=77) or TACE-S (Non-MWA group, n=75), were investigated. Overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP) and safety were compared between the two groups. Prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model.Results:Baseline patient characteristics were balanced between the two groups. MWA group was associated with a higher OS (median, 19.0 vs 13.0 months; P<0.001) and a longer TTP (median, 6.0 vs 3.0 months; P<0.001) compared with non-MWA group. Multivariate analyses showed that portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) (P=0.002), duration of sorafenib (P<0.001), and MWA treatment (P=0.011) were independently associated with OS. MWA treatment strategy (P<0.001) was a significant predictor of TTP. There were no treatment-related mortalities in either group. The rates of minor complications (42.9% vs 38.7%, P=0.599) and major complications (1.29% vs 1.33%, P=0.985) in the MWA group were similar to those in the non-MWA group.Conclusion:TACE-S-MWA was safe and effective for advanced primary HCC. TACE-S-MWA resulted in better OS and TTP than did TACE-S for treatment of patients with advanced primary HCC.
