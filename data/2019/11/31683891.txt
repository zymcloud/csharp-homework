Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. It can be caused by chronic liver cell injury with resulting sustained inflammation, e.g., triggered by infections with hepatitis viruses B (HBV) and C (HCV). Death of hepatocytes leads to the activation of compensatory mechanisms, which can ultimately result in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Another common feature is the infiltration of the liver with inflammatory cells, which secrete cytokines and chemokines that act directly on the hepatocytes. Among several secreted proteins, members of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines have emerged as important regulatory proteins that might constitute an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The IL-6-type cytokines activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways, and especially the Jak/STAT cascade has been shown to be crucial for HCC development. In this review, we give an overview about HCC pathogenesis with respect to IL-6-type cytokines and the Jak/STAT pathway. We highlight the role of mutations in genes encoding several proteins involved in the cytokine/Jak/STAT axis and summarize current knowledge about IL-6 family cytokines in this context. We further discuss possible anti-cytokine therapies for HCC patients in comparison to already established therapies.
