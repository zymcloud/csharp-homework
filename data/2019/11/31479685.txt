The high lactate production rate in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) have a profound impact on their malignant properties. In adaptation to the enhanced lactate stress, lactate-effusing monocarboxylate transporter 4(MCT4) is usually overexpressed in a broad range of HCC subtypes. In this study, the MCT4-mediated lactate efflux in HCC was blocked using microRNA-145(miR-145), which would force the endogenously generated lactate to accumulate within tumor cells in a self-regulated manner, resulting in the acidification of the cytoplasmic compartment as well as partial neutralization for pH in the tumor extracellular environment. Evaluations on multiple representative HCC subtypes (HepG2, Hep3B and HuH7) suggested that the disrupted pH homeostasis would amplify the lactate stress to initiate HCC apoptosis, while at the same time also suppressing their migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, safety tests on 7702 cells and living animals revealed that MCT4-blockade treatment has no cytotoxicity against healthy cells/tissues. The results indicate the MCT4-inhibition-induced disruption of tumor intracellular pH holds promise as a therapy against not only HCC, but a broader spectrum of MCT4-overexpressing hyperglycolytic tumors.
