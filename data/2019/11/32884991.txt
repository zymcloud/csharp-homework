Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Western medicine and therapies are the primary treatment strategies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the general prognosis for HCC patients is still dismal. Under these circumstances, HCC prevention is particularly important. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) encompasses a wealth of documented therapeutic resources, and "preventative treatment" is the principle of TCM. In China, TCM has been used for HCC prevention for thousands of years, and has also been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of HCC in modern China. However, the TCM theory for prevention and treatment of HCC is more widely accepted in China than abroad. In this review, we first summarize the herbs and ancient formulas with therapeutic effects on HCC. We also review the research status of TCM in modern medicine as well as the current obstacles in its development. Finally, we discuss the future of TCM in the context of precision and integrated medicine. After reviewing the literature, we believe that TCM, through ancient development, is an advanced method of cancer treatment with positive curative effects, despite its surrounding controversy. Furthermore, precise analyses and systematic research methods provides novel approaches to modernize TCM for the future.
