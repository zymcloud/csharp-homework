Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still remains a dominating medical challenge in early diagnosis and clinical therapy. Centromere protein M (CENPM) has been proved to be over-expressed in HCC tissues, but carcinogenic mechanism of CENPM contributing to liver cancer is poorly understood.Methods:In this study, we first explored mRNA and protein levels of CENPM in HCC samples, matching adjacent non-tumor tissues and six hepatoma cell lines by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical data of HCC patients downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were also analyzed. The character of CENPM concerned with HCC progression through several functional experimentations in vitro and in vivo was researched. Bioinformatics was carried out to further discover biological functions of CENPM.Results:CENPM was positively up-regulated in HCC and connected with a poor prognosis. Silencing CENPM repressed cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro, and knock-down CENPM inhibited cell migration and invasion. Additionally, depletion of CENPM can promote cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle. Furthermore, single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis indicated that CENPM was linked to the P53 signaling pathway and cell cycle pathway, and our research supported this prediction. Finally, we also found that miR-1270 was a negative regulator and participated in post-transcriptional regulation of CENPM, and hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) can promote hepatocellular carcinoma by suppressing miR1270.Conclusion:CENPM was closely associated with HCC progression and it could be considered as a new possible biomarker along with a therapeutic target for HCC.
