Background:Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which is present in the blood, is related to the apoptosis and necrosis of cancer cells; inflammation also influences the total plasma level of cfDNA. However, the total plasma cfDNA level has not been investigated in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who experience cancer and HBV infection at the same time. The aim of the study was to investigate total plasma cfDNA in patients with HBV-related HCC.Methods:HBV-related HCC patients were included from January 2018 to May 2019. All patients underwent hepatectomy and were diagnosed with HCC by histopathology. Peripheral blood samples were obtained preoperatively, and the levels of total plasma cfDNA were quantitated by a fluorometric double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) assay. We examined the correlation between cfDNA and clinical parameters, and recurrence-free survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:Forty-eight HBV-related HCC patients were included. The average age in years was 50.90±13.15, and the mean albumin level was 41.63±5.38 g/L. HBV-DNA, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class, TNM stage, tumor number and vascular invasion showed a relationship with total plasma cfDNA (PConclusions:In addition to tumor diameter and vascular invasion, CTP class can influence total plasma cfDNA in HBV-related HCC patients, and the total plasma cfDNA level can be used as a biomarker to predict early recurrence in HBV-related HCC patients.
