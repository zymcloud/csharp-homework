Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now the most common primary liver malignancy worldwide, and multiple risk factors attribute to the occurrence and development of HCC. Recently, increasing studies suggest that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2T (UBE2T) serves as a promising prognostic factor in human cancers, although the molecular mechanism of UBE2T in HCC remains unclear.Aim:To investigate the clinical relevance and role of UBE2T in HCC development.Methods:UBE2T expression in HCC tissues from the TCGA database and its association with patient survival were analyzed. A lentivirus-mediated strategy was used to knock down UBE2T in HCC cells. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays were performed to check the effect of UBE2T silencing in HCC cells. Cell growth in vitro and in vivo was analyzed by multiparametric high-content screening and the xenograft tumorigenicity assay, respectively. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. The genes regulated by UBE2T were profiled by microarray assay.Results:UBE2T was overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with paired and non-paired normal tissues. High expression of UBE2T predicted a poor overall survival in HCC patients. In vitro, lentivirus-mediated UBE2T knockdown significantly reduced the viability of both SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404 cells. In vivo, the xenograft tumorigenesis of SMMC-7721 cells was largely attenuated by UBE2T silencing. The cell cycle was arrested at G1/S phase in SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404 cells with UBE2T knockdown. Furthermore, apoptosis was increased by UBE2T knockdown. At the molecular level, numerous genes were dysregulated after UBE2T silencing, including IL-1B, FOSL1, PTGS2, and BMP6.Conclusion:UBE2T plays an important role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and HCC development.
