Data on malignancy in patients with collagenous colitis (CC) is scarce. We aimed to determine the incidence of cancers in patients with CC. In a two-stages, observational study, data on cancers in patients diagnosed with CC during 2000-2015, were collected from two cohorts. The risk was calculated according to the age-standardized rate for the first cohort and according to the standardized incidence ratio for the second cohort. The first cohort comprised 738 patients (394 from Scotland and 344 from Sweden; mean age 71 ± 11 and 66 ± 13 years, respectively). The incidence rates for lung cancer (RR 3.9, p = 0.001), bladder cancer (RR 9.2, p = 0.019), and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (RR 15, p = 0.001) were increased. As the majority of NMSC cases (15/16) came from Sweden, a second Swedish cohort, comprising 1141 patients (863 women, mean age 65 years, range 20-95 years) was collected. There were 93 cancer cases (besides NMSC). The risk for colon cancer was decreased (SIR 0.23, p= 0.0087). The risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma was instead markedly increased (SIR 3.27, p = 0.001).
