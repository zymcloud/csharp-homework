Objectives:Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS) is characterized by histological resemblance to hepatocellular carcinoma and a poor prognosis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of HAS.Methods:Forty-two patients with HAS who received gastrectomy were enrolled in this study. Based on a panel of 483 cancer-related genes, targeted sequencing of 24 HAS and 22 clinical parameter-matched common gastric cancer (CGC) samples was performed. Prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analysed with the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The most frequently mutated gene in both HAS and CGC was TP53, with a mutation rate of 30%. Additionally, CEBPA, RPTOR, WISP3, MARK1, and CD3EAP were identified as genes with high-frequency mutations in HAS (10-20%). Copy number gains (CNGs) at 20q11.21-13.12 occurred frequently in HAS, nearly 50% of HAS tumours harboured at least one gene with a CNG at 20q11.21-13.12. This CNG tended to be related to more adverse biobehaviour, including poorer differentiation, greater vascular and nerve invasion, and greater liver metastasis. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the HIF-1 signalling pathway and signalling pathways regulating stem cell pluripotency were specifically enriched in HAS. The survival analysis showed that a preoperative serum AFP level â‰¥ 500 ng/ml was significantly associated with poorer OS (p = 0.007) and tended to be associated with poorer DFS (p = 0.05).Conclusion:CNGs at 20q11.21-13.12 happened frequently in HAS and tended to be related to more adverse biobehaviour. The preoperative serum AFP level was a sensitive prognostic biomarker for DFS and OS.
