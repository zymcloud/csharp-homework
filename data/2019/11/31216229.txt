The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not completely eliminated in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients even after viral eradication. There are few studies in predicting the development of HCC using biomarker in CHC patients with sustained virologic response (SVR). We evaluated the role of the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) in predicting HCC development in 295 patients with SVR after interferon therapy. The annual incidence of HCC was 0.55% (95% confidence interval: 0.31-0.96). It was higher in patients with a pretreatment APRI ≥2.0 than in those with an APRI P = 0.0001) and in patients with a FIB-4 ≥ 3.25 compared with those with a FIB-4 < 3.25. (1.50% versus 0.07%; P = 0.0001). The annual incidence of HCC was higher in patients with a post-treatment APRI ≥0.5 than in those with an APRI <0.5 (1.67% versus 0.07%; P < 0.0001) and in patients with a post-treatment FIB-4 ≥ 2.5 compared with those with a FIB-4 < 2.5 (1.49% versus 0.01%; P = 0.0003). Among pretreatment variables, male gender, albumin, APRI, or FIB-4 were independent predictors for HCC. Among post-treatment variables, APRI or FIB-4 was an independent predictor for HCC. HCC surveillance should be performed in these high-risk patients.
