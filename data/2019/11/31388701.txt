Thermal ablative techniques have been increasingly recognized as a valuable alternative to graftectomy and nephron-sparing surgery for the treatment of small neoplasms arising in the transplanted kidney. However, long-term efficacy and safety data are still lacking. In particular, current experience with microwave ablation is limited to a very recent single-centre series of three cases. We herein report two microwave ablations of renal cell carcinoma of the kidney allograft. The procedures were successfully performed under ultrasound guidance with complete tumour necrosis, no peri-operative complications, and preserved renal function. No recurrences were observed after 3 years of follow-up.
