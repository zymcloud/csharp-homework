Background:Gastric cancer (GC) exhibits heterogeneous clinical and molecular features, requiring the development of new biomarkers to further understand this disease. Our transcriptomic analysis detected overexpression of melanoma-associated antigen A6 (MAGEA6) in metastatic GC, leading us to determine the clinical significance of MAGEA6 in GC.Materials and methods:Fourteen GC cell lines and 230 pairs of surgically resected gastric tissues were subjected to mRNA expression analysis. Polymerase chain reaction array analysis was performed to identify coordinately expressed cancer-related genes, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detected MAGEA6 expression in situ.Results:MAGEA6 mRNA levels were positively correlated with the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 mRNA. MAGEA6 mRNA levels were higher in GC tissues compared with those in normal adjacent tissues. Patients with high MAGEA6 expression had significantly worse prognosis. MAGEA6 protein levels in primary lesions predicted the likelihood of recurrence.Conclusion:Overexpression of MAGEA6 in GC tissues represents a promising biomarker for assessing the malignant phenotype of GC.
