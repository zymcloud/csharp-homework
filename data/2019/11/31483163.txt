Multiple studies have shown that cancer-specific alternative splicing (AS) alterations are associated with clinical outcome. In this study, we aimed to profile prognostic AS signatures for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We integrated the percent-spliced-in (PSI) data of AS in 140 PDAC patients based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We identified overall survival (OS)-associated AS events using univariate Cox regression analysis. Then, prognostic AS signatures were constructed for OS and chemoresistance prediction using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. We also analyzed splicing factors (SFs) regulatory networks by Pearson's correlation. We detected 677 OS-related AS events in 485 genes by profiling 10,354 AS events obtained from 140 PDAC patients. Gene functional enrichment analysis demonstrated the pathways enriched by survival-associated AS. The AS signatures constructed with significant survival-associated AS events revealed high performance in predicting PDAC survival and gemcitabine chemoresistance. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.937 in training cohort and 0.748 in validation cohort at 2000 days of OS. Furthermore, we identified prognostic SFs (e.g., ESRP1 and HNRNPC) to build the AS regulatory network. We constructed AS signatures for OS and gemcitabine chemoresistance in PDAC patients, which may provide clues for further experiment-based mechanism study.
