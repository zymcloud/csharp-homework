Accumulating evidences have shown that microRNA-200c (miR-200c) expression is associated with the prognosis of many types of human cancer. However, the prognostic value of miR-200c in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown. In the present study, the expression of miR-200c in paired HCC and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 148 patients was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and we analyzed its association with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of HCC patients. Our results showed that the expression of miR-200c was significantly decreased in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (P
