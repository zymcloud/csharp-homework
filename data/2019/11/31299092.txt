Background:Few data are available regarding the management and outcomes among patients with sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to its rarity.Methods:Patients diagnosed with sarcomatoid HCC from 2004 through 2015 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Overall survival (OS) was calculated among patients with sarcomatoid versus conventional HCC using a 1:3 propensity score matching based on sex, age, and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage of disease.Results:The final analytic cohort included 104 patients with sarcomatoid HCC and 312 patients with conventional HCC. Patients with sarcomatoid HCC more often had a larger median tumor size (8.5 cm vs 5.4 cm; P Conclusions:Sarcomatoid HCC is a very rare variant of HCC, which was associated with larger tumor size and worse tumor grade on presentation. On propensity score matched analyses that controlled for known confounding factors, patients with sarcomatoid HCC had a worse stage-for-stage long-term survival compared with patients who had conventional HCC.
