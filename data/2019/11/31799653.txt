Objective:Recent studies have proved that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as an important role in many diseases. In this research, lncRNA XIST was explored to identify how it functions in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect XIST expression in HCC patients. Then, we conducted Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony formation assays in vitro. Furthermore, mechanism assays and the interaction between XIST and miR-200b-3p were conducted.Results:By comparing with XIST expression in adjacent tissues, the XIST expression level was significantly higher in HCC samples. Moreover, functional assays showed that the cell growth ability of HCC cells was inhibited after XIST was silenced in vitro, and tumor formation was inhibited after XIST was silenced in vivo. Further experiments showed that miR-200b-3p was directly targeted by XIST.Conclusions:Above results suggest that XIST could enhance the cell growth ability of HCC by targeting miR-200b-3p, which suggest that XIST may be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.
