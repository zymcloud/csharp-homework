Objective:To uncover the specific function of linc00511 in the progression of liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and the underlying mechanism.Patients and methods:GEPIA dataset containing 9736 LIHC samples and 857 normal samples were downloaded from TCGA. Expression pattern and prognostic potential of linc00511 in LIHC were analyzed. Subsequently, expression level of linc00511 in LIHC tissues collected in our hospital and cell lines were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Differential expressions of linc00511 in LIHC with different tumor grades and metastatic status were compared. After transfection of si-linc00511, proliferative and migratory changes in Huh7 and Hep3B cells were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and Transwell assay. Lastly, Pearson correlation analysis and qRT-PCR were conducted to investigate the interaction between linc00511 and miR-29c.Results:Linc00511 was upregulated in LIHC tissues and cell lines. Its level was positively correlated to TNM staging, lymphatic metastasis and poor prognosis in LIHC patients. Knockdown of linc00511 attenuated proliferative and migratory abilities in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. In addition, miR-29c was downregulated in LIHC and negatively linked to linc00511 level. A negative interaction between linc00511 and miR-29c could be a regulatory feedback influencing the progression of LIHC.Conclusion:Linc00511 accelerates the proliferation and migration in LIHC, thus aggravating tumor progression. Meanwhile, linc00511 could be utilized as a hallmark predicting poor prognosis in LIHC patients.
