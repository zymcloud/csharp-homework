Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in many diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNA ZFAS1 in the development of HCC and to explore its underlying mechanism.Patients and methods:Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was utilized to detect ZFAS1 expression in tissue samples of HCC patients. Subsequently, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, and EdU incorporation assay were performed to detect the function of ZFAS1 in vitro. Furthermore, mechanism assays were performed to explore the interaction between ZFAS1 and miR-193a-3p.Results:ZFAS1 was significantly highly expressed in HCC tissues than that of adjacent normal tissues. The growth ability of HCC cells was markedly inhibited after ZFAS1 was silenced. However, the growth ability of HCC cells was remarkably promoted after ZFAS1 overexpression. Moreover, RT-qPCR results revealed that miR-193a-3p was significantly down-regulated via the overexpression of ZFAS1. However, miR-193a-3p was significantly up-regulated via the knockdown of ZFAS1. Further experiments showed that miR-193a-3p was a direct target of ZFAS1 in HCC.Conclusions:ZFAS1 could enhance the proliferation of HCC cells by suppressing miR-193a-3p, which might be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.
