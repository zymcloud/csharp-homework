Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapeutic drugs for chronic hepatitis B using pegylated interferons and nucleos(t)ide analogs have limited efficacy. Therefore, the development of novel and safe antivirals is required. Natural products including medicinal plants produce complex and structurally diverse compounds, some of which offer suitable targets for antiviral screening studies. In the present study, we screened various crude extracts from Indonesian plants for anti-HBV activity by determining their effects on the production of extracellular HBV DNA in Hep38.7-Tet cells and HBV entry onto a HBV-susceptible cell line, HepG2-NTCP, with the following results: (1) In Hep38.7-Tet cells, Cananga odorata exhibited the highest anti-HBV activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 56.5 µg/ml and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 540.2 µg/ml (Selectivity Index: 9.6). (2) The treatment of HepG2-NTCP cells with Cassia fistula, C. odorata, and Melastoma malabathricum at concentrations of 100 µg/ml lowered the levels of HBsAg production to 51.2%, 58.0%, and 40.1%, respectively, compared to untreated controls, and IC50 and CC50 values of C. odorata were 142.9 µg/ml and >400 µg/ml. In conclusion, the C. odorata extract could be a good candidate for the development of anti-HBV drugs.
