Achieving HBV DNA negative transformation and HBsAg clearance with effective antiviral therapy can reduce the incidence of HCC, but some patients are still at risk of developing HCC. Therefore, screening high-risk patients for close monitoring is essential to reduce the incidence of HCC. This paper reviews the occurrence of HCC, risk factors and risk prediction models of HBV DNA negative transformation and HBsAg clearance, and provides a basis for screening and follow-up management of high-risk group of HCC with chronic hepatitis B.
