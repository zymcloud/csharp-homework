Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence is rising. This paper summarises the current state of knowledge and recent discoveries in the cellular and physiological mechanisms leading to the development of liver cancer, especially HCC, and liver metastases. After reviewing normal hepatic cytoarchitecture and immunological characteristics, the paper addresses the pathophysiological factors that cause liver damage and predispose to neoplasia. Particular attention is given to chronic liver diseases, metabolic syndrome and the impact of altered gut microbiota, disrupted circadian rhythm and psychological stress. Improved knowledge of the multifactorial aetiology of HCC has important implications for the prevention and treatment of this cancer and of liver metastases in general.
