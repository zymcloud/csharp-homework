Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, with a high mortality rate. Its dismal prognosis is attributed to late diagnosis, high risk of recurrence and drug resistance. To improve the survival of patients with HCC, new approaches are required for early diagnosis, real-time monitoring and effective treatment. Exosomes are small membranous vesicles released by most cells that contain biological molecules and play a great role in intercellular communication under physiological or pathological conditions. In cancer, exosomes from tumor cells or non-tumor cells can be taken up by neighboring or distant target cells, and the cargoes in exosomes are functional to modulate the behaviors of tumors or reshape tumor microenvironment (TME). As essential components, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are selectively enriched in exosomes, and exosomal ncRNAs participate in regulating specific aspects of tumor development, including tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, immunomodulation and drug resistance. Besides, dysregulated exosomal ncRNAs have emerged as potential biomarkers, and exosomes can serve as natural vehicles to deliver tumor-suppressed ncRNAs for treatment. In this review, we briefly summarize the biology of exosomes, the functions of exosomal ncRNAs in HCC development and their potential clinical applications, including as biomarkers and therapeutic tools.
