The proliferation of hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) is observed in reactive conditions of the liver and primary liver cancers. Ring1 as a member of polycomb-group proteins which play vital roles in carcinogenesis and stem cell self-renewal was increased in HCC patients and promoted proliferation and survival of cancer cell by degrading p53. However, the mechanisms of Ring1 driving the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis have not been elucidated. In this study, forced expression Ring1 and Ring1 siRNA lentiviral vectors were utilized to stably overexpression and silence Ring1 in HPC cell line (WB-F344), respectively. Our finding indicated that overexpression of Ring1 in HPCs promoted colony formation, cell multiplication, and invasion in vitro, conversely depletion of Ring1 repressed the biological functions of HPCs relative to controls. The expression of β-catenin was upregulated in the HPCs with overexpression of Ring1, and the correlation analysis also showed that β-catenin and Ring1 had a significant correlation in the liver cancer tissues and adjacent tissues. The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway significantly increased the expression of liver cancer stem cells related (LCSCs)-related molecular markers CD90 and EpCAM, which led to the transformation of HPCs into LCSCs. Most importantly, the injection of HPCs with overexpressed Ring1 into the subcutaneous of nude mice leads to the formation of poorly differentiated HCC neoplasm. Our findings elucidate that overexpression of Ring1 the activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and drove the transformation of HPCs into cancer stem cell-like cells, suggesting Ring1 has extraordinary potential in early diagnosis of HCC.
