Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is the most abundant enzyme in human liver cells. When liver lesions occur, the permeability of liver cell membrane is enhanced and ALT is released into the blood. Clinically, the nature and degree of liver lesions are understood by measuring the level of ALT in peripheral blood. Serum ALT levels after chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while the normalization of ALT in antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients is an independent surrogate indicator for predicting HCC development.
