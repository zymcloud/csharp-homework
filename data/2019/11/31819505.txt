Background:Dysfunction of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is associated with tumorigenesis of various malignancies, including glioma. LncRNA RGMB-AS1 (RGMB antisense RNA 1) has been reported to participate in initiation and progression of several cancers, such as lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Nevertheless, whether RGMB-AS1 regulates glioma development is not investigated. In this study, we aimed to determine its roles in glioma.Methods:qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure gene expression. CCK8 and colony formation assays were utilized to analyze proliferation. Transwell assay was used to determine cell migration and invasion. Luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the interactions among RGMB-AS1, miR-1200 and HOXB2.Results:RGMB-AS1 was upregulated in glioma tissues and associated with glioma grade and patients' prognosis. Moreover, RGMB-AS1 silencing significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells. RGMB-AS1 downregulation led to more tumor cells arrested in the quiescent state. Mechanistically, we found that RGMB-AS1 was a molecular sponge for miR-1200. MiR-1200 level was inhibited by RGMB-AS1. And RGMB-AS1 promoted HOXB2 expression via sponging miR-1200. Restoration of HOXB2 effectively rescued the abilities of proliferation, migration and invasion in RGMB-AS1-depleted glioma cells.Conclusion:Collectively, our work clarified that RGMB-AS1/miR-1200/HOXB2 signaling exerts an essential role in regulating glioma progression.
