Background:Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is a viral marker for the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, the relationship between HBcrAg and HBV recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) is unclear.Aim:To investigate the correlation of serum HBcrAg level with HBV recurrence post-LT to evaluate the prognostic role of the pre-LT HBcrAg level.Methods:This retrospective cohort study enrolled 357 CHB patients who received LT for a median of 36.6 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for markers associated with HBV recurrence were analysed.Results:48 patients (13.4%) had HBV recurrence after LT. HBcrAg, detectable HBV DNA, HCC and HCC recurrence were associated with HBV recurrence. In a multivariate analysis, HBcrAg level was independently associated with HBV recurrence, and the relationship between HBcrAg level and incident HBV recurrence was significant and graded (HR: 3.17 per unit; 95% CI: 1.97-5.11; P for trend Conclusion:An elevated serum HBcrAg level was independently associated with the risk of HBV recurrence in patients with CHB after LT.
