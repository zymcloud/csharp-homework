Introduction:Aerobic training and green tea extract can be used to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of 8-wk aerobic exercise training and administration of green tea extract on the level of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and p53 tumor suppressor protein (p53) in prostate of rats which were stimulated by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea to induce the prostate cancer.Methods:Sixty adult male Wistar rats were assigned into six groups including healthy control, cancer control (CCt), cancer training (CTr: 45 minÂ·d at low to moderate intensity, five times per week, 8 wk), cancer extract (CEx: 1.34 mL of green tea extract, three times per week, 8 wk), cancer training+ cancer extract (CTr + CEx) and sham groups. Rats were sacrificed 48 h after the last intervention session, and the prostate tissue was isolated to measure the levels of NF-kB, COX-2, and p53.Results:The NF-kB level in CCt group was increased significantly compared to the healthy control (P = 0.02). In the CTr group, NF-kB level was decreased significantly compared to the CCt and CEx groups (P = 0.001 and 0.05, respectively). In addition, the levels of P53 protein were reduced in CTr, CEx, and CTr + CEx groups compared to CCt group (P = 0.001, 0.02 and 0.004, respectively). No significant changes were found in the level of COX-2 between groups.Conclusions:These results suggest that a long-term exercise training combined with the intake of green tea extract may reduce levels of NF-kB and p53 in rats with prostate cancer. Given the importance of recognizing complementary therapies in this regard, future studies are warranted.
