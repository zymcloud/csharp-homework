Micro-RNAs regulate multiple biological behaviors of cancers, making them potential targets of new cancer therapies. MiR-1181 has been demonstrated to perform oncogenic or tumor-suppressing function in a tissue-dependent way, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was unclear. Here, we showed that miR-1181 was significantly overexpressed in HCC tissues when compared with tumor-adjacent normal ones or normal liver tissues from donated organ, and that inhibition of miR-1181 could repress the growth of HCC cells. Through bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays, we found that axis inhibition protein 1 (AXIN1) was a direct target of miR-1181, and the expression of AXIN1 showed a negative correlation with that of miR-1181 in HCC. Therefore, these data indicated an oncogenic function of miRNA-1181 in the development of HCC and a potential target for the clinical treatment of HCC.
