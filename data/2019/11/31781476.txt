miRNAs are small non-coding RNA sequences of 18-25 nucleotides. They can regulate different cellular pathways by acting on tumor suppressors, oncogenes, or both. miRNAs are mostly tissue-specific, and their expression varies depending on the cancer or the tissue in which they are found. hsa-miR-590-3p was found to be involved in several types of cancers. In this study, we identified potential downstream target genes of hsa-miR-590-3p computationally. Several bioinformatics tools and more than one approach were used to identify potential downstream target genes of hsa-miR-590-3p. CX3CL1, SOX2, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and FOXA2 were utilized as potential downstream target genes of hsa-miR-590-3p. SNU449 and HepG2, hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, were used to carry out various molecular techniques to further validate our in silico results. mRNA and protein expression levels of these genes were detected using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Co-localization of hsa-miR-590-3p and its candidate downstream target gene, SOX2, was carried out using a miRNA in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry staining through anti-SOX2. The results show that there is an inverse correlation between hsa-miR-590-3p expression and SOX2 protein expression in SNU449. Subsequently, we suggest that SOX2 can be a direct downstream target of has-miR-590-3p indicating that it may have a role in the self-renewal and self-maintenance of cancer cells. We also suggest that CX3CL1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and FOXA2 show a lot of potential as downstream target genes of hsa-miR-590-3p signifying its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Studying the expression of hsa-miR-590-3p downstream targets can enrich our understanding of the cancer pathogenesis and how it can be used as a therapeutic tool.
