Introduction:Diabetes and cancer are among the most frequent causes of death worldwide. Recent epidemiological findings have indicated a link between diabetes and cancer in several organs, particularly the liver. A number of epidemiological studies have demonstrated that diabetes is an established independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the metabolites connecting diabetes and HCC remains less well understood.Objectives:The study aimed to identify clinical and metabolomics differences of HCC from patients with/without diabetes using comprehensive global metabolomics analysis.Methods:Metabolite profiling was conducted with the Metabolon platform for 120 human diabetes/non-diabetes HCC tumor/normal tissues. Standard statistical analyses were performed using the Partek Genomics Suite on log-transformed data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using all and dysregulated metabolites.Results:We identified a group of metabolites that are differentially expressed in the tumor tissues of diabetes HCC compared to non-diabetes HCC patients. Meanwhile, we also identified a group of metabolites that are differentially expressed in the matched normal liver tissues of diabetes HCC compared to non-diabetes HCC patients. Some metabolites are consistently dysregulated in the tumor or matched normal tissues of HCC with or without diabetes. However, some metabolites, including 2-hydroxystearate, were only overexpressed in the tumor tissues of HCC with diabetes and associated with the glucose level.Conclusion:Metabolic profiling identifies distinct dysregulated metabolites in HCC patients with/without diabetes.
