Well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasms are currently classified in the World Health Organization scheme as hepatocellular adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no recognized diagnostic category for atypical cases with borderline features, and we have designated these as atypical hepatocellular neoplasms. Diffuse glutamine synthetase staining is used as a surrogate marker to detect β-catenin activation, a well-recognized high risk feature in hepatocellular tumors. This study examined 27 well-differentiated hepatocellular neoplasms with diffuse glutamine synthetase staining, including 7 atypical hepatocellular neoplasms with no cytoarchitectural atypia, 6 atypical hepatocellular neoplasms with focal cytoarchitectural atypia, and 14 well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas. Capture-based next-generation sequencing was performed, and alterations in WNT pathway genes (CTNNB1, APC, AXIN1) were seen in 81% of cases (10/13 atypical hepatocellular neoplasms and 12/14 of hepatocellular carcinomas), while the molecular basis of diffuse glutamine synthetase staining was unclear in the remaining 19% of cases. Additional non-WNT pathway mutations (TP53, TSC1, DNMT3A, CREBBP) or copy number alterations were present in 56% of atypical hepatocellular neoplasms, with no significant difference in cases with or without focal cytoarchitectural atypia, supporting that all cases with β-catenin activation should be classified as atypical irrespective of atypia. Atypical hepatocellular neoplasm and hepatocellular carcinoma also demonstrated largely similar genomic profiles, but TERT promoter mutations were restricted to hepatocellular carcinoma (21%) and copy number alterations were more common in hepatocellular carcinoma (64 vs 31%). Mutational and copy number analysis may be helpful in characterization and risk stratification of atypical hepatocellular neoplasms when morphology and glutamine synthetase staining yield ambiguous results.
