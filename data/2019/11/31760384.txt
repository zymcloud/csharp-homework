Background:In this paper, we aim to explore clinical value of skeletal muscle index (SMI) and prognostic nutrition index (PNI) on resected colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM).Results:Among the 539 patients, 355 were males. Baseline lower SMI was associated with smaller BMI, smaller PNI, smaller pre-albumin and longer hospitalization days (P<0.05). Patients with lower SMI and PNI had significantly shorter duration of PFS and OS (P<0.05). SMI can reflect the postoperative treatment response. Postoperative 6-month's and 12-month's SMI and PNI can indicate overall prognosis. When combined SMI and PNI, prognostic AUC of ROC curves improved significantly.Conclusion:Combined monitor of SMI and PNI can improve the power at predicting prognosis. Postoperative 6-month's record of SMI and PNI was more accurate and predictive for CRLM prognosis.Method:A total of 539 resected CRLM patients between January 2013 to December 2016 with complete clinical data were included. Computed tomography image was collected from each patient. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed; area under curves (AUC) were also determined. All clinical variables were analyzed in proper way.
