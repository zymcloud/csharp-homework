Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign lesions of the liver which can rarely undergo malignant transformation. We report a 26-year-old woman with no underlying liver disease found to have an incidental liver lesion on noncontrast CT during workup for gastric reflux. Follow up MRI revealed a 10 cm gadoxetate-retaining lesion within the right hepatic lobe with imaging features suggestive of HCA vs focal nodular hyperplasia . Within this lesion was a focus of arterial enhancement with venous washout suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within HCA, later confirmed at surgical resection. Understanding the imaging characteristics of HCAs as well as their rare ability to undergo malignant transformation is useful in differentiating HCAs from focal nodular hyperplasia.
