Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of 23 common types of cancer among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with the general Chinese population.Methods:Based on the Shanghai Hospital Link database, 410 191 patients with T2D (age 20-99 years) were identified from July 2013 to December 2016, and were followed-up for cancer incidence until December 2017.Results:In all, 8485 cases of newly diagnosed cancer were identified. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of total cancer were 1.34 and 1.62 among males and females, respectively. Among males with T2D, the risk of cancer of the prostate (highest SIR of 1.86), blood (leukemia, lymphoma), skin, thyroid, kidney, liver, pancreas, lung, colorectum, and stomach was increased significantly. There was a significant decrease in the risk of esophageal cancer. In females with T2D, there were significantly greater risks of cancer of the nasopharynx (highest SIR of 2.33), liver, esophagus, thyroid, lung, pancreas, blood (lymphoma, leukemia), uterus, colorectum, breast, cervix, and stomach. In contrast, there was significantly decrease risk of gallbladder cancer in females with T2D.Conclusions:This study shows significantly increased risks of overall and some site-specific cancers among patients with T2D. We suggest that establishing strategies for regular cancer-specific screening and prevention care among patients with T2D are necessary.
