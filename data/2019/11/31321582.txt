Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) predicts poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC patients with hypercoagulability are prone to develop thrombosis; however, the relationship between preoperative coagulability state, as reflected by the international normalized ratio (INR) level, and MVI remains unclear.Methods:From January 2009 to December 2012, HCC patients who underwent R0 liver resection (LR) from four cancer centers entered into this study. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.Results:Of the 2509 HCC patients who were included into this study, 1104 were found to have MVI in the resected specimens. These patients were divided into the low (n = 151), normal (n = 796), and high (n = 157) INR subgroups based on the preoperative INR levels. The low INR subgroup had a significantly higher incidence of MVI than the normal or high INR subgroups (61.6% vs. 41.6% vs. 44.6%; p Conclusions:Preoperative hypercoagulability was associated with poor long-term prognosis in HCC patients with MVI after R0 LR.
