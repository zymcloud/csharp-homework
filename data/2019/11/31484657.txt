Despite the great success of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)-cell therapy in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, CAR-T-cell therapy is limited in solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands (NKG2DL) are generally absent on the surface of normal cells but are overexpressed on malignant cells, offering good targets for CAR-T therapy. Indeed, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas and HCC tumor samples showed that the expression of most NKG2DLs was elevated in tumors compared with normal tissues. Thus, we designed a novel NKG2D-based CAR comprising the extracellular domain of human NKG2D, 4-1BB, and CD3Î¶ signaling domains (BBz). NKG2D-BBz CAR-T cells efficiently killed the HCC cell lines SMMC-7721 and MHCC97H in vitro, which express high levels of NKG2DLs, whereas they less efficiently killed NKG2DL-silenced SMMC-7721 cells or NKG2DL-negative Hep3B cells. Overexpression of MICA or ULBP2 in Hep3B improved the killing capacity of NKG2D-BBz CAR-T cells. T cells expressing the NKG2D-BBz CAR effectively eradicated SMMC-7721 HCC xenografts. Collectively, these results suggested that NKG2D-BBz CAR-T cells could potently eliminate NKG2DL-high HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing a promising therapeutic intervention for patients with NKG2DL-positive HCC.
