Adoptive cell-based immunotherapy typically utilizes cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), expanding these cells ex vivo. Such expansion is traditionally accomplished through the use of autologous APCs that are capable of interactions with T cells. However, incidental inhibitory program such as CTLA-4 pathway can impair T cell proliferation. We therefore designed a nanobody which is specific for CTLA-4 (CTLA-4 Nb 16), and we then used this molecule to assess its ability to disrupt CTLA-4 signaling and thereby overcome negative costimulation of T cells. With CTLA-4 Nb16 stimulation, dendritic cell/hepatocellular carcinoma fusion cells (DC/HepG2-FCs) enhanced autologous CD8+ T cell proliferation and production of IFN-Î³ in vitro, thereby leading to enhanced killing of tumor cells. Using this approach in the context of adoptive CD8+ immunotherapy led to a marked suppression of tumor growth in murine NOD/SCID hepatocarcinoma or breast cancer xenograft models. We also observed significantly increased tumor cell apoptosis, and corresponding increases in murine survival. These findings thus demonstrate that in response to nanobody stimulation, DC/tumor cells-FC-induced specific CTLs exhibit superior anti-tumor efficacy, making this a potentially valuable means of achieving better adoptive immunotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.
