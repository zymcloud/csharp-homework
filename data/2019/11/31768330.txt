Aflatoxins are fungal secondary metabolites that contaminate dietary staples worldwide, including maize, rice and groundnuts. Dietary exposure to aflatoxins is a public health concern due to their carcinogenic, acute and chronic effects. Rice is an important staple food consumed widely and consists of a major part of the diets for half of the world population. Human exposure to these mycotoxins is a serious problem especially in developing countries where hot and humid climates favor the fungal growth and where food storage conditions are poor and lack of regulatory limits enforcement. The recent developments of biomarkers have provided opportunities in assessing aflatoxins exposure and related health effects in the high-risk population groups. This review describes the worldwide occurrence of aflatoxins in rice during the period from 1990 to 2015 and biomarkers-based evidence for human exposure to aflatoxins and their adverse health effects. Aflatoxin is a potent hepatocarcinogen and humans may expose to it at any stage of life. Epidemiological studies reported an association between aflatoxin intake and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in some sub-Saharan and Asian countries. Even daily high intake of rice with a low level of contamination is of health concern. Thus, it is necessary to implement effective strategies to prevent contamination and fungal growth in rice. A good agricultural and manufacturing practice should be applied during handling, storage and distribution of rice to ensure that aflatoxins contamination level is lower in the final product. Moreover, a regular survey for aflatoxins occurrence in rice and biomarkers-based studies is recommended to prevent and reduce the adverse health effects in the world population.
