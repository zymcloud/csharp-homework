Background:Ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) has a known poor prognosis. However, the risks and outcomes of this complication after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatectomized patients are poorly documented. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of and to identify the predictive factors for IC following TACE for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy.Method:From a cohort with a total of 486 patients who underwent resection for HCC, we included all consecutive patients who were treated with TACE for recurrent HCC after hepatectomy between 2000 and 2017. IC was defined by the coexistence of biological cholestasis and morphological lesions.Results:A total of 156 patients underwent TACE for the treatment of HCC recurrence after hepatectomy. Of them, eight (5.1%) developed IC. Their prognosis was poor compared with patients without IC (3-year survival 23.4% vs 76.2%; P = 0.008). Two factors, namely, time between hepatectomy and TACE (4.8 months vs. 16.0 months, P = 0.001) and TACE for a remnant liver mobilized during hepatectomy (P = 0.001), were associated with IC. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that 7 months was the more discriminant cutoff for the time period. IC occurred in 33.3% of the patients with the two factors, in 5.0% of those with one factor, and 0% in the absence of any factors.Conclusion:TACE for treating HCC recurrence carries a high risk of IC when performed early after hepatectomy in a previously mobilized liver. Our results might aid in identifying candidates for TACE for recurrent HCC, considering the major effect on patient outcomes.
