Liver resection (LR) is the standard procedure for treating colorectal cancer (CRC) hepatic metastasis; however, LR associated with a high recurrence incidence. This study aimed to determine an optimal post-LR adjuvant chemotherapeutic strategy to improve overall long-term patient outcomes. A retrospective study of 490 patients who had undergone curative LR for CRC hepatic metastasis was performed. Patients who underwent post-LR adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated high overall survival (OS) rates (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58, P = .002) but not high recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates (HR = 1.02, P = .885). Moreover, OS was significantly longer in patients who underwent 5-fluorouracil + leucovorin (5-FU/LV; HR = 0.63, P = .039), oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (HR = 0.45, P < .001), or irinotecan-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab (HR = 0.64, P = .040) than in those who did not. Among patients with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels of <5 ng/mL at 1 month after LR, significant differences were noted only in those who underwent 5-FU/LV (HR = 0.58, P = .035) and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (HR = 0.38, P < .001). In conclusion, perioperative CEA levels are crucial in prognosis and treatment of patients with CRC hepatic metastasis after LR. Additionally, certain regimens of adjuvant chemotherapy alongside post-LR CEA levels may provide beneficial results.
