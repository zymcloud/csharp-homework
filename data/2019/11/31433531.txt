Objective:This study aims to explore the predictive value of demographic and clinical factors in changes in quality of life (QoL) in liver cancer (LC) patients over time.Methods:We performed a prospective cohort study in 128 patients who had 4 time point data newly diagnosed with LC at two hospitals in Taiwan. Different functional QoL was measured by QLQ-C30. Specific characteristics were predictors for distinct functional QoL, estimated by a generalised estimating equation (GEE).Results:Patients who received liver resection or radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA) versus transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) or transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE) experienced a decrease in physical function from baseline to 1 month. In addition, patients who underwent liver resection versus RFA experienced a significant recovery in cognitive functioning from baseline to 6 months. Patients with advanced stage compared to those in early stage had a reduction in physical functioning from baseline to 1 month. The alcohol intake, hepatitis C infection and the job also affected the changes in physical and cognitive functioning.Conclusion:Healthcare professionals should pay attention to changes after treatment in the short term; additionally, they need to provide health education to modifiable factors such as alcohol intake attributed to the deterioration in QoL.
