This is a case report of a 45-year-old patient admitted with the symptom of bilateral leg swelling. Ultrasonography revealed a hyperechoic mass in the right lobe of the liver, which invaded the right hepatic vein (RHV) and extended into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrium (RA). Based on the high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and the ultrasonography findings, the patient was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a RHV, IVC, and RA tumor thrombus and secondary Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). HCC with a tumor thrombus extending into the IVC and RA has rarely been observed, and as a cause of secondary BCS, this type of HCC has been even more rarely reported.
hepatocellular carcinoma; inferior vena cava; right atrium; tumor thrombus.
