Objective: To investigate the clinical value of the adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical resection, and identify the potential beneficiaries.Methods: Patients were identified through the primary liver cancer big data (PLCBD) between 2012 and 2015. Overall survival (OS) between adjuvant TACE group and non-TACE was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier before and after propensity scoring match (PSM). Subgroup analysis was conducted stratified by risk factors.Results: A total of 2066 HCC patients receiving radical resection were identified. Patients with multiple tumors, tumor diameter >5 cm, satellite, and advanced stage were more likely to accept adjuvant TACE. Before PSM, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates in the TACE group and non-TACE group were 89%, 58%, 17%, and 88%, 53%, 13% (p = .43), respectively. While, the corresponding rates were 89%, 58%, 17%, and 86%, 49%, 11%, (p = .038), respectively after 1:1 PSM. In addition, patients were found to significantly benefit from adjuvant TACE if they had age ≥50 years, no cirrhosis, AFP ≤ 200 ng/ml, surgical margin <1 cm, tumor diameter >5 cm, no capsule, no satellite, or CN stage Ib/IIa (all p < .05), but patients with age < 50 years, tumor size ≤5 cm, or CN stage Ia were found to significantly benefit from radical resection in DFS (all p < .05).Conclusion: Currently, we concluded that not all of patients with HCC would benefit from adjuvant TACE. Patients with age ≥50 years, tumor size >5 cm, or CN stage Ib/IIa were strongly recommended to receive adjuvant TACE.
