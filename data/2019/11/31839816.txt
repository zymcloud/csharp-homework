The coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) is overexpressed in several types of cancer. This study aimed to investigate the role of CHCHD2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of CHCHD2 in HCC and non-tumorous tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, and the correlation between CHCHD2 expression and clinicopathological features of HCC was analyzed. Furthermore, the proliferation, apoptosis and migration of HepG2 cells with CHCHD2 knockdown were examined. We found that CHCHD2 was upregulated in HCC tissues, and high CHCHD2 expression was associated with poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, local tissue invasion, high TNM grade of HCC and poor patient survival. Depletion of CHCHD2 led to significantly reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and diminished migratory capacity in HepG2 cells. In addition, HCC tissues had high expression of CD105, a microvessel marker, and HepG2 cells depleted of CHCHD2 had low CD105 expression. In conclusion, CHCHD2 may play an oncogenic role in HCC via promoting tumor cell growth and migration while preventing apoptosis. CHCHD2 is a potential biomarker for poor outcome of HCC patients.
