Background:Limited effective intervention for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is available. This study aimed to investigate the potential clinical utility of apatinib, a highly selective inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) tyrosine kinase, as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of HCC.Methods:Four human HCC cell lines SMMC-7721, MHCC-97H, HCCLM3 and Hep-3B were treated with apatinib, irradiation or combination treatment. Colony formation assay, flow cytometry and nuclear Î³-H2AX foci immunofluorescence staining were performed to evaluate the efficacy of combination treatment. RNA sequencing was conducted to explore the potential mechanism. The impact of combination treatment on tumor growth was assessed by xenograft mice models.Results:Colony formation assay revealed that apatinib enhanced the radiosensitivity of HCC cell lines. Apatinib suppressed repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Flow cytometry analysis showed that apatinib increased radiation-induced apoptosis. Apatinib radiosensitized HCC via suppression of radiation-induced PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, an in vivo study indicated apatinib combined with irradiation significantly decreased xenograft tumor growth.Conclusions:Our results indicate that apatinib has therapeutic potential as a radiosensitizer in HCC, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a critical role in mediating radiosensitization of apatinib.
