Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global health burden, affecting an estimated 257 million people, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Reactivation of HBV infection among individuals with resolved and/or chronic HBV infection may result in clinical hepatitis with a rise in serum HBV DNA and serum alanine aminotransferase, and delayed identification may result in fulminant hepatitis and fatal liver failure. Routine screening for HBV is recommended in patients undergoing immunosuppressive drug regimens known to be associated with HBV reactivation (HBVr). A subset of patients identified to have positive hepatitis B surface antigen and/or hepatitis B core antibody may require preemptive antiviral therapy to reduce the risk of HBVr. This article summarizes the current evidence and society guidelines governing the evaluation and management of HBVr in the context of cancer chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drug therapy.
