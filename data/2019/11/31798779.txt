Background:Hepatitis B virus, together with hepatitis C virus, has been recognized as the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been suggested in increasing studies to be the potential prognostic factors for HCC. However, the role of combined application of lncRNAs in estimating overall survival (OS) for hepatitis virus positive HCC (VHCC) is uncertain.Aim:To construct an lncRNA signature related to the OS of VHCC patients to enhance the accuracy of prognosis prediction.Methods:The expression patterns of lncRNAs, as well as related clinical data were collected from 149 VHCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The R package was adopted to obtain the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). LncRNAs significantly associated with OS were screened by means of univariate Cox regression analysis, so as to construct a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model. Subsequently, the constructed lncRNA signature was developed and validated. Afterwards, the prognostic nomogram was established, which combined the as-established lncRNA signature as well as the clinical features. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis stratified by the virus type was also performed. Finally, the above-mentioned lncRNAs were enriched to corresponding pathways according to the markedly co-expressed genes.Results:A total of 1420 DElncRNAs were identified, among which 406 were significant in univariate Cox regression analysis. LASSO regression confirmed 8 out of the 406 lncRNAs, including AC005722.2, AC107959.3, AL353803.1, AL589182.1, AP000844.2, AP002478.1, FLJ36000, and NPSR1-AS1. Then, the prognostic risk score was calculated. Our results displayed a significant association between the risk model and the OS of VHCC [hazard ratio = 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.61-2.34, log-rank P = 2e-10]. The inference tree suggested that the established lncRNA signature was useful in the risk stratification of VHCC. Furthermore, a nomogram was plotted, and the concordance index of internal validation was 0.763 (95%CI: 0.700-0.826). Moreover, the subgroup analysis regarding etiology confirmed this risk model. In addition, the Wnt signaling pathway, angiogenesis, the p53 pathway, and the PI3 kinase pathway were the remarkably enriched pathways.Conclusion:An eight-lncRNA signature has been established to predict the prognosis for VHCC, which contributes to providing a novel foundation for the targeted therapy of VHCC.
