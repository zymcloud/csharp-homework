Abiraterone acetate (AbiAc) inhibits tumor growth when administered to immunodeficient mice engrafted with the in vitro cell model of human adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Here, we developed and validated a zebrafish model engrafted with cortisol-secreting ACC cells to study the effects of AbiAc on tumor growth. The experimental conditions for AbiAc absorption in AB zebrafish embryos including embryo number, AbiAc concentration, and absorption time curve by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were set up. The AbiAc effect on steroid production in AB zebrafish embryos was measured as well. ACC cells (the NCI-H295R cell line, the primary cell ACC29, and the negative control cell SW13) were treated with drug-induced liver injury fluorescent dye, and ∼240 cells per 4 nL was injected in the subperidermal space of the yolk sac of AB zebrafish embryos (n = 80 ± 10). The cell area was measured with Noldus DanioScopeTM software. AbiAc absorption in AB zebrafish embryos was stage dependent. Abiraterone (Abi) concentration decreased, whereas its main metabolite, Δ4A, increased. Accordingly, we demonstrated that zebrafish expressed mRNA encoding the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts Abi in Δ4A. Furthermore, ABiAc reduced cortisol production and increased progesterone in zebrafish embryos. Three days after cell injection, the cortisol-secreting ACC cell area in solvent-treated embryos was significantly higher than that in 1 µM AbiAC‒treated embryos, whereas no AbiAc effect was observed in SW13 cells, which lack the Abi target enzyme CYP17A1.Zebrafish embryos xenografted with ACC tumor cells could be a useful, fast, and reproducible experimental model to preclinically test the activity of new drugs in human ACC.
