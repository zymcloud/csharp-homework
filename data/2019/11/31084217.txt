One new benzophenone (1) and one new 1,3-diphenylpropane (2) were obtained from the fibrous roots of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge. Their structures were determined by comprehensive 1D, 2D NMR and HRESIMS data. By comparing the calculated ECD curves and OR with the experimental data the absolute configurations were determined. The antitumor activity of all isolates was evaluated against two human hepatoma carcinoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B) in vitro. The results demonstrated that compound 1 and 2 showed potent cytotoxicity against HepG2 and Hep3B cells.
