Unconventional prefoldin RNA polymerase II subunit 5 interactor (URI1) has emerged as an oncogenic driver in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although the hepatitis B virus (HBV) represents the most common etiology of HCC worldwide, it is unknown whether URI1 plays a role in HBV-related HCC (HCC-B). In the present study, we investigated URI1 expression and its underlying mechanism in HCC-B tissues and cell lines. URI1 gene-promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assay. Human HCC-B samples were used for a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We found that c-MYC induced URI1 expression and activated the URI1 promoter through the E-box in the promoter region while the HBx protein significantly enhanced it. The positivity of URI1 expression was significantly higher in HCC-B tumor tissues than in non-HBV-related HCC tumor tissues, suggesting that a specific mechanism underlies URI1 expression in HCC-B. In tumor tissues from HCC-B patients, a significantly higher level of c-MYC was recruited to the E-box than in non-tumor tissues. These results suggest that HBx and c-MYC are involved in URI1 expression in HCC-B. URI1 expression may play important roles in the development and progression of HCC-B because HBx and c-MYC are well-known oncogenic factors in the virus and host, respectively.
