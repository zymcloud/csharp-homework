Background:The majority of patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have advanced diseases and many are not eligible for curative therapies.Case presentation:We report a rare case of HCC from a patient who had a complete response (CR) with the use of combination of Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab. A 63-year-old man presented at the hospital with serious abdominal pain and was found to have a mass with heterogeneous enhancement and with hemorrhage in segment III of the liver after the examination of abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan. The patient's history of viral hepatitis B infection, liver cirrhosis and the É‘-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 14,429.3 ng/ml supported the clinical diagnosis of HCC and laboratory results demonstrated liver function damage status (Child-Pugh class B, Score 8). The patient first received hepatic arterial embolization treatment on 28th November 2017. At this stage supportive care was recommended for poor liver function. In February 2018, combined immunotherapy of Pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg, q3w) and Lenvatinib (8 mg-4 mg, qd) were performed. Nine months following the treatment he had a CR and now, 22 months since the initial treatment, there is no clinical evidence of disease progression. The current overall survival is 22 months.Conclusions:HCC is a potentially lethal malignant tumor and the combination of immunotherapy plus anti-angiogenic inhibitors shows promising outcome for advanced diseases.
