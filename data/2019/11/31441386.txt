The B-mode ultrasound usually contains scattering speckle noise which reduces the detailed resolution of the target and is regarded as an intrinsic noise that interferes with diagnostic precision. The aim of this study was to classify hepatic steatosis through applying attenuation correction with a phantom to reduce speckle noise in liver ultrasound tomography in patients. This retrospective study applied three randomized groups signifying different liver statuses. A total of 114 patients' effective liver ultrasound images-30 normal, 44 fatty, and 40 cancerous-were included. The proposed depth attenuation correction method was first applied to images. Three regions of interest were manually drawn on the images. Next, five feature values for the regions of interest were calculated. Finally, the hybrid method of logistic regression and support vector machine was employed to classify the ultrasound images with 10-fold cross-validation. The accuracy, kappa statistic, and mean absolute error of the proposed hybrid method were 87.5%, 0.812, and 0.119, respectively, which were higher than those of the logistic regression method-75.0%, 0.548, and 0.280-or those of the support vector machine method-75.7%, 0.637, and 0.293-respectively. Therefore, the hybrid method has been proven to be more accurate and have better performance and less error than either single method. The hybrid method provided acceptable accuracy of classification in three liver ultrasound image groups after depth attenuation correction. In the future, the deep learning approaches may be considered for the application in classifying liver ultrasound images.
