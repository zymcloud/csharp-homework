We set out to assess feasibility and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant in 17 persons with HIV in a phase II prospective multicenter trial. The primary endpoint was 100-day nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Patients had an 8/8 HLA-matched related or at least a 7/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor. Indications for transplant were acute leukemia, myelodysplasia, and lymphoma. Conditioning was myeloablative or reduced intensity. There was no NRM at 100 days. The cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 41%. At 1 year, overall survival was 59%; deaths were from relapsed/progressive disease (n = 5), acute GVHD (n = 1), adult respiratory distress syndrome (n = 1), and liver failure (n = 1). In patients who achieved complete chimerism, cell-associated HIV DNA and inducible infectious virus in the blood were not detectable. Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 0903/AIDS Malignancy Consortium 080 was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (no. NCT01410344).
