Background and aim:Aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) is widely used in the assessment of fibrosis and cirrhosis, especially in patients with chronic hepatitis. However, the prognostic value of APRI in patients with chronic hepatitis with regard to the prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence remains controversial. The objective of this meta-analysis is to investigate the association between APRI and HCC risk on the basis of cohort studies.Methods:We systematically reviewed PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases for relevant cohort studies up to May 1, 2019. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for total and subgroup analyses were calculated with Stata 12.0 software for the assessment of the relationship between APRI and HCC risk.Results:A total of 13 studies, involving 8897 patients, were included in the meta-analysis, of which 11 explored the association between pretreatment APRI and HCC risk and four reported the relationship between posttreatment APRI and HCC risk. Pooled results showed that an elevated level of pretreatment APRI was associated with increased HCC risk (HR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.78-3.68). When stratified by hepatitis type, high pretreatment APRI predicted HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and C (CHC) but not in alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC). In the subgroup analyses of study region, cut-off value, sample size, and analysis method, the relationship between high pretreatment APRI and increased HCC risk was significant. Meanwhile, patients with a high level of posttreatment APRI suffered from high HCC risk (HR = 3.69, 95% CI: 2.52-5.42). Conclusion: Results revealed a significant association between elevated APRI and HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis, suggesting that APRI might serve as a valuable predictor for HCC risk in patients with chronic hepatitis.
