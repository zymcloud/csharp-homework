Background:To report our experiences and outcome of pancreatectomy with hepatic artery resection (PT-HAR) for advanced pancreatic head cancer.Methods:A retrospective study of clinical data from 14 patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma undergoing PT-HAR in a tertiary academic center between March 2010 and June 2017 was performed. Furthermore, a comparison in a match-pair analysis (1:3) with patients received standard pancreatectomy during the same period was conducted to evaluate the clinical outcome.Results:The PT-HAR cohort included pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 11) and total pancreatectomy (n = 3). Of them, six underwent portal/superior mesenteric vein resection and reconstruction and three underwent hepatic artery reconstruction. Four patients without arterial reconstruction developed liver perfusion failure. No perioperative mortality occurred, with a median postoperative hospital stay of 10.5 days (range 6-39). The median overall survival was 30 months (95% confidence interval 9.8-50.2 months), with the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates of 81.8%, 63.6%, and 42.4%, respectively. The matched-pair data analysis showed no significant differences between PT-HAR and standard pancreatectomy, except that liver perfusion failure occurred more frequently after PT-HAR.Conclusions:PT-HAR can be performed with acceptable morbidity, mortality, and survival for advanced pancreatic head cancer. Considering the potential risk of liver perfusion failure, only highly selected patients are eligible for PT-HAR without reconstruction.
