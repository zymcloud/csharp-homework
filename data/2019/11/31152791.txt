Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common form of chronic liver disease worldwide (about 25% of the general population) and 3-5% of patients develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by hepatocytes damage, inflammation and fibrosis, which increase the risk of developing liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of NAFLD, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype, is still incompletely understood. In this review we examine the available literature on initial mechanisms of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, deriving from toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in the liver cells is not the main determinant of lipotoxicity and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents. These lipotoxic species affect the cell behavior via multiple mechanisms, including activation of death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function and oxidative stress. The gut microbiota, which provides signals through the intestine to the liver, is also reported to play a key role in lipotoxicity. Finally, we summarize the most recent lipidomic strategies utilized to explore the liver lipidome and its modifications in the course of NALFD. These include measures of lipid profiles in blood plasma and erythrocyte membranes that can surrogate to some extent lipid investigation in the liver.
