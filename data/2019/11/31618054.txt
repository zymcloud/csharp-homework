DNA hydroxymethylation is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms mediating the development of several human cancers. This study aimed to identify key hydroxymethylated genes and transcription factors (TFs) associated with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-negative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using whole-genome DNA hydroxymethylation profiling. A total of 615 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DHMRs) were identified from AFP-negative HCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. DHMR-associated genes were significantly enriched in gene ontology functions associated with actin binding, cell leading edge, and blood vessel morphogenesis and pathways such as MAPK signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and axon guidance. Moreover, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis showed that PH domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) and SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 2 (SMARCA2) had higher degrees and were hub nodes. Furthermore, TF prediction analysis showed that TFs, such as nuclear factor I C (NFIC) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), regulated many DHMR-associated genes. Our findings reveal that key hydroxymethylated genes such as PHLPP1 and SMARCA2, as well as TFs such as NFIC and GATA, may be involved in the development of AFP-negative HCC. These molecules may be potential biomarkers for AFP-negative HCC.
