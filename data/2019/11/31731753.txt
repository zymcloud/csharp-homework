Liver cancer is one of the dominant causes of cancer-related mortality, and the survival rate of liver cancer is among the lowest for all cancers. Immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has yielded some encouraging results, but the percentage of patients responding to single-agent therapies remains low. Therefore, potential directions for improved immunotherapies include identifying new immune targets and checkpoints and customizing treatment procedures for individual patients. The development of combination therapies for HCC is also crucial and urgent and, thus, further studies are required. Mice have been utilized in immunotherapy research due to several advantages, for example, being low in cost, having high success rates for inducing tumor growth, and so on. Moreover, immune-competent mice are used in immunotherapy research to clarify the role that the immune system plays in cancer growth. In this review paper, the advantages and disadvantages of mouse models for immunotherapy, the equipment that are used for monitoring HCC, and the cell strains used for inducing HCC are reviewed.
