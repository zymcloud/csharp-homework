This study examines the ability of arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) to enhance the anti-cancer effects of fractionated X-ray irradiation of Ehrlich solid tumor-bearing mice. Swiss albino mice bearing tumors were exposed to the following: (i) Biobran treatment (40 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal injections) beginning on day 11 post-tumor cell inoculation until day 30; (ii) ionizing radiation (Rad) 2 Gy at three consecutive doses on days 12, 14 and 16; or (iii) Biobran + Rad. Final tumor weight was suppressed by 46% for Biobran, 31% for Rad and 57% for the combined treatment (Biobran + Rad) relative to control untreated mice. Biobran and Rad also arrested the hypodiploid cells in the sub-G1-phase, signifying apoptosis by +102% and +85%, respectively, while the combined treatment induced apoptosis by +123%, with similar results in the degree of DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, Biobran + Rad upregulated the relative gene expression and protein level of p53 and Bax in tumor cells, down-regulated Bcl-2 expression, and increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, with the combined treatment greater than for either treatment alone. Additionally, the combined treatment modulated the decrease in body weight, the increase in liver and spleen weight, and the elevation of liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase to be within normal values. We conclude that Biobran enhances radiation therapy-induced tumor regression by potentiating apoptosis and minimizing toxicities related to radiation therapy, suggesting that Biobran may be useful in human cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and warranting clinical trials.
