Interleukin (IL)-8 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 play key roles in tumor progression, but the relationship between IL-8 and/or ERK2 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and postoperative recurrence or survival is unclear. The expression levels of IL-8 and ERK2 in both HCC tissues and non-tumor liver tissues were analyzed using the Oncomine™ database and immunohistochemistry assay. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was then used to evaluate the expression levels of IL-8 and ERK2 in the tumor tissues of 67 patients with HCC undergoing radical hepatectomy. Pearson's correlation, Kaplan-Meier, Cox univariate and multivariate survival analyses were utilized to determine the correlation between IL-8 and ERK2 expression in HCC tissues, and their potential prognostic significance. As indicated by the data from the Oncomine™ database, and the patient samples, IL-8 and ERK2 were expressed at significantly higher levels in HCC tissues than in non-tumor liver tissues (P
