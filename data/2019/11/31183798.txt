Background:In our process of standardizing laparoscopic right-sided anatomical hepatectomy, we found several advantages of the caudate lobe-first approach. We herein describe our standardized procedure of laparoscopic right posterior sectionectomy (Lap-RPS) using this approach.Methods:Between January 2011 and January 2018, 31 patients underwent pure Lap-RPS in our hospital. The mean patient age was 68 years (range 47-85 years), and the number of male patients was more than that of female patients (64.5%). Of 31 patients, 20 had metastatic liver tumor, 7 had hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 had intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma, and 1 had hemangioma. All 31 patients had Child-Pugh class A liver function. The surgical technique was recorded on video. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analyses were applied to assess the learning curve.Results:The mean operative time was 420 min (range 263-639 min), and the mean amount of blood loss was 304 g (range 10-900 g). No procedure was converted to open surgery. Postoperative bleeding, bile leakage, hepatic failure, and mortality did not occur. CUSUM analyses showed a decrease in the operative time and blood loss after using the caudate lobe-first approach.Conclusion:Our standardized procedure of Lap-RPS using the caudate lobe-first approach is not only feasible but also expected to provide an advantage for laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy.
