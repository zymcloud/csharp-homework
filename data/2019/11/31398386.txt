Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is on the rise worldwide, but data on long-term outcomes after curative operations are limited. The primary aim of this study was to characterize the perioperative and long-term outcomes after liver resection. The secondary aim was to investigate the influence of the histologic severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and its impact on perioperative outcomes and long-term survival.Methods:A total of 996 patients who underwent liver resection for HCC in our institution were analyzed. Patients were categorized into subgroups of NAFLD vs non-NAFLD HCC based on histologic evidence of hepatic steatosis. Comparisons of patients' demographic, clinical, and surgical characteristics; postoperative complications; and survival outcomes were performed.Results:Eight hundred and forty-four patients had non-NAFLD HCC and 152 patients had NAFLD HCC. Comorbidities were significantly more common in the NAFLD group (p Conclusions:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-related HCC is associated with greater surgical morbidity and post-hepatectomy liver failure. Despite this, long-term survival outcomes are favorable compared with non-NAFLD etiologies.
