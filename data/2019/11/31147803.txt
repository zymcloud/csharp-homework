Background:We previously reported that there were potentially certain correlations between the high expression of SATB1 and the HBV infection in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, and SATB1 promoted tumor growth and metastasis in liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is internationally recognized as a contributing factor to metastasis in liver cancer. The anoikis prevention of detached malignant cancer cells is the precondition for metastasis.Aims:Our studies aimed to explore the relationship between HBV infection, SATB1 and liver cancer cell anoikis and their specific regulatory mechanisms in HBV-associated liver cancer.Methods:HepG2 cell was transiently transfected with pBlue-HBV and seven types of HBV-encoded protein plasmids. Anoikis assay and soft agarose colony formation experiment were analyzed in HepG2.2.15-SATB1 siRNA cells, HBx-overexpressing cells and HepG2-HBx-SATB1 siRNA cells. The inhibitors of signaling molecules were used to treat of HepG2-HBx cells, and then, the SATB1 expression and phosphorylation levels of signaling molecules were evaluated.Results:Our data show that the high expression of SATB1 and enhanced anoikis resistance were observed in HBV stably expressing cell line HepG2.2.15 and high metastatic potential cell line SK-HEP-1. HBV can induce SATB1 expression and suppress anoikis of unattached liver cancer cells. Moreover, SATB1 expression and anoikis resistance were mainly regulated by HBV-encoded viral protein HBx through the activation of ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways to promote metastasis of liver cancer.Conclusion:These data suggest that the HBV-encoded HBx and SATB1 may play an important role in promoting anoikis resistance and metastasis in HBV-associated liver cancer.
