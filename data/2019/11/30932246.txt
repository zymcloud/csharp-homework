Background and aim:Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B hepatocellular carcinoma are a heterogeneous population, and the classifications available could not predict the prognosis accurately. Herein, we proposed a new substage classification method, Scoring Method for Intermediate Stage, for precise classification and clinical guidance in hepatocellular carcinoma patients within Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B.Methods:A total of 1026 stage B patients of hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization as a first-line treatment in Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were retrospectively enrolled. The prognostic evaluation ability of the new substage classification criteria was analyzed, in comparison with the existing substage classification criteria.Results:Using Scoring Method for Intermediate Stage, 1026 stage B patients were subclassified into three subgroups, based on Child-Pugh score and up-to-7 grade, as B1 (scoring 2), B2 (scoring 3 or 4), and B3 (scoring 5 or 6). The median survival time of the three substages was 29 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25-36), 19 (95% CI: 16-21), and 10 (95% CI: 8-12) months, respectively. More favorable discrimination efficacy was identified by the new criteria in comparison with the existing substage classification criteria, including Bolondi, Kinki, MICAN, and Kim's criteria. Moreover, multivariate analyses indicated that the novel classification was highly associated with prognosis (Hazard ratio(s) = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, P Conclusions:Scoring Method for Intermediate Stage demonstrates satisfying capacity in classifying patients with stage B hepatocellular carcinoma and predicting prognosis.
Scoring Method for Intermediate Stage; hepatocellular carcinoma; prognosis; transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.
