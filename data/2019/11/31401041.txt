Despite the intensive efforts to identify the molecular events responsible for the emergence of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major health problem in the world. Thus, the identification of new therapeutic opportunities is a short-term necessity. These last few decades, non-coding RNAs appeared as interesting therapeutic strategies with their pleiotropic inhibitory action in the cell itself but also in recipient cells via their secretion into extracellular vesicles. This short review recapitulates recent advancements concerning non-coding RNAs and their deregulations in liver cancer.
