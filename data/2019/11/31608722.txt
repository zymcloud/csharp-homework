Background: Dendritic cells (DCs)-mediated immunotherapy has been considered as a promising antitumor method. Aspartate-β-hydroxylase (AAH) is a potential immunotherapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials & methods: C57BL/6 mice were immunized by AAH-DCs vaccine constructed ex vivo. Killing tumor cells effect of active T cells induced by AAH-DCs vaccine on HCC cells were measured in vitro and vivo. The underlying mechanism was preliminarily investigated. Results: T cells response when activated by AAH-DCs vaccine showed a significant inhibition effect on HCC cells in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice models when compared with controls. Additionally, compared with the control group, increased expressions of Caspase8, Caspase 3 and Bax, and declined expression of Bcl-2 were observed in AAH-DCs vaccine group. Conclusion: AAH-DCs vaccine could stimulate T cell responses against HCC, which was possibly achieved via pro-apoptosis mechanism.
