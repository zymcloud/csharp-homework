Spheroid culture is a widely used three-dimensional culture technology that simulates the three-dimensional structure of tumors in vivo and has been considered a good model for tumor research. However, current commercialized spheroid culture tools have the shortcomings of high cost or relatively poor spheroid-forming results for some special cells. To solve such problems, we designed a 3D printed, reusable, stamp-like resin mold that could shape microstructures for spheroid culture of tumor cells on the surface of agarose substrate in a 96-well plate. We applied this homemade three-dimensional culture tool in spheroid formation for hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The experimental data show that the effect of spheroid culture on four hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in our homemade spheroid culture plate is better than that of the commercialized ultralow attachment spheroid culture plate, and compared to two-dimensional culture, three-dimensional culture improves cell functions. In addition, the drug-sensitive test based on patient-derived hepatocellular carcinoma cells showed a different pattern between spheroid and two-dimensional cultures. In conclusion, our spheroid culture tool is characterized by its low cost, reusability, low cell consumption, convenience in medium exchange, and good effect of spheroid formation, suggesting that this technique could be widely used in individual treatment and high-throughput drug screening.
