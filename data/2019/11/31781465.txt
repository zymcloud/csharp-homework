Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) most commonly develops in patients with liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C and B virus. HCC is the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis. The lungs, bone, and lymph nodes are frequent sites of metastasis of HCC.Patients and methods:We present a case of solitary skull metastasis as the first symptom of HCC. A literature review with regard to HCC skull metastasis was undertaken.Results:This patient had HCC based on chronic hepatitis C. He presented with an erosive lesion masquerading as a scalp lipoma resulting in hepatocellular carcinoma with retrograde reflux and sinus metastases. The lesion was ultimately resected, but the patient died within one week from liver failure. Seventeen similar cases were found in the literature. Median age of the patients was 58 years with 95% being male and 35% having viral hepatitis. Surgery was the preferred treatment with chemotherapy and radiation being other options. Outcome was acceptable but baseline liver disease is a limiting factor.Discussion:Cranial metastases of HCC are rare but should be considered in patients with chronic hepatitis C presenting with scalp skin lesions.
