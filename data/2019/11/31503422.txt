Background and objectives:The roles of microRNA(miR)-106b-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. We aimed here to investigate the clinical significance of miR-106b-5p expression in HCC and its underlying mechanisms.Methods:Expression levels of miR-106b-5p in 108 HCC clinical samples by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. Associations of miR-106b-5p expression with various clinicopathological features and patients' prognosis were evaluated by Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional regression analyses, respectively. The target gene of miR-106b-5p and their functions in HCC cells were investigated by luciferase reporter, CCK-8, and Transwell Matrigel invasion assays.Results:miR-106b-5p expression was markedly higher in HCC tissues than in noncancerous adjacent liver tissues (P Conclusions:miR-106b-5p may serve as a potent prognostic marker for tumor recurrence and survival of HCC patients. miR-106b-5p may exert an oncogenic role in HCC via regulating its target gene RUNX3.
