Studies have reported dysregulation of TIPRL, LC3 and CD133 in liver cancer tissues. However, their respective relationships to liver cancer and roles as biomarkers for prognosis and diagnosis of liver cancer have never been studied. Here we report that the level of TIPRL is significantly correlated with levels of LC3 (Spearman r = 0.9) and CD133 (r = 0.7) in liver cancer tissues. We observed significant upregulations of TIPRL, LC3 and CD133 in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) compared with adjacent normal tissues. Importantly, TIPRL, tested among additional variables, showed a significant impact on the prognosis of HCC patients. TIPRL knockdown significantly reduced expressions of LC3, CD133, stemness-related genes, as well as viability and stemness of liver cancer cell-lines, which were promoted by ectopic TIPRL expression. Either alone or as a combination, TIPRL, LC3 and CD133 showed significant values of area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity/specificity in early liver cancer tissues. Furthermore, the statistical association and the diagnostic efficacies of TIPRL, LC3 and CD133 in HCC tissues were confirmed in a different IHC cohort. This data demonstrates that the complex involvement of TIPRL/LC3/CD133 in liver cancer aggressiveness can together or individually serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection of liver cancer.
