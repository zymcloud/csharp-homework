Purpose:To characterize the effects of disease type and clinical characteristics on the pharmacokinetics of siltuximab, an IL-6 inhibiting monoclonal antibody.Methods:Siltuximab pharmacokinetic data were combined from seven phase I/II clinical trials. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to characterize changes in siltuximab disposition with disease type, albumin, liver and renal function, and patient demographics.Results:A total of 7761 concentrations from 460 participants were used in the study. The data were well described by a two-compartment model. Castleman's disease, healthy volunteer status, albumin, and ALT were independent predictors of clearance. Monte Carlo simulations of the final model for an 11 mg/kg dose resulted in a longer median half-life for healthy volunteers (24.5 days) as compared to Castleman's disease (19.1 days) and other tumor types (22.2 days). Clearance varied 1.8-fold over the range of albumin values seen in the study (1.5-5.2 g/dL), while ALT resulted in minimal changes in clearance.Conclusions:Albumin and disease state are important factors for siltuximab disposition and will likely need to be considered for dosing in future therapeutic applications.
