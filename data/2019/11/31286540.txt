Hepatic copper levels differ among patients with Wilson disease (WD) and normal individuals depending on the dietary intake, copper bioavailability, and genetic factors. Copper chloride (CuCl2 ) caused dose-dependent reduction in cell viability of human teratocarcinoma (HepG2) cell line, measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of CuCl2 in log doses and maximum cell viability reduction was recorded at 15 Âµg/mL. Toxic dose of CuCl2 is potent inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Apoptosis as a pattern of cell death was confirmed through sub-G1 fraction and morphological changes such as mitochondrial depolarization, endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomal destabilization, phosphatidylserine translocation, and DNA damage. Our transcriptional and translational results strongly support apoptotic cell death. Using the available data present in dbSNP and bioinformatics tools, three nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) were identified as deleterious, reducing the stability of protein ATP7B. Structural analysis of native and mutant ATP7B proteins was investigated using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) approach. Mutation in ATP7B gene might disturb the structural conformation and catalytic function of the ATP7B protein may be inducing WD. Hence, excess dietary intake of copper chloride must be avoided for safety of health to prevent from WD.
