Worldwide, approximately 10% of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people are also chronically coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV infection has a poor prognosis in HIV-positive people and has been documented by an increased risk of developing chronic HBV infection (CHB), progression to liver fibrosis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, in HIV patients, HBV-resolved infection is often associated with the appearance of HBV-DNA, which configures occult HBV infection (OBI) as a condition to be explored in coinfected patients. In this narrative review we summarize the main aspects of HBV infection in HIV-positive patients, emphasizing the importance of carefully considering the coinfected patient in the context of therapeutic strategies of antiretroviral therapy.
