Liver transplantation is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures for the treatment of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Post-transplantation complications include vascular, nonvascular, and biliary. Common imaging techniques used to evaluate the hepatic graft are ultrasonography (US), CT, MR imaging, cholangiography, angiography, and scintigraphy. The purposes of this pictorial review are to review imaging findings of complications of liver transplantation and provide a framework for early detection of post-surgical complications.
