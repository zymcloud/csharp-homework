Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), as a typical transcription inhibitory factor of E-cadherin, plays a major role in stimulating the invasion and metastasis of tumors via modulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signal. However, its function and modulatory mechanisms in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remain unclear. In this study, silencing ZEB1 significantly reduced EC cell migration, invasion, and metastasis, as well as enhanced the sensitivity of EC cells to cisplatin (cDDP) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism analysis indicated that ZEB1 interacts with hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and co-localizes in the nucleus. In addition, ZEB1 as a transcription factor binds to the promoter of HDGF to stimulate HDGF transcription. Furthermore, suppression of HDGF in ZEB1-overexpressed EC cells not only reduced the expression of β-catenin, TCF4, and ZEB1, but also repressed β-catenin translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and further downregulated the combination with TCF4. Interestingly, the β-catenin/TCF4 signaling feedback stimulates ZEB1 transcription and therefore constitutes a positive feedback loop. In clinical samples, ZEB1 positively correlates with HDGF expression, and co-expression of ZEB1 and HDGF promotes the pathogenesis of EC. In summary, our study demonstrated that the positive feedback loop of ZEB1/HDGF/β-catenin/TCF4 plays an unfavorable role in the metastasis of endometrial carcinoma.
