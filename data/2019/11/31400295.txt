Background:Post-treatment decline in serum alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) levels has been shown to predict the treatment efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We explored whether a decline in AFP levels was also associated with treatment outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with advanced HCC.Methods:We reviewed all patients who received ICI therapy for advanced HCC. AFP response was evaluated in patients with the pretreatment AFP level of >20 ng/mL. We defined early AFP response as a >20% decline in serum AFP levels within the first 4 weeks of treatment initiation relative to pretreatment levels. We then studied whether early AFP response was associated with treatment outcomes.Results:Sixty patients were enrolled in this study; 43 of them were evaluable for early AFP response. The objective response rate of early AFP responders was significantly higher than that of early AFP nonresponders (73% vs. 14%, P Conclusion:Early AFP response was associated with higher treatment efficacy of ICIs for advanced HCC. Additional validation studies are nonetheless warranted.
