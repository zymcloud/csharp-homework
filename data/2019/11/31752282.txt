To discover novel potent cytotoxic diterpenoids, a series of hybrids of dehydroabietic acid containing 1,2,3-triazole moiety were designed and synthesized. The target compounds were characterized by means of FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ESI-MS and elemental analysis techniques. The in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated by standard MTT (methyl thiazolytetrazolium) assay against CNE-2 (nasopharynx), HepG2 (liver), HeLa (epithelial cervical), BEL-7402 (liver) human carcinoma cell lines and human normal liver cell (HL-7702). The screening results revealed that most of the hybrids showed significantly improved cytotoxicity over parent compound DHAA. Among them, [1-(3-fluorobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-yl]dehydroabietic acid methyl ester (3c), and [1-(2-nitrobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-yl]dehydroabietic acid methyl ester (3k) displayed better antiproliferative activity with IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values of 5.90 ± 0.41 and 6.25 ± 0.37 µM toward HepG2 cells compared to cisplatin, while they exhibited lower cytotoxicity against HL-7702. Therefore, the 1,2,3-triazole-hybrids could be a promising strategy for the synthesis of antitumor diterpenoids and it also proved the essential role of 1,2,3-triazole moiety of DHAA in the biological activity.
