Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth-most common malignancy worldwide. Multiple previous studies have assessed the relationship between TM6SF2 gene polymorphism and the risk of developing HCC, with discrepant conclusions reached. To assess the association of TM6SF2 rs58542926 T/C gene polymorphism with liver cancer, we performed the current meta-analysis.Methods:This study queried the MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases from inception to April 2019. Case-control studies assessing the relationship between TM6SF2 rs5854292 locus polymorphism and liver cancer were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Stata 12.0 software was employed for data analysis.Results:A total of 5 articles, encompassing 6873 patients, met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Statistical analysis showed that the TM6SF2 gene polymorphism was significantly associated with liver cancer in the allele contrast, dominant, recessive and over dominant models (T vs C, OR = 1.621, 95%CI 1.379-1.905; CT + TT vs CC. OR = 1.541, 95%CI 1.351-1.758; TT vs CT + CC, OR = 2.897, 95%CI 1.690-4.966; CC + TT vs TC, OR = 0.693, 95%CI 0.576-0.834). The Egger's test revealed no significant publication bias.Conclusion:The present findings suggest a significant association of TM6SF2 gene polymorphism with HCC risk in the entire population studied.
