Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is an intermediate in the life cycle of HBV. HBV-encoded X protein (HBx), a key viral oncoprotein, can be specifically ubiquitylated by male specific lethal 2 (MSL2), which causes upregulation of HBx activity and promotes transcription, cell proliferation and tumor growth. The present study compared the levels of cccDNA, MSL2 mRNA and HBx mRNA in tumor and peri-tumor tissues, and clarified the effect of antiviral therapy on these indicators. Levels of intrahepatic cccDNA, MSL2 mRNA and HBx mRNA were determined using quantitative PCR in patients with HBV-associated HCC who had undergone liver surgery. A total of 50 patients were included in the present study. Prior to surgery, 31 patients had undergone antiviral treatment. Intrahepatic cccDNA levels were significantly higher in the tumor tissues compared with the peri-tumor tissues (P=0.001), particularly in the hepatitis B e antigen-positive (P=0.008), tumor recurrence (P=0.002) and
