Gold nanoparticles are the most promising candidate in cancer treatment due to their physiochemical properties and increased use in photothermal therapy (PTT). In the present study, spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were synthesized using citrate reduction method. The particles were then characterized using UV-VIS spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope. A hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was incubated with sorafenib and/or non-irradiated or laser-irradiated AuNPs for 48 hrs. The cytotoxic effect of different treatment modalities was determined using MTT assay. Furthermore, apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide, as well as estimating the level of caspases. Results showed that AuNPs and sorafenib reduced HepG2 cell viability, and the cytotoxicity was associated with increased release of LDH in the culture medium. The recorded cytotoxicity was attributed to enhanced apoptosis as revealed by increased cellular caspases (3, 8 and 9), that was further confirmed by flow cytometry. The most notable cytotoxic effect was recorded when combining sorafenib with laser-irradiated AuNPs. In conclusion, a synergistic cytotoxic effect was observed between sorafenib and laser-irradiated AuNPs against the growth of HepG2, suggesting the potential substitution of large toxic doses of sorafenib by lower doses in combination with photothermal therapy.
