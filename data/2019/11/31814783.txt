Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the West. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive form of NAFLD and can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and is associated with increased cardiovascular risks. Multiple components and risk factors are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH. Optimal therapy has not yet been found, but many advances have been made with the discovery of potential therapeutic options. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of approved, studied, and upcoming treatment options for NAFLD and NASH. Non-pharmacologic therapy (lifestyle modifications and bariatric surgery) and pharmacologic therapy are both reviewed. Pharmacologic therapy target components thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease process including insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid metabolism, and fibrosis are reviewed in this paper. Results of the emerging treatment targets in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are also included.
