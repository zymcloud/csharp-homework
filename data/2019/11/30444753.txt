The human papilloma virus (HPV) as a major causative agent of different cancers is under investigation globally. In this study, we aim to investigate HPV infection in different cytological and pathological stages by different molecular methods, and then the viral genome integration of HPV-16 and -18 is determined by a specific real-time PCR method. The study included women who underwent liquid-based cytology. HPV PCR was conducted by MY09/11 universal primers, HPV genotyping was performed by INNO-LiPA HPV genotyping assay, and the viral genome status was defined by two real-time PCR assays. The statistics were calculated by SPSS v.22 software. In 1668 women included in the study with mean age±std. deviation of 35.6±0.7, HPV was detected in 632 (38%) participants. Following genotyping analyses, 16 HPV types and 713 strains were detected. HPV-16 and HPV-18 from high-risk types and HPV-6 and HPV-11 from low-risk types were the dominant types. We found HPV-16 strains in mixed form (58.8%), and of the HPV-18 strains, the episomal form was prevalent (92.9%). The statistics revealed significant presence of HPV-6 and within normal limits cases; HPV-16 and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; HPV-33 as well as HPV-39 and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; HPV-6 and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; and HPV-35 as well as HPV-56 and squamous cell carcinoma. Our study showed high prevalence of HPV in low-grade cervical lesions, although it is associated with higher grades. The HPV molecular testing extra to cytology is recommended. HPV-16 and HPV-18 have different programs in genome integration in infected cells.
