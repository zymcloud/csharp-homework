Background:The lack of predictive biomarkers or test systems contributes to high failure rates of systemic therapy in metastasized colorectal carcinoma, accounting for a still unfavorable prognosis. Here, we present an ex vivo functional assay to measure drug-response based on a tissue slice culture approach.Methods:Tumor tissue slices of hepatic metastases of nine patients suffering from colorectal carcinoma were cultivated for 72 h and treated with different concentrations of the clinically relevant drugs Oxaliplatin, Cetuximab and Pembrolizumab. Easy to use, objective and automated analysis routines based on the Halo platform were developed to measure changes in proliferative activity and the morphometric make-up of the tumor. Apoptotic indices were assessed semiquantitatively.Results:Untreated tumor tissue slices showed high morphological comparability with the original "in vivo"-tumor, preserving proliferation and stromal-tumor interactions. All but one patients showed a dosage dependent susceptibility to treatment with Oxaliplatin, whereas only two patients showed responses to Cetuximab and Pembrolizumab, respectively. Furthermore, we identified possible non-responders to Cetuximab therapy in absence of RAS-mutations.Conclusions:This is the first time to demonstrate feasibility of the tissue slice culture approach for metastatic tissue of colorectal carcinoma. An automated readout of proliferation and tumor-morphometry allows for quantification of drug susceptibility. This strongly indicates a potential value of this technique as a patient-specific test-system of targeted therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. Co-clinical trials are needed to customize for clinical application and to define adequate read-out cut-off values.
