A 47-year-old woman with a history of known gallstone disease presented with worsening post-prandial right upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, abdominal bloating, and nausea. An ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis of cholelithiasis. During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, an accessory liver lobe attached to the anterior wall of the gallbladder was incidentally found. An accessory liver lobe is a rare anatomical variation that mostly remains clinically asymptomatic. Since hepatocellular carcinoma can rarely develop in an accessory liver lobe, intraoperative complete resection should be considered for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.
