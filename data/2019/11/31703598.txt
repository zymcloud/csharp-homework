Background:Increased liver stiffness exerts a detrimental role in driving hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) malignancy and progression, and indicates a high risk of unfavorable outcomes. However, it remains largely unknown how liver matrix stiffness as an independent cue triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and facilitates HCC metastasis.Methods:Buffalo rat HCC models with different liver stiffness backgrounds and an in vitro Col I-coated cell culture system with tunable stiffness were used in the study to explore the effects of matrix stiffness on EMT occurrence and its underlying molecular mechanism. Clinical significance of liver stiffness and key molecules required for stiffness-induced EMT were validated in HCC cohorts with different liver stiffness.Results:HCC xenografts grown in higher stiffness liver exhibited worse malignant phenotypes and higher lung metastasis rate, suggesting that higher liver stiffness promotes HCC invasion and metastasis. Cell tests in vitro showed that higher matrix stiffness was able to strikingly strengthen malignant phenotypes and independently induce EMT occurrence in HCC cells, and three signaling pathways converging on Snail expression participated in stiffness-mediated effect on EMT including integrin-mediated S100A11 membrane translocation, eIF4E phosphorylation, and TGF β1 autocrine. Additionally, the key molecules required for stiffness-induced EMT were highly expressed in tumor tissues of HCC patients with higher liver stiffness and correlated with poor tumor differentiation and higher recurrence.Conclusions:Higher matrix stiffness as an initiator triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells independently, and three signaling pathways converging on Snail expression contribute to this pathological process. This work highlights a significant role of biomechanical signal in triggering EMT and facilitating HCC invasion and metastasis.
