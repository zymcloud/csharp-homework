Background & aims:It is unclear if hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk declines over time after hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication. We analyzed changes in HCC annual incidence over time following HCV eradication and identified dynamic markers of HCC risk.Methods:We identified 48,135 patients who initiated HCV antiviral treatment from 2000 through 2015 and achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) in the Veterans Health Administration (29,033 treated with direct-acting antiviral [DAA] agents and 19,102 treated with interferon-based regimens). Patients were followed after treatment until February 14, 2019 (average 5.4 years), during which 1509 incident HCCs were identified.Results:Among patients with cirrhosis before treatment with DAAs (n = 9784), those with pre-SVR fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scores ≥3.25 had a higher annual incidence of HCC (3.66%/year) than those with FIB-4 scores Conclusions:Patients with cirrhosis before an SVR to treatment for HCV infection continue to have a high risk for HCC (>2%/year) for many years, even if their FIB-4 score decreases, and should continue surveillance. Patients without cirrhosis but with FIB-4 scores ≥3.25 have a high enough risk to merit HCC surveillance, especially if FIB-4 remains ≥3.25 post-SVR.
