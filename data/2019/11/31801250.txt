This study aims to investigate the anticancer effect of Oroxin B (OB) both in vitro and in vivo, and the molecular mechanism involved in microRNA-221 and the PI3K/Akt/PTEN pathway through modulation of apoptosis in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DEN-induced rats and HepG2 cells based on the microfluidic chip were employed, while the mRNA and protein expression of microRNA-221, PI3K, p-Akt and PTEN were evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Based on Microfluidic Chip and DEN-induced rat model, OB effectively exerts anti-liver cancer effect both in vitro and in vivo, and the expression of miR-221 in OB treated groups was significantly lower than that in the control group (** p < 0.01). The RT-PCR and Western blot results suggested the PI3K mRNA and protein in OB treated groups were both lower than those in control group and indicated the overexpression of PTEN. Therefore, OB effectively exerts anticancer effects by positively regulating the PTEN gene and then inactivating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through down-regulating the expression of the microRNA-221, thereby inducing apoptosis of liver cancer cells. This study offers a theoretical evidence for further development and clinical guidance of OB as an anti-tumor agent.
