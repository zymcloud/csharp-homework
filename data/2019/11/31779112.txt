Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rising epidemic worldwide and will be the leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplant within the next decade. NAFLD is considered as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Behaviors, such as a sedentary lifestyle and consuming a Western diet, have led to substantial challenges in managing NAFLD patients. With no curative pharmaceutical therapies, lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and exercise, that ultimately lead to weight loss remain the only effective therapy for NAFLD. Multiple diets, including low-carbohydrate, low-fat, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean (MD) diets, have been evaluated. NAFLD patients have shown better outcomes with a modified diet, such as the MD diet, where patients are encouraged to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and olive oil. It is increasingly clear that a personalized approach to managing NAFLD patients, based on their preferences and needs, should be implemented. In our review, we cover NAFLD management, with a specific focus on dietary patterns and their components. We emphasize the successful approaches highlighted in recent studies to provide recommendations that health care providers could apply in managing their NAFLD patients.
