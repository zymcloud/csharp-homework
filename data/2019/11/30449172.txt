The present study aims to evaluate phytochemical and pharmacological potential of total protoflavones from Macrothelypteris viridifrons. In the phytochemical study, an HPLC analysis method was established, and the optimal extraction and purification conditions were analyzed. The extractive condition was optimized as follows: the backflow extraction with 20 folds of 70% ethanol at 80â—¦C for 1 h twice. Moreover, by combining the alkali-extraction and acid-precipitation method with the macroporous resin purification technology, the final purity rate of total protoflavones was no less than 54.85%. In the pharmacological study, the total protoflavones from M. viridifrons showed a significant tumor-inhibitory effect in the H22 hepatoma cells transplantation model with a higher inhibitory rate of 55.76% in high dosage (100mg/kg) treatment group compared with the positive control group (20 mg/kg cyclophosphamide). Taken of all, these results support that protoflavones are the material basis of M. viridifrons as an anticancer folk medicine.
