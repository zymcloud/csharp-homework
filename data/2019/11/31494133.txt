Ionizing radiation (IR) resistance and toxicity to normal cells are the main problems in radiotherapy for cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) could inhibit effectively IR-induced damage to mouse normal hepatic cells AML-12, and improve dramatically the radiosensitivity of mouse hepatoma cells H22 to 60CoÎ³. In addition, the different effects of EGCG and underlying molecular mechanisms based on microRNA-34a (miR-34a) and apoptosis-related proteins were investigated by cells viability analysis, quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot and cells transfection. The results indicated EGCG played the key role of radiosensitization on H22 cells by activating the miR-34a/Sirt1/p53 signaling pathway. Besides, EGCG could down-regulate the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and up-regulate the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3 in H22 cells. Interestingly, EGCG showed contrary results on AML-12 cells. Therefore, radiation protection and radiosensitization of EGCG were associated with apoptosis regulated by miR-34a/Sirt1/p53 signaling pathway.
