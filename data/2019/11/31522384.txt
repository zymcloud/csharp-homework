Purpose:To determine the treatment outcome and prognostic factors for survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and macrovascular tumor thrombosis (MTT).Methods:Between January 2010 and December 2018, 66 patients diagnosed with HCC and MTT, who received specific treatment were included. Various clinical and imaging data, treatment methods, outcomes, prognostic factors, and overall survival were evaluated. Outcomes were compared with those of 24 patients treated with supportive care.Results:Most patients with HCC and MTT showed disease progression (80.3%) and a low 5-year survival rate. The median survival time after treatment was 13 months (vs. supportive care group 3 months, p 1 segment (p = 0.039), presence of ascites (p = 0.009) and among treatment methods, systemic therapy alone (p = 0.007), and supportive care (p Conclusions:Although most patients with HCC and MTT showed disease progression, median survival time was significantly longer than that with supportive care. Main branch and > 1 segment involvement of MTT and presence of ascites were significant prognostic factors for poor survival. Combined local and systemic therapy over systemic therapy alone are recommended for patients with these advanced stage HCCs.
