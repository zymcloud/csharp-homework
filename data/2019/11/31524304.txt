Background:Lamivudine and entecavir reduce hepatic events and death in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with cirrhosis, but the impact of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is less well studied.Aim:To investigate the effectiveness of TDF therapy in CHB patients with cirrhosis.Methods:We studied TDF-treated and untreated CHB patients with cirrhosis from three tertiary centres. TDF cohort included consecutive patients who received TDF for â‰¥12 months while the untreated cohort were historical controls receiving routine clinical care prior to the availability of anti-viral therapy. The primary outcome was 5-year cumulative probability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with secondary outcomes being hepatic decompensation and death or liver transplantation (LT).Results:A total of 1088 (291 untreated and 797 TDF-treated) patients were included in the study. Five-year cumulative probabilities in untreated vs TDF-treated cohorts were 14.9% vs 9.8% for HCC (P = .07), 22.3% vs 5.9% for decompensation (P Conclusions:Compared to untreated patients, TDF treatment reduces the risks of HCC, hepatic decompensation and death in CHB patients with cirrhosis at 5 years.
