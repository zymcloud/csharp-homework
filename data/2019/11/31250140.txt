We report an extremely rare case of splenic artery arising from hepatic artery proper in a patient with celiacomesenteric trunk variant. This anatomical variation was detected angiographically during hepatic mapping prior to transarterial radioembolization (TARE) for hepatocellular carcinoma in an 84-year-old man. TARE of hepatic tumors is one of the frequent procedures done by interventional radiologists. The identification of such rare vascular aberrations is of great importance not only in current interventional radiology procedures such as radioembolization but also in surgery and diagnostic radiology. To the best of our knowledge, this vascular variant is a novel discovery.
