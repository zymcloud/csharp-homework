The characteristics of the PM2.5 concentration in surgical smoke produced by operating on different human tissues during hemihepatectomy were explored to provide a reference for protective measures. Our results showed that the highest concentration of PM2.5 produced by the electrosurgical knife was the liver tissue, followed by muscle, adipose, and vascular tissue. When the single-layer disposable medical mask, double-layer disposable medical mask, and surgical particulate respirator were used to cover the sampling port of the detector, the PM2.5 concentration for all tissue types could be reduced by approximately 40%, 55% and 75%, respectively. In the liver, the average concentration of PM2.5 produced by the ultrasonic scalpel was approximately twice that produced by the electrosurgical knife, suggesting that the air pollution around the chief surgeon caused by the ultrasonic scalpel is more serious than that caused by the electrosurgical knife. Much more protective work should be given for the liver-related surgery.
