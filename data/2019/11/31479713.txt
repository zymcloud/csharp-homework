The aim of this work was to evaluate whether oral administration of Eruca vesicaria, a species of rocket cultivated in Argentina, could modify cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced genotoxicity through modulation of hepatic ABC transporters. Daily oral administration of E. vesicaria fresh leaves juice (1.0, 1.4 and 2.0 g/kg) for 14 days did not alter genotoxicity biomarkers -alkaline comet assay and micronucleus test -in neither male nor female mice. Instead, repeated intake of this cruciferous decreased CP-induced DNA damage dose-dependently and it caused hepatic overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp; 1.4 and 2.0 g/kg) and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2; 2.0 g/kg), but not breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp). The antigenotoxic effect of E. vesicaria was prevented by 50 mg/kg verapamil (P-gp inhibitor) or 10 mg/kg indomethacin (MRP2 inhibitor). In turn, CP-induced cytotoxicity (10 mM, 24 h) on human hepatoma cells (HepG2/C3A) was significantly reduced by preincubation with E. vesicaria (1.4 mg/ml; 48 h); this effect was absent when CP was coincubated with 35 μM verapamil, 80 μM indomethacin or 10 μM KO-143 (BCRP inhibitor). Altogether, these results allow us to demonstrate that repeated intake of E. vesicaria exhibited antigenotoxicity, at least in part, by induction of hepatic ABC transporters in vivo in mice as well as in vitro in human liver cells. This could account for other diet-drug interactions.
