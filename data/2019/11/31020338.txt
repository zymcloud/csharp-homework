Purpose:To identify independent confounding variables of gadoxetate-enhanced hepatobiliary-phase liver MRI using multiple regression analysis.Materials and methods:The institutional review board generally approved retrospective analyses and all patients provided written informed consent. One hundred ten patients who underwent a standardized 3.0-T gadoxetate-enhanced liver MRI between November 2008 and June 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The gadoxetate liver enhancement normalized to enhancement in the erector spinae muscle (relative signal enhancement, SE) was related to biochemical laboratory parameters and descriptive patient characteristics (patient age, body mass index) using non-parametric univariate correlation analysis followed by a multiple linear regression model.Results:Using univariate statistics, relative SE was inversely correlated with patient age, ALP, AST, total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase, INR, model of end-stage liver disease score, and proportionally with albumin and hemoglobin (all p Conclusion:A multiple regression analysis showed that high total bilirubin, low serum albumin, or advanced age was associated with low hepatobiliary-phase gadoxetate parenchymal liver enhancement. In these patients, the lower contrast-to-noise ratio might impair diagnostic evaluation of non-enhancing liver lesions (e.g., HCC, liver metastasis).Key points:• A multiple regression analysis identified independent confounding variables of hepatobiliary-phase gadoxetate liver enhancement. • High bilirubin, low albumin, or advanced age was associated with low enhancement. • Diagnostic evaluation might be hampered in these patients.
