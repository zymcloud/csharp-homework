The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is mainly due to cancer metastasis. Methionine adenosyltransferase 2β (MAT2B) encodes a regulatory subunit (β) for methionine adenosyltransferase. Previous studies reveal that MAT2B provides a growth advantage for HCC, but its role in metastasis is unknown. This study showed that both in the xenograft zebra fish model and in the lung metastasis model in nude mice, the stable inhibition of MAT2B could suppress the metastasis of HCC cancer cells. Silencing of MAT2B in HCC cell lines could remarkably inhibit migration and invasion. By analysis of human phospho-kinase array membranes, we found several differentially expressed proteins, including phosphor-AKT, phospho-EGFR, phospho-Src family, phospho-FAK, phospho-STAT3 and phospho-ERK. We further confirmed the change of these EGFR pathway-related proteins was in accordance with MAT2B expression pattern through immunoblotting test. Finally, we found that MAT2B was overexpressed in HCC caner tissues and correlated with poor prognosis for HCC patients in clinical manifestation. Our study demonstrated that silencing of MAT2B could suppress liver cancer cell migration and invasion through the inhibition of EGFR signaling, which suggested that MAT2B might serve as a new prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.
