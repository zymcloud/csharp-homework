Both non eco- and eco-friendly carriers were utilized for accelerating the dyeing rate of polyethylene terephthalate fabrics (PET) dyed with disperse dyes at 100 Â°C. Fastness properties of the dyed fabrics showed good and excellent results. Finally, the prepared disperse dyes 1 and 2 showed potent anti-tumor cytotoxic activity in vitro using MCF-7 cells (human breast cancer cell line), HepG-2 cells (human Hepatocellular carcinoma), HCT-116 (colon carcinoma), A-549 cells (Lung carcinoma cell line), and anti-oxidant activities.
