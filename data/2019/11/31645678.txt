Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent malignant tumour with high global morbidity and mortality associated with its multiple aetiologies, poor prognosis, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and high rate of recurrence. Here, we evaluated a gene therapy strategy that targets HCC using the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSVtk/GCV) suicide gene system in HCC cell lines and in an in vivo human HCC xenograft mouse model. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-modified liposomes were used for targeted gene delivery to the tumour tissue, and the survivin promoter was used to drive HSVtk expression in HCC cells. Our results showed that the survivin promoter was specifically activated in tumour cells, and HSVtk was expressed selectively in tumour cells. In combination with GCV treatment, HSVtk expression resulted in the inhibition of HCC cell proliferation via enhanced apoptosis. In addition, tail vein injection of ApoE-HSVtk significantly suppressed the growth of xenograft tumours through an apoptosis-dependent pathway and extended the survival time of tumour-bearing mice. In summary, this study illustrates an effective cancer-specific gene therapy strategy for HCC that can be further developed for future clinical trials.
