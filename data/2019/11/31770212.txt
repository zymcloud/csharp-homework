Rationale:Bladder cancer (BC) is commonly diagnosed in the urinary system and the most common subtype is transitional urothelial carcinoma (TCC). Even with the best treatment, tumor recurrence and metastases always occur. While clinicians commonly observe the metastases to pelvic lymph nodes, liver, lung, and bone, it may infrequently spread to some uncommon locations.Patient concerns:The patient was a 67-year-old man with a diagnosis of high-grade TCC with squamous differentiation in the bladder and prostate. Subsequently, radical cystoprostatectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were performed. However, he felt intermittent right scrotal pain about 1 year later.Diagnosis:Ultrasound strongly suggested a testicular neoplasm of right testis, but the left was normal.Interventions:The patient underwent a right radical orchiectomy and histopathology confirmed testicular metastatic neoplasm from bladder. Moreover, further examination with positron emission tomography revealed no visible distant spread of the urothelial carcinoma.Outcomes:No signs of tumor recurrence or distant metastasis were visible under follow-up 1 year after radical orchiectomy.Lessons:Testicular mass may be metastatic tumor during follow-up for patients who were diagnosed as BC, especially for TCC with variant histology. The reason of this could be explained of residual micrometastases after surgery and need more examination to discover local micrometastases to apply more aggressive treatment.
