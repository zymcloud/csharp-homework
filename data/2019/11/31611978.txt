Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) has been reported to be correlated with cancer. The present study investigated the prognostic values of PPIA expression levels in cancer by comparing different types of cancer using databases. High expression levels of PPIA were observed in 17 out of 17 cancer types compared with normal adjacent tissues. High expression levels of PPIA were associated with decreased overall survival in low grade glioma, acute myeloid leukemia, lung adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC). The prognostic effect of PPIA expression in LIHC was independent of tumor grade. High expression levels of PPIA were of particular prognostic value in stage 3, American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor 3, hepatitis B virus negative and sorafenib-administered subgroups in LIHC. The expression level of PPIA was significantly associated with levels of basigin and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, which may be major effectors of PPIA in the progression of the cancer.
