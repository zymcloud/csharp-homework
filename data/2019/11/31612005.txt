Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and protein kinase Cα (PRKCA) in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), and to determine the association between the combined expression of these two proteins and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with LADC. The expression of HDGF and PRKCA mRNA was assessed by GEO database analysis, and HDGF and PRKCA protein levels were examined by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray. High HDGF and PRKCA expression was observed in LADC tissue compared to normal samples, and increased HDGF and PRKCA expression was associated with AJCC clinical stage, tumor classification, node classification, and lymph node metastasis. GEO database analysis revealed no significant differences between HDGF mRNA and PRKCA mRNA in LADC tissue. However, high PRKCA protein expression was associated with high HDGF protein expression, and patients with high HDGF and PRKCA expression exhibited poorer overall survival rates than patients with low expression levels of the two proteins. The results of the present study suggest that upregulation of both HDGF and PRKCA may be an unfavourable factor for lung adenocarcinoma progression.
