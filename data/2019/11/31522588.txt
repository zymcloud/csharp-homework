Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) afflicts more than half a million people each year worldwide. It was reported that circ_0015756 was up-regulated in HCC, but the mechanism did not extensively studied. Methods: we collected 24 paired cancerous and noncancerous liver tissues surgically resected from HCC patients. HCC cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis in vitro were evaluated using MTT assay, Transwell assay, scratch test and Annexin-V/PI staining respectively. Interactions between circ_0015756 and miR-7, miR-7 and FAK were further validated by the luciferase reporter assay. Tumor xenografts of HCC cells with circ_0015756 knockdown were established in nude mice. Results: The expression level of circ_0015756 was increased and the expression level of miR-7 was diminished in cancerous liver tissues relative to noncancerous liver tissues. Circ_0015756 knockdown was shown to increase the expression of miR-7, reduce the proliferation, invasion, migration and resistance to apoptosis, and down-regulate the expression of FAK in HCC. We found miR-7 impaired expression of FAK to inhibit HCC cells, suggesting that miR-7 is responsible for the dysfunction of FAK. Importantly, we showed circ_0015756 could up-regulate FAK via targeting miR-7. These in vitro findings were reproduced in vivo that circ_0015756 knockdown decreased HCC xenograft growth. Conclusion: Our present study reveals a model of HCC development that is composed of circ_0015756, miR-7 and FAK. Modulation of their levels exhibits a promise in the treatment of HCC.
