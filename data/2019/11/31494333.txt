Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most prevalent cancer worldwide. High tumour recurrence is the most common cause of the impaired 5-year survival rate of 26-58% after hepatectomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of preoperative dynamic liver function on long-term outcome.Materials and methods:A total of 146 patients that underwent curative resection for HCC at our department from 2005 to 2016 were analysed. Univariate analysis was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable analysis was carried out with Cox regression.Results:The cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates were 83%, 42% and 14%, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression yielded that overall survival depends on disease recurrence, haemoglobin, number of tumours, liver cirrhosis, lymphatic vessel invasion, UICC stage and postoperative complications. The corresponding 1-, 3-, 5-year disease-free survival rates were 73%, 32% and 10%, respectively. Multivariable analysis yielded preoperative liver function capacity (HR 2.421; p = 0.014), vascular invasion (HR 2.116; p = 0.034) and UICC stage (HR 2.200; p = 0.037) as risk factors associated with disease-free survival. A subanalysis with respect to the degree of functional impairment implicated that severity of liver function impairment is correlated with the disease-free survival rate.Conclusion:This study shows that preoperative dynamic liver function assessed by LiMAx test as well as severity of underlying liver disease have a significant impact on recurrence-free survival after curative hepatectomy. Patients presenting with impaired liver function should be evaluated for other treatment e.g. liver transplantation or receive closer oncological follow-up.
