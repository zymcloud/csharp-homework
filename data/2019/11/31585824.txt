Purpose:To determine negative predictive value (NPV) of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to demonstrate local tumour progression (LTP) at thermal ablation (TA) sites.Methods:Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study; acquisition of consent was waived. Consecutive CEUS examinations performed between 2004-2014 for TA site evaluation on patients who could not undergo enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or had inconclusive CT or MRI, were retrospectively reviewed. Those reported as no abnormal enhancement in or surrounding TA site were included. CEUS examination was considered true-negative based on stability or lack of enhancement/washout on follow-up imaging for at least 1 year, and false-negative (FN), if there was an arterially enhancing focus with wash-out at or surrounding TA site on subsequent follow-up imaging.Results:Study population included 56 tumours in 54 patients, 11 women, 43 men; mean age 71 years. Two patients had TA of two different hepatocellular carcinomas. Thirty-six examinations were for hepatic TA and twenty for renal TA. Lesion sizes ranged from 1 cm to 7 cm (mean 3.1 Â± 1.2). Mean diameter of 7 recurrences was 13.8 mm. Overall FN rate was 12.5% (7/56). Corresponding numbers were 0% (0/20) for renal TA and 19.4% (7/36) for hepatic TA. Overall NPV of CEUS was 87.5% (49/56) (confidence interval [CI]: 78.8%-96.2%). NPV for renal TA was 100% (20/20) (CI: 100%-100%) and for hepatic TA 81.5% (29/36) (CI: 67.6 %-93.5%).Conclusion:In this cohort, CEUS showed high NPV for exclusion of LTP at renal TA sites. NPV for hepatic TA sites was high but lower than renal TA.
