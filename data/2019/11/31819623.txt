Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of raltitrexed plus oxaliplatin-based transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 123 patients with unresectable HCC were recruited into the prospective cohort study. Raltitrexed plus oxaliplatin-based TACE was performed according to the traditional method at monthly intervals and was repeated for up to 4 cycles if no disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and tumor response rate. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to assess the independent prognostic factors of OS. Adverse events were also observed.Results:The median OS time and PFS were 623 days (95% CI: 461, 785) and 338 days (95% CI: 302, 704), respectively. The disease control rate was 95.5% (118/123). The Cox proportional-hazards regression model indicated that age, ECOG performance status and response to TACE as independent prognostic factors of OS. No treatment-related mortality occurred within 30 days of treatment procedure. The most common complications included postembolization syndrome, liver dysfunction and hematological toxicity. Grade 3 pain, transglutaminase abnormality and thrombocytopenia were observed in 16 (13%), 15 (12.2%) and 3 (2.4%) patients, respectively. No grade 4 adverse events were observed.Conclusion:Raltitrexed plus oxaliplatin-based TACE led to high tumor response rate and promising PFS and OS, and was considered safe and tolerable in patients with unresectable HCC.
