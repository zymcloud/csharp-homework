Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest primary tumor of the liver. Chronic HCV infection is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease, HCC and liver-related death in Egypt. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs were reported to increase susceptibility to tumorigenesis; affect prognosis and as promising biomarkers in virus-host interactions. This study was conducted to investigate the role of genetic variants of miR-196a2 (rs 11614913) C>T and miR-499 (rs 3746444) A>G in the development of cirrhosis and HCC in Egyptian HCV infected patients. Genotyping of the candidate SNPs was performed by Real Time PCR in 75 HCV-related HCC patients, 75 cirrhotic patients on top of HCV and 75 healthy controls. There was significant difference in miR-499 (rs3746444) genotypes frequency between the three studied groups as the GG genotype was significantly lower in HCC cases than other groups (P = 0.009) while the combined miR-499 (AA+AG) genotypes were significantly higher in HCC cases than other groups (P = 0.005). Also a significant difference was found in miR-499 genotypes frequency when compared between HCC and cirrhosis groups as the GG genotype was significantly lower in HCC cases than cirrhosis group (P = 0.006) while the combined miR-499 (AA+AG) genotypes were significantly higher in HCC cases than in cirrhosis group (P = 0.003) [OR (95% CI) = 0.131 (0.028-0.601)]. The frequency of the G allele was significantly lower in HCC than other groups (P = 0.024) and significantly lower in HCC than normal group (P = 0.006) [OR (95%CI) = 0.501 (0.304-0.825)]. For miR-196a2 (rs11614913) C>T polymorphisms, no significant association was found with HCC risk. Our study concluded that the G allele of miR-499 is associated with lower risk of HCV related HCC development. No significant association of miR-196a2 (rs 11614913), genotypes or alleles with risk for HCC development, could be detected..
