Background:Sorafenib is the first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The management of its side effects is improving. This study aimed to assess, in real life, if this translates into a better prognosis.Methods:This was a retrospective study of advanced HCC patients treated with sorafenib between 2007 and 2017.Results:188 advanced HCC patients received > 4 weeks of sorafenib. Median treatment duration was 5.4 months and median overall survival (mOS) 10 months (95% confidence interval 15-27). Sorafenib was initiated in 65 patients in 2007-2012 and 123 in 2013-2017. Both groups were comparable except for Barcelona Clinic liver cancer class. Tumor progression, disease control (DC) rate, and incidence of toxicity were similar in the 2 periods, but the duration of treatment (4.3 vs. 5.9 months; p < 0.01) and mOS (8 vs. 12 months; p < 0.002) differed. Among progressive disease patients, mOS was similar (7 months) but for those who had DC at 8 weeks, mOS was longer in the recent period (13 vs. 27 months; p < 0.0001). In the univariate analysis of OS, the period of treatment had a prognostic value.Conclusion:When comparing 2 periods of treatment in advanced HCC patients under sorafenib, duration of treatment and mOS were higher in the recent period. While mOS did not differ for patients who progressed, it was 2-fold higher in the recent period for those who had tumor control. Improvements in the use of sorafenib seem to be associated with better outcomes limited to patients with DC.
