There is little information concerning the predictive ability of the preoperative platelet to albumin ratio (PAR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after liver resection. In the current study, we aimed to assess the prognostic power of the PAR in HCC patients without portal hypertension (PH) following liver resection.Approximately 628 patients were included in this study. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of the PAR for both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the independent risk factors for both RFS and OS.During the follow-up period, 361 patients experienced recurrence, and 217 patients died. ROC curve analysis suggested that the best cut-off value of the PAR for RFS was greater than 4.8. The multivariate analysis revealed that microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor size >5 cm, high aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet count ratio index (APRI) and high PAR were four independent risk factors for both RFS and OS. Patients with a low PAR had significantly better RFS and OS than those with a high PAR.The PAR may be a useful marker to predict the prognosis of HCC patients after liver resection. HCC patients with a high preoperative PAR had a higher recurrent risk and lower long-term survival rate than those with a low preoperative PAR.
