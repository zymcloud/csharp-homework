Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are expected to serve as a blood-based biomarker in the diagnosis of cancers at an early stage, providing an opportunity to increase the survival of cancer patients. Current techniques for CTC detection were designed for some particular types of cancer with confirmed primary tumor origin. In this work, a platform for the detection of two cancer types and the identification of the primary tumor origin of CTCs was established to meet the requirement of cancer diagnosis and clinical application. A combined strategy based on in vivo capture method using antibody cocktail and multicolor fluorescence imaging using aptamer was designed to achieve the high-efficiency capture of CTCs and the accurate location of the primary tumor. An antibody cocktail of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was applied to capture breast cancer CTCs and hepatocellular CTCs in vivo. The capture efficiency of hepatocellular CTCs was significantly increased from 3.17% to 26.67% and the capture efficiency of breast cancer CTCs slightly increased from 27.00% to 29.84% compared with EpCAM-based capture of CTCs. Meanwhile, the primary tumor origins of breast cancer CTCs and hepatocellular CTCs were simultaneously distinguished by specific aptamer-based fluorescence probes without any signal crosstalk. The results of in vivo experiments using the dual tumor-bearing mouse model confirmed the feasibility of this method to capture CTCs and identify primary tumor origins. This simple and efficient approach has potential for future applications in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
