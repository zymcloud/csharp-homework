Myoferlin, a protein of the ferlin family, has seven C2 domains and exhibits activity in some cells, including myoblasts and endothelial cells. Recently, myoferlin was identified as a promising target and biomarker in non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colon cancer, melanoma, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma and endometrioid carcinoma. This evidence indicated that myoferlin was involved in the proliferation, invasion and migration of tumour cells, the mechanism of which mainly included promoting angiogenesis, vasculogenic mimicry, energy metabolism reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and modulating exosomes. The roles of myoferlin in both normal cells and cancer cells are of great significance to provide novel and efficient methods of tumour treatment. In this review, we summarize recent studies and findings of myoferlin and suggest that myoferlin is a novel potential candidate for clinical diagnosis and targeted cancer therapy.
