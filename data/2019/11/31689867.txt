Background:To evaluate the short-term efficacy, long-term efficacy, and adverse events (AEs) of elemene plus transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in comparison with TACE alone for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese Scientific Journal Full-text Database, Wanfang Data, CBM, and VIP were searched by 2 reviewers using the same search strategy for clinical studies on elemene plus TACE in the treatment of HCC. These articles were screened according to pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the qualities of the included studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The primary outcomes were the objective response rate (ORR), the 1-year survival rate and AEs. Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 15.0 were used for the meta-analysis.Results:A total of 10 studies involving 543 patients (TACE + elemene = 277, TACE alone = 266) were included. The results showed that the ORR was significantly improved in the combined treatment group compared to the TACE alone group (odds ratio [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.84-4.00, P Conclusion:Based on current findings, TACE + elemene injection may improve the ORR and the 1-year survival rate for HCC patients compared to TACE alone. Arterial perfusion may be superior to intravenous guttae.
