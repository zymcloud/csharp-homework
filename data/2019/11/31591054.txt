Accumulating evidence indicates a strong correlation between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying pathophysiology is still elusive. We aimed to identify unrecognized but important genes and pathways related to T2DM and HCC by bioinformatic analysis. The GSE64998 and GSE15653 datasets (for T2DM), the GSE121248 dataset and the Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) dataset (for HCC) were downloaded. Differential expression analysis, functional and pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, survival analysis, transcription factor (TF) prediction, and correlation of gene expression with methylation and tumour-infiltrating immune cells were conducted. Nine genes, namely, CDNF, CRELD2, DNAJB11, DTL, GINS2, MANF, PDIA4, PDIA6, and VCP, were recognized as hub genes. Enrichment analysis revealed several enriched terms and pathways. Transcription factors such as Kruppel-like factor 6, abnormal methylation and immune dysregulation might help explain the dysregulation of hub genes. Our study identified nine hub genes that might play a critical role in both T2DM and HCC. However, more studies are warranted to clarify the mechanisms of these genes.
