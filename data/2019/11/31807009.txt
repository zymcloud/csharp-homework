Purpose:Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in the development and progression of various human cancers. hsa-circ-0046600 is a circRNA of unknown function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological function of hsa-circ-0046600 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms of this circRNA.Materials and methods:GSE97332, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect the expression of hsa-circ-0046600 in HCC tissues and cells. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interaction between hsa-circ-0046600 and miR-640, and a meta-analysis confirmed the expression of miR-640 in HCC. Bioinformatics was used for the functional analysis of miR-640 target genes. N-cadherin and HIF-1α expression was measured by Western blot analysis.Results:The expression level of hsa-circ-0046600 in HCC tissue was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissue (P Conclusion:hsa-circ-0046600 can be used as a new biomarker for HCC diagnosis and disease progression and provides a potential target for targeted therapy.
