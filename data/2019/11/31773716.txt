Objective:To study the effect of expression of long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) associated with microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (MVIH) on the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to gemcitabine.Materials and methods:BGC-823 cell lines were divided into control group (no treatment), low expression group (lentiviral transfection with sh-lncRNA MVIH), and high expression group (lentiviral transfection with lncRNA MVIH). The expression of lncRNA MVIH, the protein expressions of E-cadherin and Vimentin, and the differences in proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells were detected via Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, transwell assay, wound healing assay, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, and flow cytometry.Results:The results of RT-PCR revealed that compared with that in control group, the mRNA expression of lncRNA MVIH was significantly decreased in low expression group and markedly increased in high expression group. Also, there were statistically significant differences (pConclusions:Reducing the expression of lncRNA MVIH can significantly lower the migration and invasion ability of gastric cancer cells and raise the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to gemcitabine.
