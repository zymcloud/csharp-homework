Vascular invasion (VI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important clinical parameter to predict survival. In this study, we collected microRNA (miRNA) expression data from HCC patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas database and identified a novel miRNA signature associated with VI. First, we categorized HCC patients into groups with or without VI (VI+ and VI-). We identified three miRNAs (miRNA-210, miRNA-10b, and miRNA-9-1) that were associated with VI according to a Kaplan-Meier analysis. This three-miRNA signature exhibited good predictive ability for VI in patients with HCC according to a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis at 1, 3, and 5 years. Patients with HCC with a high risk score exhibited a trend toward worse outcomes as determined by multivariable Cox regression and stratified analyses. This three-miRNA signature provides an accurate prediction of VI and can be used as an independent prognostic indicator for predicting VI in HCC patients.
