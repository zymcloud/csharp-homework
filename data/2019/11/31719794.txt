Background:Radiation sensitive 52 (RAD52) is an important protein that mediates DNA repair in tumors. However, little is known about the impact of RAD52 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the expression of RAD52 and its values in HCC. Some proteins that might be coordinated with RAD52 in HCC were also analyzed.Methods:Global RAD52 mRNA levels in HCC were assessed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. RAD52 expression was analyzed in 70 HCC tissues and adjacent tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The effect of over-expressed RAD52 in Huh7 HCC cells was investigated. The String database was then used to perform enrichment and functional analysis of RAD52 and its interactome. Cytoscape software was used to create a protein-protein interaction network. Molecular interaction studies with RAD52 and its interactome were performed using the molecular docking tools in Hex8.0.0. Finally, these DNA repair proteins, which interact with RAD52, were also analyzed using the TCGA dataset and were detected by qRT-PCR. Based on the TCGA database, algorithms combining ROC between RAD52 and RAD52 interactors were used to diagnose HCC by binary logistic regression.Results:In TCGA, upregulated RAD52 related to gender was obtained in HCC. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of RAD52 was 0.704. The results of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) indicated no difference in the prognosis between patients with high and low RAD52 gene expression. We validated that RAD52 expression was increased at the mRNA and protein levels in Chinese HCC tissues compared with adjacent tissues. Higher RAD52 was associated with older age, without correlation with other clinicopathological factors. In vitro, over-expressed RAD52 significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of Huh7 cells. Furthermore, RAD52 interactors (radiation sensitive 51, RAD51; X-ray repair cross complementing 6, XRCC6; Cofilin, CFL1) were also increased in HCC and participated in some biological processes with RAD52. Protein structure analysis showed that RAD52-RAD51 had the firmest binding structure with the lowest E-total energy (- 1120.5 kcal/mol) among the RAD52-RAD51, RAD52-CFL1, and RAD52-XRCC6 complexes. An algorithm combining ROC between RAD52 and its interactome indicated a greater specificity and sensitivity for HCC screening.Conclusions:Overall, our study suggested that RAD52 plays a vital role in HCC pathogenesis and serves as a potential molecular target for HCC diagnosis and treatment. This study's findings regarding the multigene prediction and diagnosis of HCC are valuable.
