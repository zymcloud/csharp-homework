Circulating autotaxin (ATX) is elevated in persons with liver disease, particularly in the setting of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HCV/HIV infection. It is thought that plasma ATX levels are, in part, attributable to impaired liver clearance that is secondary to fibrotic liver disease. In a discovery data set, we identified plasma ATX to be associated with parameters of systemic immune activation during chronic HCV and HCV/HIV infection. We and others have observed a partial normalization of ATX levels within months of starting interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) HCV therapy, consistent with a non-fibrotic liver disease contribution to elevated ATX levels, or HCV-mediated hepatocyte activation. Relationships between ATX, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and parameters of systemic immune activation will be discussed in the context of HCV infection, age, immune health, liver health, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
