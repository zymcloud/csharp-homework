Objective:Exosomes have been described as a messenger between cells' communication and contain various information (lipids, proteins, mRNAs, microRNAs, LncRNAs). It has been proved that Linc-ROR was enriched in exosomes released by HepG2 cells. Our aim was to investigate whether exosomes released by HepG2 cells could affect the biological behaviors of LO2 cells and whether Linc-ROR played an important role in this process.Methods:Exosomes-derived from HepG2 cells were isolated and characterized. Real-time PCR assessed expression level of Linc-ROR in specimens of cancerous tissues and carcinoma-adjacent tissues. The Linc-ROR expression level in HepG2, Huh7, SMMC-7721, Bel-7402, LO2 cells and exosomes was detected by real-time PCR. Knockdown the expression of Linc-ROR in HepG2 by using effective siRNA. Cell counting method was used to test LO2 cells proliferative activities. Flow cytometry was performed to quantify the apoptosis rates of LO2 cells cocultured with exosomes. The expression levels of OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, P53 and CD133 were assessed by western blot.Results:Linc-ROR was enriched in exosomes released by HepG2 cells. Exosomes derived from HepG2 cells promoted the proliferation and suppressed the apoptosis of LO2 cells suffering nutrient deficiency. Knockdown the expression of Linc-ROR in HepG2 or LO2 cells could significantly impaired the exosomes' effects on LO2 cells. In addition, the long-term coculture with exosomes would obviously change the biological behaviors of LO2 cells.Conclusions:Our experiments indicated the HepG2 cells could transfer its Linc-ROR to the LO2 cells via exosomes, then influenced the recipient cells.
