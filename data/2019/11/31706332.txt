Objective:We previously reported the identification of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and glypican-3 (GPC3) as prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which are now considered significant poor prognostic factors for the disease. This study aimed to clarify the detailed interaction of these two factors in HCC to improve our understanding of aggressive HCC phenotypes. A total of 225 Japanese patients with HCC from our previous study were subjected to immunohistochemical analyses.Results:The number of MCT4-positive (MCT4+) HCC cases was 47 (21%), and most MCT4+ HCC showed high GPC3 expression (94%, 44/47 cases). In 44 MCT4+/GPC3+ HCC cases, intratumoral heterogeneity of GPC3 or MCT4 expression was further evaluated. We observed reciprocal (inverse), synergistic, mixed reciprocal and synergistic, or irrelevant interaction of MCT4 and GPC3 expression in 29 (66%), 5 (11%), 1 (2%), and 9 cases (21%), respectively. The cases exhibiting reciprocal expression of both markers tended to have cirrhosis without a history of neoadjuvant therapy. In summary, although MCT4+ HCC cases are mostly GPC3+, intratumoral expression patterns of MCT4 and GPC3 are frequently reciprocal each other, suggesting that dual targeting of MCT4 and GPC3 may achieve a better antitumor effect for MCT4+ HCC cases.
