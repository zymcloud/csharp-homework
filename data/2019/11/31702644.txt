To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the novel technique, transjugular portal vein embolization (TPVE).A single-center retrospective review of 18 patients (12 males and 6 females; mean age, 62 years) who underwent TPVE between January 2012 and January 2013 was conducted. The technical success rate, future liver remnant (FLR) volume, total liver volume (TLV) and FLR/TLV ratio after PVE were analyzed. Liver function, including total bilirubin (TB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR), was assessed before and after PVE. Any complications of TPVE and liver resection after TPVE were recorded.TPVE was performed on 18 patients before right hepatic resection for both primary and secondary hepatic malignancies (10 hepatocellular carcinomas, 4 cases of colorectal liver metastasis, and 4 cholangiocarcinomas). Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients (18 of 18). The mean FRL significantly increased to 580 Â± 155 mL (P
