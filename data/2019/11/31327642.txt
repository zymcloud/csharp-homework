Introduction:Two clinical studies (Study 1108 and ATLANTIC) were analyzed to evaluate the prognostic value of baseline liver metastases (LMs) in advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks.Patients and methods:A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted; covariates included performance status, tumor stage, histology, sex, age, smoking status, and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.Results:In all, 569 patients were included. LMs were present in 31.6% (96/304) of Study 1108 patients and 17.9% (47/263) of ATLANTIC patients. Median overall survival (OS) was shorter in patients with LMs than in those without in both studies. In both studies, LMs were an independent negative prognostic factor for OS and progression-free survival. Objective response rates were also significantly lower. PD-L1 independently predicted benefit across all patients.Conclusion:Liver metastases were associated with worse outcomes irrespective of PD-L1 status, but PD-L1 status predicted benefit from durvalumab irrespective of LMs.
