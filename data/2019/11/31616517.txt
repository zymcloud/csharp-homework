Although the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring after hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication has decreased, there are still reports of hepatocarcinogenesis. The present study investigated the histological changes of non-cancerous liver tissue obtained prior to interferon (IFN) therapy and after HCC development. A total of 669 HCV-infected Japanese patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR) by IFN-based therapy were retrospectively enrolled. Of these, the present study investigated 18 patients who developed HCC after IFN-based SVR. Specimens from 9 of 18 patients were available for histological comparisons prior to IFN therapy and following HCC development. Of these 9 patients, the specimens of 5 individuals were compared via immunohistochemical staining [CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), transforming growth factor-Î²1 and granzyme B]. The current study included 6 control patients with HCV-associated chronic liver disease who subsequently developed HCC (non-SVR-HCC group). Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare groups. Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. P
