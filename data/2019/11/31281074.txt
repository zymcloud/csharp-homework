Purpose:The purpose of this study was to assess liver function deterioration, as assessed using the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score variations, following transarterial chemo-embolization (TACE) versus selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) in patients with unresectable unilobar hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC).Patients and methods:We retrospectively evaluated all patients who underwent a single conventional TACE or SIRT procedure in our department from May 2013 to May 2018 for unilobar unresectable HCC. A total of 86 patients (76 men, 20 women; mean age, 65.5 years) were included. There were 63 patients in the TACE group [56 men, 7 women; mean age, 65.1±9.6 (SD) years] and 23 patients in the SIRT group [20 men, 3 women; mean age, 70±9.2 (SD) years]. Delta MELD, defined as post treatment minus pre-treatment MELD score, was considered for liver function deterioration and compared between patients who underwent single lobar treatment of SIRT versus TACE.Results:Patients in SIRT group had significant higher tumor burden, alpha-fetoprotein serum level, and rates of macroscopic vessel invasion. Mean pre-treatment MELD scores did not differ between TACE [mean, 8.41±1.71 (SD); range: 7.24-9.24] and SIRT groups [mean, 8.36±1.74 (SD); range: 7.07-9.21] (P=0.896) as well as Child-Pugh class and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade distribution. However, following treatment, mean DeltaMELD was greater in TACE group (mean, 0.83±1.83 [SD]; range: -0.30--1.31) than in SIRT group (mean, -0.13±1.06 [SD]; range: -0.49-0.32) (P=0.021). At multivariate analysis, SIRT treatment was independently associated with a lower DeltaMELD score than TACE (R=-0.955 [-1.68; -0.406]; P=0.017;).Conclusion:Whereas performed in patients with higher tumor burden, SIRT resulted in lower degrees of liver function worsening as assessed using MELD score variations.
