Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading malignancy worldwide, causing mortality in children and adults. AEG-1 is functioned as a scaffold protein for the proper assembly of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to optimize or increase its activity. The increased activity of oncogenic miRNAs leads to the degradation of target tumor suppressor genes. miR-221 is an oncogenic miRNA, that plays a seminal role in carcinogenesis regulation of HCC. However, the molecular mechanism and biological functions of the miR-221/AEG-1 axis have not been investigated extensively in HCC. Here, the expression of miR-221/AEG-1 and their target/associate genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The role of the miR-221/AEG-1 axis in HCC was evaluated by proliferation assay, migration assay, invasion assay, and flow cytometry analysis. The expression level of miR-221 decreased in AEG-1 siRNA transfected HCC cells. On the other hand, there were no significant expression changes of AEG-1 in miR-221 mimic and miR-221 inhibitor transfected HCC cells and inhibition of miR-221/AEG-1 axis decreased cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis and induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest by upregulating p57, p53, PTEN, and RB and downregulating LSF, MMP9, OPN, Bcl-2, PI3K, AKT, and LC3A in HCC cells. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the miR-221/AEG-1 axis plays a seminal oncogenic role by modulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in HCC. In conclusion, the miR-221/AEG-1 axis may serve as a potential target for therapeutics, diagnostics, and prognostics of HCC.
