Aims:Interleukin(IL)-22 plays an important role in promoting liver regeneration and repair, but its role in chronic HBV-related liver diseasesis not clear. The goal of this study was to evaluate associations between eight IL22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the development of chronic HBV cirrhosis and HBV-related HCC within a Chinese Han population.Methods:We investigated associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL22 gene (rs1026788, rs2227472, rs2227491, rs2227485, rs1179249, rs2046068,rs2227473, and rs7314777) and the risk of HBV-related chronic liver diseases within a Han population in Northeast China. A total of 649 participants were included in the study, including 103 patients with CHB, 264 patients with LC, and 282 patients with HCC. The odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using chi-square test. Haplotype analysis was conducted by haploview software.Results:Genotype and allele distributions of SNPs rs1179249 and rs2227472 differed between LC and CHB groups (both P 0.05).Conclusion:IL22 genetic variations were associated with chronic HBV infection progression, especially in the HBV-LC group. The IL22 genetic variations may help clinicians initiate the correct treatment strategy at the CHB stage.
