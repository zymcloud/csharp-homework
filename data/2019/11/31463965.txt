A new series of 2,4-disubstituted-2-thiopyrimidines 6a-t, 9a, and 9b was efficiently designed and synthesized as antiangiogenic and cytotoxic agents. Compounds 6j, 6l, and 6d showed IC50 values of 1.23, 3.78, and 3.84 μM, respectively, against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Most of the synthesized 2-thiouracils showed antiproliferative activity against the HepG2 cell line (hepatocellular carcinoma) in the micromolar range, for instance, 9b, 6l, 6m, 6n, and 6j displayed IC50 = 7.92, 8.35, 8.51, 9.59, and 13.06 μM, respectively, relative to sorafenib (III; IC50 = 10.99 μM). Also, compounds 6j, 9a, 6m, and 6s (IC50 = 15.21, 16.96, 17.68, and 18.15 μM, respectively) are the most potent compounds against the UO-31 cell line. Further evaluation of the effect of the synthesized candidates on VEGFR-2 in the HepG2 cell line demonstrated that compounds 6j and 6l exhibit VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity of 87% and 84%, respectively, relative to sorafenib (III; 92%). In silico docking of the synthesized hits into the binding site of VEGFR-2 showed their ability to perform the main binding interactions with the key amino acids in the binding site. Studying the in silico predicted ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) parameters for the synthesized thiouracils demonstrated that they have favorable pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties. These results demonstrate that the 2,4-disubstituted thiouracils 6 and 9 have not only favorable antiangiogenic and antiproliferative activity but also satisfy the criteria required for the development of orally bioavailable drugs. Consequently, they represent a biologically active scaffold that should be further optimized for future discovery of potential hits.
