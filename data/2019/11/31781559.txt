Several studies have investigated strategies to improve the clinical efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the prognosis remains poor. Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs), easily accessible and abundant in quantity, have represented as an attractive therapeutic tool for the stem cell-based treatment for cancer diseases. Through direct co-culture and indirect separate culture experiments, we showed that AT-MSCs could enhance inhibitory effect of RT on reducing HCC cell growth, migration and invasion in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a noticeable interferon-induced transmembrane 1 (IFITM1)-induced tumor gene signature. Gain and loss of mechanistic studies indicated that mechanism was attributed to downregulated expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) and upregulated expression of P53 and caspases. Collectively, our findings suggest that AT-MSCs might enhance the therapeutic effects of RT on HCC, providing a rationale for AT-MSCs and RT combination therapy as a new remedy for HCC.
