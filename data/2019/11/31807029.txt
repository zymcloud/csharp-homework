Background:Accumulating evidences indicate that circRNAs play important roles in the progression and chemoresistance of human cancers. The present study is designated for researching the roles of circ_0003418 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We detected the expression profile of circ_0003418 in human HCC tissues and cell lines by quantitative real-time-PCR assays. CCK-8 assay, transwell migration assay, transwell invasion assay and drug-sensitivity analysis were carried out to estimate the effects of circ_0003418 on HCC cells' proliferation, migration, invasion and resistance to cisplatin, respectively. Mouse xenograft model was conducted to monitor the role of circ_0003418 in cisplatin resistance in vivo. Western blotting was performed to explore the changes of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway after knockdown of circ_0003418. The rescue experiment was carried out to explore circ_0003418-activated biological functions through Wnt/β-catenin pathway.Results:The expression level of circ_0003418 was downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and the level correlated with tumor size, TNM stage and HBsAg level in HCC patients. circ_0003418 knockdown promoted HCC cells' proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, suppression of circ_0003418 enhanced cisplatin resistance of HCC cells in vivo and vitro. Knockdown of circ_0003418 activated the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in HCC cells. The effect of circ-0003418 on sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin was reversed after inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway.Conclusion:circ-0003418 exerts an antitumorigenic role in HCC and advances the sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin by restraining the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Thus, circ-0003418 may represent a novel biomarker and provide us a new strategy for the treatment of HCC.
