Combination therapy is an important method for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Gefitinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, which has profound effects on HCC. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of genistein in combination with gefitinib on the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cells and the associated mechanism. Cell counting kit-8 assay was performed to calculate the IC50 values and cytotoxicity, whilst flow cytometry was used to assess cell apoptosis. Protein expression was detected using western blot analysis. The IC50 of genistein and gefitinib on Hep3B cells were calculated to be 128.078 and 13.657 ÂµM, respectively. Genistein in combination with gefitinib significantly inhibited cell viability, promoted apoptosis and reduced EGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor phosphorylation. Genistein in combination with gefitinib promoted the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase. In addition, combined treatment of genistein and gefitinib strongly inhibited the activation of the Akt/Erk/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, findings from the present study suggest that genistein in combination with gefitinib inhibit HCC cell proliferation and promote apoptosis by inhibiting the Akt/Erk/mTOR pathway.
