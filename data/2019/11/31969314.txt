Currently probiotics are considered as an emerging therapeutic strategy in the treatment of many liver disorders. The use of probiotics beyond infection of intestinal flora is a very helpful approach. The optimistic effect of probiotics has been observed in treating the hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, viral hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic liver disease. The characterize mechanisms of probiotics are still unknown but may involve in, maintaining a microbial barrier against potential pathogens, reducing the production of bacterial toxins, modulating the immune system, intestinal permeability, and the inflammatory response. Its safety issues, effectiveness, food supplements as its source are still to be studied. However, studies revealed that probiotic therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma and in portal hypertension are still weak. Larger clinical studies are required before probiotics can be recommended as a treatment modality in liver diseases.
