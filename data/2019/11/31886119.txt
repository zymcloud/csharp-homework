Background:Acute lung injury (ALI) is a rare but life-threatening pulmonary complication of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to characterize the common risk factors, clinical features, imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes of acute lung injury caused by TACE.Methods:A retrospective study was performed on all TACE-associated ALI cases that were diagnosed at authors' hospital from January 2015 to June 2018.Results:The study included 14 ALI cases where the mean age of patients was 60.9 ± 11.7 years (range 41-82 years), with a mean onset time of 2.4 ± 1.6 d after TACE. Of the 14 patients, 8 patients (57.1%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 7 patients (50%) had underlying chronic respiratory disease and hepatic arteriovenous fistula was detected in 6 patients (42.6%), both of which were significantly higher than control group (P < 0.05). Dyspnea (92.9%) was the most common symptoms. Pleural effusion (64.3%), diffuse pulmonary infiltration (42.9%), and accumulation of Lipiodol in lung field (42.9%) were frequent radiologic abnormalities. 11 patients (78.6%) achieved remission after treatment, and the 30-day mortality rate was approximately 21.4%. Patient's median survival time after the development of ALI was merely 4.3 months, which was obviously worse than control group (4.3 months vs. 13.5 months, P < 0.05).Conclusion:This study illustrates that TACE-associated ALI is a rare pulmonary complication with a high mortality rate. We infer that pulmonary Lipiodol embolization might be one of the main causes of TACE-associated ALI. Thus, HCC patients who are at high risk should be closely evaluated and monitored during TACE to avoid such potentially fatal complication.
