Doxorubicin is conventionally used in chemotherapy against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but acquired resistance developed during long-term therapy limits its benefits. Autophagy, a conserved catabolic process for cellular self-protection and adaptation to the changing environment, is regarded as a potential clinical target to overcome doxorubicin resistance. In this study, the potential role of miR-223 in modulating doxorubicin-induced autophagy and sensitivity were evaluated in four transfected human HCC cell lines, and the in vivo relevance was assessed using a mouse xenograft model of HCC. We found that the well-defined miR-223 is expressed at low levels in doxorubicin treated HCC cells and that miR-223 overexpression inhibits the doxorubicin-induced autophagy that contributes to chemoresistance. Blockade of autophagic flux by chloroquine resulted in the failure of miR-223 inhibitor to suppress doxorubicin sensitivity of HCC cells. We further identified FOXO3a as a direct downstream target of miR-223 and primary mediator of the regulatory effect of miR-223 on doxorubicin-induced autophagy and chemoresistance in HCC cells. Finally, we confirmed the enhancement of doxorubicin sensitivity by agomiR-223 in xenograft models of HCC. These findings establish a novel miRNA-based approach for autophagy interference to reverse doxorubicin resistance in future chemotherapy regimens against human HCC.
