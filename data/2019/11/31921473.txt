A full-length translational product of the trophinin gene, KIAA1114, is a distinctive marker of cancer stem cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma, and a mAb, Kiatomab, is specific to KIAA1114 antigen. In this study, we addressed the therapeutic potential of Kiatomab for treating both metastatic and solid tumors in mouse models. Kiatomab recognizes the linear epitope of KIAA1114, which is expressed on cell surfaces of various murine cancer cell lines. Kiatomab treatment induced potent antitumor responses in pulmonary metastasis models. Antitumor activity was mediated by the fragment crystallizable portion of Kiatomab and dependent on the host immune system. The use of Kiatomab alone as an antitumor therapy was ineffective in solid tumor models. However, in combination with cyclophosphamide, or by switching the isotype of the mAb, improved antitumor effects of Kiatomab were observed. These results suggest that Kiatomab can be used as a novel mAb for cancer immunotherapy.
