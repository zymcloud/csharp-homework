Introduction: The 5-year recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatic resection or local ablation is up to 70%. Adjuvant therapies to prevent HCC recurrence have been reported but are not currently recommended by EASL or AASLD guidelines. This review examined evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the safety and efficacy of adjuvant therapies and chemotherapies in HCC patients after resection or local ablation.Areas covered: PubMed was searched through 15 June 2019. Available evidence was assessed based on the GRADE system.Expert commentary: Transarterial chemoembolization is the best adjuvant therapy for HCC patients at high risk of recurrence, antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogs is effective for preventing recurrence of HBV-related HCC, and interferon-Î± is effective for preventing recurrence of HCV-related HCC. Further studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors. Adjuvant sorafenib appears to offer negligible clinical benefit and high risk of adverse effects.
