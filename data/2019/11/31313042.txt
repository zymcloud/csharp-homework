Background:Herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) has been suggested to play various roles in cancer biology. The authors report that HVEM expression in tumor cells is associated with a reduction in the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and a poor prognosis after surgical resection in various human gastrointestinal cancers. This study aimed to clarify the clinical significance of HVEM expression in human colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM).Methods:This study examined the cases of 104 patients with CRLM who underwent curative liver resection at Nara Medical University between 2000 and 2014. The median follow-up period was 50.2 months. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against HVEM, CD4, CD8, and CD45RO.Results:High HVEM expression was observed in 49 patients (47.1%) with CRLM. Expression of HVEM was not associated with age, gender, administration of preoperative chemotherapy, tumor size, number of tumors, or histologic differentiation. The high-HVEM group exhibited significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the low-HVEM group (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that high HVEM expression in CRLM, age of 70 years or older, and having five or more tumors are independent poor prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-7.93; P = 0.006). The number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD45RO+ T cells was significantly lower in the high-HVEM group than in the low-HVEM group. High HVEM expression in primary colorectal cancer was significantly associated with synchronous CRLM, but not with metachronous CRLM.Conclusions:Tumor HVEM expression might play a critical role in CRLM.
