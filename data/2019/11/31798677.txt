Aim:To compare liver-specific EOB-GD-DTPA and liver-non-specific Gd-BT-DO3A MR, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver colorectal metastases.Material and methods:Seventy HCC patients with 158 nodules and 90 colorectal liver metastases (mCRC) with 370 lesions were included in the retrospective analysis. HCC patients underwent MR at 0 time (MR0), after 3 (MR3) and 6 months (MR6) using two different CM; 69 mCRC patients underwent MR with Gd-EOB-BTPA and 21 mCRC patients with Gd-BT-DO3A. We evaluated arterial phase hyperenhancement, lesion-to-liver contrast during portal phase, hepatobiliary phase parenchymal hyperenhancement.Results:In HCC patients arterial phase hyperenhancement degree was statistically higher (p = 0.03) with Gd-BT-DO3A (mean 4) than GD-EOB-DTPA (mean 2.6), while we found no significant statistical differences among mean (2.6) values at MR0 and MR6 using GD-EOB-DTPA. For all 209 patients underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA, we found that lesion-to-liver contrast during portal phase mean value was 4 while for patients underwent MR with Gd-BT-DO3A was 3 (p = 0.04). For HCC hepatobiliary phase parenchymal hyperenhancement mean value was 2.4. For mCRC patients: among 63 patients underwent previous chemotherapy hepatobiliary phase parenchymal hyperenhancement mean value was 3.1 while for 6 patients no underwent previous chemotherapy was 4 (p = 0.05).Conclusions:Gd-EOB-DTPA should be chosen in pre surgical setting in patients with colorectal liver metastases.
