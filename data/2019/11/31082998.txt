Aim:Even during nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy, development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been observed in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We simulated the long-term prognosis of liver disease in patients with chronic HBV who received nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy.Patients and methods:A total of 254 patients with chronic HBV receiving nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy were enrolled. Yearly transition probabilities between liver disease states [chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, HCC, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative status] were calculated using a Markov chain model.Results:In the analysis of 1-year liver disease state transition probabilities, the development of HCC occurred in men with chronic hepatitis in their 50s (1.8%) and at least 70 years (2.8%) and in patients with cirrhosis in all age groups (40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and â‰¥ 70 years). HBsAg-negative status was present in patients with chronic hepatitis in their 50s (1.8%) and 60s (2.6%), and in patients with cirrhosis in their 60s (0.6%). In female patients, the development of HCC occurred in patients with cirrhosis during their 50s (0.8%), 60s (0.8%), and older (4.5%). HBsAg-negative status was simulated in patients with cirrhosis in their 50s (0.8%) and 60s (0.8%). Assuming a chronic hepatitis state at age 40 as the starting condition for simulation over the next 40 years, the probability of developing HCC increased gradually with age in male patients and in female patients after the age of 70 years.Conclusion:There is a risk of development of HCC in middle-aged men with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and older women with cirrhosis even while receiving nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy.
