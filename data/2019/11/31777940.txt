Background:The cure rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for patients with active and inactive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may differ, but well-controlled studies are limited. We aimed to evaluate DAA outcomes in a large East Asian HCV/HCC population compared to HCV/non-HCC patients.Methods:Using data from the REAL-C registry (Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan), we used propensity score matching (PSM) to match HCC and non-HCC (1:1) groups for age, sex, cirrhosis, prior treatment, HCV genotype, treatment regimen, baseline platelet count, HCV RNA, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and albumin level to evaluate DAA treatment outcomes in a large population of HCV/HCC compared to HCV/non-HCC patients.Results:We included 6,081 patients (HCC, n=465; non-HCC, n=5,616) treated with interferon-free DAAs. PSM of the entire study population yielded 436 matched pairs with similar baseline characteristics. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall SVR rate of the HCC (92.7%) and non-HCC (95.0%) groups. Rates of treatment discontinuation, adverse effects, and death were also similar between the HCC and non-HCC groups. Among patients with HCC, those with active HCC had a lower SVR than inactive HCC cases (85.5% vs. 93.7%, P=0.03). On multivariable analysis, active HCC, but not inactive HCC, was significantly associated with lower SVR (OR 0.28, P=0.01) when compared to non-HCC.Conclusions:Active HCC but not inactive HCC was independently associated with lower SVR compared to non-HCC patients undergoing DAA therapy, though cure rate was still relatively high (85%) in active HCC patients.
