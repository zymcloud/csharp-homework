Background/Aims. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the lethal digestive cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide. Wnt7a, a 39Kd secreted glycoprotein composed of 349 amino acids, was reported to be related to various diseases. However, its role in HCC has not been studied yet. In this study, using gene expression data and clinical information obtained from the Oncomine and KMplot database, we acknowledged that WNT7A was underexpressed in HCC cancer tissue compared with normal tissue, and WNT7A underexpression was correlated with the decreased survival rate of HCC patients. The function of Wnt7a in cell viability, apoptosis, and migration was evaluated by biological behavior assay and molecular analysis. The findings revealed that WNT7A overexpression significantly restrained cell viability and migration while enhancing apoptosis. In addition, WNT7A overexpression promoted cell apoptosis by strengthening Caspase-3 activity and inhibited migration by downregulating EMT transcriptional factor Snail. Furthermore, the expression level of SKP2 was significantly downregulating in the WNT7A overexpression group. In conclusion, this study illustrated that overexpression of WNT7A inhibited cell viability and migration, which was likely attributed to the regulation of SKP2/P21.
