A series of novel coumarin-cyclic imide conjugates (1a-1j) were designed and synthesized to evaluate their glucose uptake activity by insulin resistant liver hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells through 2-NBDG uptake assay. Compounds (1a-1j) were characterised using various analytical methods such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, GC-MS, elemental and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Compounds (1a-1j) exhibited 85.21 - 65.80% of glucose uptake and showed low level of cytotoxicity towards human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) indicating good selectivity and safety profile. Compound 1f was identified as a hit candidate exhibiting 85.21% of glucose uptake which was comparable with standard antidiabetic drug Metformin (93.25% glucose uptake). Solution stability study under physiological pH conditions â‰ˆ (3.4 - 8.7), indicates that compound 1f is sufficiently stable at varied pH conditions and thereby compatible with bio-physiological environments. Interaction of 1f with human serum albumin (HSA) were also studied which quantifies that compound 1f binds with HSA efficiently through facile binding reaction in solution. Fluorescence, UV-vis spectrophotometry and molecular modeling methodologies were employed for studying the interaction mechanism of compound 1f with protein.
