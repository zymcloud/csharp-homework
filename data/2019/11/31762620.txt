Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a multi-factorial disease and the most common of chronic liver diseases worldwide. The four clinical-pathological entities which are usually followed by NAFLD course include non-alcoholic steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The cornerstones of NAFLD management and treatment, however, are healthy lifestyles such as dietary modifications, regular physical activity, and gradual weight loss. At present, no drugs or pharmacological agents have been approved for long-term treatment of NAFLD. Therefore, lifestyle modification is considered the main clinical recommendation and an initial step for the management of NAFLD.
