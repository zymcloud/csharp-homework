The 5-year survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is (CTAG2), which affects the prognosis of HCC (overall survival, P=0.035), was acquired by analysing clinical data in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Meanwhile, CTAG2 expression was significantly associated with the age at diagnosis (P=0.003), T stage (P=0.028), TNM stage (P=0.028) and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) expression (P=0.045). Further immunohistochemical analysis of samples collected in our hospital revealed that the expression level of CTAG2 in 46 HCC tissues was significantly higher in comparison with that in paired adjacent tissues. The clinical data indicated that the expression of CTAG2 was significantly correlated with the hepatitis B virus status (P=0.010) and AFP expression (P=0.004). These results were then found to be consistent with the results of big data analytics. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis demonstrated that the function of CTAG2 in HCC may be associated with the cell cycle. Taken together, these findings suggest that CTAG2 may serve as a new potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.
