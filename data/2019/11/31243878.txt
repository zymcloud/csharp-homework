Sustained virological response (SVR) results in reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mortality among chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with advanced fibrosis. Since both advanced fibrosis and liver steatosis (LS) may coexist in CHC patients, we evaluated their individual effects on a composite outcome of all-cause mortality and HCC in CHC patients with SVR following direct-acting antivirals (DAA) treatment. We retrospectively evaluated inception cohort of 515 CHC patients who achieved SVR following treatment with DAA, with a mean follow-up of 24 months. Baseline liver fibrosis was assessed by transient elastography, and LS was validated by at least three independent ultrasonographic examinations. 211 of 515 patients (41%) had baseline LS. Patients with LS had a higher cumulative rate of all-cause mortality and HCC at 2 years of follow-up compared to patients without LS (15.75% and 2.79%, respectively, P
