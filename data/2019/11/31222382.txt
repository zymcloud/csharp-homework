Introduction:Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been developed to improve reliability of many interventional radiology (IR) procedures performed with Angio system, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Angio-CT has emerged as a new imaging technology that combines a CT scanner with an Angio system in the same IR suite. The purpose of our study was to compare Angio system with CBCT capability and Angio-CT in terms of patient radiation exposure during TACE procedures.Materials and methods:Consecutive TACE procedures performed between January 2016 and September 2017 with the two imaging modalities (Artis Zeego defining the CBCT group and Infinix-i 4D-CT defining the Angio-CT group) were reviewed. TACE and patient's characteristics and patient radiation exposure parameters were collected. Dose-area products (DAP) and dose-length products (DLP) were converted into effective doses (ED) using conversion factors. Accuracy of tumor targeting and response was retrospectively assessed.Results:A total of 114 TACE procedures in 96 patients were included with 57 procedures in each group. The total ED in the Angio-CT group was 2.5 times lower than that in the CBCT group (median 15.4 vs. 39.2 mSv, p Conclusion:Angio-CT provides significant decrease in patient effective dose during TACE procedures compared to Angio system with CBCT.
