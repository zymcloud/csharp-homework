The Myc gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of most types of human cancerous tumors. Myc/Max activates large numbers of pro-tumor genes; however it also induces anti-proliferation genes. When anti-proliferation genes are activated by Myc, cancer cells can only survive if they are downregulated. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specific intronic long noncoding antisense (lnc-AS) RNA, the EVA1A-AS gene, is located within the second intron (I2) of the EVA1A gene (EVA-1 homolog A) that encodes an anti-proliferation factor. Indeed, EVA1A, but not EVA1A-AS, is expressed in normal liver. Depletion of EVA1A-AS suppressed cell proliferation of HepG2 cells by upregulation of EVA1A. Overexpression of EVA1A caused cell death at the G2/M phase via microtubule catastrophe. Furthermore, suppressed EVA1A expression levels are negatively correlated with differentiation grade in 365 primary HCCs, while EVA1A-AS expression levels are positively correlated with patient survival. Notably, both EVA1A and EVA1A-AS were activated by the Myc/Max complex. Eva1A-AS is transcribed in the opposite direction near the 3'splice site of EVA1A I2. The second intron did not splice out in a U2 dependent manner and EVA1A mRNA is not exported. Thus, the Myc/Max dependent anti-proliferating gene, EVA1A, is controlled by Myc/Max dependent anti-sense noncoding RNA for HCC survival.
