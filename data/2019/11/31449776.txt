Hepatitis B virus (HBV) e antigen (HBeAg) is associated with viral persistence and pathogenesis. Resistance of HBV-infected hepatocytes to apoptosis is seen as one of the primary promotors for HBV chronicity and malignancy. Fas receptor/ligand (Fas/FasL) and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) system plays a key role in hepatic death during HBV infection. We found that HBeAg mediates resistance of hepatocytes to FasL or TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Introduction of HBeAg into human hepatocytes rendered resistance to FasL or TRAIL cytotoxicity in a p53-dependent manner. HBeAg further inhibited the expression of p53, total Fas, membrane-bound Fas, TNF receptor superfamily member 10a, and TNF receptor superfamily member 10b at both mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, HBeAg enhanced the expression of soluble forms of Fas through facilitation of Fas alternative mRNA splicing. In a mouse model, expression of HBeAg in mice injected with recombinant adenovirus-associated virus 8 inhibited agonistic anti-Fas antibody-induced hepatic apoptosis. Xenograft tumorigenicity assay also found that HBeAg-induced carcinogenesis was resistant to the proapoptotic effect of TRAIL and chemotherapeutic drugs. These results indicate that HBeAg may prevent hepatocytes from FasL and TRAIL-induced apoptosis by regulating the expression of the proapoptotic and antiapoptotic forms of death receptors, which may contribute to the survival and persistence of infected hepatocytes during HBV infection.
