Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a xenobiotic nuclear receptor known to regulate genes involved in key physiological processes like drug metabolism, maintenance of energy homeostasis, and cell proliferation. Owing to the diverse regulatory roles played by the receptor, it is critical to understand the precise cellular signals that dictate functional dynamics of CAR. With the objective of exploring the hitherto unknown regulatory pathways modulating CAR, we subjected the CAR protein sequence to a kinase prediction tool and identified several kinases recognizing CAR as a substrate. Using fluorescence live cell imaging and specific inhibitors it was observed that CAR functions under the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) signaling cascade. Additionally, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-mediated inhibition of GSK3 also induced nuclear translocation of CAR linking CAR to the Akt signaling pathway. Identification of T38 residue of CAR as the GSK3 target site further substantiated our observations. Taking cues from these findings, we propose a hypothetical model elucidating the GSK3-mediated regulation of CAR dynamics through the involvement of Akt pathway. Further research into this area is expected to provide novel therapeutic targets in disease conditions like type 2 diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma.
