Sorafenib has been systemically utilized to therapy the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Natural killer cells (NKs) are important cytotoxic innate lymphocytes, which can exert effector functions especially in liver and tumor. However, how Sorafenib affects the function of NKs remains to be elucidated. Here, we utilized the subcutaneous and in situ tumor bearing mice with mouse hepatoma cell line hepa 1-6. At the endpoint, the number and function of NKs in blood, liver, TDLN, and tumor were explored using FACS, ELISA, WB, etc. To confirm the direct effects of Sorafenib on NKs, the NKs were sorted using FACS, which were then stimulated with Sorafenib to detect the functions and the relevant mechanisms using qPCR, western blot, and FACS in vitro. Finally, we found that Sorafenib led to a significant block of tumor progression, but reduced the number of NK cells through suppressing the proliferation of NK cells. This phenotype made us study the terminal function of NK cells, revealing that Sorafenib could decrease the production of effector molecules and cytokines, such as perforin, granzyme B, TNF-α, IFN-γ, etc. Besides, p-ERK1/2 in NK cells was inhibited after treatment with Sorafenib, and a similar tendency of NK cells could be achieved using ERK1/2 inhibitor. Collectively, our data suggested that Sorafenib functioned as a critical inhibitor that controlled the number and function of NK cells through inhibiting ERK1/2.
