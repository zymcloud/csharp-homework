Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represent the most common primary liver malignancies whose outcome is influenced by the immune response.Methods:In this study, we have functionally characterized, by flow cytometry, circulating myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and FcεRI+ monocytes in a group of healthy individuals (n = 10) and in a group of patients with HCC (n = 19) and CCA (n = 8), at the time point of the surgical resection (T0) and once the patient had recovered from surgery (T1). Moreover, we proceeded to a more in depth phenotypic characterization of the FcεRI+ monocyte subpopulation.Results:A significant decrease in the frequency of TNFα producing FcεRI+ monocytes and mDCs in HCC and CCA patients when compared to the group of healthy individuals was observed, and a close association between FcεRI+ monocytes and mDCs dysfunction was identified. In addition, the phenotypic characteristics of FcεRI+ monocytes from healthy individuals strongly suggest that this population drives to mDCs, which matches with the fact that both populations are functionally affected.Conclusions:The frequency and the function of circulating mDCs and FcεRI+ monocytes are affected in both HCC and CCA patients, and FcεRI+ monocytes could represent those fated to become mDCs. © 2019 International Clinical Cytometry Society.
