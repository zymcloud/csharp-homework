Drug resistance occurs commonly in cancers, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in tumour chemoresistance. However, little is known about the role of miR-383 in HCC chemoresistance. In the present study, RT-PCR and western blotting were used to identify the expression profile of miR-383 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2). The bioinformatics website Targetscan was used to predict the target genes of miR-383. In vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies were performed to reveal the effects and potential mechanism of the miR-383/EIF5A2 axis in chemoresistance of HCC cells. The expression level of miR-383 correlated negatively with doxorubicin (Dox) sensitivity. Overexpression of miR-383 promoted HCC cells to undergo Dox-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, whereas miR-383 knockdown had the opposite effects. EIF5A2 was predicted as a target gene of miR-383. EIF5A2 knockdown sensitized HCC cells to Dox. Moreover, miR-383 inhibition-mediated HCC Dox resistance could be reversed by silencing EIF5A2. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-383 inhibition could enhance Dox sensitivity by targeting EIF5A2 in vivo. The results indicated that miR-383 inhibited Dox resistance in HCC cells by targeting EIF5A2. Targeting the miR-383/EIF5A2 axis might help to alleviate the chemoresistance of HCC cells.
