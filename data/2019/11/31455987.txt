Aims:To evaluate early outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with a novel radiopaque bead, the 75-150 μm DC Bead LUMI™ (Biocompatibles UK Ltd).Materials and methods:This was a retrospective review of the first 40 consecutive patients at a UK tertiary hepato-biliary centre, treated for HCC with TACE using radiopaque beads, between May 2017 and March 2019. Information regarding complications, mortality, lesion response and subsequent ablation procedures was collected from electronic records and case notes. Intra- and post-operative imaging was reviewed for visibility of the embolised territory.Results:Fifty-five TACE procedures were performed in 40 patients, with a median age of 70 years (range 28-88) and median lesion size of 3.8 cm (range 1.5-7.8). The median follow-up period was 30 weeks (range 6-101). Mean post-procedure hospital stay was 1.2 days. Complications of CIRSE Grade II or above occurred after 4/55 procedures (7.3%). Mortality at 30 days was zero. Objective response rates (mRECIST) at 1, 3 and 6 months were 32/35 (91.4%), 21/24 (87.5%) and 12/15 (80%), respectively. Complete response rates at 1, 3 and 6 months were 16/35 (45.7%), 12/24 (50%) and 9/15 (60%). The embolised territory was visible on intra-operative and follow-up CT imaging in all patients. The radiopaque beads were used as a fiducial marker to guide ablation in 5/40 patients (12.5%).Conclusion:TACE with radiopaque beads shows promising tolerability and efficacy. The radiopaque beads ensure visualisation of the embolised lesion on intra- and post-operative imaging and, in selected cases, can act as a marker for CT-guided ablation.
