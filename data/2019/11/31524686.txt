Purpose:To measure the SUVs in the tail of the pancreas compared with normal liver parenchyma and somatostatin receptor-positive lesions.Materials and methods:Ga-DOTATATE PET/low mAs CT of 35 patients were reviewed.Results:There was no significant difference (P = 0.59) between the SUVaverage of normal liver and the SUVpeak of normal tail. Five patients had uptake in the tail slightly above that of normal liver that were interpreted equivocally. In one of these patients with Ga-DOTATATE uptake in a peripancreatic lymph node, proven neuroendocrine tumor underwent a distal pancreatectomy and pathologic examination revealed islet cell hyperplasia.Conclusions:Ga-DOTATATE uptake in the tail of the pancreas above that of normal liver indicates a somatostatin receptor-avid lesion. Uptake in the tail of the pancreas equal to the liver can be normal. Patients with uptake equivalent to the liver should undergo further anatomical imaging before procedural intervention.
