Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is known to be one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) all over the world. Previously, multiple studies have confirmed a decreased rate of HCC occurrence or recurrence in the cases of hepatitis C associated cirrhosis after treatment with interferon, in comparison to the untreated cases, even in the absence of clearance of HCV. Treatment programs with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) as a new method for HCV treatment and cure in 2014, with higher safety and efficacy, were considered as an important step in the treatment of patients with history of HCC, improving their overall prognosis. Recently, reports coming from various European centers claimed that the risk of HCC increased following DAAs therapy, especially in cases with previous HCC. Moreover, other studies revealed that the recurrence of HCC after DAAs treatment was more aggressive. Even though others were not able to conclude the same results, the role of DAA therapy in recurrence of HCC in patients with previous HCC after sustained virological response (SVR) achievement remains questionable. This review explored the existing literature and discussed opinions on the possibility of increasing recurrence of HCC following DAA therapy, possible mechanisms, predictors of HCC recurrence post DAAs, and whether those patients should be treated or not.
