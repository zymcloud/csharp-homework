We describe a case of acute liver failure and myopericarditis due to herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) in an immunocompetent adult. We estimate that, at the height of viremia, the patient contained a quantity of HSV-1 virions approaching that of human cells. The patient recovered with acyclovir that was dose-adjusted for neurotoxicity and developed a vigorous anti-HSV-1 T-cell response.
