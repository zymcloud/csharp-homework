Aim:This study aimed to clarify the relationship between pre-sarcopenia (PS) and quality of life (QOL) in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD).Patients and methods:This cross-sectional study evaluated 335 patients with CLD. PS was diagnosed on the basis of the assessment criteria by the Japan Society of Hepatology. QOL was evaluated using the short form-36.Results:Patients' mean age was 69.52 ± 10.17 years, and 169 (50.4%) participants were men. The prevalence of PS was 53.7%. Patients were divided into the PS and non-pre-sarcopenia (NPS) groups. Patients in the PS group were older (71.84 ± 9.78 vs. 66.81 ± 9.97, P Conclusion:QOL characteristics of PS patients with CLD were low physical function, RP, and BP in short form-36. In addition, social role functioning was low in the PS patients aged 65-74 years, whereas RP and BP were low in those aged at least 75 years. Female sex and RP were independent predictors of PS according to the multivariate analysis. Maintaining and increasing muscle mass in patients with CLD may contribute toward improving physical QOL.
