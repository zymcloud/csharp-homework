Poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is frequently associated with rapid tumor growth, recurrence and drug resistance. MT1G is a low-molecular weight protein with high affinity for zinc ions. In the present study, we investigated the expression of MT1G, analyzed clinical significance of MT1G, and we observed the effects of MT1G overexpression on proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Our results revealed that MT1G was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues, and could inhibit the proliferation as well as enhance the apoptosis of HCC cells. The mechanism study suggested that MT1G increased the stability of p53 by inhibiting the expression of its ubiquitination factor, MDM2. Furthermore, MT1G also could enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 through direct interacting with p53 and providing appropriate zinc ions to p53. The modulation of MT1G on p53 resulted in upregulation of p21 and Bax, which leads cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively. Our in vivo assay further confirmed that MT1G could suppress HCC tumor growth in nude mice. Overall, this is the first report on the interaction between MT1G and p53, and adequately uncover a new HCC suppressor which might have therapeutic values by diminishing the aggressiveness of HCC cells.
