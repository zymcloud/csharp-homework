Dysregulation of microRNAs frequently contributes to the occurrence and progression of human diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the role of miR-450b-3p in HCC was investigated. Gene Expression Omnibus database and HCC specimens were used to evaluate the expression level of miR-450b-3p and the patient's prognosis. Cell functional analyses and tumor xenograft model were used to assess the role of miR-450b-3p in HCC. Bioinformatics was used to predict the downstream target gene of miR-450b-3p, which was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. MiR-450b-3p was found to be downregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues, compared with nontransformed immortal hepatic cells and adjacent normal liver tissues, respectively. Lower expression of miR-450b-3p was associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with HCC. Ectopic expression of miR-450b-3p inhibited HCC cell viability, colony formation, and cell-cycle progression in vitro, and suppressed the growth of HCC xenograft tumors in vivo. Interestingly, a negative correlation between miR-450b-3p and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) protein was observed among HCC specimens. Additionally, miR-450b-3p inhibited PGK1 expression and phosphorylation of protein kinase B in HCC cell lines. Further experiments confirmed that PGK1 was a direct target of miR-450b-3p. Moreover, restoration of PGK1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-450b-3p on HCC proliferation and cell division. In conclusion, miR-450b-3p is downregulated in human HCC and exerts tumor suppressive effects at least in part by inhibiting PGK1.
