We evaluated overall survivals (OSs) of alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients without LC compared to those with LC.Between 2005 and 2015, 1343 patients were initially diagnosed as having HCC in our hospital.

For the 117 cirrhotic patients, cumulative OS rate was significantly higher in the CTP class A patients than in the CTP class B (P
