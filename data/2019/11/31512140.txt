Introduction:Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a major cause of death in liver cirrhosis. This multicenter study aims to develop and validate a novel and easy-to-access model for predicting the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and acute GIB.Methods:Patients with cirrhosis and acute GIB were enrolled and randomly divided into the training (n = 865) and validation (n = 817) cohorts. In the training cohort, the independent predictors for in-hospital death were identified by logistic regression analyses, and then a new prognostic model (i.e., CAGIB score) was established. Area under curve (AUC) of CAGIB score was calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared with Child-Pugh, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), MELD-Na, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) scores.Results:In the training cohort, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diabetes, total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and serum creatinine (Scr) were independent predictors of in-hospital death. CAGIB score = diabetes (yes = 1, no = 0) × 1.040 + HCC (yes = 1, no = 0) × 0.974 + TBIL (μmol/L) × 0.005 - ALB (g/L) × 0.091 + ALT (U/L) × 0.001 + Scr (μmol/L) × 0.012 - 3.964. In the training cohort, the AUC of CAGIB score for predicting in-hospital death was 0.829 (95% CI 0.801-0.854, P Conclusion:CAGIB score has a good predictive performance for prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and acute GIB.
