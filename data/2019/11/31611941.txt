The accumulation of toxic bile acids (BAs) is closely related to liver injury, inflammation and tumorigenesis. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of the serum BA spectrum in the diagnosis and progression of liver cirrhosis. This was a prospective observational study involving patients with chronic hepatitis (n=23), liver cirrhosis (n=101), and cirrhosis complicated with hepatocellular carcinoma (CC-HCC; n=56). The 6-month survival of cirrhotic patients was recorded after blood collection. Comparisons of serum total BAs and individual BAs between different groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Correlation analysis was conducted by Spearman's correlation. Diagnosis and prediction analyses were performed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression analysis. The concentrations of total BAs, glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), taurochenoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) were increased significantly in patients with early cirrhosis compared to patients with chronic hepatitis (P
