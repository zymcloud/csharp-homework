Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve a crucial role in various types of cancer. The lncRNA AWPPH has been reported to promote hepatocellular carcinoma and bladder cancer progression. However, to the best of our knowledge, the biological roles of AWPPH in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unclear. In the present study, the levels of AWPPH in OS tissues and cell lines were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. An MTT assay was used to detect OS cell proliferation. The levels of proteins associated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and apoptosis were determined by western blotting. Wound-healing and Transwell assays were conducted to determine cell migration and invasion, respectively. The results demonstrated that AWPPH was highly expressed in OS tissues and cells. Functional analyses revealed that AWPPH depletion significantly inhibited OS cell proliferation and migration, and promoted OS cell apoptosis. Furthermore, AWPPH downregulation significantly inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway. The present study demonstrated that AWPPH was highly expressed in OS, and that AWPPH promoted OS cell proliferation and migration, and inhibited OS cell apoptosis, which may be mediated by PI3K/AKT pathway activation.
