Background:Gain-of-function pathogenic variants of the Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ERBB3) gene contribute to the occurrence and development of a variety of human carcinomas through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. ERBB3 gene homozygous germline variants, whose loss of function may cause autosomal recessive congenital contractural syndrome, were recently identified. This study aims to identify the disease-causing gene in a Chinese pedigree with variable phenotypes involving multiple systems, including developmental delay, postnatal growth retardation, transient lower limb asymmetry, facial malformations, atrioventricular canal malformation, bilateral nystagmus and amblyopia, feeding difficulties, immunodeficiency, anemia, and liver damage, but without congenital contracture.Methods:Trio-whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify the disease-causing gene in a 24-month-old Chinese female patient. The pathogenicity of the identified variants was evaluated using in silico tools and in vitro functional studies.Results:Trio-WES revealed compound heterozygous variants of c.1253 T > C (p.I418T) and c.3182dupA (p.N1061Kfs*16) in the ERBB3 gene. Functional studies showed that p.I418T resulted in normal expression of ERBB3, which was capable of interacting with ERBB2. However, the variant impaired ERBB3 phosphorylation, consequently blocking ERBB2 phosphorylation and AKT and ERK activation. The truncated protein resulting from the c.3182dupA variant also lacked the capacity to activate downstream signaling pathways.Conclusions:We report the first patient with a novel multisystem syndrome disorder without congenital contracture resulting from biallelic loss-of-function variants of ERBB3.
