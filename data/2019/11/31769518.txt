Recurrent hepatitis activity during chronic hepatitis B virus infection results in fibrosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. It is still unclear what causes acute exacerbation. As platelets have recently been identified as a significant role in inflammation, we here investigated the role of platelets in mediating liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Platelet aggregation testing and flow cytometry were carried out to evaluate platelet activation status in 121 patients chronically infected with hepatitis B across different phases of the condition. The correlation between platelet aggregation rate and liver inflammation or liver fibrosis index was evaluated. To investigate the genesis of platelet activation, several serum cytokines were also assessed by MILLIPLEX microsphere-based multiplex cytokine assay. Active hepatitis patients showed a higher aggregation rate than others. Levels of CD62p, a marker of platelet activation, were also increased in this group of patients. Positive correlations between platelet aggregation rate and liver inflammation or liver fibrosis were also noted, indicating a significant role of platelet in the progression of liver disease. The level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which is known to trigger platelet activation, was markedly higher in the active hepatitis group (P
