MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally responsible for regulating >70% of human genes. MicroRNA-708 (miR-708) is encoded in the intron 1 of the Odd Oz/ten-m homolog 4 (ODZ4) gene. Numerous researches have confirmed that the abnormal expressed miR-708 is involved in the regulation of multiple types of cancer. Notably, the expression level of miR-708 was higher in lung cancer, bladder cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines while lower in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), prostate cancer (PC), gastric cancer (GC) and so on. This review provides a current view on the association between miR-708 and several cancers and focuses on the recent studies of miR-708 regulation, discussing its potential as an epigenetic biomarker and therapeutic target for these cancers. In particular, the regulated mechanisms and clinical application of miR-708 in these cancers are also discussed.
