Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10), one member of the BMP family, is involved in various development events. Dysregulation of BMP10 has been observed in several diseases, including hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy, Hirschsprung disease and blood vessel formation. However, its role in liver cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we reported that BMP10 was significantly downregulated in HCC at both mRNA and protein level. Decreased BMP10 was associated with bigger tumor size, worse TNM stage, earlier recurrence and poorer survival. BMP10 negatively regulated HCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism study revealed that BMP10 suppressed tumor cell growth by inhibiting STAT3 signaling. Interestingly, we found that cytoplasmic BMP10 interacted with both receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS) and STAT3, which facilitated dephosphorylation of STAT3 by PTPRS. Altogether, our study has revealed the clinical significance of BMP10 in HCC, and suppression of HCC cell growth by BMP10 via PTPRS-STAT3 axis, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting STAT3 signaling in HCC.
