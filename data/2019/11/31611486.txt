Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plays an important role in the treatment of unresectable liver cancer. We conducted this meta-analysis to compare the clinical safety and efficacy of conventional TACE (C-TACE) and drug-eluting beads (DEB)-TACE. A search for those procedures was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. A meta-analysis of patients who underwent C-TACE or DEB-TACE was conducted. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Of 334 studies, 30 were analyzed. The complete response rate, disease control rate, objective response rate, 3-year survival rate, and non-response rate were significantly higher in patients who underwent DEB-TACE than those in patients who underwent C-TACE. The 1-year survival rate, 2-year survival rate, 30-day mortality rate, complete response rate, disease control rate, complete necrosis rate, non-response rate, objective response rate, progressive disease rate, and recurrence did not differ significantly between patients who underwent C-TACE and patients who underwent DEB-TACE. Patients who undergo DEB-TACE might have a higher complete response rate, disease control rate, and 3-year survival rate than patients who undergo C-TACE. Safety did not differ significantly between C-TACE and DEB-TACE.
