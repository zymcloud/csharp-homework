Cellular immunotherapy is a promising new therapeutic approach for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which has a high recurrence rate, irrespective of the treatment administered. In this study, we attempted to improve the cytolytic activity of effector T-lymphocytes against HCC. T-lymphocytes were activated by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with cell lysate or RNA prepared from HCC cell lines. Monocytes were activated for differentiation into DCs by treatment with the IL4 and GM-CSF. DCs were pulsed with cell lysate or RNA prepared from a single cell line or combinations of two or three HCC cell lines, and then co-cultured with autologous T-lymphocytes with the intent of creating specific cytotoxicity. We discovered that DCs pulsed with total RNA effectuated greater T-lymphocyte function than DCs pulsed with total cell lysate, as evidenced by greater cytolytic activities against HCC target cells. The percentage of Huh7, HepG2, and SNU449 cell apoptosis at effector:target ratio of 10:1 was 42.6 ± 4.5% (p = 0.01), 33.6 ± 3.1% (p = 0.007), and 21.4 ± 1.4% (p
