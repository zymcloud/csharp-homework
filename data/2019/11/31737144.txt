We present a case of acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas (ACC) with metastasis to the liver in a patient who presented with complaints abdominal pain. The presentation, diagnosis, and management of a 56-year-old man with ACC are discussed here. Imaging with computerized tomography (CT) in particular is crucial in the diagnosis, which can identify the primary lesion as well as metastases. ACC should be considered in the differential as a source of abdominal, epigastric, or back pain with imaging that is suggestive of the diagnosis as prompt recognition and initiation of treatment is paramount in the overall prognosis.
