Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major type of primary liver cancer. HCC is influenced by sex and multiple metabolic abnormalities. The present study aimed to compare the overall metabolic changes between male and female HCC patients and identify key metabolic genes. Metabolic genes and pathways were identified based on analyses of publicly available data. Differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, survival analysis and transcriptional regulation analysis were employed to explore sex differences and identify key metabolic genes in HCC. The results suggested that female patients had more severe metabolic gene expression abnormalities and pathway deregulation than male patients. This study identified 9 key metabolic genes, and only upregulated ALDH1A2 independently increased overall survival risk in patients. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that upregulated GATA3 and TAL1 activate ALDH1A2 and then disrupt amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, which may increase the risk of HCC. This study identified a novel contribution of upregulated ALDH1A2 to HCC. Future studies are needed to elucidate the potential metabolic mechanism of the role of ALDH1A2 in HCC.
