Backgrounds:Glyoxalase I (GLO1), a ubiquitous enzyme involved in the process of detoxification of methylglyoxal in the cellular glycolysis pathway, was reported to be highly expressed in human tumor. It has also been found that GLO1 is associated with tumor cell survival and proliferation in some types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer. However, the role of GLO1 in glioma has not been clarified. The purpose of present study is to explore the expression pattern of GLO1 and whether the expression level of GLO1 is associated with the unfavorable clinical outcomes of patients with glioma.Methods:Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry staining were used to investigate the mRNA and protein level of GLO1 in glioma tissues together with normal brain tissues. The prognostic role of GLO1 in glioma patients was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Clinical outcomes were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. The function of GLO1 in glioma cell lines were investigated by in vitro experiments.Results:Expression level of GLO1 was higher in glioma tissues than that in normal brain tissues. High GLO1 expression was significantly correlated with WHO grade and the poor overall survival time in glioma patients. Moreover, GLO1 was also defined as an unfavorable prognosis factor. Overexpression of GLO1 in the glioma cell line U87 can enhance the tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Whereas, knockdown of GLO1 can suppress those abilities.Conclusions:Our studies demonstrated that GLO1 was highly expressed in glioma tissues and significantly correlated with the poor prognosis of glioma patients. It indicated that GLO1 might serve as a new prognostic predictor and therapeutic target for glioma treatment.
