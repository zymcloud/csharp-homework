Some postoperative gastric cancer patients have to terminate systemic intravenous chemotherapy early due to adverse drug reactions. We performed a retrospective study to explore the efficacy and feasibility of sequential therapy.We retrospectively analyzed 55 postoperative gastric cancer patients (Group A) who received sequential therapy (intravenous chemotherapy and S-1) and 53 patients (Group B) who received intravenous chemotherapy from January 2012 to December 2013 in our hospital. The therapeutic effect (including 1-year, 5-year tumor recurrence and survival rate) and the incidence of adverse reactions were analyzed.When death and survival for more than 5 years was regarded as the end point of follow-up, the mean follow-up period was 40.6 months (34.7-46.4) in Group A and 39.2 months (33.0-45.3) in Group B. The 1-year tumor recurrence after the operation was 23.6% (13/55, Group A) and 28.3% (15/53, Group B). The 5-year tumor recurrence was 45.5% (25/55, Group A) and 49.1% (26/53, Group B). There was no significant difference in the 1- and 5-year tumor recurrence rates between these two groups (P > .05). The 1-year survival rates of Group A and Group B were 81.8% (45/55) and 79.2% (42/53), respectively, and the 5-year survival rates of Group A and Group B were 47.3% (26/55) and 45.3% (24/53), respectively. No significant difference was observed between these two treatments at either the 1- or 5-year survival benefit (P > .05). However, the patients in Group A had a lower incidence of gastrointestinal reactions (such as nausea and vomiting), leukopenia and liver function damage (P < .05). We also found that patients who underwent sequential therapy might show lower levels of adverse reactions.Our retrospective study provided some evidence to suggest that sequential treatment is effective and safe for postoperative gastric cancer patients who are intolerant to intravenous chemotherapy.
