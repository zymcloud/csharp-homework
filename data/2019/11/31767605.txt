We present a case of a 63-year-old woman with an acute history of abdominal distension and shortness of breath. She had no risk factors for liver disease though her prior medical history was positive for breast carcinoma, in remission for 14 years. Examination and investigations were initially consistent with decompensated cirrhosis, thought to be due to subclinical autoimmune hepatitis. Imaging revealed hepatic contour irregularity, atrophy of the liver parenchyma and numerous lesions highly suggestive for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. Surprisingly, tissue histology revealed no evidence of cirrhosis, but recurrence of breast cancer which had mimicked cirrhosis. Pseudocirrhosis may be indistinguishable from true cirrhosis without histopathology. It has previously been linked to chemotherapy-induced hepatic injury and nodular regenerative hyperplasia, although our case illustrates an uncommon pathophysiology. Pseudocirrhosis often represents a poor prognosis even with a good baseline performance status, and early involvement of palliative care specialists may be advisable.
