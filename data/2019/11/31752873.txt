Background:Overexpression of erythropoietin (EPO) and EPO receptor (EPO-R) is associated with poor prognosis in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Hypoxia, a potent EPO inducer, is a major stimulating factor in the growth of solid tumors. However, how EPO-R expression is regulated under hypoxia is largely unknown.Methods:The role of EPO-R in NSCLC cell proliferation was assessed by RNA interference in vitro. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to map the promoter elements involved in the EPO-R mRNA transcription. Nuclear co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to assess the interaction among transcription factors HIF1α, SP1, and EGR1 in the regulation of EPO-R under hypoxia. The expression of key EPO-R transcription factors in clinical specimens were determined by immunohistochemistry.Results:Hypoxia induced a dosage and time dependent EPO-R mRNA expression in NSCLC cells. Knockdown of EPO-R reduced NSCLC cell growth under hypoxia (P < 0.05). Mechanistically, a SP1-EGR1 overlapped DNA binding sequence was essential to the hypoxia induced EPO-R transcription. In the early phase of hypoxia, HIF1α interacted with EGR1 that negatively regulated EPO-R. With the exit of EGR1 in late phase, HIF1α positively regulated EPO-R expression through additive interaction with SP1. In clinical NSCLC specimen, SP1 was positively while EGR1 was negatively associated with active EPO-R expression (P < 0.05).Conclusions:HIF1α, SP1 and EGR1 mediated EPO-R expression played an essential role in hypoxia-induced NSCLC cell proliferation. Our study presents a novel mechanism of EPO-R regulation in the tumor cells, which may provide information support for NSCLC diagnosis and treatment.
