Objective:In this case report, we describe our experience with a patient who was treated for rectal adenocarcinoma complicated with primary cholangiocarcinoma of the liver and highlight the problems in the diagnosis and treatment of these potentially fatal lesions.Methods:In the clinical setting, we often use the concept of “monism” for diagnosis and treatment. In this report, we review the diagnosis and treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma complicated with primary cholangiocarcinoma of the liver.Results:Four months after surgery, the patient’s carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was elevated, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed multiple liver metastases. The patient underwent three rounds of transarterial chemoembolisation and two rounds of radiofrequency ablation at our hospital for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. The clinical response was poor and indicative of progression of intrahepatic lesions.Conclusion:A preoperative multidisciplinary team, rapid intraoperative pathological examination, and active comprehensive postoperative treatment are necessary to improve the prognosis of multiple primary tumours.
Multiple primary tumours; carbohydrate antigen 19-9; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; liver metastasis; rectal adenocarcinoma; transarterial chemoembolisation.
