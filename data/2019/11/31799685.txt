Objective:Two case reports of advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with lenvatinib (LenvimaÂ®) are presented; the drug's effect on muscle loss and duration of treatment are discussed.Patients and methods:Between November 2014 and December 2017, at the Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy, two male patients with advanced HCC enrolled in the lenvatinib arm of the REFLECT trial received the drug over 24 cycles (almost 2 years). We reviewed the clinical charts from baseline, when lenvatinib was started, through 24 months of treatment. The changes in the skeletal mass area (SMA), as assessed by computed tomography (CT) at the third lumbar level (L3), between baseline and month 24 into treatment were recorded.Results:Case 1: SMA decreased by 2.8 cm2 between baseline and month 24 (134 cm2 vs. 131.2 cm2), with a muscle loss of 2.13%. Case 2: SMA decreased by 13 cm2 between baseline and month 24 (133 cm2 vs. 120 cm2), with a muscle loss of 10.83%.Conclusions:The disease remained stable for over 2.5 years in both patients. A minimal loss of muscle mass was noted at 24 months of treatment. The minimum effect on muscle loss may be correlated with the positive clinical response and the drug's low toxicity. Our findings may help to elucidate the effect of lenvatinib on muscle mass and inform the development of the targeted nutritional support for HCC patients.
