Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an inflammation-induced and chemotherapy-resistant cancer. Dysregulated signaling in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway plays a central role in inflammation, fibrogenesis, and immunomodulation in the HCC microenvironment. This review dissects the genetic landscape of the TGF-β superfamily genes in HCC and discusses the essential effects of this pathway on the tumor immune microenvironment. We highlight the TGF-β signature as a potential biomarker for identifying individualized immunotherapeutic approaches in HCC. An improved understanding of the detailed mechanisms of liver cancer immunogenicity and the specific role of TGF-β in mediating immunotherapy resistance in HCC will provide important insights into HCC immune escape and promote the development of biomarker-derived combination immunotherapies for HCC.
