Patients with HCV-related bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis remain at risk of developing life-threatening complications even after achieving a sustained virological response. Although it is reduced, the risk of liver-related events in these patients justifies their inclusion in surveillance programmes dedicated to the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma and the screening for portal hypertension. Biochemical parameters or non-invasive tests might indicate the potential progression of liver injury despite viral clearance. Specific attention must be focused on the management of comorbidities, while dedicated educational programmes must be encouraged to increase compliance and commitment to surveillance. Better knowledge of the long-term evolution of these patients, who now live longer, is essential to improve risk stratification and refine screening strategies in this growing population.
