Objective: To study the relationship between the expressions of tuftelin 1 (TUFT1) and the clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma and its effect on proliferation and apoptosis, and to explore the relationship between TUFT1 with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of TUFT1 in 98 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and 30 cases of adjacent normal tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of TUFT1 in HCC cell line. The expression of TUFT1 in SMMC-7221 cell lines was down-regulated by lentiviral vector. Cell proliferation assay, clonogenic assay, cell apoptosis assay and cell cycle assay were used to detect proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle changes of hepatocarcinoma cells after TUFT1-down-regulation. Statistics were performed using the χ2 test and the t-test. Results: Among the 98 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 65 cases (66.33%) were positive for TUFT1, and in 30 cases of adjacent normal tissues, 6 cases (16.67%) were positive for TUFT1, and the difference was statistically significant (χ (2) = 19.956, P < 0.05). The expression of TUFT1 in HCC tissues was related to tumor size, tumor stage, recurrence and metastasis (χ(2) = 6.214, 8.066, 14.400, P < 0.05). After lentiviral vector mediated downregulation of TUFT1 expression in SMMC -7221 cells, the cell proliferation rate [(18.62% ± 0.15%) vs. (67.91% ± 0.62%), P < 0.05], clonality [(8.10% ± 0.80%) vs. (50.80% ± 1.60%), P < 0.05] and G1 phase cells [(36.71% ± 0.69%) vs. (44.65% ± 0.73%), P < 0.05] were significantly decreased, whereas the G2 phase cells [ (15.44% ± 0.53%) vs. (22.31% ± 0.20%), P < 0.05] and the rate of apoptosis [(3.45% ± 0.18%) vs. (5.45% ± 0.06%), P < 0.05] was significantly increased compared with the control group of HCC cells, and the differences were statistically significant. Conclusion: The expression of TUFT1 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, the expression of TUFT1 promotes HCC cell proliferation, inhibits the apoptosis, and is poor prognostic factor of hepatocellular carcinoma.
