Since its introduction in 2012, associating liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) has significantly expanded the pool of candidates for liver resection. It offers patients with insufficient liver function a chance of a cure. ALPPS is most controversial when its high morbidity and mortality is concerned. Operative mortality is usually a result of post-hepatectomy liver failure and can be minimized with careful patient selection. Elderly patients have limited reserve for tolerating the demanding operation. Patients with colorectal liver metastasis have normal liver and are ideal candidates. ALPPS for cholangiocarcinoma is technically challenging and associated with fair outcomes. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have chronic liver disease and limited parenchymal hypertrophy. However, in selected patients with limited hepatic fibrosis satisfactory outcomes have been produced. During the inter-stage period, serum bilirubin and creatinine level and presence of surgical complication predict mortality after stage II. Kinetic growth rate and hepatobiliary scintigraphy also guide the decision whether to postpone or omit stage II surgery. The outcomes of ALPPS have been improved by a combination of technical modifications. In patients with challenging anatomy, partial ALPPS potentially reduces morbidity, but remnant hypertrophy may compare unfavorably to a complete split. When compared to conventional two-stage hepatectomy with portal vein embolization or portal vein ligation, ALPPS offers a higher resection rate for colorectal liver metastasis without increased morbidity or mortality. While ALPPS has obvious theoretical oncological advantages over two-stage hepatectomy, the long-term outcomes are yet to be determined.
