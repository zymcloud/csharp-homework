Background/aim:This study aimed to identify the survival benefit of intrahepatic tumour control by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT) or extrahepatic metastasis.Patients and methods:Between 2010 and 2017, a total of 187 consecutive patients with advanced HCC were treated with HAIC. The survival outcomes and response rates to HAIC were analysed.Results:The intrahepatic objective response (OR) rate of all enrolled patients was 18.7%. The survival outcome of patients with OR was significantly better from those without OR, irrespective of initial distant metastasis. Achievement of intrahepatic OR by HAIC and favourable liver function at the time of best response evaluation were two independent factors associated with better OS.Conclusion:HAIC-induced intrahepatic tumour reduction significantly prolonged patient survival, irrespective of PVTT or initial distant metastasis.
