Background:Congestive hepatopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication after Fontan procedure. Liver fibrosis due to hepatic congestion could occur also in adult patients after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF). However, the incidence and severity remain unclear.Methods:A total of 111 patients with adult congenital heart disease between 2009 and 2016 were enrolled. Liver fibrosis markers and hemodynamic parameters assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and catheterization were analyzed in 50 rTOF patients having significant pulmonary regurgitation and/or stenosis, 50 Fontan patients and 11 controls.Results:Liver fibrosis markers in patients with rTOF were significantly higher than controls, and tended to be lower than Fontan patients (median, hyaluronic acid: 25.8 vs. 15.9 vs. 40.8, type IV collagen: 129 vs. 113 vs. 166, ng/mL, p Conclusions:We first demonstrated elevated liver fibrosis markers in adult patients with rTOF. These levels may help to predict the progressive liver disease as well as consider the timing of pulmonary valve replacement.
