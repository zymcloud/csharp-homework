Objectives:To assess the efficacy of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and compare DKI-derived parameters with conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for distinguishing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from benign hepatic nodules including focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), hemangioma, and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA).Materials and methods:151 patients with 182 hepatic nodules (114 HCCs and 68 benign nodules including 33 FNHs, 29 hemangiomas, and 6 HCAs) were analyzed. Preoperative MRI examinations including DKI (b values: 0, 200, 500, 800, 1500, and 2000 sec/mm2) were performed, and kurtosis (K), diffusivity (D), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated. The efficacy of DKI-derived parameters K, D, and ADC for distinguishing HCC from these benign nodules was analyzed.Results:ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) analysis showed the optimal cutoff values of ADC, D, and K for identification of these benign nodules, and HCCs were 1.295 (area under the curve (AUC): 0.826; sensitivity 80.6%; specificity 70.8%), 1.787 (AUC: 0.770; sensitivity 83.6%; specificity 59.6%), and 1.002 (AUC: 0.761; sensitivity 65.5%; specificity 79.0%), respectively. Statistically significant differences were found in ADC, D, and K values between groups of HCC-FNH and HCC-hemangioma (P < 0.05). There were significant differences in K and ADC values between groups of FNH-hemangioma and HCA-hemangioma (P < 0.05), respectively. Using logistic regression analysis, a regression equation was obtained: Logit(P)=-1.982X 1+1.385X 3+1.948(X 1: ADC; X 3: K), and odds ratios (OR) were 0.138 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.052, 0.367), and 8.996 (95% CI: 0.970, 16.460), respectively.Conclusion:Both ADC value and DKI-derived parameters K and D values have demonstrated a higher preoperative efficacy in distinguishing HCC from FNH, hemangioma, and HCA. No evidence was shown to suggest D or K value was superior to the ADC value.
