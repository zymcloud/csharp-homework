We evaluated the post-treatment overall survival (OS) of elderly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.The archived records of 10,578 HCC patients registered at the Korean Central Cancer Registry from 2008 through 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. In this registry, we selected Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) 0, A, or B staged HCC patients (n = 4744) treated by surgical resection (SR), local ablation therapy (LAT), or locoregional therapy (LRT). OSs in nonelderly ( .05). In BCLC 0-A staged elderly patients, OS after SR was significantly better than after LAT (P = .005) or LRT (P 3 cm) tumor size (HR1.49, P = .018) were poor predictors of OS for elderly patients with BCLC stage 0-A, and that LRT (HR, 2.64, P = .042) was a poor predictor for those with BCLC stage B.SR provided a better OS rate than LAT or LRT in elderly HCC patients with BCLC stage 0-A, than LRT in those with BCLC stage B. SR should be considered the first therapeutic option even in elderly HCC patients with these stages.
