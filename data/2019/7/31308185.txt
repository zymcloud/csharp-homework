We describe the case of a man with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) and numerous metastatic lesions restricted to the liver. Despite extensive courses of various systemic targeted chemotherapies, progressive disease was noted on CT and MRI and the patient suffered from persistent abdominal pain associated with his metastatic lesions. The liver lesions and associated symptoms were effectively palliated with serial transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). While it is unclear if TACE has impacted his overall survival, this case encourages the use of TACE for palliative intent for patients with metastatic chRCC.
