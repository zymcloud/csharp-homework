Purposes:The purpose of this study was to review the clinical course of patients with recurrence after induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (trimodality therapy) for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) and to identify the factors associated with favorable clinical outcome after recurrence.Methods:We analyzed the records of 140 patients with LA-NSCLC who were treated with trimodality therapy between 1999 and 2014.Results:Recurrence developed after trimodality therapy in 48 patients. A yp-N positive status was associated with a high risk of recurrence (HR, 2.05; P = 0.048). Of the 45 of these patients able to be assessed retrospectively, 18 had oligometastatic recurrence and 20 underwent local treatment with curative intent. Local treatment was most frequently given to patients with oligometastatic recurrence (P < 0.001). The median post-recurrence survival (PRS) was 41.4 months, and the 2-year PRS rate was 62%. Patients who received local treatment showed better PRS (P = 0.009). The presence of liver metastasis (P = 0.008), bone metastasis (P = 0.041), or dissemination (P < 0.0001) were associated with worse PRS.Conclusion:The survival of patients who received aggressive local treatment for postoperative recurrence after trimodality therapy for LA-NSCLC was better than that of patients who did not.
