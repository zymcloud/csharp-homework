Background: Endometriosis is a chronic fibrotic disease characterized by agonizing pelvic pain and low fertility, mainly affecting middle-aged women. The aim of the present study is to assess the potential effects of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma A3 (EPHA3) on endometriosis, with emphasis on the autophagy and apoptosis of macrophages via inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Methods: The mouse models of endometriosis were established followed by culturing the macrophages and macrophage transfection via the EPHA3 vector, siRNA EPHA3, and RAPA (an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling pathway). The expression of EPHA3, related factors in the mTOR signaling pathway, macrophage autophagy (autophagy-related gene 3 (Atg3), light chain 3-I (LC3-I), light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Beclin1) and apoptosis (B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), bax and fas) were all detected and documented, respectively. The changes of autophagic lysosomes and the apoptosis of macrophages in each group following transfection were also inspected and detected.Results: The results of the in silico analysis ascertained EPHA3 to be a candidate gene of endometriosis. After successful modeling, the uterine tissues of endometriosis mice presented with a low expression of EPHA3 and activated mTOR signaling pathway. Overexpression of EPHA3 inhibited the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, down-regulated bcl-2 expression, up-regulated the expression of Atg3, LC3-II/LC3-I, Beclin1, bax and fas, and also promoted the autophagy and apoptosis of macrophages in endometriosis mice.Conclusion: Altogether, EPHA3 could potentially promote the autophagy and apoptosis of macrophages in endometriosis via inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway, highlighting the potential of EPHA3 as the target to treat endometriosis.
