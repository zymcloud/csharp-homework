Background:Growing evidence supports that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with extrahepatic cancers. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and breast cancer share similar risk factors, including obesity.Aim:The aim of this case-control study was to investigate the association between NAFLD and breast cancer.Methods:Subjects who received health screening, including mammography and breast and hepatic ultrasonography simultaneously, were included. Subjects diagnosed with breast cancer were matched with controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed.Results:Among 270 breast cancer patients and 270 controls, 81 cancer patients (30.0%) and 54 controls (20.0%) had NAFLD (P = 0.008). NAFLD was significantly associated with breast cancer in multivariate analysis (P = 0.046). When the interaction between obesity (BMI < 25 kg/m2 vs. â‰¥25 kg/m2) and NAFLD in breast cancer patients was examined, a significant effect modification between obesity and NAFLD in breast cancer was noted (P = 0.021). The subgroup analysis showed that NAFLD was significantly associated with breast cancer in the nonobese subgroup (odds ratio 3.04, 95% confidence interval 1.37-4.32, P = 0.002) but not in the obese group (P = 0.163).Conclusions:NAFLD was significantly associated with breast cancer independent of traditional risk factors, and this association existed in the nonobese subgroup but not in the obese subgroup.
