Purpose:There are several studies on premedication to prevent postembolization syndromes which occurs after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), but the medication to be used is still not established. This study aimed to examine the effect of palonosetron and dexamethasone on the prevention of gastrointestinal symptoms induced by TACE.Methods:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with TACE with epirubicin were retrospectively evaluated. The complete response rate of antiemetic drugs and incidence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms were compared between the antiemetic group (AE group), which includes 51 patients prophylactically administered with palonosetron 0.75 mg and dexamethasone 9.9 mg intravenously before TACE on day 1 and dexamethasone 6.6 mg intravenously on days 2 and 3, and control group with 101 patients without antiemetic premedication.Results:Complete response rate in the entire evaluation period was significantly higher in the AE group compared with that in the control group. In the acute phase, the incidence and severity of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia significantly decreased in the AE group, but only anorexia improved in the delay phase. Additionally, postembolization syndromes, such as abdominal pain and fever, were significantly attenuated in the AE group; however, constipation worsened in this group.Conclusions:Premedication of palonosetron and dexamethasone significantly prevents the incidence and reduces the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms especially in the acute phase. Further studies will be needed to determine the most recommended 5-HT3 antagonist or dosage of dexamethasone in establishing the optimal antiemetic regimen.
