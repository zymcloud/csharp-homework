Aim: Doxorubicin-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) is reported to improve survival and tolerability when compared with conventional lipiodol-TACE (cTACE) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate tolerability and long-term survival in patients treated with cTACE or DEB-TACE in a real-life setting. Methods: Incidence of adverse events and overall survival in HCC patients treated with either cTACE or DEB-TACE at Karolinska University Hospital 2004-2012 were analyzed retrospectively. Median follow-up was 7.1 years. Patients were censored when transplanted or at the end of follow-up. Patients receiving both cTACE and DEB-TACE, or treated with resection or ablation post-TACE were excluded from the survival analysis. Results: A total of 202 patients (76 cTACE and 126 DEB-TACE) were eligible for analysis of adverse events, and 179 patients (69 cTACE and 110 DEB-TACE) were included in the survival analysis. cTACE patients were younger and had fewer tumors but higher BCLC stage than DEB-TACE. Child-Pugh and ECOG performance status were similar between groups. Adverse events (abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, fever, fatigue) were significantly less common in the DEB-TACE group. Median survival was 17.1 months in the cTACE group and 19.1 months in the DEB-TACE (NS). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, portal vein thrombosis and tumor size were associated with increased, and sorafenib treatment post-TACE with decreased mortality. Conclusion: In this retrospective real-life analysis, DEB-TACE had better tolerability compared to cTACE, but overall survival did not differ between the two treatments. Portal vein thrombosis, tumor size and sorafenib treatment after TACE influence survival.
