Background: There is no guideline recommendation for preventing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after hepatic resection. Moreover, an unmet need exists on the effectiveness of sorafenib therapy in recurrent HCC. Purpose: We therefore assessed the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in Chinese HCC patients with high risk of recurrence. Patients and methods: Data were collected retrospectively from 15 Chinese research centers from January 1, 2012 to November 15, 2013, by chart reviews of patients with moderate-advanced HCC who received hepatic carcinectomy. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival rate at 1 year in patients with a high recurrence risk. Secondary end points included 1-year survival rate, time to recurrence and safety assessment. Results: A total of 209 high-risk patients (sorafenib, n=98; control, n=111) who underwent carcinectomy were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with recurrence-free survival at 1 year between the sorafenib and control (70.43% vs 68.90%: χ2=0.007, P=0.934). One-year survival rate was significantly higher with sorafenib than observed with control (95.5% vs 83.35%; χ2=7.441, P=0.006). Time to recurrence between sorafenib and control groups was similar. Incidences of all the adverse events (AEs) were similar in both the groups and transaminase elevation was most common in both groups (20.37% vs 24.79%). Thrombocytopenia incidence was significantly lower with the sorafenib group than with control (1.85% vs 9.40%; P=0.015). Conclusion: Sorafenib may be considered as a feasible option in the treatment of HCC recurrence.
