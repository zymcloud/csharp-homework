Development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually preceded by chronic liver injury and ongoing liver diseases. Liver cirrhosis reflects the outcome of long-term liver injury and is associated with an increased risk of developing HCC. However, HCC also arises in individuals without cirrhosis and bears several characteristics distinct from HCC in the cirrhotic liver. The molecular characteristics, prognosis, and surveillance of noncirrhotic HCC have not been adequately studied. In this review, we update readers and researchers in the field with the latest understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment strategies, prognosis, and surveillance of noncirrhotic HCC.
