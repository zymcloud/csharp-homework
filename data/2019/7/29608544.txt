Objective:We reviewed nationwide follow-up data to determine outcomes of different treatments for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in elderly patients.Summary background data:Outcomes of early-stage HCC treatments in elderly patients have not been prospectively compared.Methods:We included 6490 HCC patients, aged ≥75 years at treatment, who underwent curative hepatic resection (HR, n = 2020), radiofrequency ablation (RFA, n = 1888), microwave ablation (MWA, n = 193), or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE, n = 2389), and compared their characteristics and survival. We used matching propensity score analysis (PSA) between the HR and RFA subgroups with tumors ≤3 cm to overcome baseline bias.Results:The HR group had significantly longer recurrence-free survival (RFS) than the RFA, MWA, and TACE groups [RFA vs HR-hazard ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09-1.37, P Conclusions:HR decreases recurrence risk and improves OS in patients aged ≥75 years with primary HCC tumors ≤3.0 cm.
