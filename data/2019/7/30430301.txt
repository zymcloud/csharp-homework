Purpose:Patients' involvement in their own care is important for those with upper abdominal tumours. Care is often conducted according to standardized fast-track care programs (FTCP), and a shorter hospital stay is one of the goals. However, there is no research providing an in-depth perspective on patients' experiences of involvement in care. In this qualitative study, we explored experiences of involvement among patients who had surgery for upper abdominal tumours and were cared for according to an FTCP.Methods:Qualitative in-depth face-to-face interviews about patient involvement in care were conducted with 20 patients who had surgery for the liver, bile duct, or pancreatic cancer using an open-interview guide.Results:The most important findings are that customized information and active dialogue about care decisions stimulate patient involvement. We identified three themes from the analysed data: involvement depended on the quality of information, communication and involvement during the care period, and safety at discharge.Conclusions:Individualized care and continuous information about treatment and care goals in the FTCP during the care process create trust between patients and healthcare professionals and increase patient experiences of involvement.
