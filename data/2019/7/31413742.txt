Background and Aims: Although previous studies suggested that female patients who underwent curative resection in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had better survival rates than male patients, it is unclear whether females in different HCC stages actually have survival advantage. This study aimed to investigate whether gender differences in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification system contributed to different survival outcomes in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 1,753 patients diagnosed with HBV-related HCC between January 2008 and June 2017 at the Beijing Ditan hospital. The BCLC stages were classified into BCLC stage 0-B and BCLC stage C-D groups. Factors determining overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed via univariate and multivariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Results: The cohort consisted of 1,202 BCLC stage 0-B and 551 BCLC stage C-D HBV-related HCC patients. Gender was identified to be an independent risk factor for OS (HR = 0.617; 95% CI, 0.426-0.895; p = 0.011) and PFS (HR = 0.728; 95% CI, 0.558-0.950; p = 0.019) in BCLC stage 0-B HBV-related HCC patients. With respect to OS and PFS, there were significant differences between female and male patients only in BCLC stage 0-B, but not in BCLC stage C-D. The OS and PFS in BCLC stage 0-B for female patients was significantly greater than that for male patients (p = 0.0103, p = 0.0112). Tumor multiplicity and size were independent risk factors for female patients in BCLC stage 0-B, whereas tumor multiplicity, tumor size, HBV-DNA, hemoglobin, total bilirubin, and alpha-fetoprotein levels were independent risk factors for male patients in BCLC stage 0-B. Conclusions: Different outcomes in OS or PFS with respect to gender only exist in BCLC stage 0-B HBV-related HCC patients. Female patients have a better outcome than male patients in BCLC stage 0-B.
