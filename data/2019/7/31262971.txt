Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the commonest malignancies in the urinary system. Recent evidences have shown that Phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (LHPP) serves as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical cancer. However, little is known about its function in BC. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of LHPP in BC. We found that LHPP was down-regulated in BC tissues and cells. Knockdown of LHPP promoted the proliferation and growth of BC cells T24 and 5637. Inverse results were observed in SW780 and BIU87 cells with ectopic LHPP expression. LHPP also repressed the glycolysis of BC cells. At the molecular level, LHPP silencing led to enhanced phosphorylation of both AKT and p65, as well as up-regulation of their downstream targets Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1. Inhibition of AKT by MK2206 blunted the increased phosphorylation of p65 caused by LHPP knockdown, suggesting that LHPP silencing activated p65 through AKT. Importantly, p65 inhibitor (caffeic acid phenethyl ester) exhibited larger suppressive effect on the proliferation of LHPP knockdown BC cells as compared with Ctrl cell. Our study demonstrates that LHPP suppresses BC cell growth via inactivating AKT/p65 signaling pathway.
