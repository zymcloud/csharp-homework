Background: The benefits of anatomical resection (AR) and non-anatomical resection (NAR) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with microscope vascular invasion (MVI) remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the prognostic outcomes of AR and NAR for HCC patients with MVI. Study Design: A total of 362 consecutive HCC patients diagnosed with MVI after hepatic resection between February 2005 and December 2013 were included in this study. The patient outcomes were compared, and a 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was applied to eliminate selection bias. Results: Before PSM, compared to the NAR group, the AR group contained more patients that exceeded the Milan criteria, with larger, unilobar tumors and higher AST levels. After PSM, 100 patients were classified into the propensity-matched AR group (PS-AR), while 170 were classified into the propensity-matched NAR group (PS-NAR). Baseline data, including liver function and tumor burden measurements, were similar in the matched groups. The respective 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 78.9%, 56.9%, and 51.5% in the PS-AR group and 76.2%, 53.0%, and 42.4% in the PS-NAR group (P = 0.301). The 1-, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 51.1%, 44.7% and 42.0% in the PS-AR group and 44.9%, 34.3% and 26.4% in the PS-NAR group, respectively (P = 0.039). Multivariate analysis identified AR (P=0.025) as an independent favorable prognostic factor for DFS in HCC patients with MVI. Conclusions: Anatomical resection was superior to non-anatomical resection for improving DFS in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with microscope vascular invasion.
