Mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR) is a protein-coding gene, and the protein encoded by this gene is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII). Numerous studies have shown disorder of lipid metabolism is closely related with malignance, especially in liver cancer. Through pre-experiment, we found that the expression of MECR gene was highly expressed in hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) cell lines in vitro. This suggests that the MECR gene may play a role of oncogene in HCC. Therefore, we conducted a preliminary experimental study on the role of MECR gene in HCC cells in vitro. Objective to explore whether the MECR gene can affect the malignant biological behavior of HCC. We selected HCC cell line BEL-7404 as experimental cell, which involves the highest expression of MECR in the pre-experiment. We constructed MECR knockdwon lentivirus vector, and then infected HCC cell lines to down-regulate MECR expression, and establish negative control group (NC). Through various experiments of cytology, our study showed that knockdown of MECR inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, promoted apoptosis, and inhibited metastasis in HCC cell lines BEL-7404. MECR might serve as a novel gene therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. Further study is needed to elucidate the signaling pathway through which MECR functions in HCC.
