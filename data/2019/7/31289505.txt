Aberrantly elevated expression levels of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and vimentin are closely associated with disease progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It was previously demonstrated that knocking down expression of HDAC1 resulted in a concurrent decrease in the expression levels of vimentin. However, a causal link between these two proteins has not yet been demonstrated, to the best of our knowledge. In the present study, the association between HDAC1 and vimentin was investigated using an HDAC1 overexpression platform. HDAC1 and vimentin were significantly increased in HCC cells, and HDAC1 overexpression enhanced vimentin mRNA and protein expression levels in an HDAC1 dose-dependent manner. Subsequently, truncation and mutation of a vimentin promoter demonstrated that HDAC1-induced vimentin expression was dependent on a nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) binding site in the vimentin promoter sequence. Furthermore, HDAC1 induced vimentin expression by promoting NF-κB translocation between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as opposed to modulating the total expression level of vimentin directly. The data in the present study demonstrated that HDAC1 is overexpressed in HCC and that HDAC1 may upregulate vimentin expression through the NF-κB signaling pathway, thus demonstrating a causal link between HDAC1 and vimentin in HCC, and may provide valuable information in understanding the pathogenesis of HCC.
