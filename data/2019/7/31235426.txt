Background:With the development of RNA-seq technology, tens of thousands of circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of RNAs, have been identified. However, little is known about circRNA formation and biogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We performed ribosomal-depleted RNA-seq profiling of HCC and para-carcinoma tissues and analyzed the expression of a hotspot circRNA derived from the 3'UTR of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) gene, termed SCD-circRNA 2.Findings:It was significantly upregulated in HCC and correlated with poor patient prognosis. Moreover, we observed that the production of SCD-circRNA 2 was dynamically regulated by RNA-binding protein 3 (RBM3). RBM3 overexpression was indicative of a short recurrence-free survival and poor overall survival for HCC patients. Furthermore, by modulating the RBM3 or SCD-circRNA 2 levels, we found that RBM3 promoted the HCC cell proliferation in a SCD-circRNA 2 dependent manner.Interpretation:Herein, we report that RBM3 is crucial for the SCD-circRNA 2 formation in HCC cells, which not only provides mechanistic insights into cancer-related circRNA dysregulation but also establishes RBM3 as an oncogene with both therapeutic potential and prognostic value.
