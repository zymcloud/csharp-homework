Given the growing interest in using proton beam therapy (PBT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is possible that transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) could be used for selected patients who have previously undergone PBT. However, these cases can be technically challenging to treat and require appropriate preparation. Thus, we aimed to identify angiographic findings in this setting. We retrospectively identified 31 patients (28 men and 3 women, mean age: 69 years, range: 43-84 years) who underwent hepatic angiography plus TACE or transarterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) for HCC that recurred after PBT (July 2007 to June 2018). We discovered four angiographic findings, which we speculate were related to the previous PBT. 18 patients experienced recurrence in the irradiated field, and 13 patients experienced recurrence outside the irradiated field. 29 patients underwent TACE and only 2 patients underwent TAI. The mean number of previous PBT treatments was 1.3 Â± 0.6 (range: 1-4). The median interval from the earliest PBT treatment to hepatic angiography was 559 days (range: 34-5,383 days), and the median interval from the latest PBT treatment to hepatic angiography was 464 days (range: 34-5,383 days). Abnormal staining of the irradiated liver parenchyma was observed in 22 patients, which obscured the angiographic tumor staining in 4 patients. Development of a tortuous tumor feeder vessel was observed in 13 patients. Development of an extrahepatic collateral pathway was observed in 7 patients. Development of an arterioportal or arteriovenous shunt was observed in 4 patients. Based on these findings, we conclude that PBT was associated with various angiographic findings during subsequent transarterial chemotherapy for recurrent HCC, and familiarity with these findings will be important in developing appropriate treatment plans.
