Aberrant miR-629-5p expression in several cancer types has been reported. Nonetheless, its potential effect and mechanism of action on tumor growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have rarely been analyzed. In this study, we found that miR-629-5p was upregulated in HCC tissue samples as compared to matched adjacent-tissue samples. Overexpression of miR-629-5p promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of human HCC cells in vitro, whereas miR-629-5p knockdown reduced these parameters. Consistently, miR-629-5p overexpression accelerated tumor growth and metastasis in a nude mouse model. Mechanistically, miR-629-5p directly targeted the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) mRNA and suppressed its expression, resulting in the activation of β-catenin. Inhibition of β-catenin abrogated miR-629-5p-induced growth and invasiveness. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-629-5p activates β-catenin signaling by downregulating SFRP2 and thus promotes the growth and metastasis of HCC. These data open up new prospects for HCC treatment.
