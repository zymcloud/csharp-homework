Objective:To describe the liver imaging findings of Hereditary tyrosinemia type-1 (HT1) patients.Materials and methods:We report 16 patients (8 Female and 8 Male) with HT-1. Their demographic features, imaging findings and alpha feto protein (AFP) levels were recorded. Imaging features on CT and MR were evaluated for the following characteristics: contour of the liver and liver nodules. Liver nodules were categorized as; regenerative, dysplastic, fatty and malignant nodules (HCC).Results:Thirteen (81%) patients had multiple liver nodules (>20) on imaging studies. Five patients (31%) had regenerative nodules, six (38%) had dysplastic nodules and ten (63%) had fatty nodules. Dysplastic nodules were encountered in two patients with HCC and in four patients without a tumor. Four patients (25%) had HCC nodule on imaging studies. Those four patients had biopsy and all of them had HCC nodule on histopathology. In the follow-up period, in one patient fatty nodules had increased in size, in one patient regenerative nodules had disappeared and in one patient dysplastic nodules had disappeared.Conclusions:Multiple fatty nodules can be seen in HT1 patients and in some patients, the regenerative and dysplastic nodules can disappear during the follow-up period.
