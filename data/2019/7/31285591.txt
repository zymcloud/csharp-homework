Background:Chemotherapy with biologics followed by liver surgery improves the resection rate and survival of patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). However, no prospective study has compared the outcomes of chemotherapy with bevacizumab (BEV) versus cetuximab (CET).Methods:The ATOM study is the first randomised trial comparing BEV and CET for initially unresectable CRLM. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive mFOLFOX6 plus either BEV or CET. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).Results:Between May 2013 and April 2016, 122 patients were enrolled. Median PFS was 11.5 months (95% CI 9.2-13.3 months) in the BEV group and 14.8 months (95% CI 9.7-17.3 months) in the CET group (hazard ratio 0.803; P = 0.33). Patients with a smaller-number but larger-sized metastases did better in the CET group. In the BEV and CET groups, the response rates were 68.4% and 84.7% and the resection rates were 56.1% and 49.2%, respectively.Conclusion:Although CET achieved a better response rate than BEV for patients with a small number of large liver metastases, both biologics had similar efficacy regarding liver resection and acceptable safety profiles. To achieve optimal PFS, biologics should be selected in accordance with patient conditions.Trial registration:This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01836653), and UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR number UMIN000010209).
