Tumor thrombus is a very rare complication observed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a unique case of hepatocellular carcinoma with extension of tumor along the inferior vein cava into the right atrium, in a patient with cardiac amyloidosis and without any cardio respiratory distress or typical clinical findings suggestive of cardiovascular involvement from cardiac amyloidosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is a useful tool to assess intracardiac tumor extension as well as to provide myocardial tissue characterization.
