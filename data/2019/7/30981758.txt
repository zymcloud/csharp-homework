Long noncoding RNA HULC is identified and highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a key driver of liver cancer. In the present study, we found that HULC remarkably elevated the levels of HBeAg, HBsAg, HBcAg, pgRNA, HBx, HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which activated the HBV replication in HBV-expressing hepatoma cells or de novo HBV-infected cell lines (PHH, HepG2-NTCP and dHepaRG). Mechanistically, HULC enhanced HBV cccDNA stability by down-regulating the APOBEC3B in hepatoma cells. HULC significantly up-regulated microRNA-539, which targeted the 3'UTR of APOBEC3B mRNA. Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed a putative STAT3-binding site located in the upstream of miR-539 promoter. Moreover, we identified that HULC was able to elevate HBx, which co-activated the STAT3 to stimulate the miR-539 promoter. Then, miR-539 down-regulated APOBEC3B and promoted HBV replication. Functionally, HULC enhanced the growth of hepatoma cells by activating HBV in vitro and in vivo, which could be blocked by overexpressing APOBEC3B. In conclusion, HULC activates HBV by modulating HBx/STAT3/miR-539/APOBEC3B signaling in HBV-related HCC.
