Background and aim:Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) predicts a poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Platelets (PLTs) play an important role in HCC progression and metastasis. However, the relationship between PLTs and PVTT remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the value of PLT counts in the prognosis of HCC patients with PVTT after hepatectomy.Methods:From January 2002 to December 2012, 694 HCC patients with PVTT after hepatectomy were evaluated. The patients were divided into the thrombocytopenia group (PLT 9 /L), the normal group, and the thrombocytosis group (PLT > 300 Ã— 109 /L) based on the preoperative PLT level. A propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used.Results:Before the PSM, PVTT patients with thrombocytopenia exhibited longer recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with those with normal PLT counts (both P Conclusion:According to the PSM, preoperative thrombocytopenia predicts an increased RFS and OS in HCC patients with PVTT after hepatectomy.
