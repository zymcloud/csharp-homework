Objective: Spontaneous hepatic tumor hemorrhage is a rare but challenging emergency especially among cirrhotic patients with poor hepatic function. This study aimed at analyzing the safety, efficacy and feasibility of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in the treatment of hepatic tumor hemorrhage. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients undergoing embolization attempt for hepatic tumor hemorrhage in the Helsinki University Hospital during 2004-2017. Electronic medical records provided the study data. Outcomes included the 30-day rebleeding, complication and mortality rates, need for blood transfusions, durations of intensive care unit and hospital admissions, estimates of overall survival, and analysis of factors associated with 30-day mortality. Results: During the study period, 49 patients underwent angiography for hepatic tumor hemorrhage. TAE was technically feasible in 45 patients (92%), and controlled the bleeding with the first attempt in 84%. The 30-day complication and mortality rates were 57 and 33%, respectively. Major complications occurred in 33% of patients. In-hospital mortality was higher among cirrhotic than non-cirrhotic patients (55 versus 7%, p < .001). Patients with bleeding hepatic metastases, but no cirrhosis, had an in-hospital mortality of 0% with no major complications. Patients with benign etiology had a good prognosis and no bleeding- or tumor-related mortality. Discussion: TAE is an effective method in controlling the bleeding in spontaneous hepatic hemorrhage. Underlying pathology determines the prognosis that is poor especially in cirrhotic patients with bleeding hepatocellular carcinoma.
