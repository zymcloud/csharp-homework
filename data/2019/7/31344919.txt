Due to the lack of suitable in-vivo models, the etiology of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC) is poorly understood. We previously showed the involvement of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (Pecam-1/CD31) in acute liver damage. Here, we developed a model of ICC using thioacetamide (TAA) in drinking water of wild-type (WT)-mice and Pecam-1-knock-out (KO)-mice. Gross inspection and microscopy revealed liver-cirrhosis and ICC in both groups after 22 weeks of TAA. The severity of cirrhosis and ICC (Ck-19-positive) was reduced in Pecam-1 KO mice (stage-4 cirrhosis in WT vs. stage-3 in KO mice). Tumor networks (accompanied by neutrophils) were predominantly located in portal areas, with signs of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In serum, TAA induced an increase in hepatic damage markers, with lower levels in Pecam-1 null mice. With qPCR of liver, elevated expression of Pecam-1 mRNA was noted in WT mice, in addition to Icam-1, EpCam, cytokines, cMyc, and Mmp2. Thereby, levels of EpCAM, cytokines, cMyc, and Mmp2 were significantly lower in Pecam-1 null mice. Lipocalin-2 and Ccl5 were elevated significantly in both WT and Pecam-1 null mice after TAA administration. Also, EMT marker Wnt5a (not Twist-1) was increased in both groups after TAA. We present a highly reproducible mouse model for ICC and show protective effects of Pecam-1 deficiency.
