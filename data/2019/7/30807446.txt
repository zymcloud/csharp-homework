Objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide with poor prognosis due to the high incidence of recurrence. For patients with advanced HCC, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the preferred treatment option owing to the minimal invasive clinical treatment with optimum therapeutic outcomes. But, there is a paucity of studies on early detection of residual cancer and relapse that result in the bottleneck of long-term effects after TACE therapy.Patients and methods:Using next-generation sequencing platform targeting a panel of 622 cancer-associated genes, we prospectively evaluated the predictive significance of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to detect minimal residual disease in plasma cfDNA in comparison with DNA obtained from tumor tissue and blood cells of three eligible cases with HCC following TACE therapy.Results:The results indicated that the mutational spectrum from plasma cfDNA was consistent with tumor-derived DNA and potentially suggested disease progression. Next, we determined if the dynamic variation of plasma cfDNA could indicate treatment response, the findings suggested that the mutation burden of plasma cfDNA could reveal relapse before alterations in conventional computed tomography imaging and serum Î±-fetoprotein values.Conclusion:The mutation burden in plasma cfDNA may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker by providing early evidence of residual disease and identifying high risk of recurrence in patients with HCC following TACE therapy.
