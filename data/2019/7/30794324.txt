Chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) is the most severe chronic hepatitis, with no satisfactory treatment options and severe clinical outcomes. This infection is frequent in the migrant subjects from endemic areas, especially from Africa and East-Europe. The pegylated (PEG)-interferon Î± (IFN) is limited by side effects and poor response. In this retrospective analysis, we reported our experience of treatment with PEG-IFN in a cohort of immigrant patients affected by CHD. We evaluated the virological responses are as follows: complete response (CR; clearance of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and hepatitis D virus [HDV]-RNA), partial response (PR; HBsAg clearance with HDV-RNA+), and null response (NR; HBsAg and HDV-RNA+). Clinical outcomes were clinical stabilization, disease progression, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), death, and liver transplantation. Forty-six patients were included. At the end of treatment (ET), 11 patients gained a CR (23.9%), 10 were PR (21.7%), and 16 were NR (34.8%). After 1 year, 10 remained with CR (21.7%), after 2 years, 9 (19.5%), and at 3 years, 8 (17.4%). Relapse rate was 2.2%, 4.4%, and 6.5% at year 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Favorable factors were CR at the ET (odds ratio [OR] = 4.559, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.219-7.116; P = 0.003), PEG-IFN course greater than 1 (OR = 1.240, 95% CI: 0.998-4.839; P = 0.012), prolonged treatment (OR = 1.276, 95% CI: 0.816-3.108; P = 0.018), quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) decline at 12 weeks greater than 0.5 log IU/mL (OR = 4.816, 95% CI: 2.190-8.194; P
