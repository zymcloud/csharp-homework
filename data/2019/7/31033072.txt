In mammals, methylation of the 5th position of cytosine (5mC) seems to be a major epigenetic modification of DNA. This process can be reversed (resulting in cytosine) with high efficiency by dioxygenases of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family, which perform oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine. It has been demonstrated that these 5mC oxidation derivatives are in a dynamic state and have pivotal regulatory functions. Here, we comprehensively summarized the recent research progress in the understanding of the physiological functions of the TET proteins and their mechanisms of regulation of DNA methylation and transcription. Among the three TET genes, TET1 and TET2 expression levels have frequently been shown to be low in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and received most attention. The modulation of TET1 also correlates with microRNAs in a post-transcriptional regulatory process. Additionally, recent studies revealed that global genomic 5hmC levels are down-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Combined with the reported results, identification of 5hmC signatures in HCC tissues and in circulating cell-free DNA will certainly contribute to early detection and should help to design therapeutic strategies against HCC. 5hmC might also be a novel prognostic biomarker of HCC. Thus, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms resulting in the premalignant and aggressive transformation of TET proteins and cells with 5hmC disruption might help to develop novel epigenetic therapies for HCC.
