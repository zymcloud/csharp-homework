Aims:In addition to potentially progressing to either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is currently the leading indication for liver transplantation. Nintedanib has been clinically used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for many years, but its effects in an animal model of NASH have not been tested. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of nintendanib on NASH in choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD)-fed mice.Main methods:Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a CDAHFD for 6 weeks to induce NASH with liver fibrosis, and they were administered nintedanib (60 mg/kg/day) or distilled water orally in the last 2 weeks of the feeding period. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), triglyceride, and non-esterified fatty acids concentrations were measured. Serum cytokeratin 18 fragment (CK18) was detected using ELISA. Liver tissue sections from mice were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome to assess the level of steatohepatitis and fibrosis.Key findings:CDAHFD-fed mice exhibited higher serum ALT, AST, and ALP levels compared with Control mice. A significant increase in the serum CK18 level was observed in the NASH group compared with the Control group. CDAHFD feeding also enhanced steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis pathological features, which were reduced after nintedanib treatment.Significance:Nintedanib exerted anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in CDAHFD-induced NASH mice.
