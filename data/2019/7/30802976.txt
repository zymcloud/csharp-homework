Overexpression of metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) was correlated with poor prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC). The aim of this study was to examine the clinical significance of the expression of MTA1 and its exon 4-excluded form (MTA1dE4), the most abundant spliced variant of MTA1, in patients receiving curative resection for HBV-HCC. We collected 102 patients with HBV-HCC and received curative resection retrospectively and examined the expressions level of total MTA1/MTA1dE4 in their paired nontumor and tumor liver tissues by using RT-qPCR. The association between MTA1/MTA1dE4 expression and various tumor features as well as tumor recurrence was analyzed. During the median follow-up period of 4 years, 25 patients (24.5%) showed early recurrence (within 12 months postresection) and 42 (54.5%) showed late recurrence. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, MTA1dE4 overexpression in tumor, but not MTA1, was associated with early recurrence (P = 0.0365), but not late recurrence. In multivariate analysis, only alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) â‰¥200 ng/mL (P = 0.006) and large tumor size (P = 0.027) were correlated with early recurrence. In the subgroup of patients with AFP
