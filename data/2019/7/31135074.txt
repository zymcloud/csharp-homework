Background:It remains unknown whether antiviral treatment for HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients having high viral loads without significant elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels would reduce the risks of clinical events.Aim:To compare clinical outcomes of high viral load CHB patients untreated for normal or mildly elevated ALT vs those treated for ALT â‰¥ 2 upper limit of normal (ULN).Methods:This historical cohort study included 5414 HBeAg-negative CHB patients without cirrhosis at a tertiary hospital in Korea from 2000 to 2013. Inactive phase was defined as serum hepatitis B virus [HBV] DNA Results:The mean age of the patients was 47 years without a significant difference among the groups. Compared with the treated Active phase group, the untreated Replicative phase group showed a significantly higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; HR 1.76; 95% CI 1.00 - 3.10, P = 0.05) and death/transplantation (HR 2.14; 5% CI 1.09 - 4.21, P = 0.03) by propensity score-matched analysis. The untreated mildly active phase patients had further increase in risk of HCC and death/transplantation compared with the treated Active phase group by unadjusted, PS-matched, competing risks, and multivariable-adjusted analyses.Conclusions:Untreated high viral load HBeAg-negative CHB patients without significant ALT elevation had higher risks of clinical events than treated Active phase patients with elevated ALT.
