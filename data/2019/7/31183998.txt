Background:This real-world study assessed the efficacy and toxicity of anlotinib as salvage treatment in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods:The medical records of 81 patients with advanced NSCLC who had failed at least two lines of chemotherapy were retrospectively collected. All patients were administered anlotinib treatment until disease progression or intolerance as a result of adverse events. Survival curves were created using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used for univariate analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) between groups. Cox regression was used to estimate the statistically significant factors based on univariate analysis.Results:The median PFS was five months (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5-6.5). The objective response rate (ORR) was 7% and the disease control rate (DCR) was 84%. The following subgroups of patients had longer PFS (P < 0.05): squamous cell carcinoma, no brain or liver metastases, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0-1, and no previous VEGF-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. The results of Cox regression indicated that an ECOG PS of 0-1 (hazard ratio 0.152, 95% CI 0.057-0.403; P = 0.00) and patients without brain metastases (hazard ratio 0.421, 95% CI 0.195-0.911; P = 0.028) had longer PFS following anlotinib treatment.Conclusion:Anlotinib, which is well tolerated, plays a significant role in the salvage treatment of advanced NSCLC. Patients with advanced NSCLC with an ECOG PS of 0-1 and no brain metastases achieved longer PFS following anlotinib salvage treatment.
