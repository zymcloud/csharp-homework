Aim: To assess neoadjuvant conformal radiotherapy (CRT) before orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not suitable for standard locoregional treatments. Methods: Patients undergoing OLT for HCC with or without prior CRT were compared using 1:3 propensity score matching. Results: After propensity score matching, 23 patients with CRT were compared with 66 control subjects. Severe morbidity rate was 34.8 versus 24.2% in the CRT and non-CRT groups (p = 0.289). Complete pathological response was observed in 47.8% of CRT-targeted nodules. The 1-/3-/5-year disease-free survivals were 77.3, 77.3 and 68.7% in the CRT group versus 85.4, 68.0 and 61.7% in the non-CRT group (p = 0.829). Conclusion: Conformal radiotherapy represents a satisfactory neoadjuvant therapy for OLT candidates not suitable for standard HCC locoregional therapies.
