Tumor-associated autoantibodies are promising diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of tumors. We have screened a novel tumor-associated autoantibody in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model mice. Its target antigen was identified as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (EIF3A) by proteomic analysis, and the elevated expression of EIF3A in HCC tissues of tumor model mice as well as human patients was shown. Also, its existence in tumor-derived exosomes was revealed, which seem to be the cause of tumor-associated autoantibody production. To use serum anti-EIF3A autoantibody as biomarker, ELISA detecting anti-EIF3A autoantibody in human serum was performed using autoantibody-specific epitope. For the sensitive detection of serum autoantibodies its specific conformational epitopes were screened from the random cyclic peptide library, and a streptavidin antigen displaying anti-EIF3A autoantibody-specific epitope, XC90p2(-CPVRSGFPC-), was used as capture antigen. It distinguished patients with HCC (n = 102) from healthy controls (n = 0285) with a sensitivity of 79.4% and specificity of 83.5% (AUC = 0.87). Also, by simultaneously detecting with other HCC biomarkers, including alpha-fetoprotein, HCC diagnostic sensitivity improved from 79.4% to 85%. Collectively, we suggest that serum anti-EIF3A autoantibody is a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC and the combinational detection of related biomarkers can enhance the accuracy of the cancer diagnosis.
