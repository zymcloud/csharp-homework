Aim:Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade was investigated to predict prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. It was defined using the ALBI score calculated based on serum total bilirubin and albumin, which represent liver function. The diagnostic accuracy for liver fibrosis staging in patients with chronic hepatitis using the ALBI score has not been investigated well. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic abilities of the ALBI score for liver fibrosis staging in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in Japanese patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Methods:Japanese patients with HCV infection who underwent liver biopsy examinations were enrolled in a retrospective study. Fibrosis staging and activity grading were assessed using the modified METAVIR score. The ALBI score was calculated according to the following equation: Log10 total bilirubin (μmol/L) × 0.66 + albumin (g/L) × (-0.085).Results:A total of 382 patients were enrolled in this study. The ALBI score differentiated fibrosis stage 4 from 3 and stage 3 from 2 (P Conclusions:The ALBI score indicates liver fibrosis staging in Japanese patients with HCV infection. Furthermore, smaller ALBI scores predict better HCC-free survival and overall survival. The ALBI score has the potential to expand its application from cirrhosis to chronic hepatitis.
