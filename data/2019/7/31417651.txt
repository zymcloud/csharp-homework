Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare macrovascular invasion (MVI)-free survival (MFS) at the three-year follow-up in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent hepatic resection (HR), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), or TACE combined with radiofrequency ablation (TACE-RFA). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 828 patients who were diagnosed with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A or stage B HCC. Of these patients, 116 underwent HR, 395 underwent TACE-RFA, 239 underwent TACE, and 78 patients received conservative treatment (control group). A validation cohort of 158 patients was included. The MFS and overall survival (OS) before and after propensity score (PS) matching were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: The baseline characteristics between the control and TACE groups were comparable. MFS was higher in the TACE group than in the control group at the three-year follow-up (p = 0.0091), and OS was similar in the two groups (p = 0.0549). PS matching was used to generate 68 pairs of patients in the control versus HR group and 74 pairs of patients in the control versus TACE-RFA group (1-to-1 matched). MFS was significantly higher in the HR or TACE-RFA groups than in the control group (p < 0.0001 (HR versus control) and p = 0.0001 (TACE-RFA versus control), respectively). Furthermore, for patients in the HR versus TACE-RFA versus TACE groups that were generated by PS matching, the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that MFS and OS were higher with HR or TACE-RFA than with TACE at three years. In the study, similar results were obtained in the validation cohort. Conclusions: MFS and OS were higher with HR or TACE-RFA than with TACE for HCC patients without MVI.
