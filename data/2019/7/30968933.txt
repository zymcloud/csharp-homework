Background and aim:The impact of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and preventive antiviral therapy on the occurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation and subsequent hepatitis remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of TACE and preventive antiviral therapy on the risk of HBV reactivation and subsequent hepatitis. Meanwhile, we explored the role of HBeAg status in HBV reactivation after TACE.Methods:We performed this meta-analysis with 11 included studies to assess the effect of TACE and preventive antiviral therapy on predicting clinical outcomes in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated using a random or fixed effects model. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled were searched for the included articles (from 2000 to December 2017).Results:Our results showed that TACE significantly increased the risk of HBV reactivation (OR: 3.70; 95% CI 1.45-9.42; P Conclusions:The present study suggested that TACE was associated with a higher possibility of HBV reactivation and subsequent hepatitis. Preventive antiviral therapy is significantly in favor of a protective effect.
