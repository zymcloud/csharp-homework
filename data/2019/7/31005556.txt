Background:Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recently have been identified as influential indicators in a variety of malignancies. Hence, the aim of the present study was to identify a functional lncRNA and its associated effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of cellular growth and a ngiogenesis.Methods and results:Microarray-based analysis revealed a possible regulatory mechanism involving LINC00488, microRNA-330-5p (miR-330-5p) and talin-1 (TLN1) in HCC. Targetscan and RNA22 online tools predicted the relationship among LINC00488, miR-330-5p and TLN1, which were further validated by dual luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA pull-down and RIP. To evaluate the effects of LINC00488 and miR-330-5p on the cellular process of HCC, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, with the expression of LINC00488, miR-330-5p, and TLN1 altered by delivering plasmids into Hep3B cell line. The obtained results demonstrated that cells with siRNA-mediated depletion of LINC00488 or restoration of miR-330-5p displayed suppressed abilities of in vitro proliferation as well as of in vivo tumor growth and angiogenesis, while in vitro apoptosis was notably induced.Conclusion:The fundamental findings of the present study collectively propose that lncRNA LINC00488 can competitively sponge miR-330-5p to regulate TLN1 in relation to the cell growth and angiogenesis in HCC.
