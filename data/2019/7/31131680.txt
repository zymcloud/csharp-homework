Introduction: Hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can develop in children with congenital heart disease. Although hepatic fibrosis and HCC are prone to develop after the Fontan operation, they can also develop in patients suffering from congenital heart disease who have not undergone Fontan operation. Area covered: The history of cardiac hepatopathy including Fontan-associated liver disease is described. Patient characteristics, liver histology, imaging examinations and blood tests are reviewed to elucidate the mechanism of cardiac hepatopathy. In addition, a flowchart for the follow-up management of cardiac hepatopathy in children with congenital heart disease is proposed. Expert opinion: Congestion and low cardiac output are the main causes of cardiac hepatopathy. Advanced hepatic fibrosis is presumed to be associated with HCC. HCC can develop in both adolescents and young adults. Regardless of whether the Fontan operation is performed, children with a functional single ventricle and chronic heart failure should be regularly examined for cardiac hepatopathy. There is no single reliable laboratory parameter to accurately detect cardiac hepatopathy; hepatic fibrosis indices and elastography have shown inconsistent results for detection of this disease. Further studies using liver specimen-confirmed patients and standardization of evaluation protocols are required to clarify the pathogenesis of cardiac hepatopathy.
