In this study, we summarized the association of IL-23R gene polymorphisms with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 270 HCC patients were selected as HCC group, and 251 healthy individuals served as the control group. PCR-RFLP was performed to detect IL-23R gene polymorphism, including rs17375018 and rs11805303. Survival rate and risk factors of HCC were identified. The findings suggested that IL-23R rs17375018 was correlated with genetic susceptibility to HCC, and GC haplotype was closely linked with the risk factors of HCC. Moreover, rs17375018 polymorphism was related to portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) and alcohol consumption in HCC patients, while prognosis was better in HCC patients with AA genotype of rs17375018 polymorphism. Lastly, GG genotype in rs17375018, PVTT and TNM stage III and IV were identified as independent risk factors for HCC. In conclusion, IL-23R rs17375018 polymorphism might serve as a prognostic factor in patients with HCC after interventional therapy.
