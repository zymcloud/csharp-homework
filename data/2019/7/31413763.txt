Background: MiR-92a has been discovered to be involved in the malignant behavior of various types of cancers. However, the particular clinical and prognostic roles of miR-92a in tumors still need to be identified more precisely. The current meta-analysis assessed the prognostic value of miR-92a in various carcinomas. Methods: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, PMC, Web of Science (WOS), Embase in English and Wanfang, SinoMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) in Chinese up to Jan 15th 2019 were conducted for eligible studies. Twenty studies involving a total of 2573 patients were included in the analysis. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were assessed using fixed-effects and random-effects models. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were carried out to explore the source of heterogeneity. Odds ratio (OR) and 95%CIs were applied to evaluate the relationship between miR-92a expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics. Results: A significant association between miR-92a levels and OS (HR=2.18) was identified. The random pooling model also revealed significance of consistency (HR=2.14), indicating that the stability of the results. Subgroup analyses were performed and the corresponding significance was recognized in Chinese cancer patients (HR=2.35), studies of specimen derived from tissues (HR=2.43), non-hematological cancer (HR=2.35), osteosarcoma (HR=2.54), non-small cell lung cancer (HR=2.33), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR=2.40) and so on. There were significant relations observed of the expression level of miR-92a to tumor size (â‰¥5 vs <5 cm) (OR=2.13), lymph node metastasis (present vs. absent) (OR=1.87), distant metastasis (present vs. absent) (OR=2.99) and so on. Conclusions: the over expression of miR-92a is associated with unfavorable prognosis of Chinese cancer patients. In addition, patients of elevated miR-92a expression level are likely to develop the cancers of more malignant behaviors.
