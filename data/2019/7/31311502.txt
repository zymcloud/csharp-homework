Background:Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) arising in the caudate lobe is rare and the treatment is difficult. The aim of this study is to summarize the experience of ultrasound-guided percutaneous ablation therapy for HCC located in the caudate lobe and to investigate the predictive factors of the treatment outcomes.Methods:From August 2006 to June 2017, 73 patients (63 males and 10 females; mean age, 54.9 ± 11.6 years; age range, 25-79 years) with 73 caudate lobe HCCs (mean size, 2.6 ± 1.1 cm; size range, 1.0-5.0 cm) were treated with percutaneous ablation, including 33 patients with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 23 patients with ethanol ablation (EA), and 17 patients with combination of RFA and EA. The treatment outcome and survival after ablation for caudate lobe HCC were assessed and the predictive factors were calculated by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:A total of 72 patients achieved complete ablation after the first or second session of ablation. The treatment effectiveness was 98.6% (72/73). During the follow-up, 16 tumors developed local tumor progression (LTP) and a total of 61 patients (61/73, 83.6%) were detected distant recurrence (DR). According to univariate and multivariate analyses, tumor size > 2 cm (hazard ratio[HR] = 3.667; 95% confidence interval[CI], 1.043-12.889; P = 0.043) was a significant prognostic factor of LTP after ablation for HCC in the caudate lobe, while tumor number (HR = 2.245; 95%CI, 1.168-4.317; P = 0.015) was a significant prognostic factor of DR. The mean overall survival time after ablation was 28.7 ± 2.8 months, without independent predictive factors detected. Four patients (4/73, 5.5%) were detected treatment-related major complications, without independent predictive factor detected.Conclusion:Ultrasound-guided percutaneous ablation is a feasible treatment for a selected case with HCC in the caudate lobe. Tumor size > 2 cm increases the risk of LTP and intrahepatic tumor number is associated with DR after ablation.
