Aims:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 144-week tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) therapy in treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in Korean.Methods:In total, 579 treatment-naïve CHB patients at 11 medical centers were enrolled retrospective and prospective from September 2015 to January 2016 by design (NCT02533544). We evaluated the complete virologic response (CVR) rate and the renal safety of TDF.Results:The overall CVR rate was 69.4%, 87.0%, and 89.7% at weeks 48, 96, and 144, respectively. In the HBeAg-positive CHB patients, the CVR rate at weeks 48, 96, and 144 was 61.4%, 83.1%, and 89.6%, respectively. The rates of HBeAg loss and seroconversion at weeks 48, 96, and 144 were 16.6%, 23.5%, 34.1%, and 7.6%, 8.9%, 13.3%, respectively. In HBeAg-negative CHB patients, the CVR rate at weeks 48, 96, and 144 was 82.5%, 93.2%, and 90.0%, respectively. The rate of alanine aminotransferase normalization was 36.9%, 45.4%, and 46.8% at weeks 48, 96, and 144, respectively. Of the CHB patients, 0.9% showed an elevated creatinine (> 0.5 mg/dL from baseline). Age (≥ 60 years) was significantly associated with a decline in renal function at week 144 (P Conclusions:TDF therapy induced sustained viral suppression and had a favorable safety profile over a 3-year period. However, close monitoring of renal function should be mandatory in treating CHB patients receiving TDF, particularly older patients.
