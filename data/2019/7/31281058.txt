Background:Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas (SPN) is a rare neoplasm, which mainly affects young women. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological features and surgical management of SPNs in our institution.Methods:Patients who underwent surgery for a pathologically confirmed SPN in our institution between January 2008 and October 2018 were collected. Their clinical characteristics and survival associations were analyzed.Results:In total, 243 pathologically confirmed patients were analyzed in this study, including 181(74.5%)females and 62(25.5%) males. The mean age was 35.3 years old (range: 12-64 years old) with average tumor size of 4.83 cm (range: 0.8-16 cm). 239 patients underwent complete surgical resection. After median follow-up of 46 months (range: 10-118 months), four patients died due to tumor progression. All the other people were absent of local recurrence or distant metastasis.Conclusions:SPN is a latent malignant tumor with excellent prognosis. Surgical resection is recommended even in the presence of liver metastasis. If possible, function-preserving surgery is advocated. High Ki67 index may predict the malignant potential and poor prognosis of SPNs.
