Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high incidence and mortality rate. Identification of new, reliable and non invasive biomarkers are important to improve early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. Circulating micro-RNAs are abundant and play a central role in different biological process of hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate miR-483-5p and miR-133a as potential biomarkers for diagnosis of hepato-cellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients post chronic hepatitis C virus infection and compare their sensitivity and specificity to currently used alpha fetoprotein test. The study included 20 patients with HCC on top of hepatic cirrhosis post chronic hepatitis C viral infection, 20 patients with hepatic cirrhosis post chronic hepatitis C viral infection, and 20 age and sex matched healthy controls. Serum miRNAs 483 5p and 133a were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Expression levels of miR-483-5p and miR-133a were higher in HCC patients than in patients with liver cirrhosis (P 3.89 while, miR-133a could predict HCC with sensitivity 70%, specificity 90%, accuracy 0.84, and cut off value > 4.79. However, the sensitivity and the specificity of AFP were 80% and 100% respectively. In detecting HCC, combining a-fetoprotein (AFP) and serum miR-483-5p (sensitivity = 95%) and miR 133 a (sensitivity = 90%) were better than AFP alone (sensitivity = 80%). In conclusion; serum miR- 483-5p and miR-133a might serve as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma. Combination of serum miR-483-5p and miR-133a with AFP might complement the role of AFP in detecting hepatocellular carcinoma.
