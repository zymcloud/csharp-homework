As a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and a transcriptional regulator, Metastasis associated lung adenocarcioma transcript-1 (MALAT-1) has been reported to be associated with proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the effects of MALAT-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on HCC remains poorly understood. This study, including 624 HCC cases and 618 controls, aimed to explore the potential associations between three common tagSNPs at MALAT-1 and HCC risk in a Southern Chinese population. No significant associations were observed between the three tagSNPs and HCC risk under any genetic models after adjusting for potential confounders. Additionally, there were no any significant associations in the stratified analysis, combined effect analysis, and multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis. Unification analysis of mediation and interaction on HCC risk further showed that four decomposition of total effects ((controlled direct effect (CDE), the reference interaction effect (INTref), the mediated interaction effect (INTmed), or the pure indirect effect (PIE)) were also not significant. Neither was the association between the MALAT-1 SNPs and progression factors of HCC, including TNM staging, metastasis, and cancer embolus; Overall, this study suggested that tagSNPs rs11227209, rs619586, and rs3200401 at MALAT-1 were not significantly associated with HCC susceptibility. Nevertheless, large population-based studies are warranted to further explore the role of MALAT-1 SNPs in HCC incidence and development.
