Rationale:Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) of the liver is an uncommon benign lesion. It is usually difficult to differentiate from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), peripheral-type cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC), combined HCC-CCC, and liver metastases. On account of its rarity and controversial issues, we report a case report and review the literature to discuss its clinical features, treatments, radiological, and immunohistochemical characteristics.Patient concerns:A 54-year-old woman had a history of primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic cholecystitis. She complained of finding a lesion in the right liver during her last medical check-up by abdominal B type ultrasound. The Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a circular and low-density lesion in the right posterior lobe of the liver, approximately 22.0 Ã— 18.7 mm in size. On magnetic resonance imaging, the lesion showed low-signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Laboratory test results were almost normal.Diagnosis:After the postoperative pathological and immunohistochemical examination, the patient was finally diagnosed as having RLH.Interventions:The patient received right posterior lobe hepatectomy and cholecystectomy.Outcomes:The patient was discharged 11 days after surgery. No evidence of recurrence was noted 1 year after the surgery.Lessons:Although RLH of the liver is rare, it is necessary to be considered in a liver lesion, especially in female patients. This case report may advance the understanding of RLH of the liver and reduce the number of mistakenly diagnosed patients.
