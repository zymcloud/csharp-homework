Background and aims:Direct antiviral agents have greatly improved therapeutic options for chronic hepatitis C. Indeed, former "difficult-to-treat" patients can now be treated and can achieve sustained response. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Other malignancies have been reported to be associated with HCV infection albeit with various grades of evidence. Antineoplastic treatment is often reduced or suspended in HCV-positive cancer patients to avoid "HCV reactivation." In this setting, antiviral therapy combined with antineoplastic protocols may improve the outcome. For this reason, we conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to update the association between HCV infection and non-hepatocellular malignancies, and to shed light on the effects exerted by antiviral treatment on the natural history of oncological diseases.Methods:Relevant studies were identified by searching PUBMED, EMBASE and MEDLINE up to 1 August 2018. Pooled risk estimates were calculated with random-effects models according to PRISMA guidelines.Results:A total of 58 studies were included in the analysis: 27 studies of the association between HCV and B-NHL(OR 3.36; 95% CI 2.40-4.72;P Conclusions:This study updates the strong association between B-NHL and HCV infection, confirms the association between HCV and non-hepatocellular tumours, and demonstrates a very strong association between viral eradication and a better outcome of HCV-positive B-NHL.
