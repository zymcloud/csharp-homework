Background/aim:We assessed suitable factors indicating newly developed lenvatinib (LEN) treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC) by investigating real-world clinical features of patients.Materials/methods:One hundred fifty two u-HCC patients, who receive LEN treatment from March to December 2018, were enrolled. (Child-Pugh score [CPS] 5/6/7/8 = 76/61/13/2, modified albumin-bilirubin grade [mALBI] 1/2a/2b/3 = 53/35/60/4). Clinical features were evaluated retrospectively.Results:Overall-response rate (ORR)/disease control rate (DCR) at 1 month after starting LEN were 38.7%/86.0%, respectively. Estimated median time to progression (TTP) was 7.0 months, while median survival time was not reached within the observation period. CPS (≥7) and past history of tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) were not significant prognostic factors. mALBI ≥2b was an only significant prognostic factor (HR 4.632, 95%CI 1.649-13.02, P = 0.004) in Cox-hazard multivariate analysis. In patients with Child-Pugh A, c-index/Akaike's information criterion (AIC) of prognostic predictive value of mALBI were superior to CPS (0.682/135.6 vs 0.652/138.7), while those of stopping LEN also showed that mALBI was better (0.575/447.3 vs 0.562/447.8). Additional analysis of patients with good mALBI (1/2a) revealed that time to stopping LEN was significantly shorter in those with the adverse event (AE) of appetite loss (any grade) than those without (P = 0.006) and body mass index (BMI) was also lower in patients with that AE (20.3 ± 3.0 vs 23.6 ± 4.0kg/m2 , P < 0.001), while patients with a hand-foot skin reaction (any grade) showed good ORR/DCR (59.1%/86.4%) and longer TTP as compared to patients without (P = 0.007).Conclusion:Good hepatic function (mALBI 1/2a) is the best indication for LEN, while potential appetite loss in association with low BMI should be kept in mind in such cases.
