Aim:To retrospectively compare the treatment effect of intraprocedural computed tomography/magnetic resonance-contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CT/MR-CEUS) fusion imaging (FI) with that of conventional ultrasound (US) in the guidance and assessment of thermal ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The FI group (112 patients with 129 HCC) was treated between April 2010 and December 2012, whereas the US group (83 patients with 90 HCC) was treated between January 2008 and March 2010. Either CT/MR-CEUS FI or US was used to guide puncture, provide immediate assessment, and guide supplementary ablation. Technical efficacy, cumulative local tumor progression rate (LTP), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated and compared during follow-up. Technical success rate of CT/MR-CEUS FI was also recorded.Results:Technical efficacy was significantly higher in the FI group than in the US group (100% vs. 86.7%, P Conclusions:Intraprocedural CT/MR-CEUS FI improved the treatment effect of thermal ablation of HCC by immediately assessing treatment response and guiding supplementary ablation relative to those resulting from the use of conventional US.
