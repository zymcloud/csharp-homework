BACKGROUND The optimal strategy for dealing with sub-centimeter hepatic nodules has not yet been established. This study aimed to assess whether there was a need to provide curative treatments for sub-centimeter hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) to patients at risk for high false positives. MATERIAL AND METHODS We identified patients with primary pathologically diagnosed HCC â‰¤2 cm from 2004 to 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. They were divided according to the interventions they received: local ablation, surgical resection, or liver transplantation. In each group, overall survival and cancer-specific survival were used as endpoints to compare the prognoses between patients with sub-centimeter HCC and patients with HCC measuring 1 to 2 cm by Kaplan-Meier. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce bias. We also compared the survival of patients with a primary solitary HCC based on interventions, in the different tumor size groups. Bootstrapping was performed to validate the findings. RESULTS Overall, 10.4% of patients (197 out of 1894) had HCCs
