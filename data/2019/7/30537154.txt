The long noncoding RNA cancer susceptibility 9 (CASC9) has been reported to be a pivot modulator in growth and metastasis of breast cancer, liver cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, and nasopharyngeal cancer. However, its potential roles in ovarian cancer remain unclear. In this study, we aimed at its functions and molecular mechanism in ovarian cancer progression. We showed that CASC9 was highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. An elevated level of CASC9 predicts an unfavorable prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays illustrated that CASC9 promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and accelerates tumor growth in vivo. We showed that CASC9 works as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-758-3p which targets LIN7A. CASC9 inhibits the level of miR-758-3p, and in turn stimulates LIN7A expression in ovarian cancer. Overexpression of LIN7A reverses the suppressive roles of CASC9 depletion on ovarian cancer. In sum, our findings reveal a novel undefined regulatory signaling pathway, namely CASC9/miR-758-3p/LIN7A axis, involved in ovarian cancer progression.
