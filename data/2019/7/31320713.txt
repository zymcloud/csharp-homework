Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer with high mortality, due to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. Blood miRNAs, which circulate in a highly stable, cell-free form, show promise as novel potential biomarkers for early detection of HCC. Whole miRNome profiling was performed to identify deregulated miRNAs between HCC and normal healthy (NH) volunteers. These deregulated miRNAs were validated in an independent cohort of HCC, NH and chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) volunteers and finally in a 3rd cohort comprising NH, CHB, cirrhotic and HCC volunteers to evaluate miRNA changes during disease progression. The associations between circulating miRNAs and liver-damage markers, clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes were analysed to identify prognostic markers. Twelve miRNAs are differentially expressed between HCC and NH individuals in all three cohorts. Five upregulated miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-885-5p, miR-100-5p and miR-148a-3p) in CHB, cirrhosis and HCC patients are potential biomarkers for CHB infection, while miR-34a-5p can be a biomarker for cirrhosis. Notably, four miRNAs (miR-1972, miR-193a-5p, miR-214-3p and miR-365a-3p) can distinguish HCC from other non-HCC individuals. Six miRNAs are potential prognostic markers for overall survival.
