Objective The purpose of this multicenter retrospective study was to investigate the impact of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) on the survival of Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib. Methods A total of 178 HCC patients from May 2009 to December 2015 at our affiliated hospitals was included in this study. The PNI was calculated as follows: 10×serum albumin (g/dL) +0.005×total lymphocyte count (per mm3). The patients were divided into two groups according to the cut-off value of the PNI and as calculated by a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results The optimum cut-off value of the PNI was set at 46.8. We defined the 33 patients with a PNI≥46.8 as the PNI-high group and the 145 patients with a PNI<46.8 as the PNI-low group. The response rate was 20.0% in the PNI-high group and 8.1% in the PNI-low group, without any statistically significance (p=0.09). The duration of sorafenib therapy and the overall survival in the PNI-high group were significantly better than those in the PNI-low group. The PNI-high group was thus found to be a predictive factor associated with the duration of sorafenib therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.87, p=0.008] and overall survival (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.39-0.99, p=0.046) in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion The PNI is a simple and useful marker for predicting the survival of patients with HCC treated with sorafenib.
