Purpose: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common and most malignant disorder of the oral cavity. Standard cancer treatments have many complications for patients. Nausea, vomiting, and perturbation in blood cells are the most common side effects when using Doxorubicin (Dox) for the treatment of OSCC. Use of Doxorubicin-loaded nano-particles (n-Dox) give rise to increase its biological efficacy and the rapeutic effects. This study assessed the efficacy of the injectable form of the n-Doxon blood parameters and cardiac and liver enzymes compared to the commercial form of Dox in OSCC-induced by 4NQO in rats. Methods: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxideas was used as a solution in drinking water for inducing OSCC during 14 weeks in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Four groups of animals were categorized randomly: first (OSCC+Dox), second (OSCC+n-Dox), third (OSCC) and, last, healthy animals. Results: Using n-Dox had no harmful effect on the number of white and red blood cells. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in animals treated with n-Dox was less than the other groups. Hemoglobin and hematocrit in all treated groups did not differ and were similar to the healthy control. Hepatic and cardiac enzymes did not show any significant difference in any of the groups. Conclusion: The results of this research showed that significant decreases in haematological changes occurred, including leukopenia and anemia, in an animal model of OSCC induced by 4-NQO following use of n-Dox with compare to Dox. Use of n-Dox is better than of Dox for treatment of OSCC.
