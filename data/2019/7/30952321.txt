A new highly green luminescent binuclear palladium 2-pyrazinecarboxamide-bipyridine complex [Pd(pyc)(bpy)] was prepared and characterized. The binuclear Pd(pyc)(bpy) complex doped in sol-gel matrix has a strong luminescence intensity at 547 nm with λex = 330 nm in water The method depends on the quenching of the luminescence intensity of the binuclear Pd(pyc)(bpy) complex at 547 nm by different concentrations of uric acid. The remarkable quenching of the luminescence intensity of the binuclear Pd(pyc)(bpy) complex, doped in a sol-gel matrix, by uric acid was successfully used for the determination of uric acid in serum samples of patients with hypouricemia disease. The calibration plot was achieved over the concentration 3.9 × 10-9 to 1.2 × 10-4 mol L-1uric acid with a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and a detection limit of 1.8 × 10-10 mol L-1. The method was used satisfactorily for the assessment of the uric acid in a number of serum samples collected from various patients with Hypouricemia disease.
