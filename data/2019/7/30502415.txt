In 1964, the first human oncovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, was identified in Burkitt lymphoma cells. Since then, 6 other human oncoviruses have been identified: human papillomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1, and human herpesvirus-8. These viruses are causally linked to 12% of all cancers, many of which have mucocutaneous manifestations. In addition, oncoviruses are associated with multiple benign mucocutaneous diseases. Research regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of oncoviruses and virus-specific treatment and prevention is rapidly evolving. Preventative vaccines for human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus are already available. This review discusses the mucocutaneous manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of oncovirus-related diseases. The first article in this continuing medical education series focuses on diseases associated with human papillomavirus and Merkel cell polyomavirus, while the second article in the series focuses on diseases associated with hepatitis B and C viruses, human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1, human herpesvirus-8, and Epstein-Barr virus.
