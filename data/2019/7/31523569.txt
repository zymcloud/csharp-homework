Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a solid tumor of the liver and one of the most common primary tumors of the liver. Lifestyle being a major risk factor for the development of HCC makes it a major public health concern worldwide. HCC rarely infiltrates the gall bladder because it rarely destroys the muscle layer and collagen fibers of the gallbladder wall. We report here a rare case of hepatocellular carcinoma that invaded the gallbladder and was initially misdiagnosed as primary gallbladder malignancy invading the liver.
