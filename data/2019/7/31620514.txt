Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplant is uncommon in patients who have favorable pretransplant characteristics. We present a 56-year-old man with a history of liver transplant 8 weeks prior for hepatitis C cirrhosis and HCC who presented for shortness of breath. He was found to have a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and an erythematous, nodular skin rash on his left lower abdomen. Biopsy of the skin rash would demonstrate metastatic HCC, determined to be the cause of hemolysis as well. Recurrent malignancy should be considered in patients with a history of HCC who present with new, unexplained skin nodules.
