Objective: To assess the safety and feasibility of the application of the laparoscopic modality in the perioperative treatment of central liver tumors. Methods: Collecting all the clinical information of a total of 40 patients with central liver tumors who received laparoscopic resection treatment carried out at Department of Hepatological Surgery of People's Hospital of Hunan Provincial from January 2016 to December 2018 to take a retrospective review. There were 19 males and 21 females.The age was (59.5±14.5) years (range: 15 to 71 years) . There were 26 cases of primary hepatic carcinoma (24 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 cases of cholangiocellular carcinoma) , 8 cases of hepatic cavernous hemangioma, 1 case of metastatic hepatic carcinoma, 5 cases of hepatocellular adenoma. The maximum diameter of tumors were (6.2±2.9) cm (range: 2 to 13 cm) . The patient's information about hepatectomy methods, blocking mode and time of blood flow, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative blood transfusion rate, post-operative hospitalization time, perioperative reoperation and postoperative complications were collected. Results: A total of 40 patients all were treated with laparoscopic surgery. The surgical procedure was as follows: 2 patients received the right hepatic lobectomy (Ⅴ, Ⅵ, Ⅶ and Ⅷ segments) , 2 patients received the left hepatic lobectomy (Ⅱ, III and Ⅳ segments) , 13 patients received mesohepatectomy (Ⅳ, Ⅰ and Ⅷ segments) , 2 patients received left hepatic trisegmentectomy (Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ and Ⅷ segments) , 2 patients received right hepatic trisegmentectomy (Ⅳ, Ⅴ, Ⅵ, Ⅶ and Ⅷ segments) , 7 patients received Ⅷ segmentectomy, 1 patient received Ⅳ segmentectomy, 3 patients received Ⅴ and Ⅷ segmentectomy, 5 patients received hepatic caudate lobe resection (Ⅰ, Ⅸ segments) , and 3 patients received local tumors resection.Pathological results: there were 26 cases of primary hepatic carcinoma (24 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 cases of cholangiocellular carcinoma) , 8 cases of hepatic cavernous hemangioma, 1 case of metastatic hepatic carcinoma, 5 cases of hepatocellular adenoma; the pathological reports of all malignant tumor cases all showed negative incisal edge. The operative time was (333±30) minutes (range: 280 to 380 minutes) ; the intraoperative hepatic portal occlusion period was (58±13) minutes (range: 30 to 90 minutes) ; the intraoperative hemorrhage was (173±129) ml (range: 20 to 600 ml) ; the intraoperative blood transfusion rate was 2.5% (1/40) ; the postoperative incidence of bile leakage was 2.5% (1/40) , the hospital discharge of 1 patient with bile leakage was approved after conservative treatments like T pipe decompression and adequate drainage; there was 1 case of abdominal infection and 1 case of pulmonary infection, both of which were discharged from the hospital with conservative treatments; there were no other serious postoperative complications. The postoperative hospital stay was (10.7±2.7) days (range: 6 to 16 days) ; there were no perioperative mortality and reoperation cases. Conclusion: In the centers with abundant laparoscopic hepatectomy experiences, the laparoscopic resection is proved to be safe and feasible in the perioperative treatments of central liver tumors by the highly selective cases, the adequate preoperative assessment and reasonable surgical techniques and approach.
