Background The evidence of combining sorafenib with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for intermediate-stage recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited. Patient responses to this treatment varied because of the heterogeneous nature of intermediate-stage recurrent HCC, making it important to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from this combination therapy. Purpose To compare sorafenib administered in combination with TACE versus TACE alone in the treatment of recurrent intermediate-stage HCC after initial hepatectomy and to determine the relationship of microvascular invasion (MVI) to survival. Materials and Methods In this retrospective multicenter study, 3652 consecutive patients were found to have intrahepatic recurrences after initial hepatectomy of primary HCC from January 2010 to December 2016. Of these, 260 patients with intermediate-stage recurrent HCC underwent combination treatment with sorafenib and TACE or TACE alone. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between these two treatments according to MVI status by using log-rank tests. Results A total of 128 patients were administered combination therapy (mean age, 55 years ± 7.6 [standard deviation]; 107 men) and 132 patients were administered TACE alone (mean age, 56 years ± 8.3; 110 men). The 5-year OS and PFS were higher in the combination group than in the TACE group (OS: 38.9% vs 20.5%, respectively, P = .01; PFS, 37.5% vs 18.7%, respectively, P = .003). For patients with MVI-positive lesions, the median OS and PFS after combination treatment (n = 55) were longer than those after TACE alone (n = 72; OS: 17.2 months vs 12.1 months, respectively, P = .02; PFS: 17.0 months vs 11.0 months, respectively, P = .02). Multivariable analysis showed that tumor number, MVI status, and treatment allocation were significant predictors of OS and PFS, whereas tumor size was a prognostic factor for PFS. Conclusion Patients with recurrent intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma and lesions positive for microvascular invasion (MVI) had longer survival times by using a combined treatment of sorafenib with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) compared with TACE alone; patients with MVI-negative lesions did not show survival benefit from combined therapy. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
