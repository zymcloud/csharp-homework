Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Emerging studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are differentially expressed in HCC and play an important role in HCC pathogenesis and metastasis. However, the mechanism of circRNA in the chemoresistance of HCC remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of circRNA in cisplatin resistance of HCC. We identified a novel circRNA circRNA_101505 that was decreased in cisplatin-resistant HCC tissues and cell lines, and associated with a poor survival outcome. Gain-of-function investigations showed that overexpression of circRNA_101505 suppressed cancer cell growth in vivo and in vitro, and enhanced cisplatin toxicity in HCC cells. Mechanistic studies found that circRNA_101505 could sensitize HCC cells to cisplatin by sponging miR-103, and thereby promoting oxidored-nitro domain-containing protein 1 (NOR1) expression. In conclusion, the significant inhibitory effects indicate circRNA_101505 to be a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment. Our findings provide significant evidence to further elucidate the therapeutic use of circRNA in HCC.
