Background and aim:Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a pivotal role in tumor immunity and induction of immune tolerance to a variety of antitumor effectors, including T lymphocytes. Herein, we tried to evaluate the frequency and clinical significance of MDSCs and different lymphocyte subsets in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Four groups were enrolled; chronic HCV (CHC; n = 40), HCV-related liver cirrhosis (n = 40), HCV-related HCC (HCV-HCC; n = 75), and healthy control group (n = 20). The percentage of peripheral lymphocytes subsets and total MDSCs with their main two subsets; monocytic (M-MDSCs) and granulocytic (G-MDSCs) was evaluated by flow cytometry.Results:The frequency of total MSDCs and M-MDSCs was significantly elevated in HCV-HCC especially patients with advanced stage HCC compared with those with early-stage HCC. The frequency of total MSDCs and M-MDSCs was positively correlated with ALT, AFP, and HCV viral load and negatively correlated with CD8+ T-cell frequency. CD4 + T cells were significantly decreased in HCV-HCC patients. The frequency of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells was negatively correlated with AFP and AST, but not with albumin or HCV viral load.Conclusion:Taken together, our data suggest that MDSCs, M-MDSCs, and lymphocyte subsets are associated with the development and progression of HCV-related HCC.
