NEF is a tumor suppressing long non-coding (lnc)RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma. Based on current literature, the involvement of NEF in other human diseases is still unknown. The current study aimed to investigate the potential involvement of NEF in glioma, which is a type of rare, but aggressive malignancy. It was determined that NEF expression was downregulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent heathy tissues. A low blood NEF level in patients with glioma effectively distinguished patients from healthy controls who had high blood NEF levels. Blood NEF levels were significantly correlation with distant tumor metastasis, but not tumor growth. Blood NEF levels were negatively correlated with blood transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 levels in patients with distant tumor metastasis, but not in patients with non-metastatic glioma and healthy controls. NEF overexpression inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. In addition, NEF overexpression downregulated TGF-β1 expression. The authors of the current study concluded that lncRNA NEF may inhibit glioma cell migration and invasion by downregulating TGF-β1.
