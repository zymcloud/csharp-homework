Background: Radiotherapy is a primary treatment strategy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the prognostic factors among HCC patients who have received radiotherapy but not undergone surgery have not been systematically studied. Thus, the prognostic factors were investigated in this study based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare database. Methods: A screening process was used for select cases from the SEER database. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and a competing risk model. A nomogram was established for predicting 1- and 3-year overall survival (OS) of patients. Results: A total of 1305 HCC patients who received radiotherapy but had not undergone surgery were included in this study and divided into training (n = 1175) and validation cohorts (n = 130). Patients in the training cohort had a 1-year OS rate of 30.9±1.3%, a 3-year OS rate of 10.0±1.0%, and a median survival rate of 6.0 months (range, 5.4-6.6 months). Race (p = 0.025), T stage (p < 0.001), N stage (p < 0.001), M stage (p < 0.001), and chemotherapy (p < 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors by multivariate analyses in the training cohort, while sex, age, grade, marital status, and insurance status were not independent factors. Survival in patients who received radiotherapy was worse with respect to the following characteristics: black race; higher T, N, or M stage; and no chemotherapy. A nomogram was established based on the results of the multivariate analysis, which was internally validated by a concordance index (C-index) of 0.731±0.016 and a group of calibration plots. External validation was carried out and the C-index was 0.738±0.049, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the nomogram we constructed. Conclusions: Race, T stage, N stage, M stage, and chemotherapy were independent risk factors for survival of HCC patients who received radiotherapy but had not undergone surgery. A validated nomogram was formulated to predict 1- and 3-year OS in these patients based on individual clinical characteristics.
