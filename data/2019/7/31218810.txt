Aim:The main aims of this study are to investigate the clinical application value of using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for ensuring complete resection of tumour tissue during hepatectomy and to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging system using indocyanine green in hepatectomy.Methods:After undergoing liver resection at the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University from July 2017 to May 2018, 35 eligible patients were included in this study. The liver surface and resection margin were intraoperatively assessed by intraoperative ultrasonography and NIR fluorescence imaging, after intravenous administration of indocyanine green (0.5 mg/kg) 72-96 h prior to surgery. The intraoperative observations were compared with the pathological findings in the liver.Results:In the 35 patients, a total of 53 lesions were found, of which 42 were malignant lesions. The analysis results showed that the sensitivity and accuracy of detection using NIR fluorescence imaging were significantly higher than with intraoperative ultrasonography (P 0.05). In addition, 11 new suspicious lesions were detected only by NIR fluorescence imaging in the liver surface and resection margin during surgery, four of which were hepatocellular carcinoma. We also detected four vein tumour thrombi using the NIR fluorescence navigation system.Conclusions:The NIR fluorescence navigation system enables the identification of small tumours, residual cancer tissues in resection margin and venous tumour embolies in real time and enhances the accuracy and integrity of liver resection.
