Objectives:Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) consist of a cluster of RNAs having >200 nucleotides lacking protein-coding function. Recent studies indicate that lncRNAs are involved in various cellular processes and their aberrant expression may lead to tumour development and progression. They may also serve as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes in other diseases. In this review, we emphasize current investigations involving clinical management, tumour progression and the molecular mechanism of SNHG1 in human cancer.Materials and methods:We investigate and summarize recent studies regarding the biologic functions and mechanisms of lncRNA SNHG1 in tumorigenesis. Related studies were obtained through a systematic search of google scholar, PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library.Results:SNHG1 is a novel oncogenic lncRNA aberrantly expressed in different diseases including colorectal, liver, lung, prostate, gastric and esophageal cancers as well as ischemic stroke, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and osteosarcoma. Upregulation of SNHG1 was significantly associated with advanced tumour stage, tumour size, TNM stage and decreased overall survival. Furthermore, aberrant expression of SNHG1 contributes to cell proliferation, metastasis, migration and invasion of cancer cells.Conclusion:SNHG1 likely acts as a useful tumour biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.
