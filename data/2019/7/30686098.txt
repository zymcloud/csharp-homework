UVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated) is an important regulator of mammalian macroautophagy/autophagy by interacting with BECN1, PIK3C3, and RUBCN. Phosphorylation of UVRAG by MTORC1 negatively regulates autophagosome maturation under nutrient-enriched conditions. However, how UVRAG ubiquitination is regulated is still unknown. Here we report that UVRAG is ubiquitinated by SMURF1 at lysine residues 517 and 559, which decreases the association of UVRAG with RUBCN and promotes autophagosome maturation. However, the deubiquitinase ZRANB1 specifically cleaves SMURF1-induced K29 and K33-linked polyubiquitin chains from UVRAG, thereby increasing the binding of UVRAG to RUBCN and inhibiting autophagy flux. We also demonstrate that CSNK1A1-mediated UVRAG phosphorylation at Ser522 disrupts the binding of SMURF1 to UVRAG through PPxY motif and blocks UVRAG ubiquitination-mediated autophagosome maturation. Interestingly, ZRANB1 is phosphorylated at Thr35, and Ser209 residues by CSNK1A1, and this phosphorylation activates its deubiquitinating activity. Importantly, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that UVRAG ubiquitination at lysine residues 517 and 559 or prevention of Ser522 phosphorylation by D4476, a CSNK1A1 inhibitor, enhances the lysosomal degradation of EGFR, which significantly inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth. Furthermore, UVRAG S522 phosphorylation levels correlate with ZRANB1 T35/S209 phosphorylation levels and poor prognosis in HCC patients. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism by which ubiquitination and phosphorylation of UVRAG regulate its function in autophagosome maturation and HCC growth, encouraging further study of their potential therapeutic implications.
