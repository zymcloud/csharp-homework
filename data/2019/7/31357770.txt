Liver cancer (HCC) holds third position for cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Therefore, it is urgent to explore new strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Illustrating the successful experience of other tumors on precancerous lesions, this paper puts forward the idea of advance strategy for the diagnosis and treatment through dysplastic nodules, especially high-grade dysplastic nodules, which can reduce or delay the carcinogenesis of some patients with cirrhosis. It is hoped that this measure might improve the present situation of diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer in coming days in China.
