Objective:The previous research revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a vital role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To further discuss the underlying mechanisms of lncRNA DCST1-AS1 in the pathogenesis of HCC.Patients and methods:We screened the abnormally expressed genes in HCC tissues through microarray analysis and found that lncRNA DCST1-AS1 was one of the genes significantly up-regulated. Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to test the gene expression of lncRNA DCST1-AS1 in HCC tissues and HepG2 cells. Respectively, CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry detection, transwell assay, wound healing assay, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and autophagy of HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, the expression of signaling pathway proteins was detected by Western blot.Results:LncRNA DCST1-AS1 was confirmed hyper-expression both in HCC tissues and HCC cells. High expression of lncRNA DCST1-AS1 was significantly correlated with inferior prognosis. Moreover, lncRNA DCST1-AS1 depletion suppressed proliferation and accelerated apoptosis, activated cycle arrest, restrained cell migration, and stimulated autophagy in HCC cells. In addition, it is found that the depletion of lncRNA DCST1-AS1 on HepG2 cells exhibits anti-tumor characteristics and was mediated by the AKT/mTOR signal transduction pathway. Furthermore, pre-treated HepG2 cells with SC79, an AKT signal activator, partially restored the effect of lncRNA DCST1-AS1 silencing on HepG2 cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and autophagy.Conclusions:Our results suggested that lncRNA DCST1-AS1, as a carcinogenic factor in HCC, promoted cell proliferation, and invasion, inhibited apoptosis and autophagy by modulating the AKT/mTOR signaling cascade. Therefore, our findings showed that lncRNA DCST1-AS1 may improve potential treatment strategies for HCC.
