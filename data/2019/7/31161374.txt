Purpose:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 125I brachytherapy to treat bilateral lung recurrences from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after resection or ablation.Materials and methods:We retrospectively recruited 95 patients with bilateral lung recurrences from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after resection or ablation who had received 3-6-month sorafenib with or without stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), from October 2011 to January 2015; patients were then randomly divided into two groups, 44 patients received computed tomography (CT)-guided 125I brachytherapy (group A), and 51 patients were treated with supportive and symptomatic treatments (group B).Results:The median survival time was 19 months (range of 3-36 months). The local response rate (LRR) at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months in group A was 81.8%, 65.9%, 59.1%, 45.0%, 38.6%, 22.7%, 11.4%, respectively, and 64.7%, 47.1%, 33.3%, 25.4%, 15.7%, 11.7%, 7.8%, respectively, in group B (P Conclusion:CT-guided 125I brachytherapy is safe and effective for the treatment of bilateral lung recurrences from HCC after resection or ablation.
