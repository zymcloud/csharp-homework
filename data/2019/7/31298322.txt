Objective:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be vital in tumor progression. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of fatal primary liver cancers worldwide. This study aims to determine whether lncRNA SNHG7 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 7) functions in the metastasis of HCC.Patients and methods:Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to detect the SNHG7 expression in HCC cells and tissue samples. Moreover, function assays were performed in vitro to identify the role of SNHG7 in metastasis of HCC cells. Western blot assay was used to explore the possible mechanism.Results:SNHG7 expression was remarkably higher in HCC tissues than that in adjacent tissues. Moreover, HCC migration and invasion were suppressed after silence of SNHG7 in HCC cells. Moreover, after silence of SNHG7, RBM5 was upregulated in HCC cells. Besides, the expression of RBM5 in tumor tissues was negatively correlated to the expression of SNHG7.Conclusions:Our study suggests that SNHG7 could promote cell invasion and migration in HCC cells through downregulating RBM5, which may offer a new therapeutic intervention for HCC patients.
