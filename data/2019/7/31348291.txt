In this study, we aim to explore the values of serum dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in predicting the efficacy and prognosis of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We did a retrospective analysis on 155 HCC patients who underwent TACE treatment. The patients were divided into response group (complete response and partial response) and nonresponse group (stable disease and progressive disease), and their changes in serum DKK1 and CTCs after TACE were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curve and survival analysis were used to assess the predictive values of DKK1 and CTCs for TACE efficacy and long-term prognosis of HCC. We found that the levels of preoperative DKK1 and CTCs in patients with HCC had a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.54). After TACE treatment, the serum DKK1 and CTCs in the response group were significantly decreased compared to pretreatment levels (P 0.02 Î¼g/L reduction in DKK1 level after 4 weeks of TACE to predict the efficacy of TACE treatment (AUC = 0.913, 95% confidence interval: 0.856-0.952, P
