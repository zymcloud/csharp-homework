Background and objectives:Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is common in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In order to intervene HCC LNM in advance, we developed a prediction nomogram based on serum long noncoding RNA (lncRNA).Methods:Serum samples from 242 HCC patients were gathered and randomly enrolled into the training and validation cohorts. LncRNAs screened out from microarray were quantified with qRT-PCR. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied for screening independent risk factors. A prediction nomogram was ultimately developed for HCC LNM. The nomogram was estimated by discrimination and calibration tests in the validation cohort. The effects of the candidate lncRNA on the malignant phenotypes of HCC cells were further explored by wound healing assay and colony formation assay.Results:ENST00000418803, lnc-ZNF35-4:1, lnc-EPS15L1-2:1, BCLC stage, and vascular invasion were selected as components of the nomogram according to the adjusted multivariate analysis. The nomogram effectively predicted the HCC LNM risk among the cohorts with suitable calibration fittings and displayed high discrimination with C-index of 0.89 and 0.85. Moreover, the abnormally high expression of lnc-EPS15L1-2:1 in HCC cell lines showed significant carcinogenic effects.Conclusions:The noninvasive nomogram may provide more diagnostic basis for treatments of HCC. The biomarkers identified can bring new clues to basic researches.
