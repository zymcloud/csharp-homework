Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection is considered a high risk for development of end-stage liver diseases, particularly server hepatitis, decompensated liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Regulatory T cells (Treg) and T-helper 17 (TH17) associated cytokines presumed to play a pivotal role in the immune pathogenesis of HCV infection and stimulate autoimmune diseases. Herein, we tried to assess the association of Treg and TH 17 cytokines with HCV pathogenesis and liver pathology. Fifty CHC infected patients and twenty HCV free controls were included in this study, IL17, IL21, IL10, IL4, TGF- and IL35 serum levels were assessed in both groups using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CHC infected patients had statistically signiﬁcant higher values of all serum cytokine levels when compared to the control group (P
