Background:To determine the treatment behaviors among a community-based cohort of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected persons and to examine the disease progression among non-antiviral-treated HBV-infected cases after 5 years of follow-up.Methods:We conducted a community-based prospective study on people with chronic HBV infection in mainland China from 2009 to 2014. In 2009, we recruited participants who were identified as HBV infected in 2006 in a national sero-survey. A face-to-face follow-up investigation was completed in 2014, and the personal information, the clinical diagnosis provided at the last hospital visit, the HBV antiviral treatment history, and the insurance type was collected for each patient for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors that are associated with active medical care- seeking and antiviral treatments.Results:Among the 2422 chronic HBV-infected patients recruited in 2009, 1784 (73.7%) were followed-up to 2014, and 638 (35.8%) had sought medical care in hospitals; among them, 140 (21.9%) received antiviral treatments. The lowest medical care-seeking rate (26%) was in participants over 50-year old. We determined that the frequency of medical care-seeking was higher among those participants living in urban areas (aRR = 1.3, 95% CI:1.0-1.6), those in 0-19-year old (aRR = 1.5, 95% CI:1.1-2.1), 20-39-year old (aRR = 2.2, 95% CI:1.7-3.0) and 40-49-year old (aRR = 1.5, 95% CI:1.1-2.0), and persons with insurance of the type Urban residents' basic medical insurance (URBMI) or Commercial health insurance (CHI) (aRR = 2.5, 95% CI:1.7-3.6) and New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) (aRR = 1.9, 95% CI:1.4-2.6). Patients were more likely to receive antiviral treatment if they were 20-39-year old (aRR = 0.4, 95% CI:0.3-0.7), had insurance of the type URBMI or CHI (aRR = 2.6, 95% CI:1.1-6.3) or NRCMS (aRR = 3.0, 95% CI:1.3-6.9) and were treated at prefecture and above-level hospitals (aRR = 2.0, 95% CI:1.4-3.0). Among non-antiviral-treated HBV-infected cases, we found the annual rates for HBsAg sero-clearance, progress to cirrhosis and HCC were 1.0, 0.6 and 0.2%, respectively.Conclusion:The rates of medical care-seeking and antiviral treatment were low among community-based chronic HBV-infected persons, thus we recommend improving the insurance policies for HBV-infected persons to increase the antiviral treatment rate, and conducting extensive education to promote HBV-infected patients actively seeking medical care from hospitals.
