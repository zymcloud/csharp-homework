Purpose:We evaluated the detection rate and degree of motion artifact of the modified CAIPIRINHA-VIBE (mC-VIBE) without view-sharing and compare them with the CAIPIRINHA-Dixon-TWIST-VIBE (CDT-VIBE) with view-sharing on multi-arterial gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI in the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:We retrospectively identified 114 pathological-proven hepatic tumors in 114 patients with risk of HCC who underwent multi-arterial gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI between June 2016 and June 2018. All patients underwent triple arterial phase imaging using the mC-VIBE without view-sharing (54 patients; 49 HCCs and 5 non-HCCs) or the CDT-VIBE with view-sharing (60 patients; 55 HCCs and 5 non-HCCs). We compared the detection rate of two sequences for HCC, with reference to LI-RADS.V.2017. We also compared the mean motion scores and proportions of transient severe motion (TSM) in two sequences.Result:For the examination using the mC-VIBE, the HCC-detection rate was significantly higher, compared with that using CDT-VIBE (93.9% [46/49] vs 80.0% [44/55], respectively; p = 0.047). For the examination with the mC-VIBE, mean motion scores were significantly lower compared with those of CDT-VIBE for all multi-arterial phases (1.21, 1.19, and 1.15 vs. 1.82, 1.85, and 1.84, respectively; p Conclusion:In multi-arterial phase gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, the mC-VIBE sequence without view-sharing has slightly higher HCC-detection rate and fewer motion artifacts compared with CDT-VIBE with view-sharing.Key points:• Multi-arterial phase using the mC-VIBE without view-sharing can overcome motion artifacts, resulting in providing optimal arterial phase imaging. • The HCC-detection rate is slightly higher with the mC-VIBE vs. CAIPIRINHA-Dixon-TWIST-VIBE with view-sharing (CDT-VIBE). • View-sharing of CDT-VIBE in the multi-arterial phase is associated with increased frequency of TSM.
