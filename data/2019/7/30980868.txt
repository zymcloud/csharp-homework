Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will almost always develop acquired tolerance after sorafenib therapy, and the molecular mechanism of sorafenib tolerance remains poorly characterized. Here, using our established sorafenib-resistant HCC cell and xenograft models, we identified a novel gene, KIAA1199, which was markedly elevated among the differentially expressed genes involved in sorafenib tolerance. Moreover, elevated expression of KIAA1199 was positively correlated with a high risk of recurrence and metastasis and advanced TNM stage in HCC patients. Functionally, loss- and gain-of-function studies showed that KIAA1199 promoted the migration, invasion, and metastasis of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Mechanistically, KIAA1199 is required for EGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells by aiding in EGFR phosphorylation. In summary, our data uncover KIAA1199 as a novel sorafenib-tolerant promoting gene that plays an indispensable role in maintaining sorafenib-resistant HCC cell metastasis.
