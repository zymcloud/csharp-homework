Background & aims:The immunogenomic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with immune cell stroma (HCC-IS), defined histologically, have not been clarified. We investigated the clinical and molecular features of HCC-IS and the prognostic impact of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.Methods:We evaluated 219 patients with conventional HCC (C-HCC) and 47 with HCC-IS using in situ hybridization for EBV, immunohistochemistry, multiplex immunofluorescence staining, and whole exome and transcriptome sequencing. Human leukocyte antigen types were also extracted from the sequencing data. Genomic and prognostic parameters were compared between HCC-IS and C-HCC.Results:CD8 T cell infiltration was more frequent in HCC-IS than C-HCC (mean fraction/sample, 22.6% vs. 8.9%, false discovery rate q Conclusions:HCC-IS is a distinct HCC subtype associated with a good prognosis and frequent EBV-positive TILs. However, paradoxically, a high density of EBV-positive TILs in tumors is associated with inferior prognostic outcomes. Patients with HCC-IS could be candidates for immunotherapy.Lay summary:Hepatocellular carcinomas with histologic evidence of abundant immune cell infiltration are characterized by frequent activation of Epstein-Barr virus in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and less aggressive clinical behavior. However, a high density of Epstein-Barr virus-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with inferior prognostic outcomes, possibly as a result of immune escape due to significant CD8 T cell exhaustion.
