Purpose:To evaluate the impact of disclosure/nondisclosure of cancer diagnosis on patients' posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), posttraumatic growth (PTG), and quality of life (QOL).Methods:Patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who were admitted for potentially curative treatments in a teaching hospital were recruited. Patients were interviewed at admission regarding their QOL and their attitude towards disclosure of diagnosis. They were interviewed again for QOL, PTSS, and PTG at discharge and at 1 month after discharge.Results:There were 300 patients recruited, 88.3% of whom preferred disclosure of cancer diagnosis. In fact, 162 patients (54.0%) received disclosure of their cancer diagnosis before discharge (disclosed group). However, for the 138 patients whose diagnoses were concealed by their families (uninformed group), 116 patients (84.1%) had learned of their diagnosis of HCC independently within 1 month after discharge. Comparing the scores at 1 month after discharge with scores at discharge showed that the PTSS score significantly declined for patients in the disclosed group and the PTG score significantly decreased for the uninformed patients at 1 month after discharge (p Conclusions:Our findings indicate that concealing the diagnosis of cancer from patients is unlikely to succeed. Additionally, disclosure of diagnosis is beneficial for HCC patients in reducing PTSS and improving PTG and QOL.
