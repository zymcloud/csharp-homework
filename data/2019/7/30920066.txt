The present study investigated the impact of coexposure to fluoride and diethylnitrosamine (DEN) on hepatorenal function in adult rats. The animals were exposed to fluoride (15 mg/L in drinking water) and DEN (10 mg/kg) singly or coexposed to both compounds for 14 days. Results demonstrated that the fluoride or DEN mediated increase in hepatorenal toxicity was intensified in the coexposure group. Additionally, the decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities as well as the elevation in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and lipid peroxidation was markedly aggravated in rats coexposed to DEN and fluoride. Furthermore, the increase in levels of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, myeloperoxidase and caspase-3 activities as well as histological lesions was more pronounced in the liver and kidney of rats coexposed to DEN and fluoride. Conclusively, coexposure to fluoride and DEN exacerbated hepatorenal damage via enhancement of oxido-inflammatory responses and caspase-3 activation in rats.
