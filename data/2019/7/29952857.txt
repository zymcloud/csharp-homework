Goals:We aim to describe the efficacy, safety profile, and variables associated with survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib in South America.Background:Sorafenib has been shown to improve survival in patients with advanced HCC. There are few data on sorafenib use for HCC in South America.Study:We performed a retrospective analysis of HCC cases treated with sorafenib from 8 medical centers in 5 South American countries, between January 2010 and June 2017. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), which was defined as time from sorafenib initiation to death or last follow-up. Risk factors for decreased OS were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression and log-rank tests.Results:Of 1336 evaluated patients, 127 were treated with sorafenib and were included in the study. The median age of individuals was 65 years (interquartile range, 55 to 71) and 70% were male individuals. Median OS in all patients was 8 months (interquartile range, 2 to 17). Variables associated with survival on multivariate analysis were platelets >//Conclusions:Pretreatment elevation of platelets and advanced BCLC stage were independently associated with poor survival on sorafenib in a South American cohort.
