Eastern and Western guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are known to significantly differ on many points, because they reflect different diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this cancer. Importantly, these guidelines are primarily consensus-driven when it comes to surveillance, both in term of the tests used and surveillance program design. The main difference between East and West lies in clinical practice, as several Eastern countries implement coordinated and systematic surveillance programs, while most Western countries rely on individual adherence to surveillance recommendations. This review article presents an overview of the evidence supporting surveillance programs for HCC, with a particular focus on the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and consequences of this approach for patient survival. Western and Eastern guideline recommendations are discussed.
