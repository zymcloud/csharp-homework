Patients receiving sorafenib treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) experience different treatment efficacy. Personalized sorafenib treatment should be achieved through the identification of predictors of therapeutic response. In the current study, we found that high UGT1A9 expression indicated better prognosis for HCC patients treated with sorafenib after surgery. In silico analysis predicted microRNA-200a/-183 as potential regulators of the UGT1A gene family via binding to the shared UGT1A9 3'-UTR. A significant inverse correlation between microRNA-200a/-183 and UGT1A9 mRNA level was observed in a panel of HCC specimens. Direct binding was further demonstrated by luciferase reporter gene vector carrying wild-type or binding site truncated UGT1A9 3'-UTR. MicroRNA-200a/-183 downregulated UGT1A9 expression in a dose-dependent manner and significantly reduced sorafenib Î²-D-glucuronide formation in HCC cells. These data indicated that UGT1A9, under epigenetic regulation of microRNA-200a/-183, could predict patients who might benefit from adjuvant sorafenib treatment after surgery.
