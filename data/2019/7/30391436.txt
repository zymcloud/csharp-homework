Background & aims:Little is known about trends in mortality among Hispanic subpopulations and etiologies of chronic liver disease (CLD). We investigated trends in mortality of CLD among the 3 largest Hispanic subgroups based on origin (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans) in the United States (US) from 2007 to 2016.Methods:We collected data from the US Census and national mortality database, calculated age-standardized mortalities for CLD among Hispanic subgroups, and compared these with non-Hispanic whites. We determined mortality rate patterns by joinpoint analysis with estimates of annual percentage change.Results:Hispanics were relatively younger with a lower likelihood of high school education than non-Hispanic whites at time of death. Puerto Ricans had the highest rates of age-standardized hepatitis C virus-related mortality in 2016, followed by non-Hispanic whites, Mexicans, and Cubans. Age-standardized mortality rates associated with hepatitis B virus infection decreased steadily among all subjects. Age-standardized mortality rates from alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease among non-Hispanic whites and all Hispanics increased and accelerated. Mexicans had the highest rates of age-standardized alcoholic liver disease-related mortality, followed by non-Hispanic whites, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. Cirrhosis- and hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality rates increased steadily from 2007 to 2016, with the highest among Puerto Ricans and non-Hispanic whites and Mexicans, and lowest in Cubans.Conclusions:We found high levels of heterogeneity in CLD-related mortality patterns among the 3 largest Hispanic subgroups. Therefore, combining Hispanics as an aggregate group obscures potentially meaningful heterogeneity in etiology-specific CLD-related mortality rates among Hispanic subgroups.
