Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most fatal cancers with common features of invasion and metastasis. Recent evidence indicate that the long noncoding RNA NORAD is a potential oncogene and is significantly upregulated in several cancers. However, the general biological role and clinical value of NORAD in HCC remains unknown. Here, NORAD expression was measured in 29 paired tumor and paratumor tissues via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The effects of NORAD on HCC cell malignant potential were investigated via NORAD overexpression and knockdown both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) was acquired and identified by bioinformatics analyses and luciferase assays. Moreover, the impact of NORAD level on the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway was further determined by qPCR. We found that HCC tissues had a high level of NORAD compared with the paratumor tissues, and NORAD upregulation was associated with the shorter overall survival of patients with HCC. Furthermore, NORAD overexpression was demonstrated to promote HCC cell migration and invasion. Mechanically, NORAD might function as a ceRNA to regulate miR-202-5p, which served as a tumor-suppressing microRNA via the TGF-β pathway. We address that NORAD has a tumor-promoting effect in HCC and describes a novel mechanism whereby NORAD regulates the TGF-β pathway as a ceRNA of Homo sapiens (hsa)-miR-202-5p.
