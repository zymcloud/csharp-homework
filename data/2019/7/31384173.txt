Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and have been confirmed to participate in the carcinogenesis and development of HCC. However, the relationship between miR-497-5p and HCC remains unclear.Methods:Kaplan-Meier curve analysis and the log-rank test were used to investigate the efficacy of miR-497-5p on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with HCC. According to in vitro experiments, programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) was a target of miR-497-5p by the dual-luciferase activity assay. The efficacy of PDCD4 on cell proliferation and metastasis in HCC was examined by transwell assays, CCK-8 assays and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Additionally, we conducted a luciferase activity reporter assay to confirm the interaction between lncRNA XIST and miR-49-5p. Then, to evaluate the relationship between lncRNA XIST and miR-497-5p, several mechanistic experiments, including qRT-PCR, Western blotting, transwell assays and tumor xenograft assays, were performed.Results:miR-497-5p was upregulated in HCC tissues, and high expression of miR-497-5p resulted in increases in tumor size and tumor number and a higher tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and Edmondson grade in patients with HCC. Silencing miR-497-5p inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCC cells. PDCD4, which was downregulated in HCC tissues, was shown to be a target of miR-497-5p and was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-497-5p. lncRNA XIST was found to act as a miR-497-5p sponge and to regulate the level of PDCD4, which is targeted by miR-497-5p. lncRNA XIST was observed to be downregulated in the HCC tissues and positively correlated with the expression of PDCD4.Conclusions:Our findings reveal that the XIST/miR-497-5p/PDCD4 axis participates in HCC development and that XIST could be used as a biomarker of HCC.
