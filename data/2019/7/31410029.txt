Background and aims:This study aimed to clarify the prognostic role of LINC01296 in various cancers, and to evaluate its effect on proliferation, metastasis, and the cell cycle in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by data mining, bioinformatics, and in vitro validation.Methods:The prognostic role of LINC01296 in cancer patients was assessed by searching the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Gene Expression Omnibus databases and calculating pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); this prognostic role was also evaluated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We detected LINC01296 expression in HCC cell lines, and lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNAs were used to silence LINC01296 in MHCC97H and Hep3B cells to explore the role of LINC01296 in cell proliferation, metastasis, and cell cycle progression with in vitro validation and bioinformatics.Results:The results indicated that LINC01296 overexpression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in various cancers; however, LINC01296 expression was not associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS). Similar results were found with TCGA, which showed that LINC01296 expression was associated with the pathologic stage, tumor size, and differentiation in Asian cancer patients. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis revealed expression of 394 related genes, which indicated that LINC01296 could be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC. In vitro gene silencing experiments indicated that LINC01296 downregulation repressed cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and the metastatic potential of HCC through the regulation of BUB1, CCNA2, and CDK1 expression.Conclusion:This study demonstrated that LINC01296 expression is related to poor OS and DFS in a variety of cancer types and that LINC01296 has an oncogenic role in HCC.
