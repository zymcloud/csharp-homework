Background & aims:Fibrosis stage can decrease following treatment in patients with hemochromatosis caused by mutations in the homeostatic iron regulator gene (HFE), but the effects on cirrhosis are not clear. We assessed regression of severe fibrosis and the ensuing risk of liver cancer after treatment.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 106 patients in France or Australia who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE with F3 fibrosis (n = 40) or F4 fibrosis (n = 66) at diagnosis and from whom at least 1 liver biopsy was collected during follow up. We collected data from the time of first biopsy and during follow-up period on patient demographics, treatment, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, infection with hepatitis B or C viruses, and other diseases. The median time between first and last liver biopsy was 9.5 years (range, 3.5-15.6 years). We collected results of tests for liver function, markers of iron stores, and platelet levels. Patients were followed for a median 17.6 years (range, 9.8-24.1 years) for development of liver cancer occurrence.Results:At last liver biopsy, 41 patients (38.6%) had fibrosis scores of F2 or less. Liver cancer occurred in 34 patients (52.3%) with F3 or F4 fibrosis at last liver biopsy vs 2 patients (4.8%) with fibrosis scores of F2 or less at last liver biopsy (P Conclusions:In a retrospective analysis of patients with hemochromatosis caused by the C282Y mutation in HFE, we found that severe liver fibrosis can regress with treatment. In patients with fibrosis regression to a stage F2 or less, the long-term risk for liver cancer is significantly reduced.
