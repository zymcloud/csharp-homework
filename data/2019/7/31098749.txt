This committee is comprised of health care providers with diverse areas of expertise and perspectives on radiation dosimetry. The goal of these recommendations is to optimize glass microspheres radiation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma while accounting for variables including disease presentation, tumour vascularity, liver function, and curative/palliative intent. The recommendations aim to unify glass microsphere users behind standardized dosimetry methodology that is simple, reproducible and supported by clinical data, with the overarching goal of improving clinical outcomes and advancing the knowledge of dosimetry.
