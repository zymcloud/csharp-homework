Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is well known as an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, a novel embolic agent of sodium alginate (SA)-modified silk fibroin (SF) microspheres was successfully prepared by emulsifying cross-linking method. The SA-modified SF microspheres were evaluated for the ability of embolization by investigating the morphology, particle size, swelling ratio, degradation, cytotoxicity, blood compatibility, and in vivo embolization. The results found that SA-modified SF microspheres had smooth surfaces and good sphericity. Swelling ratio of the microspheres can meet the requirements of arterial embolic agent and have pH and temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, hemolytic and anticoagulant studies have proved that the microspheres have good blood compatibility. Cytotoxicity tests indicated that the microspheres could promote the proliferation of fibroblasts and HUVEC. In vivo embolization evaluation of microspheres revealed that the arteries could be embolized by SA-modified SF microspheres in 3 weeks. The ability of drug loading and releasing of microspheres was proved by the controlled release profile of Adriamycin hydrochloride. The findings indicated that the SA-modified SF microspheres can be used as a potentially biodegradable arterial embolic agent for liver cancer therapy.
