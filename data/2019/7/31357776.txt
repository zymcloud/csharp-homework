Objective: To comparatively study intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with reference to clinical features and prognosis in Chinese Han population. Methods: 699 cases of HCC and 170 cases of ICC confirmed by surgical pathological files from 2009 to 2010 were included and followed-up. The differences in demographic characteristics, hepatitis B virus infection, clinical characteristics, biochemical indexes, tumor markers and prognosis of HCC and ICC were analyzed retrospectively by means of paired t-test, analysis of variance, chi-square test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: Among 869 cases of primary liver cancer, HCC and ICC accounted for 80.43% and 19.57%. The old aged (P < 0.001) male incidence of HCC was higher than that of ICC (P < 0.001). The infection rates of hepatitis B virus were 89.84% and 35.88% in HCC and ICC, respectively, and the infection rates of hepatitis B, serum HBsAg postive rate and DNA account in HCC were higher than ICC (P < 0.001). The incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatic schistosomiasis in HCC was also significantly different from that in ICC (both P < 0.01). Pearson's correlation analysis showed that there was a significant negative correlation between HCC or ICC tumor type and hepatic schistosomiasis (r = -0.018, P < 0.001), and there was a significant positive correlation between HCC and hepatic cirrhosis (r = 0.179, P < 0.001, and r = 0.528, P < 0.001, respectively). However, the proportion of cirrhosis and schistosomiasis in hepatitis B positive ICC cases was not significantly different from that in HCC cases (P > 0.05). Among the biochemical indicators, there were significant differences between HCC and ICC in the abnormal rate of ALT(P < 0.01), AST(P < 0.05), ALP (P < 0.01), GGT (P < 0.01) and TBIL (P < 0.01) while there was no significant difference between ALB and pre-ALB (P > 0.05) in HCC and ICC groups. The content and abnormal rate of alpha-fetoprotein were higher in HCC (P < 0.01), while the content and abnormal rate of carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were higher in ICC (P < 0.01). The 10-year survival rate and median survival time (46.92% and 80.3 months) of HCC were higher than those of ICC (12.57% and 12.4 months) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: In the study population, compared with ICC cases, the old aged male HCC cases are more common and has higher infection rate of hepatitis B virus and cirrhosis, but liver schistosomiasis is less common. The inflammatory damage, secretion and metabolic function of HCC were different from that of ICC cases, while the synthetic reserve function was similar to that of ICC and the prognosis of HCC cases was significantly better. The incidence of cirrhosis and schistosomiasis in ICC cases with positive hepatitis B virus infection was not significantly different from that of HCC cases.
