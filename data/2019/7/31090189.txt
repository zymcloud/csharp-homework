Background:Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is used as a first-line treatment for colorectal liver metastases that recur after first liver resection in our institution. We aim to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy compared to repeated surgical resection.Methods:A retrospective review was performed in 104 patients treated with curative intent for resectable recurrent colorectal liver metastases.Results:Sixty-one patients underwent RFA and 43 patients underwent surgery. The overall recurrence rates were 82% in the RFA group and 65.1% in the resection group (P = 0.05). The local recurrence rate on a lesion-basis was markedly higher after RFA than that after resection (16.7% versus 7.3%, P = 0.04). The difference remained significant in patients with a maximum lesion diameter >3 cm (24.5% versus 7.6%, P = 0.01). RFA treatment was independently associated with recurrence on multivariate analyses (P = 0.01). 69.7% of RFA patients and 42.6% of surgery patients with intrahepatic recurrence were amenable to repeated local treatment (P = 0.05), leading to the equivalent actuarial 3-year progression free survival rates (RFA: 29.1% versus Resection: 33.1%, P = 0.48) and 5-year overall survival rates in the two treatment groups (RFA: 33% versus Resection: 28.4%, P = 0.36).Conclusions:Surgery remains the treatment of choice for resectable recurrence. RFA may offer similar benefit in selected patients.
