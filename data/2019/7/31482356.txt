Background:Laparoscopic liver resection yields improved short-term surgical outcomes, whereas the reports about clinical benefits of single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH) are scarce. This retrospective study is to compare the surgical outcomes of SILH with those of multi-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (MILH).Methods:The study included 54 patients who had undergone SILH and 184 patients who had undergone MILH between January 2010 and December 2017. Short-term outcomes were compared in those of patients who underwent left lateral sectionectomy and partial hepatectomy of segment 5-6. A subgroup analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was also performed for long-term outcome comparisons.Results:In those of patients who underwent left lateral sectionectomy, SILH group had less chronic hepatitis B (15.2 vs. 45.8%; p = 0.004), less liver cirrhosis (12.1 vs. 50.0%; p = 0.002), less tumor proximal to major vessel (6.1 vs. 29.2%; p = 0.018), shorter surgical time (113.2 ± 37.9 vs. 146.0 ± 50.5 min; p = 0.007), and shorter postoperative hospital stays (4.4 ± 1.1 vs. 5.4 ± 1.3 days; p = 0.002) compared with MILH group. In those of patients with tumor located at segment 5-6, no significant differences were observed in surgical time, blood loss, complications, and mortality. Single-incision laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was only associated with wider surgical margins (11.8 ± 7.0 vs. 5.3 ± 5.2 mm; p = 0.003). In the HCC subgroup, SILH had similar 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival and 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates compared with patients who had undergone MILH.Conclusions:The study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of single-incision laparoscopic liver resection for left lateral sectionectomy and partial hepatectomy for segment 5-6. In selected patients within the group and by experienced surgical team, the SILH technique results in comparable short-term surgical outcomes and long-term oncological outcomes.
