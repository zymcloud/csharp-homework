Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer, whose diversified occurrence worldwide indicates a connection between genetic variations among individuals and the predisposition to such neoplasms. Mounting evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 can have both promotive and inhibitory effects on cancer development, revealing a dual role in tumorigenesis. In this study, the link of H19 gene polymorphisms to hepatocarcinogenesis was assessed between 359 HCC patients and 1190 cancer-free subjects. We found that heterozygotes for the minor allele of H19 rs2839698 (T) and rs3741219 (G) were more inclined to develop HCC (OR, 1.291; 95% CI, 1.003-1.661; p = 0.047, and OR, 1.361; 95% CI, 1.054-1.758; p = 0.018, respectively), whereas homozygotes for the polymorphic allele of rs2107425 (TT) were correlated with a decreased risk of HCC (OR, 0.606; 95% CI, 0.410-0.895; p = 0.012). Moreover, patients who bear at least one variant allele (heterozygote or homozygote) of rs3024270 were less prone to develop late-stage tumors (for stage III/IV; OR, 0.566; 95% CI, 0.342-0.937; p = 0.027). In addition, carriers of a particular haplotype of three H19 SNPs tested were more susceptible to HCC. In conclusion, our results indicate an association between H19 gene polymorphisms and the incidence and progression of liver cancer.
