Accumulating evidence suggests that long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays important roles in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. However, the mechanism underlying how lncRNA regulate hepatocellular carcinoma process remains largely unknown. In this study we found that the expression of LINC01152 was significantly increased in HBV positive HCC tissues and cells and was induced by HBx in vitro. The overexpression of LINC01152 could increases HCC cell proliferation and promotes tumor formation in nude mice. Mechanistically, HBx could increase the transcription of LINC01152. Elevated LINC01152 binds to the promoter region of IL-23, promoting its transcriptional activity and upregulating the levels of Stat3 and p-Stat3. Our findings suggest that LINC01152 plays an important role in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma development and may serve as a therapeutic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma.
