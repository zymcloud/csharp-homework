Background:The clinical characteristics and outcomes of secondary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cancer survivors with other prior malignancies remain poorly understood. We aimed to depict the features of HCC patients with other prior cancer and to examine the prognostic effect of prior cancer in those patients.Methods:All patients diagnosed with HCC between 2004 and 2014 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis were conducted to determine survival differences and impact of prior cancer history.Results:In total, 32,343 eligible patients with HCC were included in the current study, and 2830 (8.7%) of those patients had prior cancer. Patients who had prior cancer were older and more frequently at localized or regional stages of HCC compared to those without a history of cancer. No differences in overall or cancer-specific survival rates were observed among patients with or without prior cancer, as revealed by the Kaplan-Meier curves. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, a history of cancer was not a prognostic factor for worse overall (HR = 0.99, 95%CI 0.94-1.03, P = 0.577) or HCC-specific (HR = 1.01, 95%CI 0.96-1.06, P = 0.802) survival after adjustment for various covariates.Conclusions:Subsequent HCC in cancer survivors has several different clinical characteristics compared with primary HCC. A history of prior cancer did not significantly contribute to a worse prognosis for subsequent HCC.
