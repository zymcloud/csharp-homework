4-(4-Aminophenyl)-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.5]decan-3-one 1 was prepared and allowed to react with nitrogen nucleophiles to give the corresponding hydrazones 2-4. Further, compound 1 underwent diazotization and afforded the parallel hydrazono derivative 5; moreover, compound 1 refluxed with active methylene derivatives yielded the corresponding aminospirothiazolo pyridine-carbonitrile derivative 6 and spirothiazolopyridinone-carbonitrile derivative 7. Condensation of spirothiazolidine 1 with 4-chlorobenzaldehyde gave the corresponding spiro arylidiene derivative 8, which was utilized as a component of Micheal addition to react with excess of nitrogen nucleophiles to yield novel ring frameworks 4-(3'-(4-chlorophenyl)-spiro [cyclohexane-1,5'-pyrazolo[3,4-d]thiazol]-6'(1'H)-yl)aniline (9) and 4-(3'-(4-chlorophenyl)-6'H- spiro[cyclohexane-1,5'-thiazolo[5,4-d]isoxazol]-6'-yl)aniline (10). Finally, when spirothiazolo pyridinone-carbonitrile derivative 7 sodium salt generated in situ was reacted with different alkyl halides, it produced the corresponding N-derivatives 12-16. Three compounds, 6, 14, and 16, showed high significantly anticancer activities compared with DoxorubicinÂ® (positive control) against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and human liver carcinoma (HepG-2) cell lines. On the other hand, compounds 6 and 9 showed higher therapeutic indices for both of alpha-amylase inhibitor and alpha-glucosidase inhibitor than the other tested compounds compared with the antidiabetic Acarbose (positive control).
