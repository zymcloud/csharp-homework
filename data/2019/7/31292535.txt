Background:Molecular profiling is increasingly used to match patients with metastatic cancer to targeted therapies, but obtaining a high-quality biopsy specimen from metastatic sites can be difficult.Methods:Patient samples were received by Perthera to coordinate genomic, proteomic and/or phosphoproteomic testing, using a specimen from either the primary tumour or a metastatic site. The relative frequencies were compared across specimen sites to assess the potential limitations of using a primary tumour sample for clinical decision support.Results:No significant differences were identified at the gene or pathway level when comparing genomic alterations between primary and metastatic lesions. Site-specific trends towards enrichment of MYC amplification in liver lesions, STK11 mutations in lung lesions and ATM and ARID2 mutations in abdominal lesions were seen, but were not statistically significant after false-discovery rate correction. Comparative analyses of proteomic results revealed significantly elevated expression of ERCC1 and TOP1 in metastatic lesions.Conclusions:Tumour tissue limitations remain a barrier to precision oncology efforts, and these real-world data suggest that performing molecular testing on a primary tumour specimen could be considered in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who do not have adequate tissue readily available from a metastatic site.
