Aim:Sarcopenia has a negative impact on the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the significance of skeletal muscle volume and its changes in HCC patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 179 HCC patients receiving TACE from 2006 to 2017. Skeletal mass index was calculated as the left-right sum of the major Ã— minor axis of the psoas muscle at the third lumbar vertebra, divided by height squared (psoas muscle index [PMI]). Patients were classified into two groups (low and normal PMI) depending on an index 2 /m2 for men and women, respectively. We assessed overall survival (OS) and TACE period (between the first TACE [Pre] and the time of TACE refractoriness [Post]). Changes in PMI per month during the TACE period (CPMI; (PMI [Pre] - PMI [Post]) / TACE period) were calculated as an index of progressive muscle atrophy.Results:There were no significant differences in OS between groups with low and normal PMI at Pre. Multivariate analysis showed that CPMI was significantly associated with poor OS (hazard ratio, 1.884; P = 0.001). Patients with severe muscle atrophy (CPMI above the upper quartile) had a significantly lower OS than those with mild muscle atrophy (CPMI below the upper quartile). Compared with patients with mild muscle atrophy, patients with severe muscle atrophy had a significant loss of liver function reserves at Post.Conclusion:Progressive loss of skeletal muscle volume is an important predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients treated with TACE.
