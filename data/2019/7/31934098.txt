The prognostic role of homeobox B7 (HOXB7) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not clearly established. The present study aimed to evaluate the associations among the clinicopathological characteristics, HOXB7 expression, and the overall survival (OS) of patients with HCC. An immunohistochemical analysis was used to detect the expression level of HOXB7. In addition, the association between the expression of HOXB7 and the clinicopathological characteristics of HCC was analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the survival rates, and the COX proportional hazards model was used to investigate univariate and multivariate analyses. A total of 80 patients were enrolled in this study. Of the 80 HCC samples, HOXB7 was up-regulated in 28 samples (35.0%). The high HOXB7 expression was significantly associated with OS by univariate Cox regression analysis (HR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.1-3.4, P = 0.016). The median survival with high HOXB7 expression and low HOXB7 expression was 12.5 months ± 3.7 months versus 32.5 months ± 4.7 months, respectively, as visualized on Kaplan-Meier curves (P = 0.014). After adjusting for possible factors related to survival time after HCC resection, the results suggested that survival time was negatively correlated with high HOXB7 expression (HR = 2.592, 95% CI = 1.283-5.239, P = 0.008). The present data indicate that the HOXB7 expression was negatively associated with survival time after HCC resection. As HOXB7 was a common and readily available measurement in the clinical setting, it was a convenient and feasible way to identify those patients who were at high risk and who had a poor prognosis.
