COMPARZ study revealed no marked differences in terms of the progression free survival and overall survival between sunitinib and pazopanib treatment. Regarding the quality of life and early tumor shrinkage, pazopanib showed more favorable results than sunitinib treatment. A 70-year-old man underwent right nephrectomy in 2015. In 2017, iliac bone metastasis was found and consequently lung metastasis was developed. Pazopanib (200 mg Ã— 4 tablets) was introduced. He showed no abnormal liver function markers during pazopanib treatment for more than two years and the size and number of lung metastases decreased. We herein report a case of successful control of metastatic renal cell carcinoma for more than two years using pazopanib treatment.
