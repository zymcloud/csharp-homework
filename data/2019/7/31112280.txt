The differential impact of preemptive therapy (PET) and antiviral prophylaxis (AP) on development of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) and T-cell responses have not previously been directly compared in high-risk donor-seropositive/recipient-seronegative (D+R-) organ transplant recipients. We prospectively assessed T-cell and nAb responses 3 months after transplantation in cohorts of high-risk D+R- liver transplant recipients who received either PET (n = 15) or AP (n = 25) and a control group of CMV-seropositive transplant recipients (R+) (AP; n = 24). CMV phosphoprotein 65 (pp65)- and immediate early protein 1-specific multifunctional T-cell responses were determined by means of intracellular cytokine staining and nAbs against BADrUL131-Y4 CMV in adult retinal pigment epithelial cell line-19 human epithelial cells; nAbs were detected in 8 of 12 (67%) in the PET group, none of 17 in the AP group, and 20 of 22 (91%) in the R+ group. Multifunctional CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses to pp65 were generally similar between PET and R+ groups, and lower for the AP group; multifunctional CD4 responses were similar across all groups. Among D+R- liver transplant recipients, PET was associated with the development of greater nAb and multifunctional CD8 T-cell responses compared with AP, providing a potential mechanism to explain the relative protection against late-onset disease with PET. Future studies are needed to define specific immune parameters predictive of late-onset CMV disease with AP.
