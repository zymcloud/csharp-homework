Although endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) seems to cause fewer instances of bleeding, there are insufficient data to determine the optimal methods for decreasing the risk of bleeding in cirrhotic patients.In this study, we compared the bleeding risks following endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy (EST) vs EPBD in cirrhotic patients and identified clinical factors associated with bleeding and 30-day mortality.Taiwan's National Health Insurance Database was used to identify 3201 cirrhotic patients who underwent EST or EPBD between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013.We enrolled 2620 patients receiving EST and 581 patients receiving EPBD. The mean age was 63.1 Â± 13.9 years, and 70.4% (2252/3201) were men. The incidence of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) bleeding was higher among patients treated with EST than those treated with EPBD (EST vs EPBD: 3.5% vs 1.9%). Independent predisposing factors for bleeding included EST, renal function impairment, and antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. The overall 30-day mortality was 4.0% (127/3201). Older age, renal function impairment, hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding esophageal varices, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma, biliary malignancy, and pancreatic malignancy were associated with higher risks for 30-day mortality.To decrease post-ERCP hemorrhage, EPBD is the preferred method in patients with cirrhosis, especially for those who have renal function impairment or are receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.
