Hepatic angiomyolipoma is a rare primary liver tumor, with a radiographic appearance very similar to hepatocellular carcinoma. We present the case of a noncirrhotic patient with a liver tumor suspicious for HCC by imaging features. Liver biopsy demonstrated angiomyolipoma, and the patient successfully underwent a laparoscopic liver resection.
