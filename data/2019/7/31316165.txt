No distinct guidelines are available regarding the effect of pretransplant locoregional treatment (LRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) staging system. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognosis of pathologic downstaging (PDS) by the exclusion of total necrosis after liver transplantation. We conducted a study of 326 HCC patients who underwent liver transplantation between September 2005 and December 2016. Two hundred twenty-two patients received pretransplant LRT and 102 patients did not. Among the former group, 74 (33.0%) achieved PDS while 150 (67.0%) showed unchanged T stage after the exclusion of total necrosis. Five-year HCC recurrent free survival (RFS) of PDS group (85.1%) was similar to that of the no LRT group (88.8%) but higher than that of the non-PDS group (68.9%; P
