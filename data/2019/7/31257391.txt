Identifying tolerance responses to ingested foodstuff over life is essential for understanding dysfunction in metabolic diseases. This study presents a comparative structural and functional analysis of serine-type protease inhibitors (STPIs) from Chenopodium quinoa, Salvia hispanica L., Avena sativa and Triticum durum. It also evaluates their influence on an in vivo hepatocarcinoma (HCC) model. STPIs are found in all samples with significant differences in protease inhibitory capacity: C. quinoa = S. hispanica
