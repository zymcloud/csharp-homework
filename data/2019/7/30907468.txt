Aim:To retrospectively evaluate the outcomes of conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≥10 cm.Methods:Twenty-five patients with naïve HCC ≥10 cm (mean maximum tumor diameter, 130 ± 27.6 mm; single [n = 12], 2-9 [n = 6], and ≥10 [n = 7]) without extrahepatic spread treated with cTACE were eligible. Five (20%) had vascular invasion. Two to three stepwise cTACE sessions using iodized oil ≤10 mL in one cTACE session were scheduled. When the tumor recurred, additional cTACE was repeated on demand, if possible. Overall survival (OS) rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The prognostic factors were evaluated using uni- and multivariate analyses.Results:Stepwise cTACE sessions were completed for 20 (80%) patients, but could not be completed for four (16%). In the remaining (4%) patient, the whole tumor was embolized in one session. Additional treatment, mainly cTACE, was undertaken for 19 (76%) patients. The OS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 68, 34.7, and 23.1%, respectively. A tumor number of three was a significant prognostic factor (P = 0.020) and the 1-, 3-, and 4-year OS rates in patients with ≤3 and ≥4 tumors were 81.3 and 33.3, 55.6 and 11.1, and 38.9% and 0%, respectively. Whole tumor embolization and the serum level of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II were also significant prognostic factors (P Conclusion:Conventional TACE is safe and effective for huge HCCs, but has limited effects in cases with four or more tumors.
