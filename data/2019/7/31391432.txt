This is a cross sectional study to establish that Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) could be accepted as the most effective imaging modality for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the bile duct. It is much less common than hepatocellular carcinoma, accounting for 5-30% of all hepatic malignancies. Clinically suspected patients with obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma were referred to the Department of Radiology and Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study was carried out in 60 patients, of which 38(63%) were male and 22(37%) were female. Out of 60 cases 56 cases were truly diagnosed by MRCP, 4 were normal, among these 1 case was diagnosed as cholangiocarcinoma as compared with histopathology. Forty four (44) patients (73.2%) of the patients were in sixth decade of life. The overall sensitivity and specificity were found to be 98.2% and 75%. The diagnostic accuracy was 96.7% & positive predictive value was about 98%.
