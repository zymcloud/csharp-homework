Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes B (HBV/B) and C (HBV/C) are the most prevalent genotypes among Japanese patients with hepatitis. Reportedly, HBV/C infection has been associated with more severe disease progression, manifesting as developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), than HBV/B infection. However, no long-term studies have examined the development of HCC in HBV/B-infected patients in Japan. The aims of our study were to compare the incidence of HCC in HBV/B- or HBV/C-infected patients. A total of 241 patients were followed up among 295 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive carriers. Genotypes of HBV were A in 1% (4/295), B in 61% (179/295), C in 37% (110/295) and D in 1% (2/295) patients, and 96% of HBV/B were infected with subgenotype Bj. The mean age at HCC diagnosis was significantly higher in HBV/B than in HBV/C (67.0 ± 10.0 vs 57.7 ± 8.0 years, P
