Aims:Calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) is a very rare begin fibroblastic tumor featuring a widely anatomical distribution and may mimic various spindle cell tumors. Misdiagnosis and hence mistreatment are likely caused due to unfamiliarity to clinicians or junior pathologists. We collected a relatively large series of CFTs in our institution aiming at further summarizing their clinicopathologic features in Chinese patients and discussing the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in clinical practice.Methods:Clinicopathologic data of 22 CFTs were retrospectively reviewed. Histologic features were reevaluated and summarized. Immunostaining markers include CD34, SMA, Desmin, keratin, S100, ALK1, CD117, IgG, IgG4, and Ki-67. Follow-up of all cases was performed.Results:22 CFTs include gastric (n=8), pulmonary (n=2), hepatic (n=2), cervical (n=1), appendiceal (n=1), esophageal (n=1), retroperitoneal (n=1), intra-abdominal (n=1), diaphragmatic (n=1), spermatic cord and scrotum (n=1), anconeal (n=1), mesenteric (n=1), and omental (n=1) lesions. Coexisting hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, Castleman disease, and leiomyoma of the uterus and other metabolic or functional disorders were also appreciated. CFT histologically features spindle cells embedded dense hyalinized stroma with scattered psammomatous calcifications and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and immunohistochemically for CD34. None of any individuals die of CFT per se.Conclusion:Our study discloses that CFT is a bona fide benign fibroblastic lesion, regardless of its developing location. Involvement of digestive tract seems much more common in the Chinese population. Awareness of the clinicopathologic characteristics of this rare entity and its mimickers contribute to avoiding misdiagnosis and mistreatment in clinical practice.
