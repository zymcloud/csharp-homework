A new series of pyrazole derivatives was prepared in this work, including pyrazolopyrimidines, pyrazolotriazines, pyrazolylthienopyridines, and 2-(pyrazolylamino)thiazol-4-ones, utilizing 3-amino-5-methyl-1H-pyrazole as a synthetic precursor. Their in vitro anticancer activity was tested on hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2. The results revealed that the pyrazolylhydrazonoyl cyanide 8, the pyrazolopyrimidine 3, and the pyrazolylaminothiazolone 17 were the most active with IC50 values of 2, 7, and 7 µM respectively in comparison with 5.5 µM for cisplatin as a reference drug. Interestingly, all the synthesized compounds showed higher selectivity index than cisplatin. DNA binding assay was also carried out for the synthesized compounds to rationalize their mechanism of action. Molecular modeling studies, including docking into DNA minor groove, flexible alignment, and surface mapping, were conducted. Results obtained proved the superior DNA-binding affinity of the most active anticancer compounds.
