Background In 2017, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) included an algorithm for the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with local-regional therapy. The aim of the algorithm was to enable standardized evaluation of treatment response to guide subsequent therapy. However, the performance of the algorithm has not yet been validated in the literature. Purpose To evaluate the performance of the LI-RADS 2017 Treatment Response algorithm for assessing the histopathologic viability of HCC treated with bland arterial embolization. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent bland arterial embolization for HCC between 2006 and 2016 and subsequent liver transplantation. Three radiologists independently assessed all treated lesions by using the CT/MRI LI-RADS 2017 Treatment Response algorithm. Radiology and posttransplant histopathology reports were then compared. Lesions were categorized on the basis of explant pathologic findings as either completely (100%) or incompletely (Online supplemental material is available for this article.
