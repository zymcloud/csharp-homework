Context: Chronic liver damage has serious medical consequences. Objective: To investigate the hepatoprotective effect of dry Zingiber officinale (ginger) and its essential (volatile) oil against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) toxicity in rats. Materials and methods: Phenols and flavonoids components were characterized in dry ginger using HPLC-UV instrument while ginger essential oil (E.O.) was investigated via GC-MS technique. Antioxidant activity was determined in vitro. In rat model, ginger was administrated for 2 months. Lipid profile, antioxidant biomarkers, liver functions and histopathology were assessed. Results: Chlorogenic acid (63.85 ppm) and hesperidin (156.91 ppm) are among the major phenolic and flavonoid constituents in dry ginger. Curcumene (15.21%) and linalool (13.47%) represent the main E.O. constituents. In rats treated with ginger E.O., a significant elevation in serum HDL (31.14%) was accompanied by a decrease in LDL (55.14%). A significant decrease in serum ALT and ALP was reported (56.85% and 53.84%, respectively). Serum GSH-Px activity has significantly increased 75.06%. Meanwhile, E.O. showed anticancer potential against HepG2 cell line (IC50 = 40 Âµg/mL). Liver histopathological examinations confirmed the protective effect against abnormalities. Conclusion: Ginger was able to reduce the severity of DEN-cytotoxicity in rats, which suggests a novel antioxidant role originating from this medicinal plant.
