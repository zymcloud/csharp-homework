Partial hepatectomy is still the preferred modality of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.In recent years, a substantial number of in vivo and in vitro tests have been carried out to study how to promote postoperative liver regeneration in order to prevent the occurrence of small-for-size liver syndrome and liver failure. However, several studies have shown that the process of liver regeneration after hepatectomy can actually promote the growth of tumor cells and activate occult micro-focal lesions leading to tumor recurrence. Moreover, cytokines and genes which play crucial roles in the 3 stages of liver regeneration, are involved in the formation, migration, infiltration and recurrence of liver cancer to varying degrees. Achieving a balance between promotion of postoperative liver regeneration and inhibition of tumor recurrence has become a major problem in liver surgery.
