Autophagy is a mechanism by which cellular substances are transported to lysosomes for degradation, allowing the basic transformation of cellular components, and providing energy and macromolecular precursors. In cancer, the contradictory role of autophagy in tumor suppression and promotion has been widely acknowledged. Activation and suppression of autophagy have been proposed as cancer therapies, resulting in targeted treatment of cancer by autophagy being considered ambiguous. The dynamic effect of autophagy can also be applied to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a malignant tumor with high incidence and a low survival rate. In this review, we introduce characteristics of different types of autophagy and summarize which genes, non-coding RNAs, and related signaling pathways are involved in autophagy and the regulation of the formation and progress of HCC. More importantly, we discuss the role of autophagy in the treatment of HCC, such as in traditional chemotherapy, molecular targeted drugs, and natural products.
