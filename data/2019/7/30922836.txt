Sphingolipids have been considered for many years only as structural components of membranes. It is now acknowledged that they are also involved in controlling cellular processes such as proliferation.The present work was designed to find the anticancer activity of the crab Dromia dehanni hemolymph in in-vivo and in vitro with special reference to the anticancer compound sphingolipids isolation and characterization. The active fraction of the purified hemolymph was subjected to NMR and ESI-MS/MS analysis. The ESI-MS/MS spectrum exhibited intense signals for sodiated molecular ions [M + Na]+ of sphingomyelins (SM) identified as N-2-O-Acetyl-12 pentadecenoyl sphingosine phosphorylcholine, N-9-eicosenoyl- sphinganine phosphocholine and the corresponding dehydro sphingomyelin, N-9-eicosenoyl- dehydro- sphinganine phosphocholine along with the ions at m/z 147, 184 characteristic of phosphocholine. The present study revealed D. dehaani might be a great source for the novel anti-cancer compounds which can be used for human benefits.
