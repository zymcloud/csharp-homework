To discover novel structural compounds which are producted by endophytic fungi, a primary chemical profiling of Camptotheca acuminata Decne derived endophytic fungus Penicillum polonicum had been taken. Two new compounds Î²-lactone polonicin A (1) and enoic acid polonicin B (2) together with seven known compounds 3-9 were isolated from Penicillum polonicum obtained from C. acuminata. The structures of the new compounds 1 and 2 were identified by modern spectrum technology including detailed 1D, 2D NMR and MS data analyses. When tested against HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, compounds 4-8 showed moderate anti-HCC activity. In addition, compound 1-3 have effects on increasing GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in vitro. Compound 1 showed the strongest glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation activities in rat skeleton (L6) myoblast cell line with enhancements of 1.8 and 2.1 folds respectively compared to the control.
Endophytic fungi; GLUT4 translocation; Penicillium polonicum; anti-HCC activity; glucose uptake.
