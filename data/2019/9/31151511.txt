In recent years, the utilization of polysaccharides as targeted drug carriers has attracted considerable attention. Herein, Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), a plant polysaccharide with good biocompatibility, excellent aqueous solubility and intrinsic liver-targeted capability, was modified with hydrophobic group (deoxycholic acid) to fabricate amphiphilic conjugate (ASP-DOCA). Self-assembled nanoparticles were successfully developed for hepatoma-targeted delivery of therapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX). The DOX loaded nanoparticles (DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs) were spherical in shape with a particle size of 228 nm and negatively charged around -17 mV. DOX was released from nanoparticles in a sustainable and pH-dependent manner. In vitro cellular uptake revealed that DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs were internalized into HepG2 cells through asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-mediated endocytosis, resulting in a higher anti-proliferation effect than DOX-loaded dextran derivative DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. Additionally, DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs showed higher inhibition on the growth of HepG2 multicellular spheroids (MCs) than DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. In vivo imaging demonstrated that ASP-DOCA NPs specifically targeted HepG2 tumors via ASGPR, improving the accumulation of DOX/ASP-DOCA NPs in tumors and generating superior antitumor activity compared with free DOX and DOX/DEX-DOCA NPs. Taken together, ASP-DOCA NPs possess potential applications in drug delivery systems targeting liver cancer.
