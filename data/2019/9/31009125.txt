The present study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of pantoprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor, on precancerous lesion (PCL) in rats. diethylnitrosamine and 2-acetylaminofluorene were used to induce PCL in rats, in vivo. The rats were treated with three doses of pantoprazole (100, 50, and 25 mg/kg; three times weekly) during the last 4 weeks of the total 10 weeks of the experiment. Blood and liver tissue samples were collected for measurement of the exosomal abundance and exosomal competing endogenous RNA markers. Results revealed that pantoprazole administration had an ameliorating effect on liver function tests and microscopic features of the liver; and decreased exosome abundance in the liver tissue samples and sera of the rats. Meanwhile, the treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in exosomal RAB11A mRNA and long noncoding RNA RP11-513I15.6, which is an important participant in th exosomal secretion process with an increase in exosomal miRNA-1262. Based on these results, we postulated that pantoprazole has the potential to attenuate liver tumorigenesis in this rat model.
