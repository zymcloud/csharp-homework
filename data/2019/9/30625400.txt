Background & aims:Statin use is associated with a lower risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it is unclear whether postdiagnosis statin use is associated with a reduced risk of death in patients with HCC.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 15,422 patients with HCC in the Veterans Administration Central Cancer Registry, diagnosed from 2002 through 2016. We identified statin prescriptions that were filled before and after the cancer diagnosis and used time-dependent Cox regression models to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for risk of death. We used a time-varying exposure to avoid immortal time bias, and a 3-month lag (following up patients from 3 months after the cancer diagnosis) to reduce reverse causation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted varying the lag duration between date of cancer diagnosis and start of follow-up evaluation.Results:Statin use after diagnosis was recorded for 14.9% of patients with HCC. We found that postdiagnosis statin use was associated with a decreased risk of cancer-specific death (adjusted HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.93) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95). The magnitudes of these inverse associations were consistent for patients who used high or low doses of statins, and the inverse associations remained across a range of lag periods (from 0 months to 12 months after HCC diagnosis). We found no evidence for effect modification by prediagnosis statin use, or by presentation- or treatment-related factors, and no independent association with prediagnosis statin use.Conclusions:In a retrospective analysis of data from veterans with HCC, use of statins (high or low doses) after a diagnosis of HCC was associated with reduced mortality.
