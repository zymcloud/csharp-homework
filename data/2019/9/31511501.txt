Lipid metabolism that correlates tightly to the glucose metabolic regulation in malignant cells includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The transcription factor Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1 (SREBP-1), a regulator of fatty acid synthesis, has been shown to pivotally regulate the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells. However, the intrinsic mechanism by which SREBP-1 regulates the survival of HCC cells remains unclear. In this study, among HCC patients who had dismal responses to Sorafenib, a high SREBP-1 level was found in the tumors and correlated to poor survival. This observation suggested the negative role of SREBP-1 in clinical HCC prognosis. Our mechanistical studies reveal that the inhibition of SREBP-1 via its inhibitor Betulin suppresses cellular glucose metabolism. In addition to the reduced glycolytic activity, a thwarted metastatic potential was observed in HCC cells upon Betulin administration. Moreover, our data show that SREBP-1 inhibition facilitated the antitumor effects of Sorafenib on HCC cells and xenograft tumors.
