Background:This study assessed the clinical value of regional ischemic preconditioning (RIP) and the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in the protective mechanism of RIP in cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing hepatectomy.Methods:Liver resection was performed with hemi-hepatic vascular inflow occlusion (HHV) under RIP (RIP group) or with HHV alone (HHV group). Clinical data, surgical outcomes, and the levels of phosphorylated MAPKs before occlusion and 30 min after reperfusion were estimated.Results:HHV under RIP was associated with less intraoperative blood loss (300 vs. 400 ml; P = 0.042), postoperative plasma transfused (400 vs. 800 ml; P = 0.019), and a higher level of prothrombin activity at postoperative days 3, 5, and 7 compared to HHV alone. The level of phosphorylated ERK protein was significantly increased and the levels of phosphorylated p38 and JNK proteins were significantly decreased 30 min after reperfusion compared to HHV group in the RIP group.Conclusions:HHV under RIP may have clinical value in cirrhotic HCC patients requiring resection and the protective mechanism of RIP may be associated with changes in the protein phosphorylation level of MAPK pathways.
