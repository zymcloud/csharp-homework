Purpose:To assess the safety and efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization using a 75-μm drug-eluting embolic (DEE) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:The medical records of 109 patients with a mean age of 64.1 years (range 85-49) treated for unresectable HCC between November 2013 and August 2016 with transarterial chemoembolization using a 75-μm DEE were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had prior therapy for HCC were excluded. Child-Pugh A patients and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stages A/B patients constituted 68.8% and 65.1% of the patients, respectively. The mean size of the index tumors was 5.8 cm (range 18.5-1.2) with 42 (39%) patients with central tumors around the porta-hepatis region. Portal vein invasion was seen in 10 (9.2%) patients. Tumor response was categorized according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, and the toxicity profile was assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.Results:At 1-month follow-up, complete response, objective response, and disease control was seen in 23%, 66%, and 90%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 11.2 months. The median overall survival was 25.1 months (33.4 months for Child-Pugh A and 28.2 months for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stages A/B), and transplant-free survival was 21.3 months. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month survivals were 91.7%, 75.5%, and 50.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicity was seen in 1.8% of the patients; no grade 4 or 5 toxicity was reported.Conclusions:Transarterial chemoembolization using 75-μm DEE is safe and efficacious in the treatment of HCC.
