Purpose:To present a comprehensive review of the literature data, published between 2000 and 2019 on the PubMed and Web of Science databases, in the field of the tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). All the data were combined with the personal experiences of the authors.Design:From 1002 representative papers, we selected 86 representative publications which included data on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), and molecular background of chemoresistance or resistance to radiotherapy.Results:Although the central event concerns activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, other signal pathways, such as c-Met/HGF/Snail, Notch-1/NF-κB, TGF-β/SMAD, and basic fibroblast growth factor-related signaling, play a role in the EMT of HCC cells. This pathway is targeted by specific miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, as explored in this paper. A central player in the tumor microenvironment proved to be the CSCs which can be marked by CD133, CD44, CD90, EpCAM, and CD105. CSCs can induce resistance to cytotoxic therapy or, alternatively, can be synthesized, de novo, after chemo- or radiotherapy, especially after transarterial chemoembolization- or radiofrequency ablation-induced hypoxia. The circulating tumor cells proved to have epithelial, intermediate, or mesenchymal features; their properties have a critical prognostic role.Conclusion:The metastatic pathway of HCC seems to be related to the Wnt- or, rather, TGFβ1-mediated inflammation-angiogenesis-EMT-CSCs crosstalk link. Molecular therapy should target this molecular axis controlling the HCC microenvironment.
