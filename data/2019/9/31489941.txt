Liver damage upon exposure to ionizing radiation, whether accidental or because of therapy can contribute to liver dysfunction. Currently, radiation therapy is used for various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma; however, the treatment dose is limited by poor liver tolerance to radiation. Furthermore, reliable biomarkers to predict liver damage and associated side-effects are unavailable. Here, we investigated fibrinogen-like 1 (FGL1)-expression in the liver and plasma after radiation exposure. We found that 30 Gy of liver irradiation (IR) induced cell death including apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, with fibrotic changes in the liver occurring during the acute and subacute phase in mice. Moreover, FGL1 expression pattern in the liver following IR was associated with liver damage represented by injury-related proteins and oxidative stress markers. We confirmed the association between FGL1 expression and hepatocellular injury by exposing human hepatocytes to radiation. To determine its suitability, as a potential biomarker for radiation-induced liver injury, we measured FGL1 in the liver tissue and the plasma of mice following total body irradiation (TBI) or liver IR. In TBI, FGL1 showed the highest elevation in the liver compared to other major internal organs including the heart, lung, kidney, and intestine. Notably, plasma FGL1 showed good correlation with radiation dose by liver IR. Our data revealed that FGL1 upregulation indicates hepatocellular injury in response to IR. These results suggest that plasma FGL1 may represent a potential biomarker for acute and subacute radiation exposure to the liver.
