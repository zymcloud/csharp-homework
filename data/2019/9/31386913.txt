Background:Tumor histology affects outcome after liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study explores the association between F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and tumor histology in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) recipients and their outcome.Materials and methods:Two hundred fifty-eight patients with primary liver tumors who underwent FDG-PET before LDLT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Unfavorable tumor histology was defined as primary liver tumor other than a well- or moderately differentiated HCC. Thirteen patients had unfavorable tumor histology, including 2 poorly differentiated HCC, 2 sarcomatoid HCC, 5 combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma, 3 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 hilar cholangiocarcinoma.Results:FDG-PET positivity was significantly associated with unfavorable tumor histology (P Conclusions:The expression of FDG-PET is highly associated with histology of explanted HCC and predicts the recurrence. FDG-PET-positive tumors with high FDG uptake may be considered contraindication for LDLT due to high recurrence rate except when pathology proves favorable histology.
