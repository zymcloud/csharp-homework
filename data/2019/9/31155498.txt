Purpose:To identify risk factors for hypertensive crisis (HC) during ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation of adrenal neoplasms.Materials and methods:Patients who underwent MW ablation for adrenal tumors between April 2006 and November 2017 were retrospectively identified for this study (51 consecutive patients; 35 males, 16 females; mean age, 55 years; range, 15-85 years). A total of 77 MW ablation treatments were performed for 67 tumors (24 primary [9 pheochromocytomas, 8 adenomas, and 7 cortical carcinomas]; and 43 metastases [22 hepatocellular carcinoma, 8 renal cell carcinoma, 5 non-small cell lung cancer, 4 colorectal cancer, 3 liposarcoma, and 1 malignant fibrous histiocytoma]). The mean diameter of the adrenal tumors was 4.6 cm (range, 1.2-16.2 cm). Information about patient demographics, imaging studies, pathology and laboratory results, procedure records, and clinical outcomes was retrieved and analyzed. Statistical analysis was then performed to determine potential risk factors for HC.Results:Of the 77 MW ablation procedures, HC occurred in 13 (16.9%). A significantly higher risk of HC was observed in patients with pheochromocytoma (odds ratio [OR], 9.037; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.731-47.172; P = .009), body mass index 2 (OR, 5.167; 95% CI, 1.060-25.194; P = .042), dominant tumor size ≤4.5 cm (OR, 4.023; 95% CI, 1.011-16.005; P = .048), and pre-procedural systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg (OR, 0.242; 95% CI, 0.068-0.861; P = .029).Conclusion:HC can occur during MW ablation in patients with either primary or metastatic adrenal tumors. Pheochromocytoma, body mass index, tumor size, and pre-procedural systolic blood pressure appear to be significant risk factors for the occurrence of HC.
