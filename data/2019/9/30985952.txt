This clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of the investigational anticancer agent, alisertib, in adult patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. Patients with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and alanine transaminase [ALT] ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN]), moderate hepatic impairment (1.5 × ULN < total bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN, with any ALT) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 × ULN, with any ALT), received a single 50-mg oral dose of alisertib. Blood samples for PK were collected up to 168 hours postdose. Predose samples were also used to assess alisertib plasma protein binding. Patients could continue to receive alisertib for 7 days in 21-day cycles (50, 30, or 10 mg twice daily for normal hepatic function, moderate hepatic impairment, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively). Alisertib was approximately 99% protein bound in all hepatic function groups. Alisertib exposure was similar in moderate and severe hepatic impairment groups, but higher than the normal hepatic function group. The geometric least-squares mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for unbound alisertib area under the curve extrapolated to infinity for moderate/severe impairment groups versus the normal hepatic function group was 254% (184%, 353%). Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment have approximately 150% higher unbound alisertib exposures compared with patients with normal hepatic function. An approximately 60% reduction of the starting dose of alisertib in patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment is recommended based on pharmacokinetic considerations.
