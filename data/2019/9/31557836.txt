Coumarins are widely present in a variety of plants and have a variety of pharmacological activities. In this study, we isolated a coumarin compound from Microsorium fortunei (Moore) Ching; the compound was identified as esculetin by hydrogen and carbon spectroscopy. Its anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In the human hepatocellular liver carcinoma 2.2.15 cell line (HepG2.2.15) transfected with HBV, esculetin effecting inhibited the expression of the HBV antigens and HBV DNA in vitro. Esculetin inhibited the expression of Hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein in a dose-dependent manner. In the ducklings infected with duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), the levels of DHBV DNA, duck hepatitis B surface antigen (DHBsAg), duck hepatitis B e-antigen (DHBeAg), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) decreased significantly after esculetin treatment. Summing up the above, the results suggest that esculetin efficiently inhibits HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo, which provides an opportunity for further development of esculetin as antiviral drug.
