Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second-most lethal cancer worldwide with a complex pathogenesis. RuvB-like 2 (RUVBL2) was previously found to contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. However, its expression, regulation and clinical significance have not been systematically evaluated in a large number of clinical samples.Methods:Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of RUVBL2 based on multiple datasets from 371 liver cancer patients of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and on immunohistochemical staining in 153 subjects. In addition, the aberrant signaling pathways caused by RUVBL2 overexpression were investigated.Results:We demonstrated that promoter hypomethylation, copy number gain, MYC amplification and CTNNB1 mutation were all responsible for RUVBL2 overexpression in HCC. High levels of RUVBL2 mRNA were associated with shorter recurrence-free survival time (RFS) but not overall survival time (OS). Furthermore, RUVBL2 protein was overexpressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of HCC samples. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses showed that strong nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of RUVBL2 independently predicted worse OS and RFS with a 2.03-fold and a 1.71-fold increase in the hazard ratio, respectively. High levels of RUVBL2 promoted carcinogenesis through the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90)-Cell Division Cycle 37 (CDC37), AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathways.Conclusion:The deregulation of RUVBL2 in HCC is influenced at the genomic, epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Our findings highlight the potential roles of RUVBL2 as a promising prognostic marker as well as a therapeutic target for HCC.
