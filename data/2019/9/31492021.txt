Two new cytochalasans, Chaetomadrasins A (1) and B (2), along with six known analogues (3-8), were isolated from the solid-state fermented culture of desert soil-derived Chaetomium madrasense 375. Their structures were clarified by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, and the absolute configurations of Compounds 1 and 2 were confirmed by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and calculated ECD. For the first time, Chaetomadrasins A (1), which belongs to the chaetoglobosin family, is characterized by the presence of all oxygen atoms in the form of Carbonyl. Chaetomadrasin B (2) represents the first example of chaetoglobosin type cytochalasan characterized by a hydroxy unit and carbonyl group fused to the indole ring. Compounds 1 and 2 displayed moderate cytotoxicity against HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
