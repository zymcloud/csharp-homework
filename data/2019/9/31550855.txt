Objective: To explore the effects of lncRNA HULC on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth by down-regulating miR-29. Methods: The expression levels of HULC and miR-29 in HCC tissues and cells were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and the correlation analysis was performed. After HCC cells were transfected with HULC overexpressed plasmid or siRNA, the expressions of miR-29 and its target gene SETDB1 were determinate by RT-qPCR. According to the bioinformatic prediction of the miR-29 binding site in the HULC sequence, the report gene plasmids were constructed. The HCC cells were co-transfected with miR-29 mimics or miR-29 inhibitor, and the HULC targeted regulation of miR-29 was verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. The effect of miR-29 on the HULC-mediated proliferation in HCC cells was detected by cell count kit 8 (CCK-8) experiment. Expression of tumor proliferation antigen Ki-67 was detected by RT-qPCR.The Hep3B cells were inoculated in mice and miR-29 mimics and miR-29 negative control (NC) further injected into the lesions. The tumor volume was observed, and the expressions of tumor proliferation antigen ki-67 in tumor tissues were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Results: The expression of HULC was significantly up-regulated while the expression of miR-29 was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues and cells (P<0.01). The level of HULC was negatively correlated with miR-29 in tumor tissues (r=-0.754, P<0.01) and HCC cells (r=-0.865, P<0.05). The in vitro experiments showed that, compared with the blank control group, the expression of miR-29 in HULC overexpressed Huh7 cells was significantly reduced, while the mRNA level of miR-29 target gene SETDB1 was increased (P<0.01). The expression of miR-29 was significantly increased in HULC deleted Hep3B cells, while the mRNA expression of SETDB1 was decreased (P<0.01). Double luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-29 mimics significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of Hep3B cells transfected with HULC wide type (psi-HULC-WT) plasmid but had no effect on Hep3B cells transfected with mutant plasmid (psi-HULC-Mut). However, the miR-29 inhibitor antagonized the inhibitory effect of miR-29 mimics on luciferase activity of psi-HULC-WT (P<0.01). Cell proliferation experiments showed that, compared with the control group, the proliferation ability of miR-29 mimics overexpressed Huh7 cells was significantly reduced.After 24, 48 and 72 hours of treatment, the proliferation rates of Huh7 cells in the HULC overexpressed group were (43.87±3.82)%, (83.45±7.46)% and (123.34±8.67)%, respectively, significantly higher than (13.45±1.77)%, (23.54±1.37)% and (38.21±2.09)% of control group (P<0.05). After treatment for 48 and 72 hours, the proliferation rates of miR-29 mimics transfected Huh7 cells were (57.10±1.94)% and (73.76±3.46)%, respectively, significantly lower than (83.45±7.46)% and (123.34±8.67)% of control group (P<0.05). After treatment for 48 and 72 hours, the proliferation rates of Huh7 cells transfected with miR-29 mimics and miR-29 inhibitor group were (76.45±3.24)% and (89.37±4.37)%, respectively, significant higher than (57.10%±1.94)% and (73.76±3.46)% of the control group (P<0.05). After 48 h transfection, the expression of Ki-67 in Huh7 transfected with miR-29 mimics was significantly inhibited compared with the control group (P<0.01). However, the expression of Ki-67 mRNA was increased in Huh7 cells transfected with miR-29 inhibitor (P<0.01). The results of in vivo experiments showed that the tumor volumes of the control group, miR-29 mimics group and miR-29 mimics + miR-29 inhibitors group were (504.0±19.6) mm(3), (310.0±24.3) mm(3) and (483.7±21.2) mm(3), respectively. Injection of miR-29 mimics reduced while miR-29 inhibitor promoted tumorigenesis ability of Huh7 in nude mice (P<0.01). The immunohistochemical staining showed that the average optical density values of Ki-67 protein in tumor tissues of the control group, miR-29 mimics group and miR-29 analogue+ miR-29 inhibitor group were 0.65±0.08, 0.36±0.07 and 0.56±0.06, respectively. The expression level of Ki-67 protein in miR-29 mimics group was significantly reduced (P<0.01) while increased in the miR-29 mimics+ miR-29 inhibitor group (P<0.01). Conclusion: LncRNA HULC promotes HCC growth by down-regulating miR-29.
