Background:Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are at increased risk of liver-related mortality. The effect of occult cirrhosis (OcC), defined as preclinical compensated cirrhosis without any clinical findings, on liver-related events is unknown.Methods:HIV-infected patients from 2 Canadian cohorts underwent transient elastography (TE) examination and were classified as (1) OcC (TE ≥13 kPa with no sign of cirrhosis, including absence of thrombocytopenia and signs of advanced liver disease on ultrasound or gastroscopy); (2) overt cirrhosis (OvC) (TE ≥13 kPa with signs of cirrhosis); or (3) noncirrhotic patients (TE Results:A total of 1092 HIV-infected patients (51% coinfected with hepatitis C virus) were included. Prevalence of OcC and OvC at baseline was 2.7% and 10.7%, respectively. During a median follow-up of 1.8 (interquartile range, 1.5-2.8) years, the incidence of liver-related events in noncirrhosis, OcC, and OvC was 3.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-7.3), 34.0 (95% CI, 6.0-104.0), and 37.0 (95% CI, 17.0-69.1) per 1000 person-years, respectively. Baseline OcC (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 7.1 [95% CI, 1.3-38.0]) and OvC (aHR, 8.5 [95% CI, 2.8-26.0]) were independently associated with liver-related events. Monitoring rates for HCC were lower in patients with OcC (24%) compared to those with OvC (40%).Conclusions:HIV-infected patients with OcC have a high incidence of liver-related events. Greater surveillance and earlier recognition with appropriate screening strategies are necessary for improved outcomes.
