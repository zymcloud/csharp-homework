Nitidine chloride (NC) has been demonstrated to have an anticancer effect in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism of action of NC against HCC remains largely unclear. In this study, three pairs of NC-treated and NC-untreated HCC xenograft tumour tissues were collected for circRNA sequencing analysis. In total, 297 circRNAs were differently expressed between the two groups, with 188 upregulated and 109 downregulated, among which hsa_circ_0088364 and hsa_circ_0090049 were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The in vitro experiments showed that the two circRNAs inhibited the malignant biological behaviour of HCC, suggesting that they may play important roles in the development of HCC. To elucidate whether the two circRNAs function as "miRNA sponges" in HCC, we identified circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA interactions by using the CircInteractome and miRwalk, respectively. Subsequently, 857 miRNA-associated differently expressed genes in HCC were selected for weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Module Eigengene turquoise with 423 genes was found to be significantly related to the survival time, pathology grade and TNM stage of HCC patients. Gene functional enrichment analysis showed that the 423 genes mainly functioned in DNA replication- and cell cycle-related biological processes and signalling cascades. Eighteen hubgenes (SMARCD1, CBX1, HCFC1, RBM12B, RCC2, NUP205, ECT2, PRIM2, RBM28, COPS7B, PRRC2A, GPR107, ANKRD52, TUBA1B, ATXN7L3, FUS, MCM8 and RACGAP1) associated with clinical outcomes of HCC patients were then identified. These findings showed that the crosstalk between hsa_circ_0088364 and hsa_circ_0090049 and their competing mRNAs may play important roles in HCC, providing interesting clues into the potential of circRNAs as therapeutic targets of NC in HCC.
