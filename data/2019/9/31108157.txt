Background & aims:Although gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows higher sensitivity for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its arterial-phase images may be unsatisfactory because of weak arterial enhancement. We investigated the clinical effectiveness of arterial subtraction images from gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI for diagnosing early-stage HCC using the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2018.Methods:In 258 patients at risk of HCC who underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI in 2016, a total of 372 hepatic nodules (273 HCCs, 18 other malignancies, and 81 benign nodules) of 3.0 cm or smaller were retrospectively analyzed. Final diagnosis was assessed histopathologically or clinically (marginal recurrence after treatment or change in lesion size on follow-up imaging). The detection rate for arterial hyperenhancement was compared between ordinary arterial-phase and arterial subtraction images, and the benefit of arterial subtraction images in diagnosing HCC using LI-RADS was assessed.Results:Arterial subtraction images had a significantly higher detection rate for arterial hyperenhancement than ordinary arterial-phase images, both for all hepatic nodules (72.3% vs. 62.4%, p Conclusions:Arterial subtraction images of gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI can significantly improve the sensitivity of early-stage HCC diagnosis using LI-RADS, without a significant decrease in specificity.Lay summary:Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is an imaging technique with a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, arterial-phase images may be unsatisfactory because of weak arterial enhancement. We found that using arterial subtraction images led to clinically meaningful improvements in the diagnosis of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.
