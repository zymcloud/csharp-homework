Objective:To analyze of the minimum graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) required for living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) without middle hepatic vein branch (MHVT) reconstruction.Methods:We retrospectively collected the clinical data and outcomes of 303 LDLT patients over 16 years from 2001 to 2017. The minimum GRWR of non-middle hepatic vein reconstruction was analyzed by propensity score (PSM).Results:With PSM analysis, no significant differences were observed in postoperative complications, SFSS, inpatient time, liver function, and coagulation function, but significant differences in 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival between MHVT reconstruction and non-reconstruction group. The patients with MHVT reconstruction had better short-term and long-term survival than those without reconstruction.Conclusion:For LDLT patients without HMVT reconstruction, GRWR should be greater than 0.86%; for patients with HMVT reconstruction, GRWR is acceptable between 0.5% and 0.6%.
