Due to the aggressive nature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), most patients succumb to disease before any distant metastasis, such as to the central nervous system (CNS), can occur. Thus only a handful of cases of metastasis to the skull base have been described. After a thorough review of the available literature published since 1950, we report the sixth case of HCC metastasis to the clivus. In this case, a 65-year-old man with a history of melanoma presented with sudden onset of right-sided headache and complete ophthalmoplegia of the right eye for one month. MRI of the brain with and without contrast demonstrated a homogeneously enhancing lesion involving the clivus with evidence of invasion into the right cavernous sinus. Through further body imaging, he was found to have an infiltrative lesion in the left hepatic lobe and underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy of said lesion that was proven to be well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. An endonasal endoscopic biopsy of his clival lesion was performed and the final pathology was consistent with a metastatic HCC. This case demonstrates the impact of obtaining a surgical specimen of clival tumors to confirm the suspected diagnosis, as well as to perform molecular studies that can drive post-operative decision-making and prognosis. As in this case, the final diagnosis altered treatment plans from that of melanoma, with systemic chemotherapy and radiosurgery, to stereotactic radiosurgery and intrahepatic radioembolization.
