Clear cell hepatocellular carcinoma (CHCC) is defined as a tumor which contains more than 50% of clear cells. However, CHCC with more than 90% of clear cells are extremely rare. We report a case of a 65-year-old woman who was found to have a solitary mass, which was histologically diagnosed as clear cell hepatocellular carcinoma composed of 90% or more clear cells. The tumor presented rim arterial phase hyperenhancement in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography during hepatic arteriography, and was classified as LR-M category according to The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2018(LI-RADS v2018). This tumor may mimic other tumors with similar radiographic features, such as intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma and metastatic tumor.
