Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), highly upregulated liver cancer (HULC), metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), lncRNA-AF085935, and lncRNA-uc003wbd have been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in HULC and MALAT1 are associated with HCC susceptibility. However, association between these SNPs and lncRNA-AF085935 and lncRNA-uc003wbd expression and their potential clinical value in differentiating HCC from both hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected Egyptian patients and the healthy specimens have not been explored yet. In the present study, SNPs rs7763881 in HULC and rs619586 in MALAT1 were genotyped in 70 HBV-positive HCC, 70 HBV patients, and 70 healthy controls in Egyptian population and the level of serum lncRNA-AF085935 and lncRNA-uc003wbd of all the subjects was assayed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. HULC rs7763881 AC/CC genotype was significantly associated with decreased HCC risk. Similarly, AG/GG of MALAT1 rs619586 was associated with decreased HCC risk with a borderline significance. Serum lncRNA-AF085935 and lncRNA-uc003wbd levels were upregulated in HBV-positive HCC and HBV patients vs controls and discriminated these groups by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Patients carrying AC/CC genotype of rs7763881 and AG/GG of rs619586 had lower serum lncRNA-AF085935 and lncRNA-uc003wbd levels compared with AA genotype. In conclusion, genetic variants of lncRNA HULC and lncRNA MALAT1 are associated with the decreased susceptibility to HCC in HBV-persistent carriers and are correlated with serum lncRNA-AF085935 and lncRNAuc003wbd levels, two potential noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for HCC.
