Objective: To investigate the effect of long-chain non-coding RNA Fez family zinc finger protein 1 antisense RNA1 (lncRNA FEZF1-AS1) on the biological function of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: SMMC771 and BEL-7402 cells were transfected with sh-FEZF1-AS1 and OE-FEZF1-AS1, respectively. The expression of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. Cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The effects of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 on invasion and migration were detected by Transwell and wound healing assays. The expression levels of adhesion molecules were detected by Western blot. The effect of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 on the in vivo growth was verified by nude mice xenograft experiments. Results: The silencing or ectopic expression of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 inhibited or promoted the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. CCK-8 assay showed that the proliferation abilities of SMMC7721 and BEL-7402 cells in sh-FEZF1-AS1 transfection group significantly decreased, achieving (35.43±4.06)% and (34.68±3.97)%, respectively, on the fifth day. There were significant differences between sh-FEZF1-AS1 group and sh-NC group [52.21±8.46)% and (53.76±7.64)%] (all P<0.05). In contrast, the proliferation ability of SMMC7721 and BEL-7402 cells transfected with OE-FEZF1-AS1 was significantly increased, achieving (83.49±6.92)% and (80.31±3.13)%, respectively, on the fifth day. There were significant differences between OE-FEZF1-AS1 and OE-NC group [53.03±8.84)% and (55.11±7.09)%] (all P<0.05). The subsequent flow cytometry results showed that cell apoptotic rates of SMMC7721 and BEL-7402 cells transfected with sh-FEZF1-AS1 were (13.02±1.38)% and (11.88±1.29)%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in sh-NC groups [(5.57±1.46)% and (8.06±1.42)%, respectively, all P<0.05]. In contrast, the apoptotic rates of SMMC7721 and BEL-7402 cells transfected with OE-FEZF1-AS1 were (3.01±0.39)% and (3.22±0.43)%, which were significantly lower than those in OE-NC groups [(6.68±0.96)% and (6.63±0.45)%, all P<0.05]. In addition, knockdown or overexpression of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 expression inhibited or enhanced the migration and invasion abilities as well as the levels of adhesion molecules in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. After 30 days of feeding under the same conditions, the tumor volumes of sh-FEZF1-AS1 and sh-NC SMMC7721 cells xenograft mice models were (0.26±0.03) cm(3) and (0.63±0.06) cm(3), respectively, showing significant difference (P<0.05). The tumor volumes of sh-FEZF1-AS1 and sh-NC BEL-7402 cells were (0.31±0.02) cm(3) and (0.72±0.08) cm(3), and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 may strengthen the growth, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
