The cross-talk between hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatic carcinoma cells contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. We report here that activated HSCs induce upregulation of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), which is known to regulate multiple metabolic pathways in hepatoma cells of the liver. High levels of NNMT in HCC tissues were positively correlated with vascular invasion, increased serum HBV-DNA levels, and distant metastasis. In addition, functional assays showed that NNMT promoted HCC cell invasion and metastasis by altering the histone H3 methylation on 27 methylation pattern and transcriptionally activating cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44). NNMT-mediated N6-methyladenosine modification of CD44 mRNA resulted in the formation of a CD44v3 splice variant, while its product 1-methyl-nicotinamide stabilized CD44 protein by preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Finally, NNMT was also shown to be a target of statins that inhibited metastasis of hepatoma cells. Taken together, our study shows for the first time that the NNMT/CD44v3 axis regulates HCC metastasis and presents NNMT as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.
