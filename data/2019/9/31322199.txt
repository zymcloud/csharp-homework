The present study examined the relationships between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of three members of the apolipoprotein B mRNA‑editing catalytic polypeptide‑like 3 (A3) gene family, A3A, A3B and A3H, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Han Chinese population. A total of 654 patients were enrolled in the study between January 2012 and July 2016, including 104 patients with chronic HBV infection (CHB), 265 patients with HBV‑related liver cirrhosis and 285 patients with HBV‑related HCC. A total of two A3A SNPs (rs7286317 and rs7290153), three A3B SNPs (rs2267398, rs2267401 and rs2076109), and five A3H SNPs (rs56695217, rs139302, rs139297, rs139316 and rs139292) were genotyped using a MassArray system. Statistical analysis and haplotype estimation were conducted using Haploview and Unphased software. No significant associations were observed between the A3A, A3B and A3H SNPs and the development of CHB and HCC. Haplotype analysis revealed that the mutant haplotypes C‑T‑A, C‑T‑G, T‑G‑G and T‑T‑G from the A3B SNPs rs2267398‑rs2267401‑rs2076109 carried a lower risk of HCC than the reference haplotype. These findings suggested that there was no relationship between A3A, A3B and A3H SNPs and CHB progression or HCC development in the Han Chinese population.
