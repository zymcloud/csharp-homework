Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor is the most common primary hepatic cancer. Bone metastases are rare with an incidence varying from 2% to 20% during autopsy. Spinal cord compression secondary to HCC is exceptional (0.03%-1.52%). It represents a therapeutic emergency. Therefore, it must be systematically searched in case of neurological signs. We report here two new cases of spinal cord compression secondary to HCC with a review of the literature.
Hepatocellular carcinoma; radiotherapy; spinal cord compression.
