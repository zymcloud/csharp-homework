Background and aims:New direct-acting antiviral drugs have become the corner-stone treatment for HCV infection: they show promising results with accepted side-effects and low dropout rates. One of the available regimens is paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir (PTV/OMV/RTV). Our aim was to study the efficacy and safety of this drug regimen among HCV-positive hemodialysis patients.Methods:This prospective single-center study was performed in the Urology and Nephrology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt. Ninety-six maintenance hemodialysis patients were screened for HCV antibodies. Positive results were found in 46 patients (47.9%). HCV PCR was assessed in all HCV-antibody-positive patients; positive results were found positive for 38 (82%); all patients were HCV genotype 4. Four patients were excluded due to advanced liver cirrhosis, liver malignancy, or metastatic breast cancer. Thirty-four patients were prescribed PTV/OMV/RTV for 3 months to treat HCV.Results:Mean age was 43.2 Â± 11.9 years. Most patients were male (67.6%). There was a rapid response to treatment: HCV PCR became negative by 4 weeks after starting treatment. By 12 and 24 weeks post-DAA therapy, there was a sustained viral response (SVR 12, SVR 24) in 100% of patients with improved liver-enzyme levels.Conclusion:The PTV/OMV/RTV regimen was safe and effectively treated Egyptian HCV-positive genotype-4 hemodialysis patients.
