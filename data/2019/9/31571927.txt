Purpose:This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intratumoral IL-12 gene therapy in an HCC-hu-PBL-NOD/SCID mouse model.Materials and methods:The HCC murine model was generated in NOD/SCID mice, and mice with grafted tumors were injected intraperitoneally with 2 × 107 human peripheral blood lymphocytes 14 days after modeling. After 4 days, mice were randomly divided into the 9597/IL-12 group, the 9597/plasmid group and the PBS group. The changes of tumor volume were measured and mouse peripheral blood was sampled post-treatment for ELISA and CBA analyses, and the grafted tumors were collected 28 days post-treatment for immunohistochemistry, ELISA, CBA and detection of cell cycle and apoptosis.Results:The tumor volume was smaller in the 9597/IL-12 group than in the 9597/plasmid and PBS groups on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 post-treatment (P < 0.05). Higher IL-12 levels were detected in the peripheral blood and the supernatants of grafted tumor homogenates in the 9597/IL-12 group than in the 9597/plasmid and PBS groups 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-treatment (P < 0.05). IHC revealed higher counts of CD3+T cells, CD4+T helper cells, IFN-γ Th1 cells+ and S-100 protein positive dentric cells and lower MVD in the 9597/IL-12 group than in the 9597/plasmid and PBS groups (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry showed a significantly higher proportion of HCC cells at the G0/G1 phase and a significantly lower proportion of HCC cells at the S phase in the 9597/IL-12 group than in the PBS group (P < 0.05) and a greater apoptotic rate of HCC cells in the 9597/IL-12 group than in the 9597/plasmid and PBS groups (P < 0.05).Conclusion:Intratumoral IL-12 gene therapy may inhibit tumorigenesis with mild adverse effects in a HCC-hu-PBL-NOD/SCID murine model through inhibiting angiogenesis, arresting cells in G0/G1 phase and inducing apoptosis.
