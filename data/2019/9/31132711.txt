Recent studies have shown that microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is one of the principal factors that cause liver cancer. Previously we have found that Aristaless-like Homeobox 4 (ALX4) was differentially expressed in MC-LR-induced malignant transformed L02 cells. However, the expression regulation, role and molecular mechanism of ALX4 during the process of liver cancer induced by MC-LR are still unclear. The expression of ALX4 was detected by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and Western blot in MC-LR induced malignantly transformed cell and rat models. Methylation status of ALX4 promoter region was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. The anti-tumor effects of ALX4 on MC-LR induced liver cancer were identified in vitro and in vivo. ALX4 expression was progressively down-regulated in MC-LR-induced malignantly transformed L02 cells and the MC-LR exposed rat models. ALX4 promoter regions were highly methylated in malignantly transformed cells, while treatment with demethylation agent 5-aza-dC significantly increased ALX4 expression. Functional studies showed that overexpression of ALX4 inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, blocks the G1/S phase and promotes the apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of ALX4 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Mechanism study found that ALX4 exerts its antitumor function through the P53 pathway, C-MYC and MMP9. More importantly, ALX4 expression level showed a negative relation with serum MC-LR levels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Our results suggested that ALX4 was inactivated by DNA methylation and played a tumor suppressor function through the P53 pathway in MC-LR induced liver cancer.
