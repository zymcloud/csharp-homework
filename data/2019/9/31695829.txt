The primary choice among treatment options for liver malignancies is surgery. However, if surgery cannot be performed, Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) may be effective. 99m-technetium galactosyl human serum albumin (GSA) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is useful for the assessment of liver function before surgery. We report the case of a 77-year-old man who had undergone SBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma of the left lobe of the liver 2 years previously. Follow-up revealed a 15-mm hepatocellular carcinoma at the edge of the right lobe of the liver. 99m-technetium GSA SPECT was performed before SBRT to confirm that there was no accumulation in the left lobe and to ensure that there was good function of the right lobe. Three months after SBRT, the tumor had responded, and decreases in GSA accumulation were observed in line with the radiation beam. Because hepatocellular carcinoma often relapses, it is important to assess the anatomic site of liver dysfunction before and after radiation. This case demonstrates that 99m-technetium GSA SPECT is useful for this purpose.
