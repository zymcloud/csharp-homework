Background:Salivary proteomic analysis has been extensively used in a wide range of cancer, but not in hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to identify potential salivary biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma clinical screening.Methods:In this study, we performed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics analysis to detect differentially expressed proteins between saliva samples from 15 hepatocellular carcinoma patients and 15 healthy controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) verification was undertaken in saliva samples from 14 hepatocellular carcinoma patients and 14 healthy controls.Results:Overall, 133 proteins with significant differential expression level (ratio > 1.5 or Conclusions:iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics revealed that SOD2 might serve as a potential salivary biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma detection. Our results indicated that a noninvasive and inexpensive salivary test might be established for hepatocellular carcinoma detection.
