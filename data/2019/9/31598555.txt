Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the main causes of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. After infection the majority of HBV-infected patients achieve immune control leading to HBV-DNA stabilization at a low level. The risk of HBV reactivation rises significantly when HBV-infected patients receive immunosuppressive treatments. Presented recommendations provide guidelines for management of patients scheduled or undergoing therapies, which through their immunomodulatory activity contribute to the impairment of antiviral immunity, including chemotherapy, immunosuppressive treatment or biological therapy.
