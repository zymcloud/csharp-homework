Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors, with a poor long-term prognosis worldwide. The functional deregulations of global transcriptome were associated with the genesis and development of HCC, but lacks systematic research and validation.Methods:A total of 519 postoperative HCC patients were included. We built an interactive and visual competing endogenous RNA network. The prognostic signature was established with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen for independent prognostic factors for HCC overall survival.Results:In the training set, we identified a four-gene signature (PBK, CBX2, CLSPN, and CPEB3) and effectively predicted the overall survival. The survival times of patients in the high-score group were worse than those in the low-score group (p = 0.0004), and death was also more likely in the high-score group (HR 2.444, p Conclusions:In conclusion, we successfully built a more extensive ceRNA network for HCC and then identified a four-gene-based signature, enabling prediction of the overall survival of patients with HCC.
