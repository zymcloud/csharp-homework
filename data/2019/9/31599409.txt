Objective:Recently, the vital role of circular RNAs is discovered in many diseases, including tumor progression. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most ordinary malignant tumors. The purpose of our study is to detect the potential function of circ_0000885 in HCC to offer new biomarkers and targets.Patients and methods:The expression level of circ_0000885 in HCC tissues and cell lines was monitored by Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Pearson's Chi-square test was used to determine the association of circ_0000885 expression with several clinicopathological factors. Then knockdown of circ_0000885 was constructed to uncover its function in HCC. The cell growth ability was measured through the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, and cell cycle assay. The Western blot assay was performed to analyze the protein level of Caprin1.Results:Circ_0000885 was highly expressed in HCC tissues than that in adjacent samples. The miR-532-5p expression was associated with lymphatic metastasis and TNM stage. The expression of circ_0000885 was also higher in HCC cell lines. The cell growth ability of HCC cells was inhibited after circ_0000885 was silenced. Furthermore, Caprin1 was inhibited via knockdown of circ_0000885.Conclusions:Circ_0000885 could enhance cell proliferation and regulate cell cycle of HCC by promoting Caprin1.
