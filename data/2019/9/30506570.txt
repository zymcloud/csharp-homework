Sorafenib is the most recommended first-line systemic therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yet there is no clinically applied biomarker for predicting sorafenib response. We have demonstrated that a vascular pattern, named VETC (Vessels that Encapsulate Tumor Clusters), facilitates the release of whole tumor clusters into the bloodstream; VETC-mediated metastasis relies on vascular pattern, but not on migration and invasion of cancer cells. In this study, we aimed to explore whether vascular pattern could predict sorafenib benefit. Two cohorts of patients were recruited from four academic hospitals. The survival benefit of sorafenib treatment for patients with or without the VETC pattern (VETC+ /VETC- ) was investigated. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that sorafenib treatment significantly reduced death risk and prolonged overall survival (OS; in cohort 1/2, P = 0.004/0.005; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.567/0.408) and postrecurrence survival (PRS; in cohort 1/2, P = 0.001/0.002; HR = 0.506/0.384) in VETC+ patients. However, sorafenib therapy was not beneficial for VETC- patients (OS in cohort 1/2, P = 0.204/0.549; HR = 0.761/1.221; PRS in cohort 1/2, P = 0.121/0.644; HR = 0.728/1.161). Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed that sorafenib treatment significantly improved OS/PRS in VETC+ , but not VETC- , patients. Further mechanistic investigations showed that VETC+ and VETC- HCCs displayed similar levels of light chain 3 (LC3) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in tumor tissues (pERK) or endothelial cells (EC-pERK), and greater sorafenib benefit was consistently observed in VETC+ HCC patients than VETC- irrespective of levels of pERK/EC-pERK/LC3, suggesting that the different sorafenib benefit between VETC+ and VETC- HCCs may not result from activation of Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)/ERK signaling or induction of autophagy. Conclusion: Sorafenib is effective in prolonging the survival of VETC+ , but not VETC- , patients. VETC pattern may act as a predictor of sorafenib benefit for HCC.
