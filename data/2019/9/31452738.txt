Evidence suggests that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is among the main causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, HCV-induced HCC (HCV-HCC) exhibits adverse clinical outcomes and limited therapeutic treatments are available for this condition. To investigate key biomarkers in the occurrence and development of HCV-HCC, microarray datasets GSE62232, GSE69715 and GSE107170 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database for analysis. The differentially expressed genes between HCV-HCC and normal tissue were identified using the GEO2R online tool. The function enrichment analyses including Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery online tool. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database and visualized using Cytoscape. A total of 368 DEGs were identified, and the top 10 hub genes with a high degree of connectivity were selected for further analysis. Subsequently, overall survival and disease-free survival analysis revealed that there was a significant association between altered expression of HMMR, CCNB1 and KIF20A, and poor clinical outcome. In summary, these results indicate that HMMR, CCNB1 and KIF20A are potential targets for diagnosis and therapy of HCV-HCC.
