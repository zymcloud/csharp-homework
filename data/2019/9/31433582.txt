Purpose:Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 665 (LINC00665) plays a vital role in the development of cancer. Its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, remains largely unknown.Materials and methods:The expressions of LINC00665, miR-186-5p, and MAP4K3 were determined by qRT-PCR. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. Autophagic puncta formation was observed by fluorescence microscopy. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pulldown were performed to identify associations among LINC00665, miR-186-5p, and MAP4K3. Western blot was utilized to examine the expressions of MAP4K3, Beclin-1, and LC3. Tumor growth was evaluated in a xenograft model.Results:Elevations in LINC00665 were observed in HCC tissues and cells. The overall survival of HCC patients with high levels of LINC00665 was shorter than those with low levels. In vitro, LINC00665 depletion inhibited viability and induced apoptosis and autophagy. miR-186-5p interacted with LINC00665 and was downregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Upregulation of miR-186-5p inhibited viability and induced apoptosis and autophagy, which were attenuated by upregulation of LINC00665. MAP4K3 was found to possess binding sites with miR-186-5p and was upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. MAP4K3 depletion inhibited viability and induced apoptosis and autophagy, which were attenuated by miR-186-5p inhibitor. In vivo, miR-186-5p expression was negatively correlated with LINC00665 or MAP4K3 in HCC tissues, while LINC00665 was positively correlated with MAP4K3. LINC00665 knockdown suppressed tumor growth.Conclusion:LINC00665 was involved in cell viability, apoptosis, and autophagy in HCC via miR-186-5p/MAP4K3 axis, which may provide a new approach for HCC treatment.
