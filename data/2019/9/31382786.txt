Introduction: Since the pioneering work of J. J. Thomson on magnetic deflection of charged particles, mass spectrometry (MS) has become the most progressive clinical tool by continuously providing new applications in medical research. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MS can be used from surveillance in early stages of the disease to constant evaluation of effective treatments. Areas covered: This Special Report highlights the groundbreaking possibilities of mass spectrometry clinical application in the mainstream to evaluate HCC development and progression. Expert opinon: MS has been employed to understand a myriad of liver diseases, such as the identification of early biomarkers in cirrhosis and HVB and HVC, as well as metabolic alterations of lipidic imbalance in HCC due to fatty liver disease. In an integrative point-of-view, researchers worldwide are looking for molecular signatures that may represent more faithfully the complex scenario of the onset and progression of HCC. Following the steps of MELD score (Model of End-stage Liver Disease), which evaluates biochemical dysfunction of end-stage liver diseases, the necessity to use innovative attempts to pursue a molecular-MEaLD (mMEaLD - molecular Model for Early Liver Disease), shifting MS to the upstream and from the lab facilities into the mainstream, inside the surgery room.
