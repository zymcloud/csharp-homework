Existing methods often fail to recognize the conversions for the biological roles of the pairs of genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) between the tumor and normal samples. We have developed a novel cluster scoring method to identify messenger RNA (mRNA) and miRNA interaction pairs and clusters while considering tumor and normal samples jointly. Our method has identified 54 significant clusters for 15 cancer types selected from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We also determined the shared clusters across tumor types and/or subtypes. In addition, we compared gene and miRNA overlap between lists identified in our liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) study and regulatory relationships reported from human and rat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease studies (NAFLD). Finally, we analyzed biological functions for the single significant cluster in LIHC and uncovered a significantly enriched pathway (phospholipase D signaling pathway) with six genes represented in the cluster, symbols: DGKQ, LPAR2, PDGFRB, PIK3R3, PTGFR and RAPGEF3.
