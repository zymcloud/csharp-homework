The aim of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of Wingless‑type MMTV integration site (WNT) gene family expression in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)‑related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The clinical data of the patients and gene expression levels were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to investigate the diagnostic value of WNT genes. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis were performed to evaluate the association of WNT gene expression level with overall survival (OS) and recurrence‑free survival (RFS). A nomogram was constructed for the prediction of prognosis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Diagnostic receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that WNT2 had a high diagnostic value, with an area under the curve (AUC) of >0.800 (P
