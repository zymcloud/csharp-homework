Objectives:Surgical indications for pulmonary metastasis from hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) carcinomas remain controversial.Methods:Between 2000 and 2015, 25 patients with pulmonary metastasis from HPB carcinomas and 145 with that from colorectal carcinomas underwent metastasectomies in our institution. The primary diseases were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 8 patients, pancreatic carcinoma (PC) in 12 and biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) in 5. All patients had a sufficient pulmonary reserve, controlled primary disease and no evidence of other metastatic disease. Perioperative factors were investigated retrospectively to analyze the overall survival (OS), pulmonary metastasis-free survival (PmFS) after pulmonary metastasectomy and disease-free interval between surgery for primary disease and the development of pulmonary metastasis (DFI).Results:Complete resection was performed in all patients with lobectomy in 3, segmentectomy in 5 and partial resection in 17. The respective 1-, 2- and 5-year OS rates after metastasectomy were 82.6%, 69.8% and 69.8% in HPB patients and 98.3%, 92.4% and 78.0% in colorectal carcinoma patients (p = 0.351). The 2-year PmFS of HPB patients was 80.0%, versus 60.6% for colorectal carcinoma patients (p = 0.265). The DFI was 41.4 months for HPB patients and 34.5 months for colorectal carcinoma patients (p = 0.273).Conclusions:Metastasectomy for pulmonary metastasis from HPB may be performed in carefully selected patients.
