Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumor worldwide. Metastasis is a marker of cancer deterioration in patients with liver cancer and a major cause of death. In order to develop effective therapeutic strategies, it is urgent to study the molecular basis of liver cancer metastasis. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in HCC. Wound healing and transwell cell invasion assays was used to confirm the role of FASN in liver cancer migration and invasion. Proteins that interacted with FASN were identified using iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification). Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and cellular immunofluorescence analysis were used to assess the interaction between FASN and signal transduction and transcription activator 3 (STAT3). The expression of STAT3, p-STAT3, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was detected after FASN knockdown using Western blot method. Statistical analysis was performed using the t-test. Results: Immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of FASN in HCC tissue was higher than that in adjacent tissues. iTRAQ, Co-IP and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that FASN interacted with STAT3. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of p-STAT3, MMP-2 and MMP-9 decreased after FASN knockdown. Conclusion: FASN may promote the metastasis of liver cancer by interacting with STAT3 and affecting the expression of MMP-2/MMP-9.
