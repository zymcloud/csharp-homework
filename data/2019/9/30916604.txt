Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health problem, with an estimated bioburden of >180 million. Every year about 350,000 people die from HCV-associated liver complications such as cirrhosis and cancer (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma). Pakistan has the second highest prevalence of HCV. Treatment of this life-threatening disease has been a challenge, but recent developments in direct-acting antivirals have offered hope to many. Although direct-acting antivirals have dramatically improved viral clearance, their exorbitant costs put them out of reach for patients in developing countries. Thus, interferon therapy is still being used in Pakistan. Specifically, interferon-stimulating genes can alter treatment response. For example, interferons induce expression of many antiviral genes through signal transducer and activator of transcription/Janus kinase signaling. Suppressor of cytokine signaling genes play an eminent role in the inhibition of cytokine signaling pathways and regulation of both adaptive and innate immunity. The present review examines expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 in HCV-treated patients.
