Background:Primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) is the 4th most common malignancy among males at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research center (KFSH & RC) and in Saudi Arabia. There has been a steady increase in the number of PHC cases since 1975 at KFSH & RC and the burden of hepatic carcinomas is growing in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study is to explore the changing trends and patterns of PHCs at KFSH & RC and conduct a comparative analysis with local, regional and global trends.Materials and methods:Cancer incidence data was obtained from the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center Tumor Registry program as per the American College of Surgeons standards. Clinico-epidemiological data of 1174 liver cancer patients from KFSH & RC during 2000 to 2014 and Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) between 2001-2015 with total of 5,796 cases was reviewed. Trends, patterns of occurrence and other prognostic factors of interest were sub-stratified by gender, age, stage, and grade.Results:Temporal trends indicated a rising incidence of PHC from 2001 to 2014 in Saudi Arabia; from 323 cases in 2001 to 376 cases in 2015 as per SCR. A total of 2,779 new cases of PHC were seen at KFSH & RC between 1975 and 2014; the rate of PHC increased from 60 cases in 2004 to 80 cases in 2014. Majority of liver cancers were hepatocellular carcinomas (79.3%) followed by cholangiocarcinoma (11%), and hepatoblastoma (4.7%) with significantly higher incidence among males with a male to female ratio of 2:1 (p Conclusion:Despite improvement in preventive measures, incidence rates of PHC has increased during the last decade with marked regional variation. Etiology of this escalating trend is multifactorial; predominantly, chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), heavy alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes, and tobacco smoking. This exponential increase may also be due to early detection and diagnosis due to expanding health care delivery in the Kingdom. Further studies are indicated to comprehend the rising trends at the molecular and genetic levels.
