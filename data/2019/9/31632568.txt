CD38 is expressed on the surface of many immune cells, which are closely associated with antitumor immunity and immune tolerance of tumor cells. Therefore, monitoring CD38 expression has gained great attention for tracking the progression of tumors and cancer treatment. Herein, we aim to develop a PET tracer using an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (daratumumab) to monitor CD38 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, daratumumab was radiolabeled with 64Cu (t1/2=12.7 h) to obtain 64Cu-NOTA-daratumumab. Relative CD38 expression in HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cell lines was assessed using western blot. The specificity of 64Cu-NOTA-daratumumab to both cell lines was examined using an in vitro cell-binding assay. PET imaging in subcutaneous models of HCC was performed to evaluate the capability and specificity of 64Cu-NOTA-daratumumab to target CD38 in vivo. Region-of-interest analysis and ex vivo biodistribution were performed to verify the tracer targeting capability of CD38. Through cellular studies of two HCC cell lines, CD38 expression was found to be higher in HepG2 and minimal in Huh7 cells. 64Cu-NOTA-daratumumab showed relatively high affinity to CD38 (Ka=18.21 ± 1.74 nM), while the affinity of Huh7 was in the micromolar range for daratumumab binding to the cells (Ka=3.98 ± 0.87 μM). At 48 h post-injection, PET imaging of subcutaneous models with 64Cu-NOTA-daratumumab revealed tumor uptakes of 12.23 ± 2.4 and 2.7 ± 1.2 %ID/g for HepG2 and Huh7, respectively (n=4), which correlated well with relative CD38 expression of the cells. Moreover, the 64Cu-NOTA-IgG nonspecific analogue showed a significantly lower uptake in HepG2 subcutaneous model in mice, suggesting a specific binding of daratumumab with CD38 in vivo. Our cellular studies and PET imaging confirmed the capability and specificity of 64Cu-NOTA-daratumumab for the imaging of CD38 in murine models of HCC. This study supports our claim that 64Cu-NOTA-daratumumab is an effective PET tracer for the non-invasive evaluation of CD38 expression and sensitive detection of CD38-positive tumor lesions in HCC.
