Purpose:While transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a mainstay of treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), technical aspects have varied considerably in the literature. These variations lead to heterogeneity and make meaningful comparisons between articles difficult. The goal of this survey was to report international embolization practices for the treatment of HCC in an effort to understand current treatment strategies as a first step toward technique standardization.Materials and methods:An anonymous 18 question online survey, evaluating technical aspects of TACE, was distributed via e-mail to practicing members of the five largest interventional radiology societies in Chinese and English. A total of 1160 responses were obtained from 62 countries.Results:Between regions, there were significant statistical differences in nearly all responses, including the amount of ethiodol oil used for cTACE (p = Conclusion:Technical aspects of transarterial embolization for HCC vary significantly by geographical location.
