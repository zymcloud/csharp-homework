Purpose:Inhibition of the VEGFR-2 blocks angiogenesis and attenuates tumor growth, but cancers may evade this effect through activation of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET. Here we report results of the phase Ib/II study of ramucirumab, a monoclonal anti-VEGFR-2 antibody, plus the anti-MET mAb emibetuzumab.Patients and methods:A 3+3 dose escalation of emibetuzumab plus ramucirumab (phase Ib) was followed by tumor-specific expansion cohorts. Primary objectives were to determine the recommended phase II dose and to evaluate antitumor activity. Secondary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Tumoral MET expression was explored by immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results:A total of 97 patients with solid tumor [6 phase Ib, 16 gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, 45 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 15 renal cell carcinoma, and 15 non-small lung cancer] received emibetuzumab at 750 or 2,000 mg flat dosing plus ramucirumab at 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Common adverse events were primarily mild or moderate and included fatigue (36.1%), peripheral edema (28.9%), and nausea (14.4%). Emibetuzumab exposures were similar as in previous studies with no apparent drug-drug interactions. Five partial responses (5.2%) were observed across all tumor types. The greatest antitumor activity was noted in HCC with a 6.7% overall response rate, 60% disease control rate, and 5.42 months (95% confidence interval, 1.64-8.12) progression-free survival (PFS). HCC with high MET expression showed improved PFS with approximately 3-fold increase in PFS (8.1 vs. 2.8 months) relative to low MET expression.Conclusions:Ramucirumab plus emibetuzumab was safe and exhibited cytostatic antitumor activity. MET expression may help to select patients benefitting most from this combination treatment in select tumor types.
