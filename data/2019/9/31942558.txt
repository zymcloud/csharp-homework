Background:The outcomes for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving sorafenib are far from satisfactory because of treatment resistance to sorafenib. However, the exact mechanism of resistance to sorafenib remains unclear and it is valuable to establish a novel mouse model to quantitatively analyze the inhibition rates of sorafenib on the invasive growth of HCC cells in the liver.Methods:HCC tissue microblocks derived from patients were cultured and mixed with hydrogel drops. Then, hydrogel drops containing microblocks of HCC tissue were attached onto the surface of the livers of nude mice to form lesions or nodules of HCC. The mice received molecular targeting agents through oral administration. Livers with tumor nodules were harvested for H&E staining (hematoxylin-eosin staining) analysis and H&E staining images were quantitatively analyzed using image J software. The invasive growth of HCC cells into the liver was calculated using the depth of the lesions compared with the total thickness of the liver.Results:Microblocks containing cells derived from HCC patients can form lesions in the liver of nude mice. Oral administration of molecular targeting agents inhibited the invasive growth of HCC cells in the liver of nude mice.Conclusions:The model established in this study involves the invasive growth of HCC cells in the liver of nude mice, and the model allows for the quantitative analysis of the inhibitory effect of molecular targeting agents on the invasion of HCC cells in vivo.
