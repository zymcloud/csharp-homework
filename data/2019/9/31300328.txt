Purpose:The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of stereotactic radiation therapy for primary and secondary liver tumours in Jean-Perrin cancer centre (Clermont-Ferrand, France) in terms of efficacy and safety.Materials and methods:Between December 2013 and June 2016, 25 patients were included. Treatment was performed on a linear accelerator Novalis TX®. The prescription dose was 42 to 60Gy in three to five fractions. Local control at 1 year was evaluated with modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST) and RECIST criteria. Acute and late toxicity were evaluated with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 criteria.Results:Median follow-up was 10.5 months. Treatment tolerance was good with few side effects grade 3 or above, no acute toxicity and only one late toxicity. We have highlighted that hepatic artery haemorrhage was associated with the presence of a biliary prosthesis in contact with the artery (P=0.006) and in the irradiation field. There was no correlation with the dose delivered to the artery and hepatic artery haemorrhage.Conclusion:Stereotactic radiation therapy for liver tumours allows a good local control with few secondary effects. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with biliary prostheses in the vicinity of the target volume because there is a risk of haemorrhage of the hepatic artery in contact with the prosthesis.
