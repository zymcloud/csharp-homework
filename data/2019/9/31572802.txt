Epidemiological study has confirmed that PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) is associated with the incidence and progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Accordingly, this study was undertaken to investigate the pro-metastatic effects of PM2.5 on human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 in vitro and to explore the underlying mechanisms. CCK-8 assay was performed to examine the effect of PM2.5 on the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells; scratch wound assay and transwell matrigel system has been used to examine the effect of PM2.5 on the migration and invasion ability of SMMC-7721 cells; furthermore, effect of PM2.5 on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of SMMC-7721 cells were examined by examining the EMT markers vimentin, ɑ-smooth muscle actin (ɑ-SMA), and E-cadherin; furthermore, the roles of microRNA-16 (miR-16) and its target Twist1 in PM2.5 induced carcinogenic effects were also examined. Results of CCK-8 assay suggested that PM2.5 promoted the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells in a dose and time dependent manner. PM2.5 also markedly promoted the migration and invasion ability of SMMC-7721 cells. Moreover, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) was also triggered by PM2.5. On the other hand, microRNA-16 (miR-16) and its target Twist1 was found to be mediated by PM2.5, and miR-16 mimic could suppress the metastatic ability of SMMC-7721 cells exposure to PM2.5 via inversely regulating the expression of Twist1. Furthermore, dual Luciferase reporter assay confirmed the specifically binding of miR-16 to the predicted 3'-UTR of Twist1. The present study confirmed the pro-proliferative and pro-metastatic effect of PM2.5 on HCC cell line SMMC-7721. The possible mechanisms were EMT process induced by PM2.5 in SMMC-7721 cells, which was accompanied by a decrease in miR-16 and increase in Twist1 expression.
