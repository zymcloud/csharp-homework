Introduction:The common metastatic sites of renal cell cancer (RCC) are the lung, bone, liver, brain, adrenal glands, and contralateral kidney. Metastasis to the gallbladder is rare, and cystic duct metastasis from RCC has been reported in only one metachronous case. This is the first report of a case of synchronous cystic duct metastasis from RCC.Case report:A 72-year-old woman presenting with hematuria had a history of Cushing disease approximately 10 years previously. Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen showed a mass measuring 5.8 Ã— 3.0 cm in the left kidney, which was strongly enhanced in the early phase and washed out in the late phase. A mass measuring 2 cm in diameter was seen in the left adrenal gland, and a 1.0-cm mass was noted in the right adrenal gland. Multiple tiny masses were detected in the cystic duct. Left renal cell carcinoma, cystic duct metastasis, and bilateral adrenal gland metastases were diagnosed. Because the metastatic tumor was close to the common bile duct, we performed left nephrectomy, bilateral adrenalectomy, cholecystectomy, resection of the extrahepatic bile duct, and hepaticojejunostomy. Pathological findings showed that the renal tumor was clear cell carcinoma, as were the bilateral adrenal tumors and cystic duct tumor. The patient died 30 months after the operation.
