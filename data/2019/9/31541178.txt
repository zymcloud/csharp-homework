β-CD-DPPE molecule was synthesized through the conjugation of β-CD-NH2 and the DPPE molecule, and its' water-solubility was more excellent than the traditional phospholipid molecule. The spherical micelles was formed by β-CD-DPPE molecule in aqueous solution, and the β-CD-DPPE-Dox nanomedicine can be prepared through loading Dox (Doxorubicin) into the micelles, and the Dox loading ratio was about 82.3 ± 7.27%. At the same time the Dox release behavior from the nanomedicine was sustained-release and pH controlled release, and the release test in vitro showed that the release rate of the Dox at the lower pH was faster than that of normal pH (pH = 7.4), which indicated that the rate of release in the tumor microenvironment is faster than in the normal tissue. Biological test showed that the micelles was low cytotoxicity, and the cytotoxicity of β-CD-DPPE-Dox nanomedicine was lower than the Dox under the same Dox concentration, and the β-CD-DPPE-Dox nanomedicine could effectively induce cancer cell apoptosis and inhibit the tumor growth.
