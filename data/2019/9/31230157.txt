Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab paclitaxel (nab-P) plus gemcitabine (GEM) in elderly patients ≥ 75 years old with unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC) compared with younger patients.Methods:The data of 27 unresectable PC patients treated with nab-P plus GEM as first-line chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups according to their age at inclusion: an elderly group (9 patients ≥ 75 years old) and a younger group (18 patients <75 years old). We compared the disease control rate, median overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs) between the two groups. Predictive factors for the OS were also evaluated.Results:The clinical characteristics of patients of the two groups were not significantly different except for the age. The respective values for the disease control rate (66.7% vs. 77.8%, P = 0.542) and median OS (277 days vs. 312 days, P = 0.722) were also not significantly different between the elderly and younger group, although the relative dose intensity of GEM/nab-P in the elderly group (56.6%/53.1%) was significantly lower than that in the younger group (67.3%/63.1%) (P = 0.016/0.04). The absence of biliary drainage and CEA ≥ 6.5 were found to be poor prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis. The most common grade ≥ 3 AE was neutropenia (44% in both groups). No significant differences in the frequency of all AEs were observed between the two groups.Conclusions:Nab-P plus GEM appears effective and well-tolerated for elderly patients ≥ 75 years old with unresectable PC.
