RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) is one of the basic eukaryotic cellular machinery which plays a pivotal role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Discovery of miRNAs and their role in gene regulation have changed the course of modern biology. The method of gene silencing using small interfering RNAs and miRNAs has become major tool in molecular biology and genetic engineering. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a very common malignancy of liver in developing countries and due to various risk factors; the prevalence of this disease is rapidly increasing throughout the globe. There exists an imbalance in interplay between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and their regulation plays a major role in HCC growth, development and metastasis. The regulatory function of RISC and miRNAs make them a very important mediators of cancer signaling in HCC. Therefore, targeting the RISC complex for HCC therapy is the need of the time.
