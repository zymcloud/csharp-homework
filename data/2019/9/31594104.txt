The treatment of late stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presently remains a great challenge. A very few drugs have been recently approved for clinical use except sorafenib and lenvatinib. After decades of failure and experience with molecular targeted and immunosuppressive therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors are becoming one of the potentially effective therapies for patients with HCC, whose tumor is in the middle and late stages. Moreover, immune checkpoint is one of the main mechanisms of tumor immune evasion; of which programmed cell death protein 1 and its ligand (PD1/PD-L1) are important immune checkpoint targets, and its related pathway has shown to have an antitumor effect in a variety of solid or hematologic tumors and its inhibitors can effectively exert antitumor immunosuppressive effects. This review summarizes the current role of PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the treatment of late stage HCC, and explores the forecasting value of combined therapy strategy for HCC.
