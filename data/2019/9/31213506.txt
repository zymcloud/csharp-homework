The approved kinase inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not matched to specific mutations within tumors. This has presented a daunting challenge; without a clear target or mechanism, no straightforward path has existed to guide the development of improved therapies for HCC. Here, we combine phenotypic screens with a class of conformation-specific kinase inhibitors termed type II to identify a multikinase inhibitor, AD80, with antitumoral activity across a variety of HCC preclinical models, including mouse xenografts. Mass spectrometry profiling found a number of kinases as putative targets for AD80, including several receptor and cytoplasmic protein kinases. Among these, we found p38 gamma and delta as direct targets of AD80. Notably, a closely related analog of AD80 lacking p38δ/γ activity, but retaining several other off-target kinases, lost significant activity in several HCC models. Moreover, forced and sustained MKK6 → p38→ATF2 signaling led to a significant reduction of AD80 activity within HCC cell lines. Together with HCC survival data in The Cancer Genome Atlas and RNA-seq analysis, we suggest p38 delta and gamma as therapeutic targets in HCC and an "AD80 inhibition signature" as identifying those patients with best clinical outcomes.
