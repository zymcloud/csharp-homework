Background:Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a deadly urological tumor that remains largely incurable. Our limited understanding of key molecular mechanisms underlying RCC invasion and metastasis has hampered efforts to identify molecular drivers with therapeutic potential. With evidence from our previous study revealing that nuclear overexpression of YBX1 is associated with RCC T stage and metastasis, we investigated the effects of YBX1 in RCC migration, invasion, and adhesion, and then characterized its interaction with RCC-associated proteins G3BP1 and SPP1.Methods:Renal cancer cell lines, human embryonic kidney cells, and clinical samples were analyzed to investigate the functional role of YBX1 in RCC metastasis. YBX1 knockdown cells were established via lentiviral infection and subjected to adhesion, transwell migration, and invasion assay. Microarray, immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and classical biochemical assays were applied to characterize the mechanism of YBX1 interaction with RCC-associated proteins G3BP1 and SPP1.Results:Knockdown of YBX1 in RCC cells dramatically inhibited cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Mechanistic investigations revealed that YBX1 interaction with G3BP1 upregulated their downstream target SPP1 in vitro and in vivo, which led to an activated NF-κB signaling pathway. Meanwhile, knockdown of SPP1 rescued the YBX1/G3BP1-mediated activation of NF-κB signaling pathway, and RCC cell migration and invasion. We further showed that YBX1 expression was positively correlated with G3BP1 and SPP1 expression levels in clinical RCC samples.Conclusions:YBX1 interacts with G3BP1 to promote metastasis of RCC by activating the YBX1/G3BP1-SPP1-NF-κB signaling axis.
