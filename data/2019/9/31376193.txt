Background:The rarities of primary neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and primary adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (NE differentiation) mean that their clinical characteristics have not been fully elucidated.Materials and methods:A total of 449 patients with NEPC, including 352 cases of pure NEPC and 97 cases of NE differentiation, together with 408 629 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma at diagnosis were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (2010-2015). Clinical parameters and prognoses were compared between patients with different histological types of NEPC using the Ï‡2 test and Kaplan-Meier analysis, respectively. The prognostic value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in NEPC and adenocarcinoma was evaluated using Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Pure NEPC had higher rates of visceral metastases (brain, lung, and liver: 4.58%, 26.72%, and 36.64%, respectively) but a lower rate of bone metastasis (65.65%) compared with NE differentiation and prostate adenocarcinoma. Moreover, patients diagnosed with pure NEPC had a poorer outcome (median survival time: 10 months) compared with patients with NE differentiation (26 months) and prostate adenocarcinoma (median survival time not reached). Using PSA 4.1 to 10 ng/mL as the reference, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PSA lower than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL were 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-4.55, P = .025) in the NE differentiation group and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.11-2.23, P = .011) in the pure NEPC group.Conclusions:Patients with NE differentiation had different clinical characteristics and a better prognosis than patients with pure NEPC. In addition, low-serum PSA levels were associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with either NEPC or NE differentiation.
