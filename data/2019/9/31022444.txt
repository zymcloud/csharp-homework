Cancer is one of the most critical problems of public health in the world and one of the main challenges for medicine. Different biological effects have been reported for sulfonamide-based compounds including antibacterial, antifungal, and antitumor activities. Herein, a series of phenylpropanoid-based sulfonamides (4a, 4a', 4b, 4b', 5a, 5a', 5b and 5b') were synthesized and their cytotoxic activity was evaluated against four cell lines derived from human tumours (A549 - lung, MCF-7 - breast, Hep G2 - hepatocellular carcinoma, and HT-144-melanoma). Cell viability was significantly reduced in the MCF-7 cell line when compounds 4b, 4b' and 5a were used; IC50 values were lower than those found for their precursors (eugenol and dihydroeugenol) and sulfanilamide. We observed that 4b induced cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition. This is probably due to its ability to reduce cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression. Moreover, 4b also induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells as demonstrated by an increase in the cell population positive for annexin V in treated cultures in comparison to the control group. Taken together, the data showed that 4b is a promising antitumor agent and it should be considered for further in vivo studies.
