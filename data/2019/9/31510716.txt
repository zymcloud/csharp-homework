Objective: To explore clinical application value of prognostic nutrition index(PNI) and apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC) in treating hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of patients with hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 77 patients with HHC of BCLC B were retrospectively analyzed in Dalian Medical University Affiliated Second Hospital who were diagnosed for the first time and received TACE treatment from October 2017 to December 2018, of whom 64 Males, 13 females, mean age was 54±13 years.At 1 month after surgery, TACE efficacy was evaluated according to revised solid tumor evaluation criteria (mRECIST), the enrolled patients were divided into TACE effective group (41 cases, 53.2%) and TACE ineffective group (36 cases, 46.8%) to compare ability of PNI and ability of ADC alone or in combination in evaluating efficacy of TACE and the relationship between these two groups. Results: Overall postoperative PNI of enrolled patients was decreased compared with preoperative PNI, 47.7±6.6 vs 48.3±5.9 (P<0.05), preoperative and postoperative PNI of TACE effective group were all higher than that of TACE ineffective group (49.9±6.0 vs 46.6±5.3, 50.6±5.4 vs 44.4±5.1,all P<0.05), there was no significant difference in PNI between the treatment groups (P>0.05). The value of ADC in postoperative tumor region increased compared with that in preoperative tumor region ((1.43±0.15) ×10(-3) vs (1.28±0.08) ×10(-3) mm(2)/s, P<0.05), the difference between postoperative tumor region ADC value and postoperative normal liver parenchyma had no statistical significance(P>0.05). Overall postoperative PNI and tumor region ADC value of enrolled patients had linear correlation (P<0.05).Threshold value of PNI and ADC value in preoperative prediction were 51.05 and 1.32×10(-3) mm(2)/s; postoperative evaluation threshold value were 50.11 and 1.41×10(-3) mm(2)/s.Postoperative combination of PNI and ADC had the highest value in evaluating TACE efficacy. Conclusions: TACE postoperative PNI and tumor region ADC are related. PNI and tumor region ADC could be used in predicting and evaluating TACE efficacy in HCC patients, combination of these two could further increase the efficiency.
