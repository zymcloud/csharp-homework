Purpose:Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly cancer that is broadly chemoresistant, due in part to biophysical properties of tumor stroma, which serves as a barrier to drug delivery for most classical chemotherapeutic drugs. The goal of this work is to evaluate the preclinical efficacy and mechanisms of PTC596, a novel agent with potent anticancer properties in vitro and desirable pharmacologic properties in vivo.Experimental Design: We assessed the pharmacology, mechanism, and preclinical efficacy of PTC596 in combination with standards of care, using multiple preclinical models of PDA.Results:We found that PTC596 has pharmacologic properties that overcome the barrier to drug delivery in PDA, including a long circulating half-life, lack of P-glycoprotein substrate activity, and high systemic tolerability. We also found that PTC596 combined synergistically with standard clinical regimens to improve efficacy in multiple model systems, including the chemoresistant genetically engineered "KPC" model of PDA. Through mechanistic studies, we learned that PTC596 functions as a direct microtubule polymerization inhibitor, yet a prior clinical trial found that it lacks peripheral neurotoxicity, in contrast to other such agents. Strikingly, we found that PTC596 synergized with the standard clinical backbone regimen gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, yielding potent, durable regressions in a PDX model. Moreover, similar efficacy was achieved in combination with nab-paclitaxel alone, highlighting a specific synergistic interaction between two different microtubule-targeted agents in the setting of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Conclusions:These data demonstrate clear rationale for the development of PTC596 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy for PDA.
