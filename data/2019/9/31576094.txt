Background:Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very malignant tumor in the world. CARMA3 plays an oncogenic role in the pathogenesis of various tumors. However, the function of CARMA3 in HCC has not been fully clarified.Aim:To study the biological function of CAEMA3 in HCC.Methods:Tissue microarray slides including tissues form 100 HCC patients were applied to access the expression of CARMA3 in HCC and its clinical relevance. Knockdown and overexpression of CARMA3 were conducted with plasmid transfection. MTT, colony formation, and apoptosis assays were performed to check the biological activity of cells.Results:Higher expression of CARMA3 in HCC was relevant to poor prognostic survival (P < 0.05). Down-regulation of CARMA3 inhibited proliferation and colony formation and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines, while increasing its expression promoted tumorigenesis. We also found that sodium aescinate (SA), a natural herb extract, exerted anti-proliferation effects in HCC cells by suppressing the CARMA3/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway.Conclusion:Overexpression of CARMA3 in HCC tissues correlates with a poor prognosis in HCC patients. CARMA3 acts pro-tumorigenic effects partly through activation of CARMA3/NF-κB. SA inhibits HCC growth by targeting CARMA3/NF-κB.
