Oxidative stress is involved in the onset and progression of many human diseases. Activators of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway effectively inhibit the progression of oxidative stress-induced diseases. Herein, a small library of diterpenoids was established by means of phytochemical isolation, and chemical modification on naturally occurring molecules. The diterpenoids were subjected to a NAD(P)H: quinone reductase (QR) assay to evaluate its potential inhibition against oxidative stress. Sixteen diterpenoids were found to be novel potential activators of Nrf2-mediated defensive response. Of which, an isopimarane-type diterpenoid, sphaeropsidin A (SA), was identified as a potent activator of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway, and displayed approximately 5-folds potency than that of sulforaphane (SF). SA activated Nrf2 and its downstream cytoprotective genes through enhancing the stabilization of Nrf2 in a process involving PI3K, PKC, and PERK, as well as potentially interrupting Nrf2-Keap1 protein-protein interaction. In addition, SA conferred protection against sodium arsenite [As(III)]- and cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced redox imbalance and cytotoxicity in human lung epithelial cells, as wells as inhibited metronidazole (MTZ)-induced oxidative insult in Tg (krt4: NTR-hKikGR)cy17 transgenic zebrafish and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative damage in wild-type AB zebrafish. These results imply that SA is a lead compound for therapeutic agent against oxidative stress-induced diseases, and diterpenoid is a good resource for discovering drug candidates and leads of antioxidant therapy.
