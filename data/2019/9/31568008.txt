Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene has proven to be associated with the clinical outcome of patients with chronic hepatitis virus B or C (HBV or HCV) infections. However, whether IL28B SNPs have an influence on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients with HBV or HCV infection remains controversial. Therefore, this study aims to determine the association between IL28B polymorphisms and the risk of HCC in individuals with HBV or HCV infection.PubMed, EMBASE, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were used to identify studies meeting the selection requirements using the terms "interleukin 28B", "IFN-lambda-3", "IFNL3", "single nucleotide polymorphisms", "SNPs", "hepatocellular carcinoma", "HCC", "liver cancer".A total of 24 eligible original studies (1 cohort study and 23 case-control studies) involved 20238 individuals (HCC group = 8725 vs control group = 11,513) were included. Both IL28B rs12979860 CC and rs8099917 TT genotypes were significantly associated with a decreased risk of HCC among patients with HBV or HCV infection (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.57-0.88; OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.72-0.94, respectively). Egger test and Begg test revealed no' publication bias (P > .05). Sensitivity analyses suggested the robustness of the results in this meta-analysis.Both IL28B rs12979860 CC and rs8099917 TT genotypes are protective factors for the development of HCC among patients with HBV or HCV infection. Future prospective studies examining the impact of IL28B polymorphisms on the risk of HCC and investigating the underlying mechanism for the protective role of IL28B polymorphisms in HCC development are warranted.
