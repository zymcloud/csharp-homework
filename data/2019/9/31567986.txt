Rationale:Liver transplantation is an increasingly common treatment for patients with liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation in patients with heart disease can pose a significant challenge to the transplant teams.Patient concerns:A 46-year-old woman was diagnosed with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma 3 years ago and had received 3 times transarterial chemoembolization.Diagnoses:The patient was diagnosed as end-stage liver disease due to hepatocellular carcinoma and was scheduled to undergo living-donor liver transplantation. The preoperative echocardiogram revealed mass in the right atrium and the inferior vena cava.Interventions:The patient underwent mass removal under cardiopulmonary bypass followed by liver transplantation.Outcomes:A month later, she was discharged without any complications.Lessons:There have only been a few reported cases of anesthetic liver transplantation after a cardiopulmonary bypass. The successful experience described in this case report suggests that some patients may be eligible to undergo a liver transplantation after a cardiopulmonary bypass.
