Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is important for preventing alcohol toxicity and developmental disorders, and may be involved in other diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. We found that the major acceptor protein of polyADP-ribosylation in a model organism of neurodegeneration using a Drosophila melanogaster mutant lacking poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, was ADH. Thus we postulated that human ADH activity might be regulated by polyADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification. The radioactivity of [32P]NAD+ was incorporated into human ADH1 by human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in vitro, but was not incorporated when heat-inactivated PARP1 or a PARP inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, was used. The incorporated radioactivity was not released from ADH1 protein in the presence of excess amount of ADP-ribose or poly(ADP-ribose) as competitors. However, it was released by incubation with 1 M neutral NH2OH or 0.1 N NaOH, but was not with 0.1 N HCl, suggesting the bond between ADH1 and poly(ADP-ribose) is an ester linkage. When HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, were cultured in the presence of another PARP inhibitor, olaparib, ADH activity of the cell was significantly increased. These results suggest that polyADP-ribosylation could regulate ADH activity in vivo and might be involved in neurodegeneration.
