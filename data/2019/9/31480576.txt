Aim:This prospective study assessed the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using long Kupffer phase enhancement for adults with liver tumor size of less than 3 cm. Performance comparisons were also conducted with dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Background:CEUS has emerged as a reliable image modality, since the development of second-generation contrast medium with long Kupffer phase enhancement. Nonetheless, dynamic CT and MRI are currently the standard imaging tools for the diagnosis of liver cancers, and the diagnostic value of CEUS for liver cancer has yet to be universally accepted.Methods:Sixty-six adult patients suspected of having liver tumors smaller than 3 cm underwent CEUS, dynamic CT, and MRI examinations independently. Subsequent tumor biopsies were used to verify the diagnostic performance of the three imaging modalities.Results:The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR, 95% CI) for hepatocellular carcinoma were as follows: CEUS (52.8, 11.4-243), CT (29.29, 7.36-116), and MRI (19.43, 5.44-69.4); for metastasis: CEUS (200, 19.1-2095), CT (24, 5.05-114), and MRI (32, 6.56-156); and all liver malignancy: CEUS (260, 12.7-5310), CT (2.57, 0.55-12.1), and MRI (5.22, 1.25-21.8). CEUS achieved the best differentiation performance.Conclusions:CEUS outperformed dynamic CT and MRI in terms of diagnostic performance when dealing with small liver tumors (
