Background:Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for patients with unresectable early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Post-LT HCC recurrence rates range from 8 to 20% and still impact on overall survival (OS). The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of HCC recurrence on post-LT survival and analyze prognostic factors among those patients with recurrence.Patients and methods:We carried out a national, multicenter, retrospective cohort study in Brazil. Medical records of 1119 LT recipients with HCC were collected. Data from patients with post-LT HCC recurrence were analyzed and correlated with post-relapse survival.Results:OS of the 1119 patients included in the study was 63% over 5 years. Post-LT HCC recurrence occurred in 86 (8%) patients. The mean time to recurrence was 12 months. Sites of recurrence were extrahepatic in 55%, hepatic in 27%, and both hepatic and extrahepatic in 18%. Recurrence treatment was performed in 50 (64%) cases, mostly with sorafenib. Post-relapse survival rates were 34% at 1 year and 13% at 5 years. Univariable analysis identified Î±-fetoprotein more than 1000 ng/ml at relapse, recurrence treatment, extrahepatic location, and time to recurrence more than 2 years as prognostic factors. In multivariable analysis, recurrence treatment, extrahepatic location, and time to recurrence more than 2 years were independent predictors of better survival.Conclusion:In a large Brazilian cohort of LT recipients with HCC, post-LT HCC recurrence occurred in 8% and impacted significantly on the OS. Patients with early recurrence presented a worse prognosis. However, treatment of recurrence improved outcomes, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis.
