Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression has been demonstrated in tumor neovasculature of many solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate PSMA expression in patients with HCC.Materials and methods:Nineteen HCC patients who underwent F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) as part of restaging procedure also underwent Ga-PSMA PET. F-FDG PET and Ga-PSMA findings were compared visually as well as quantitatively using maximized standardized uptake values (SUVmax).Results:FDG was positive in 15 patients while 16 patients demonstrated PSMA expression. The only extrahepatic finding was one metastatic lymph node detected by both tracers. Mean SUVmax of liver lesions on FDG PET/CT was 8.3 ± 2.3 and mean tumor to background ratio was 2.3 ± 1.5. Respective values for Ga-PSMA PET/CT were 17.4 ± 9 and 3.3 ± 2.2. On visual and quantitative evaluation uptake was higher with PSMA in nine patients and higher with FDG in four patients. PSMA and FDG activity were similar in three patients. One of the FDG positive patients was PSMA negative whereas two patients were PSMA positive but FDG negative. Heterogeneous uptake pattern was observed in three patients. Comparison of mean SUVmax and T/B values between PET studies revealed no statistically significant difference (P > 0.1). The mean survival was 25 months (range: 18-32 months) and SUVmax of PSMA (P = 0.05) and FDG (P = 0.012) showed medium strength of correlation with overall survival.Conclusion:PSMA expression in advanced HCC can be demonstrated by Ga-PSMA PET but is not superior to FDG PET however it could be useful for identifying patients with limited therapeutic options.
