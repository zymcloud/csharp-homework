Aim:To evaluate the safety and mid-term outcome of percutaneous thermal ablation (PTA) for the treatment of intrahepatic recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (r-HCC) after liver transplantation (LT).Materials and methods:Between October 2010 and March 2017, a total of 52 cases with 120 r-HCCs after LT treated with PTA as a first-line option were enrolled. Overall survival (OS), recurrence free survival (RFS), and the incidence of complications were comprehensively analysed.Results:Major complications occurred in four of 52 (7.7%) patients and minor complications occurred in 19 patients (36.5%). Median OS time was 21.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]:16.4-26.7 months), with 1-, 2-, and 3-year cumulative survival rates of 74.5%, 45.6%, and 26.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that tumour number, the time to recurrence after LT, and serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level were found as independent predictors of OS. The estimated of median RFS time was 6 months (95% CI: 3.1-9 months) with the estimated 1-year recurrence-free survival rates of 28.8%. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated tumour number and the time to recurrence after LT were found as independent predictors of RFS.Conclusion:PTA is a safe and effective treatment for intrahepatic r-HCCs after LT, with a favourable mid-term outcome. Single tumour, late recurrence after LT (>12 months), and serum AFP level â‰¤200 ng/ml were independent predictors for longer OS time.
