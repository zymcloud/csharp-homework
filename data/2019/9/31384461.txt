To examine the effectiveness of ultrasonography (US) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance, the prognosis of HCC patients who underwent such screening at an expert medical institution or at general clinics were analyzed, as well as those without US surveillance. From October 2006 to December 2014, 872 patients with na√Øve HCC were enrolled and divided into the surveillance (S)-group (n=398), who underwent follow-up examinations with US, and the non-S group (n=474). The S-group was further subdivided into patients who underwent follow-up surveillance at Ehime Prefectural Central Hospital, an expert medical institution (SE-group, n=189), and those who received surveillance at general clinics (SG-group, n=209). Prognosis and clinical characteristics were analyzed. In the non-S group, the frequency of patients without viral hepatitis (NBNC-HCC) and Tumor, Node, Metastasis stage was greater. As a result, the median survival time (MST) of the non-S group was reduced, compared with the S group (non-S group, 34.1 vs. S group, 68.2 months; P
