Background:Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in many diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Autophagy is a metabolic pathway that facilitates cancer cell survival in response to stress. The relationship between autophagy and the lncRNA-activated by transforming growth factor beta (lncRNA-ATB) in HCC remains unknown.Aim:To explore the influence of lncRNA-ATB in regulating autophagy in HCC cells and the underlying mechanism.Methods:In the present study, we evaluated lncRNA-ATB expression in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 72 HCC cases by real-time PCR. We evaluated the role of lncRNA-ATB in the proliferation and clonogenicity of HCC cells in vitro. The effect of lncRNA-ATB on autophagy was determined using a LC3-GFP reporter and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, the mechanism by which lncRNA-ATB regulates autophagy was explored by immunofluorescence staining, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and Western blot.Results:The expression of lncRNA-ATB was higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues, and lncRNA-ATB expression was positively correlated with tumor size, TNM stage, and poorer survival of patients with HCC. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of lncRNA-ATB promoted cell proliferation and clonogenicnity of HCC cells in vitro. LncRNA-ATB promoted autophagy by activating Yes-associated protein (YAP). Moreover, lncRNA-ATB interacted with autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5) mRNA and increased ATG5 expression.Conclusion:LncRNA-ATB regulates autophagy by activating YAP and increasing ATG5 expression. Our data demonstrate a novel function for lncRNA-ATB in autophagy and suggest that lncRNA-ATB plays an important role in HCC.
