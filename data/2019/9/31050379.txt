Background and aims:The modified PAGE-B (mPAGE-B) score comprising age, gender, platelet count and albumin was recently proposed to predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients undergoing antivirals. Here, in the independent cohort, we externally validated the predictive performance of the mPAGE-B score and compared it with those of conventional HCC prediction models.Methods:We consecutively recruited CHB patients treated with lamivudine, entecavir or tenofovir as the first-line antiviral regimen. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis or HCC at baseline were excluded. Predictive performances of the mPAGE-B score and other models were assessed with comparison.Results:Among 1330 patients, 9.6% developed HCC during follow-up. The mPAGE-B score provided the highest Harrell's c-index (0.769), followed by the GAG-HCC (0.751), PAGE (0.744), REACH-B (0.686) and CU-HCC (0.618) scores. The mPAGE-B score showed the similar performance to the PAGE-B and GAG-HCC scores and the better performance than the REACH-B and CU-HCC scores. Cumulative HCC probabilities at 5- and 7-years were 0.0% and 0.0% in low-risk group (mPAGE-B score ≤ 8), 6.1% and 10.8% in intermediate-risk group (mPAGE-B score 9-12) and 18.7% and 26.7% in high-risk group (mPAGE-B score ≥ 13) respectively (both P Conclusion:The mPAGE-B score showed acceptable predictive performances. Compared to the PAGE-B score, addition of albumin as a constituent provided the marginal benefit.
