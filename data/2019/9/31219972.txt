Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) is a rare, aggressive tumor arising from different localizations along the gastrointestinal tract with generally poor prognosis. We present the case of a 51-year-old female patient with histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of a MANEC of the descending colon. At presentation, the tumor had already spread to the liver causing extensive hepatic metastases. Immunohistochemical examination showed 5%-10% of tumor cells to express the programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 and FoundationOne testing revealed a high mutational tumor burden with 149 Muts/Mb. The patient responded very well clinically and radiologically to anti-programmed death 1 receptor monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab therapy after having undergone 3 previous systemic treatment regimens as well as selective internal radiation therapy of her hepatic metastases. Clinical improvement was evident after the first infusion already and is ongoing for 10 months so far with very little side effects including initial and short lived skin irritation as well as muscle pain. To our knowledge, this is the first published case where a MANEC was successfully treated with immunotherapy targeting the programmed death 1 receptor.
