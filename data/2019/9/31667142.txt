Background:To investigate the value of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with a stretched exponential model (SEM) in the evaluation of tumor heterogeneity in an orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) xenograft model.Methods:Thirty orthotopic HCC xenograft nude mice models were established and randomly divided into two groups, the sorafenib induction group (n=15) and control group (n=15). Every mouse in each group underwent MRI with DKI and SEM on a 1.5T MR scanner at 7, 14, and 21 days after sorafenib intervention. DKI and SEM parameters including mean kurtosis (MK), mean diffusivity (MD), Î±, and distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) were measured, calculated, and compared between the two groups and among different time points. Sequential correlations between histopathological results including necrotic fraction (NF), micro-vessel density (MVD), Ki-67 index, standard deviation (SD), and kurtosis from hematoxylin-eosin staining, and DKI and SEM parameters were analyzed.Results:MK, MD, and DDC of HCC in the sorafenib induction group were significantly higher than those in the control group at each time point (PConclusions:DKI and SEM parameters may be potentially useful for evaluating intratumoral heterogeneity in HCC.
