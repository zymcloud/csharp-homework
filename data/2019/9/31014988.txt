Background:Primary hepatobiliary cancer incidence in the UK is rising and survival rates are low. Surgery is the main curative option for these cancers, but multimodality therapies are expanding. The aim of our original study was to determine trends in survival, over an 8-year period, of patients treated for primary hepatobiliary cancers at our tertiary referral Centre.Method:Patients treated for the most common types of primary hepatobiliary cancers, namely Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder cancer between January 2009 and December 2016 were retrospectively analysed from a prospective database linked to UK Hospital Episode Statistics data.Results:A total of 1536 patients with primary hepatobiliary cancers were assessed and treatment plans formulated at our supra-regional specialist Hepatobiliary MDT. The primary hepatobiliary cancers treated were HCC (n = 836), Cholangiocarcinoma (n = 516), and Gallbladder cancer (n = 184). Survival for all the 3 cancers was significantly better with curative treatment. Overall median survival times were 350, 180, and 150 days respectively for HCC, Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder cancer. Excluding best supportive care patients, the respective survival figures were 900, 600, and 400 days. Survival for HCC patients improved over time and was significantly increased in the final 3 years of the study (p â‰¤ 0.011 for all). Cholangiocarcinoma and Gallbladder cancer survivals were poor and did not change significantly over time.Conclusion:HCC outcome has improved in association with expanded multimodal therapies. Survivals for cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer remain poor in parallel with limited expansion of multimodal therapies highlighting an unmet therapeutic need for biliary tract cancers.
