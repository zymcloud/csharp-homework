Purpose:Despite advances in prevention techniques, screening, and new technologies in both diagnosis and treatment, the incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continue to rise. To obtain the best treatment result for HCC, early diagnosis is the key. In this study, we investigated the accuracy of noninvasive fibrosis markers, which have been typically used to predict liver fibrosis in recent years, in the prediction of HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis B + D-induced cirrhosis.Methods:Between 2004 and 2018, 1216 patients with chronic liver disease were retrospectively reviewed, and 331 patients (27%) with hepatitis B and hepatitis B+D virus-related cirrhosis were enrolled in our study. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on HCC diagnosis (HCC and non-HCC group). Eleven noninvasive fibrosis markers were evaluated in the groups. These markers included 3 alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-based models (PAPAS index, Fibro-alpha, and BRC score) and 8 non-AFP based models (Lok index, FIB-4, Fibro-O index, APRI, King's score, Forns index, Bonacini score, and HUI model) for each Child-Pugh score in the prediction of HCC.Results:AFP-based models were higher in HCC group patients, and statistically significant outcomes were detected with these methods in each Child-Pugh score group for HCC prediction (P Conclusion:These easily applied fibrosis markers, particularly AFP-based models, may provide an effective, simple, and low-cost way to predict HCC development in patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis B + D cirrhosis.
