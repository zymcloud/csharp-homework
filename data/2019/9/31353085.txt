Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) is essential for the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Here, we report the presence of genes on the anti-sense strands of the human MTTP and mouse Mttp genes. The gene on the anti-sense strand of the human MTTP gene is called MTTP-AS1. It consists of 5 exons and 4 introns and codes for two different transcripts MTTP-AS1-Long and MTTP-AS1-Short. Exons 3 and 5 of the MTTP-AS1 gene are ancient and evolutionary conserved whereas exons 2 and 4 are primate specific. MTTP-AS1-Long is mainly in the liver and is in the cytoplasm of human hepatoma cells. MTTP-AS1-Short is in the testis. The MTTP-AS1-Long transcript shows complementarity with two different exons of the MTTP transcript. The gene on the opposite strand of the mouse Mttp gene is named as Mttpos. It consists of 2 exons and one intron and codes for one transcript. Partial sequence of the Mttpos exon 2 is homologous in several species from rodents to primates. Mttpos transcript is present in mouse liver, small intestine and testis. The Mttpos transcript shows significant complementarity with the corresponding mouse Mttp mRNA sequences. Further, we identified a conserved sequence in the human MTTP-AS1-Long and mouse Mttpos transcripts indicating for possible evolutionarily conserved regulatory function for these long noncoding RNAs. It is likely that these newly identified long noncoding RNAs interact with their complementary sequences in MTTP mRNAs and affect their stability or translation.
