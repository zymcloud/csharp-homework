Background:Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a life-threatening complication after hepatectomy. However, the relationship between postoperative PVT and morphometric features of the PV has not been fully elucidated yet.Patients and methods:A total of 81 patients who underwent hepatectomy for perihilar cholangio-carcinoma (PHCC) were studied. We investigated the diameters and angles of PV using pre- and postoperative computed tomography (CT) reconstructed by SYNAPSE VINCENT®.Results:The incidence of PVT after hepatectomy was 11.1%. There were significant differences with respect to the remnant liver PV diameter (p=0.015), the diameter ratio (p=0.001), and the postoperative PV angle (p=0.001) between patients with and without PVT. Multivariate analysis revealed that a postoperative PV angle of less than 90° (p=0.008) and a diameter ratio of less than 45% (p=0.041) were independent risk factors for PVT.Conclusion:A postoperative PV angle of less than 90° and diameter ratio of less than 45% eventually lead to PVT after hepatectomy for PHCC.
