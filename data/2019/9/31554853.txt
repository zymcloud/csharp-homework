Thermal ablation has proven beneficial for hepatocellular carcinoma and possibly for colorectal liver metastases, but data is lacking for other liver metastases. Computer-assisted navigation can increase ablation efficacy and broaden its indications. We present our experience with percutaneous stereotactic image-guided microwave ablation (SMWA) for non-colorectal liver metastases (NCRLM), in form of a retrospective study including all SMWA for NCRLM from 2015 to 2017. Indication for SMWA was determined at a multidisciplinary tumorboard. End-points include recurrence, overall and liver-specific disease progression and complications. Twenty-three patients underwent 25 interventions for 40 lesions, including 17 neuroendocrine tumor, nine breast cancer, four sarcoma, two non-small cell lung cancer, three duodenal adenocarcinoma, one esophageal adenocarcinoma, one pancreatic adenocarcinoma, one ampullary carcinoma, one prostate carcinoma, and one renal cell carcinoma metastases. Median follow-up was 15 months (2-32). Incomplete ablation rate was 2.5% (1/40), local recurrence rate 10% (4/40). Three patients (12%) had minor complications. Overall disease progression was 73.9% (17/23), median disease-free survival 7 months (0-26) and overall survival 18 months (2-39). SIMWA is feasible, safe and minimally invasive for NCRLM in selected patients. While it might offer an alternative to resection or palliative strategies, the oncological benefit needs to be evaluated in a larger patient cohort.
