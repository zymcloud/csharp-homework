Background:Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway. However, sorafenib loses effectiveness because most tumors acquire drug resistance over time. As the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is also activated abnormally in HCC, we evaluated the effect of sorafenib, in combination with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235, on HCC cell proliferation and survival in vitro.Materials and methods:Biological phenotypes were analysed in HCC cell lines, parental and sorafenib-resistant HepG2 cells (HepG2 and HepG2R), treated with sorafenib or BEZ235, alone or in combination. HCC cellular proliferation and apoptosis were investigated, and perturbations of the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling/survival pathways were evaluated by western blot analysis.Results:BEZ235 enhanced sorafenib inhibition of cellular proliferation, migration, and promotion of apoptosis in HepG2 and HepG2R cells. The combined effects were associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and S6K in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, whereas the combination of sorafenib and BEZ235 did not significantly alter the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway compared with the effect of sorafenib alone.Conclusion:Sorafenib/BEZ235 combination has potent anti-HCC cell activity. This anti-tumor activity is most likely multi-factorial, mainly involving PI3K down-regulation and AKT, mTOR and S6K dephosphorylation. Combined inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways enhances sorafenib inhibition of HCC. The results of these in vitro studies suggest that trials of combined sorafenib and BEZ235 in the treatment of HCC should be considered.
