Alterations in circular RNA (circRNA) expression have a vital impact on the biological processes in cancer. Moreover, the expression pattern and roles of circRNAs in hepatocellular cancer (HCC) remain unclear. This study performed qRT-PCR to determine the regulated circRNAs in HCC tissues and cell lines. CCK8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, colony formation, cell cycle assay, apoptotic assay, transwell, and wound healing assay were conducted to assess the function of hsa_circ_0091570 or miR-1307 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration in vitro. Mouse xenograft models were used to measure the functions of hsa_circ_0091570 in vivo. The decreased expression of hsa_circ_0091570 was associated with the pathological staging of HCC patients. Furthermore, inhibition of hsa_circ_0091570 promoted cell proliferation and migration, blocked cell apoptosis in HCC cell lines, and promoted tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model. RNA immunoprecipitation assay verified the interaction of hsa_circ_0091570 and miR-1307. The miR-1307 inhibitor inhibited the function induced by hsa_circ_0091570 siRNA. Overall, hsa_circ_0091570 sponge miR-1307 as a ceRNA and regulate ISM1 expression by exerting functional roles in HCC.
