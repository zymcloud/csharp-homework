Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as crucial regulators in the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 205 (LINC00205) has been identified as a prognostic biomarker in HCC. However, the biological role of LINC0205 and its potential molecular mechanism are poorly investigated. Here, we found that the expression of LINC00205 was dramatically up-regulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent nontumor tissues. Furthermore, the level of LINC00205 in both Hep3B and Huh7 cells was prominently higher than that in normal hepatic cell line LO2. Notably, the high expression of LINC00205 was strongly correlated with tumor size â‰¥5 cm, venous infiltration and advanced tumor stages. Functionally, LINC00205 knockdown obviously repressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of Hep3B and Huh7 cells in vitro. An inverse correlation between LINC00205 and miR-122-5p was detected in HCC tissues. Interestingly, LINC00205 knockdown increased the level of miR-122-5p in both Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Mechanistically, luciferase reporter assay demonstrated LINC00205 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by directly interacting with miR-122-5p. More importantly, miR-122-5p overexpression significantly restrained the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells. Collectively, our study provides solid evidence to support the oncogenic role of LINC00205 in HCC, which may be benefit for the improvement of HCC therapy.
