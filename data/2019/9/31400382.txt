Integrin α6 emerges to be a diagnostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we translated our previously identified integrin α6 targeted peptide RWY into a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 18F-RWY for the detection of HCC lesions in following four HCC mouse models including subcutaneous, orthotopic, genetically engineered and chemical induced HCC mice. 18F-RWY produced high PET signals in liver tumor tissues that were reduced by blocking studies using nonradiolabeled RWY peptide. We compared the integrin α6 targeted PET tracer 18F-RWY with the integrin αvβ3-targeted PET tracer 18F-3PRGD2 and the clinical PET tracer 18F-FDG in chemical induced HCC mice. Among 12 HCC identified by enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with hepatocellular specific gadoxetate disodium Gd-EOB-DTPA, the sensitivities of 18F-RWY, 18F-3PRGD2 and 18F-FDG were approximately 92%, 73% and 50% while the tumor-to-liver ratios were 4.36 ± 1.41, 1.97 ± 0.43 and 1.63 ± 0.23 respectively. Additionally, PET imaging with the integrin α6 targeted 18F-RWY enabled to visualize small HCC lesions with diameters approximately 0.2 cm that was hard to be distinguished from surround hepatic vascular by enhanced MRI with Gd-EOB-DTPA. These findings potentiate the use of integrin α6 targeted PET tracer 18F-RWY for the detection of HCC.
