Patients who suffer from gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) often present with liver metastatic disease. The efficacy of primary tumor resection (PTR) for these patients remains controversial due to the relatively heterogeneous behavior of the primary tumor and the lack of clinical evidence. In this series, GEP-NEN patients with liver metastases (LM) were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2010 and 2015. A logistic regression model was used to analyze variables that were associated with PTR. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic risk factors. In total, 1547 patients were enrolled in our study, including 897 patients who underwent PTR. Resection of the primary tumor was associated with prolonged survival in all patients (5-year overall survival (OS) rates: 57.0% vs 15.4%, P < .001), and improved 5-year OS rates were observed in patients with gastric, small intestinal, colorectal, and pancreatic subtypes (39.7%, 73.3%, 24.6%, and 59.7%, respectively). On the multivariate analysis, PTR was an independent prognostic factor of prolonged OS (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39-0.59, P < .001). Patients with a young age (≤60 years), small intestinal or colorectal NENs, a large primary tumor, lymph node (LN) metastases, and high tumor differentiation were more likely to undergo PTR. However, patients with colorectal NENs or a large primary tumor (≥4 cm) were at an increased risk of death independently in the PTR subgroup. The risk factors for OS also included old age, gastric tumor location, and poor differentiation. In conclusion, although PTR prolonged OS in all GEP-NEN patients presenting with LM, surgical recipients should be considered carefully. Age, primary tumor site, size, and differentiation might help surgeons identify patients who could benefit from PTR.
