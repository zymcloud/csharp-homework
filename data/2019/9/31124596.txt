Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV) can develop in 1.2-4% of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. HBV infection affects about 350 million people worldwide. It can progress from acute or fulminant hepatitis to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty per cent of HBV patients may develop extra-hepatic manifestations, such as polyarteritis nodosa, glomerulonephritis, dermatitis, polyarthralgias and arthritis, lung disease, aplastic anaemia. Our review focuses on the role of antiviral agent nucleot(s)ide analogues (NAs) in treatment of HBV-related CV. The studies in literature have demonstrated that NAs therapy in HBV-related CV yields high virological and satisfying clinical responses in most patients with mild-and-moderate CV, but a low response in severe CV. Overall, NAs represent a promising therapeutic option for HBV-related CV. Obtaining early suppression of HBV viral load should be the main virological and clinical goal in order to prevent organ complications and lymphoproliferative disorders.
