Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Most cases of HCC are usually associated with liver cirrhosis due to various causes such as alcohol or more commonly viral hepatitis. Usually, patients remain asymptomatic for a long time, and symptoms are usually related to the cirrhosis itself or secondary to tumor extension. Intra-cardiac involvement with HCC rarely develops with a very poor prognosis. The occurrence and recurrence of HCC in cirrhotic patients treated with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy (sofosbuvir) have been discussed in a few trials so far with no valid answer.Case presentation:We are reporting a case of recurrent HCC with an accidentally discovered direct right atrial extension with tumor thrombus through the inferior vena cava (IVC) in a cirrhotic patient previously treated with DAA. Unfortunately, due to his critical general condition, he died within days.Conclusion:Cardiac involvement in HCC rarely occurs and usually develops in advanced stages of HCC with very poor reported prognosis. Data regarding the relation between DAA and HCC development is controversial.
