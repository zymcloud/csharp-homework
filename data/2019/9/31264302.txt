Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), caused by excessive consumption of alcohol, is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Much effort has been expended to explore the pathogenesis of ALD. Hepatic cell injury, oxidative stress, inflammation, regeneration, and bacterial translocation are all involved in the pathogenesis of ALD. Immediate abstinence is the most important therapeutic treatment for affected individuals. However, the medical treatment for ALD had not advanced in a long period. Intriguingly, an increasing body of research indicates the potential of natural compounds in the targeted therapy of ALD. A plethora of dietary natural products such as flavonoids, resveratrol, saponins, and β-carotene are found to exert protective effects on ALD. This occurs through various mechanisms composed of antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, iron chelation, pro-apoptosis, and/or antiproliferation of hepatic stellate cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In this review, we will summarize current knowledge about the pathogenesis and treatments of ALD and focus on the potential of natural compounds in ALD therapies and underlying mechanisms.
