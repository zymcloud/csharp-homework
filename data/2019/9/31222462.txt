Objective:The purpose of this article is to describe and illustrate uncommon imaging evolutions of benign (i.e., cyst, hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules, and hepatic angiomyolipoma) and malignant (i.e., HCC and non HCC malignancies) lesions in a cirrhotic liver. The content highlights relevant pathogenesis and imaging clues for proper differential diagnosis. Revision of prior imaging and knowledge of these scenarios may help the abdominal radiologist to reach a noninvasive diagnosis and direct the patient to the most appropriate clinical management.Conclusion:Uncommon imaging evolutions of focal liver lesions in cirrhosis may represent a challenge for the abdominal radiologist, with atypical changes in size, and internal vascularization changes that may lead to misdiagnoses.
