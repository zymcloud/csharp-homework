The five-year survival rate of patients diagnosed with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has remained static at <5% despite decades of research. With the exception of erlotinib, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the benefit of any targeted therapy for PDAC despite promising results in preclinical animal studies. The development of more refined mouse models of PDAC which recapitulate the carcinogenic progression from non-neoplastic, adult exocrine subsets of pancreatic cells to invasive carcinoma in humans are needed to facilitate the accurate translation of therapies to the clinic. To study acinar cell-derived PDAC initiation, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC, called KPT, utilizing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase/estrogen receptor (ESR1) fusion protein knocked into the Ptf1a locus to activate the expression of oncogenic KrasG12D and Trp53R270H alleles in mature pancreatic acinar cells. Oncogene-expressing acinar cells underwent acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, and formed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions following the induction of oncogene expression. After a defined latency period, oncogene-expressing acinar cells initiated the formation of highly differentiated and fibrotic tumors, which metastasized to the lungs and liver. Whole-transcriptome analysis of microdissected regions of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and histological validation experiments demonstrated that regions of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia are characterized by the deposition of the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan. These results indicate that acinar cells expressing KrasG12D and Trp53R270H can initiate PDAC development in young adult mice and implicate hyaluronan deposition in the formation of the earliest characterized PDAC precursor lesions (and the progression of pancreatic cancer). Further studies are necessary to provide a comprehensive characterization of PDAC progression and treatment response in KPT mice and to investigate whether the KPT model could be used as a tool to study translational aspects of acinar cell-derived PDAC tumorigenesis.
