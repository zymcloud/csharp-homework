A new triterpene named klodorol B (1), together with six known compounds, were isolated from the green walnut husks of Juglans mandshurica Maxim. Their structures were determined using spectroscopic methods on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR, and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities on human gastric carcinoma (BGC-823), human liver cancer (HepG-2) and human lung cancer (A549) cell lines. .
