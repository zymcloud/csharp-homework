Background:Factors associated with response to lenvatinib have not been clarified in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:This study retrospectively analyzed 50 patients treated with lenvatinib as first-line therapy between March 2018 and March 2019. Patients were divided into two groups by the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (mRECIST) (responders and non-responders, whose best overall responses were complete (CR)/partial response (PR) and stable (SD)/progressive disease (PD), respectively). Factors associated with response were assessed, including the relative dose intensity 8 weeks after lenvatinib induction (8W-RDI).Results:The best overall responses were 0/22/14/14 of CR/PR/SD/PD. Multivariate analysis revealed that only 8W-RDI was significantly associated with response. The receiver operating characteristic curve for 8W-RDI in differentiating responders from non-responders revealed a cut-off value of 75%. Patients with 8W-RDI ≥75% experienced a higher response rate and longer progression-free survival than patients with 8W-RDI Conclusion:Our results suggest that maintaining an RDI ≥75% during the initial 8 weeks of lenvatinib treatment has a favorable impact on response.
