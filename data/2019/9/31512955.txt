Aim: To simulate effects of the new Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/United Network for Organ Sharing policy on the patients' characteristics and post orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) outcome. Materials & methods: The United Network for Organ Sharing database was used to identify patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were listed for OLT 2002-2014. All patients (actual group) versus simulated group with new 6-month delay in assigning Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score exception and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exception cap of 34 were compared. Results & conclusion: With the new policy, 7,745 (30.4%) of the transplanted patients would have received a delayed transplantation or not be transplanted. The simulated group also showed significantly higher mean overall survival after OLT (p < 0.002) and received more locoreginal treatments (p < 0.001).
