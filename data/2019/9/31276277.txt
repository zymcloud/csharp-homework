Background:Targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is difficult because of their similarities with normal stem cells (NSCs). EpCAM can identify CSCs from EpCAM+AFP+HCC cases, but is also expressed on NSCs. We aimed to distinguish the two using integrated protein, mRNA and miRNA profiling.Methods:iTRAQ based protein profiling and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed on EpCAM+/EpCAM- cells isolated from HCC (Ep+CSC, Ep- HCC) and EpCAM+ cells from non-cancerous/non-cirrhotic control liver tissues (Ep+NSC). Validations were done using qRT-PCR, flowcytometry and western blotting followed by in vitro and in vivo functional studies.Results:11 proteins were overexpressed (>3 fold) in Ep+CSCs compared to Ep- HCC and Ep+NSC cells. However, RNA-sequencing confirmed the Ep+CSC specific up-regulation of only HSPA8, HNRNPC, MPST and GAPDH mRNAs among these. Database search combined with miRNA profiling revealed Ep+ CSC specific down-regulation of 29 miRNAs targeting these four genes. Of these, only miR-26b-5p was found to target both HSPA8 and EpCAM. Validation of HSPA8 overexpression and miR-26b-5p down-regulation followed by linear regression analysis established a negative correlation between the two. Functional studies demonstrated that reduced miR-26b-5p expression increased the spheroid formation, migration, invasion and tumourigenicity of Ep+ CSCs. Furthermore, anti-miR-26b-5p increased the number of Ep+ CSCs with a concomitant overexpression of stemness genes and reduction of proapoptotic protein BBC3, which is a known substrate of HSPA8.Conclusion:miR-26b-5p imparts metastatic properties and helps in maintenance of Ep+ CSCs via HSPA8. Thus, miR-26b-5p and HSPA8 could serve as molecular targets for selectively eliminating the Ep+ CSC population in human HCCs.
