Background:Whether vedolizumab may be effective as a treatment for primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC] in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] remains controversial.Methods:We performed a retrospective observational study of consecutive patients with IBD and PSC, treated with vedolizumab for at least 30 weeks in 22 centres of GETAID from January 2015 to June 2016. The outcomes included a decrease in the serum alkaline phosphatase [ALP] concentration of at least 50% from baseline to Week 30 or 54, a change in any serum liver enzymes concentrations, and an assessment of the efficacy and safety of vedolizumab in IBD.Results:Among 75 patients with active IBD and PSC treated with vedolizumab, 21 patients discontinued vedolizumab before Week 30 [due to lack of efficacy in 19 and malignancy in two patients]. In the remaining 54 patients, a decrease in the serum ALP concentration of at least 50% from baseline to Weeks 30 and 54 was observed in four [7%] and four [11%] patients, respectively. No significant change was observed in serum liver enzyme concentrations at week 30 or 54. After a median follow-up period of 19.4 [14.0-29.9] months, nine cases of digestive neoplasia [colorectal neoplasia in seven and cholangiocarcinoma in two] were reported.Conclusions:In patients with IBD and PSC, vedolizumab did not improve serum liver enzyme concentrations at week 30 or 54. Nine cases of digestive cancer occurred during the follow-up period, confirming the need for a tight surveillance programme in this population.
