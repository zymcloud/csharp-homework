An 83-year-old man with a history of carbon ion radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma nine years ago presented to a primary care hospital with a fever and abdominal pain. He underwent computed tomography, which revealed the rupture of a hepatic pseudoaneurysm close to the fiducial marker for carbon ion radiotherapy and bleeding into the bile duct. He was successfully treated with transcatheter arterial embolization. Thereafter, re-rupture occurred from a site proximal to the first rupture, and this was treated similarly. It is necessary to be alert for not only tumor recurrence but also pseudoaneurysm occurrence after carbon ion radiotherapy.
