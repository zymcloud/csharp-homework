Objectives:Higher affinity of Ga compounds to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) and PET better image resolution increased interest in Ga-labelled somatostatin analogs in the management of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). This study aimed to evaluate the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) variation in sequential somatostatin analogs-PET in NET patients and identify optimal tumour detection and characterization imaging time.Methods:Patients with histological or biochemical NET diagnosis performed two to three PET/computed tomography (CT) scans after intravenous injection of Ga-DOTATATE: Early PET [EarlyPET: <15 minutes postinjection (p.i.)], diagnostic PET (DiagPET: 45-90 minutes p.i.) and delayed PET (DelayPE: 90-240 minutes p.i.). Up to five tumour sites and normal tissues had SUVmax determined. Time-SUVmax curves were created for the target lesions and normal organs. Ratios between tumour and liver SUVmax (SUVTU/Liver) and tumour/blood pool (SUVTU/BP) were also calculated.Results:Twenty-nine patients were included, 16 female, mean age of 46.5 ± 14.3 years. Average administered activity was 129.5 ± 29.6 MBq. Kidneys SUVmax was higher in EarlyPET compared with DiagPET (P = 0.04) and DelayPET showed higher SUVmax compared with DiagPET for normal liver, pancreas and kidneys (P = 0.02). No differences were noted between EarlyPET, DiagPET and DelayPET in tumour SUVmax (P > 0.05). SUVTU/Liver and SUVTU/BP did not change between EarlyPET and DiagPET, with a slight decrease in DelayPET.Conclusion:Stability in tumour SUVmax values measured at different intervals independently of tumour location, as also in normal tissues as kidneys and liver suggest that a more flexible imaging protocol may be adopted.
