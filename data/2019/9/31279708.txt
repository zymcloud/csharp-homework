Recently, we read the published article in GENE. Dong et al. presented the evaluation of the MDM2 40-bp insertion/deletion status in Hepatocellular carcinoma patients (Dong et al., 2012). The authors stated that the insertion allele showed a 521-bp band and the deletion allele showed a 481-bp band on agarose gel electrophoresis. While it seems that these reported sizes for insertion and deletion alleles of MDM2 are incorrect. Our analysis using the primers indicated that the length of insertion and deletion fragments will be 481 and 441 bps, respectively. Actually, 40-bp is added to the fragment length instead of reducing the 40-bp. In the 'UCSC In-Silico PCR' tool, the length of the amplified fragment using mentioned primers is 481-bp including the sequence of 40-bp insertion allele (5'-(A)5GCTGCA(GAAGG)2ATATAACTTTAT(A)7-3') (Reference SNP (rs) Report, n.d.). Therefore, the fragment including the deletion allele will be 441-bp.
