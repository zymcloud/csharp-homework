á…Ÿ: Detection and quantitative measurements of diffused tumor markers in blood samples of patients with cancer is a facile and convenient method to determine prognosis and the appropriateness of the treatment. This study was done to evaluate the level of CA125, CEA, AFP, Beta HCG, and CA19-9 tumor markers and their relation to the stage and grade of the disease in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.Materials and methods:In a descriptive cross-sectional study, of 81 patients referred to the oncology department of Tohid Hospital, Sanandaj, Iran, in 1 year, with recently detected gastric adenocarcinoma, serum level of CEA, CA19-9, CA125, AFP, and Beta HCG tumor markers was measured by ELISA method before chemotherapy and surgery. Patients were divided into four groups based on stage of disease (I, II, III, IV), and in terms of tumor differentiation, degrees were classified in to three groups: low, high, and intermediate. To determine the correlation of tumor markers level with the stage and grade of the disease, the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used.Results:By progression, the stages of the disease, the serum level of CA19-9, CA125, and AFP tumor markers demonstrated a significant increase. But this difference between level of HCG and CEA was not significant with the staging. There was no significant difference between the serum level of tumor markers and the grading of disease in the patients.Conclusion:Preoperative CA19-9, CA125, and AFP tumor markers measurements could be beneficial in detecting the progressed stages of the disease.
