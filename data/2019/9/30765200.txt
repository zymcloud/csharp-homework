Background:The aim of this study was to analyze the nutritional risk factors for postoperative complications following hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The preoperative nutritional status of patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection was evaluated using the scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). The perioperative variables were compared between well-nourished and malnourished patients. Regression analysis was employed to identify the risk factors for postoperative complications.Results:The overall operative mortality and morbidity of 287 patients who underwent resection for HCC were 1.7% and 44.3%, respectively. Upon admission, 96 (33.4%) study participants were malnourished, which was associated with a significantly higher PG-SGA score (P Conclusions:The PG-SGA score is an effective tool for predicting postoperative complications in patients with HCC following hepatic resection.
