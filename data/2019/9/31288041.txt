Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health burden with over 250 million cases worldwide. This complex infection can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Complete recovery is seldom achieved due to the persistence in infected hepatocytes of covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA, which is not targeted by current antiviral therapies. Routine circulating biomarkers used for clinical monitoring of patients do not accurately reflect the cccDNA pool and transcriptional activity. New biomarkers, such as serum HB core-related Ag and circulating HBV RNAs, are under development. In this review, we discuss surrogate non-invasive biomarkers for evaluating intrahepatic cccDNA abundance and transcriptional activity. We also present their relevance for improving the classification of patients with regards to their natural history and for evaluating novel compounds to assess target engagement and to define new virological endpoints.
