Background:To compare the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of Tourniquet-ALPPS (T-ALPPS) and conventional two-stage hepatectomy (TSH) in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).Methods:A retrospective study from a prospectively collected database was performed between October 2000 and July 2016. TSH was performed before September 2011, after which time T-ALPPS became the technique of choice. A propensity score matching (PSM) was performed based on a 1:1 ratio with consideration of the following variables: number and size of metastases, bilobar disease presence, and chemotherapy received.Results:Thirty-four patients received T-ALPPS; 41 patients received TSH. After PSM, 21 patients remained in each group, with 100% resectability in the T-ALPPS group and 90.5% resectability in the TSH group. The median OS for TSH was 41 months; for T-ALPPS, the median OS was 36 months (P = 0.925). The median DFS was 16 months in the TSH group; the median DFS was 9 months in the T-ALPPS group (P = 0.930). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS for TSH was 81%, 66.7%, and 23.8% vs. 76.2%, 57.1%, and 22.9% for T-ALPPS, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year DFS for TSH was 66.7%, 9.5%, and 5% vs. 44.6%, 11.1%, and 11.1% for T-ALPPS, respectively. The volume increase with T-ALPPS was superior to that with TSH (68% vs. 39%; P = 0.018). There were no differences in morbidity and mortality after stages 1 and 2.Conclusions:T-ALPPS produces a similar outcome to TSH, indicating that it could be a safe and effective alternative for curative hepatectomy for all patients.
