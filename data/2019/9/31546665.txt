Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, representing 13% of all cancers. The role of epigenetics in cancer diagnosis and prognosis is well established. MicroRNAs in particular influence numerous cancer associated processes including apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, cell-cycle controls, migration/invasion and metabolism. MiRNAs-137 and 342 are exon- and intron-embedded, respectively, acting as tumour-suppressive microRNA via hypermethylation events. Levels of miRNAs 137 and 342 have been investigated here as potential prognostic markers for colorectal cancer patients. The methylation status of miRNA-137 and miRNA-342 was evaluated using methylation-specific (MSP) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on freshly frozen tissue derived from 51 polyps, 8 tumours and 14 normal colon mucosa specimens. Methylation status of miRNA-137 and miRNA-342 was significantly higher in tumour lesions compared to normal adjacent mucosa. Surprisingly, the methylation frequency of miR-342 (76.3%) among colorectal cancer patients was significantly higher compared to miR-137 (18.6%). Furthermore, normal tissues, adjacent to the lesions (N-Cs), displayed no observable methylation for miRNA-137, whereas 27.2% of these N-Cs showed miRNA-342 hypermethylation. MiRNA-137 hypermethylation was significantly higher in male patients and miR-342 hypermethylation correlated with patient age. Methylation status of miRNA-137 and miRNA-342 has both diagnostic and prognostic value in CRC prediction and prevention.
