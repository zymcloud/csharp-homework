Background:Recently, experts proposed subclassification for BCLC B patients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficient of subclassification of patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system.Methods:Seven hundred twenty-nine consecutive hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients with BCLC stage B classification who underwent hepatectomy in the period 2006-2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were reclassified based on the new proposed subclassification of the BCLC B stage from B1 to B4. The prognosis of subclassification was tested using Kaplan-Meier statistics analysis.Results:There were 145 (19.9%), 480 (65.8%), 62 (8.5%), and 42 (5.8%) patients in B1, B2, B3, and B4, respectively. The result suggested that overall and tumor-free survival rates among the B1, B2, and B3 subclassification in the Bolondi system had significant difference (P Conclusions:The subclassification of BCLC stage B can be used in patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative intent hepatectomy. Patients in BCLC B1 and B2 subgroups should be treated more aggressively than patients in B3 and B4 subgroups. B3 and B4 groups should be merged for patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative intent hepatectomy.
