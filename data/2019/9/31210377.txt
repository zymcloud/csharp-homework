Recently, great advances have been achieved in both surgery and chemotherapy for the treatment of gastric cancer, but there is still poor prognosis for this disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of liver X receptor β (LXRβ) in chemosensitivity of gastric cancer SGC7901 cells. From 171 patients with gastric cancer, the gastric cancer and paracancerous tissues were selected to measure the expression of LXRβ and ATF4. Gastric cancer cell lines were cultured and screened to figure out the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer SGC7901 cells with the treatment of LXRβ agonist (GW3965), ATF4 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and chemotherapy drug paclitaxel. The expression of apoptosis-related gene cleaved caspase-3 was detected by Western blot analysis. First, we found that the expressions of LXRβ and ATF4 in gastric cancer tissues and cells were significantly lower than those in their paracancerous tissues and gastric mucosal epithelial cells. In addition, activation of LXRβ and paclitaxel treatment suppressed proliferation of SGC7901 cells, and the expression of ATF4 was upregulated in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, shRNA significantly inhibited the expression of ATF4 and blocked the chemosensitivity of SGC7901 cells to LXRβ activation. Our study demonstrates that the expression of LXRβ was low in gastric cancer. In addition, activation of LXRβ may inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, promote apoptosis, and increase chemosensitivity by upregulating the expression of ATF4.
