We report the case of a 22-year-old patient with acute abdominopelvic pain. The diagnosis of hypercalcemic small cell carcinoma (SCCOHT)/ovarian rhabdoid tumor has been made. Small cell carcinoma of hypercalcemic type is a rare and aggressive tumor that occurs in young women. The diagnosis of this tumor and the management must be rapid in view of its aggressiveness. Through this observation, we specify the epidemiological, diagnostic, molecular aspects and discussions about its name.
