Lymphoepithelioma-like intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (LEL-ICC) is an uncommon lesion. Less than 100 cases of hepatic LELC, including IEL-HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and IEL-ICC, have been described, and the understanding of the LELC is very limited. We report the case of a 75-year-old woman with LEL-ICC. She complained of finding a lesion located in the left lateral liver during her last check-up 2 years ago. The contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a low-density mass located in the left lateral liver with an estimated magnitude of 20Ã—16 mm. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated two T2 high-signal intensity foci in the left lateral liver, with similar size and signal manifestation in the arterial and portal venous phases. The patient underwent laparoscopic left lateral hepatectomy. The postoperative pathological and immunohistochemical examination findings allowed for the definitive diagnosis. A literature review indicated that a geriatric Asian female with a single lesion located in the liver should consider the possibility of LEL-ICC. An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection might play a crucial role in the tumorigenesis of LEL-ICC, and surgical resection was the first choice for treating LEL-ICC.
