Polycomb group (PcG) proteins have recently been identified as critical regulators in tumor initiation and development. However, the function of CBX8 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. Our study was designed to explore the biological function and clinical implication of CBX8 in HCC. We investigated the interplay between CBX8 and cell cycle through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and western blotting. Bioinformatics tools and co-immunoprecipitation were used to explore cell cycle regulation. Finally, we studied the expression and clinical significance of CBX8 in HCC through 3 independent datasets. CBX8 was upregulated in HCC and its expression correlated with cell cycle progression. CyclinD1 was downregulated by CBX8 knockdown but upregulated by CBX8 overexpression. YBX1 interacted with CBX8 and regulated the cell cycle. Moreover, targeting YBX1 with specific siRNA impaired CBX8-mediated regulation of CyclinD1. CBX8 overexpression boosted HCC cell growth, while CBX8 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation. Further, YBX1 interacted with CBX8. YBX1 knockdown compromised the proliferation of CBX8 overexpressing cells. CBX8 promotes HCC cell proliferation through YBX1 mediated cell cycle progression and is related to poor HCC prognoses. Therefore, CBX8 may serve as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.
