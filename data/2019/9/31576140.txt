Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is a common malignant cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1) has been increasingly reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression. However, limited data are available regarding the role of CTHRC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Paraffin-embedded specimens from a total of 29 patients with HCC were collected in our study. The expression of CTHRC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, Spearman analysis was performed to identify factors of correlation between CTHRC1 and clinicopathological features. Survival curves for hepatocellular carcinoma were produced using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test.Results:In this study, we confirmed that CTHRC1 is highly expressed in tissues and hepatoma cell lines. The statistical analysis revealed that the levels of CTHRC1 were significantly correlated with cirrhosis (P=0.024), tumor size (P=0.006), vascular invasion (P<0.001), TNM stage (P<0.001), and BCLC stage (P<0.001). High expression of CTHRC1 in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues is significantly associated with poor survival.Conclusion:CTHRC1 may serve as a prognostic biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.
