Background/objective:Previous studies have proposed several objective means for liver function assessment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients; however, their efficiency in predicting survival of HCC rupture is unknown. Our study aims to confirm which is a better liver function model for ruptured HCC.Methods:A total of 230 patients with HCC ruptures at our center were included. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to compare long-term survival and short-term mortality. The 90-day mortality was compared with the area under the receiver characteristic curve. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors for 90-day deaths, and the discriminant ability of the model was measured.Results:There were significant differences in predicting OS of the Child-Pugh (CP) score in all patients, the non-surgical subgroup, and the surgical subgroup (all P Conclusion:The CP or MELD rather than ALBI score should be used as a liver function classification criterion for HCC rupture.Clinical trial number:NCT03534843 (retrospectively).
