The long noncoding (lnc)RNA, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), plays a crucial role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, potential genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) in MALAT1 that affect the susceptibility and progression of HCC have rarely been explored. Three tagging SNPs, viz., rs3200401 C > T, rs619586 A > G, and rs1194338 C > A, in MALAT1 were genotyped by a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay in 394 HCC patients and 1199 healthy controls. A stratified analysis showed that younger patients (<55 years) with the MALAT1 rs619586 G allele had a decreased risk of HCC under a codominant model (AOR = 0.289, 95% CI: 0.108-0.773, p = 0.013) and dominant model (AOR = 0.286, 95% CI: 0.107-0.765, p = 0.013). Female patients and patients with a smoking habit who carried the CA + AA genotype of rs1194338 had a lower risk of developing vascular invasion (p = 0.049) and a high Child-Pugh grade (B or C) (p = 0.036), respectively. Under the dominant model, smokers with the MALAT1 rs3200401 CT + TT genotype had a higher frequency of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (p = 0.034). Moreover, the aspartate aminotransferase was higher in patients with the rs3200401 CT + TT genotype. Furthermore, analyses of clinical datasets revealed that MALAT1 expression level was gradually unregulated during HCC development from normal liver, cirrhotic liver, dysplastic liver to HCC and correlated with poor survival rates in HCC patients, especially in the hepatitis virus-infected population.
