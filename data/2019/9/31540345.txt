Seven compounds, carbazole alkaloids (heptaphylline, 7-methoxyheptaphylline, 7-methoxymukonal) and coumarins (clausarin, dentatin, nordentatin, and xanthoxyletin), were isolated from the root bark of Clausena harmandiana. Antioxidation, cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction were evaluated in vitro. Results showed that clausarin exerted the highest DPPH radical scavenging and 7-methoxymukonal had the highest ferric reducing antioxidant power. In contrary, dentatin was the least DPPH radical scavenger, and heptaphylline was the least reducing antioxidant power. The isolated compounds showed different cytotoxicity. The hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) was generally more sensitive to the isolated compounds than lung cancer (SK-LU-1), colon cancer (HCT-116), and noncancerous (Vero) cell lines, respectively. Clausarin possessed the highest cytotoxicity selectively against cancer cell lines tested. 7-Methoxymukonal and 7-methoxyheptaphylline exhibited less cytotoxicity only in HepG2 cells and were inactive in the SK-LU-1 and HCT116 cells. Despite xantoxyletin possessing low antioxidant and low cytotoxic activity, it induced the highest apoptosis percentage with the lowest necrosis percentage of HepG2 cells after 24 h. In conclusion, xantoxyletin primarily show potential anticancer activity. The root bark of C. harmandiana is a good source of bioactive compounds or the lead for the development of new pharmaceutical agent.
