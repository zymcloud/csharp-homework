Background:Metastases to the bones, lungs, and liver are common in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) but not to the brain and frontal bone (B + FB).Methods:We describe a patient with NPC with B + FB metastasis. He received two cycles of palliative chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) and then radiotherapy (60 Gy) for B + FB metastasis. A literature review of previous cases was also undertaken.Results:Follow-up 6 months after completion of chemotherapy and radiotherapy showed that our patient experienced a complete response without signs of NPC progression.Conclusions:B + FB metastases from NPC are uncommon. Our case highlights the diagnostic and treatment difficulties clinicians face when dealing with patients with uncommon sites of metastasis. Optimal adjuvant therapy followed by local radiotherapy might elicit long survival in patients with NPC with uncommon sites of metastasis.
