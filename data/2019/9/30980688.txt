Chronic hepatitis C certainly is a global health burden in children as well as in adults. Spontaneous viral clearance can occur in early childhood but is uncommon thereafter. Although the majority of cases are asymptomatic during childhood and young adulthood, without an effective treatment, children who acquire HCV via vertical transmission can develop chronic liver disease and other complications including end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in adulthood. Efforts from worldwide health organizations, the pharmaceutical industry, and clinical and research institutions have resulted in very effective interferon-free therapy with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV-infected children. In this manuscript, we will briefly review the epidemiology of HCV in children, historic treatment, current published data on DAAs in children and conclude with suggestions for management of the child with HCV in the era of DAAs.
