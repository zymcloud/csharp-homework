Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent liver cancer, characterized by a high rate of recurrence and heterogeneity. Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) may well contribute to both of these pathological properties, but the mechanism underlying their self-renewal maintenance is poorly understood. Here, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) termed HAND2-AS1 that is highly expressed in liver CSCs. Human HAND2-AS1 and its mouse ortholog lncHand2 display a high level of conservation. HAND2-AS1 is required for the self-renewal maintenance of liver CSCs to initiate HCC development. Mechanistically, HAND2-AS1 recruits the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex to the promoter of BMPR1A, thereby inducing its expression and leading to the activation of BMP signaling. Importantly, interfering with expression of HAND2-AS1 by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and BMPR1A by siRNAs has synergistic anti-tumorigenic effects on humanized HCC models. Moreover, knockout of lncHand2 or Bmpr1a in mouse hepatocytes impairs BMP signaling and suppresses the initiation of liver cancer. Our findings reveal that HAND2-AS1 promotes the self-renewal of liver CSCs and drives liver oncogenesis, offering a potential new target for HCC therapy.
