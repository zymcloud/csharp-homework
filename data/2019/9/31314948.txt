The development of immunotherapy for solid tumours has boosted interest in the contexture of tumour immune microenvironment (TIME). Several lines of evidence indicate that the interplay between tumour cells and TIME components is a key factor for the evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and for the likelihood of response to immunotherapeutics. The availability of high-resolution methods will be instrumental for a better definition of the complexity and diversity of TIME with the aim of predicting disease outcome, treatment response and possibly new therapeutic targets. Here, we review current knowledge about the immunological mechanisms involved in shaping the clinical course of HCC. Effector cells, regulatory cells and soluble mediators are discussed for their role defining TIME and as targets for immune modulation, together with possible immune signatures for optimization of immunotherapeutic strategies.
