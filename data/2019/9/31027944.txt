Background:Management of recurrent hepatocellular cancer (HCC) after liver resection is challenging, with unsatisfactory long-term patient outcomes. Liver re-resection, in theory, is a good treatment option. We therefore studied prognosis and risk factors of patients who undergo re-hepatectomy.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 103 patients who underwent re-hepatectomy.Results:The re-resection postoperative complication rate was 31.1% (32/103). Patients with gross vascular invasion (GVI), cirrhosis, or hepatitis B (HBV) infections not treated with antiviral therapy had higher morbidity than patients without these diseases (per chi-square tests). In bivariate regression analysis, cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR]: 10.308, P = 0.031) and HBV not treated with antiviral therapy (OR: 3.982, P = 0.011) were associated with immediate postoperative morbidity. Median overall survival (OS) after re-resection was 65.0 months (range: 2.1-119.3 months); cumulative OS rates were 1-year: 92.1%, 2-year: 78.2%, and 5-year: 54.4%. Independent risk factors for worse survival were serum AFP level > 20 ng/mL at first resection, portal hypertension (PH) and GVI at recurrence. In the non-PH group, microvascular invasion (micro-VI), GVI and pTNM III-IV disease were associated with poor prognosis; patients with pTNM I-II disease had significantly less micro-VI and GVI than did patients with advanced disease.Conclusion:Repeat hepatectomy has favorable long-term outcomes. Cirrhosis and HBV not treated with antiviral therapy were associated with immediate postoperative morbidity. Serum AFP > 20 ng/mL at first resection, PH, and GVI at recurrence are independent prognostic factors. For patients without PH, TNM staging can predict prognosis.
