Increasing studies provide evidence to support that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initiation and progression. However, whether miR-1307-3p is aberrantly expressed in HCC and affects malignant behaviors of cancer cells remain unknown. In this study, we found that miR-1307-3p expression was obviously up-regulated in HCC compared to adjacent nontumor tissues. Moreover, miR-1307-3p expression was prominently higher in HCC cells compared with the normal hepatic cell line LO2. Patients with venous infiltration, tumor size â‰¥5 cm and advanced tumor stages (III + IV) had significant higher levels of miR-1307-3p in HCC tissues. Notably, the high level of miR-1307-3p predicted poor clinical outcomes of HCC patients. Functionally, miR-1307-3p knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of MHCC97H and HCCLM3 cells, and suppressed the in vivo growth and metastasis of HCCLM3 cells. Conversely, overexpression of miR-1307-3p facilitated Hep3B cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Mechanistically, DAB2 interacting protein (DAB2IP) was screened as a direct target of miR-1307-3p. The expression of DAB2IP mRNA was down-regulated and inversely correlated with miR-1307-3p level in HCC tissues. miR-1307-3p knockdown increased the level of DAB2IP in HCC cells. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed the direct interaction between miR-1307-3p and 3'UTR of DAB2IP. Importantly, DAB2IP overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCCLM3 cells. DAB2IP knockdown rescued miR-1307-3p silencing-attenuated HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-1307-3p plays a driving role in HCC progression by targeting DAB2IP. Our study may provide new therapeutic targets for HCC treatment.
