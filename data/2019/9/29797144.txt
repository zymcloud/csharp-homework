Background and aim of work:Pancreatic cancer is the deadliest of the 21 most common cancers, largely because it is often identified at a late stage, we aimed to determine the control rates, and PFS for patients who received docetaxel-oxaliplatin regimen as a 2nd line therapy.Patients and methods:Twenty-five patients with advanced cancer pancreas progressed or failed on 1st line treatments and justified the inclusion criteria were eligible to receive Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 over 1h iv infusion on day 1, Oxaliplatin 80 mg/m2 over 2 h iv infusion on day 2, the cycle was repeated every 3 weeks for 6-8 cycles unless disease progression or severe toxicity appeared.Results:No patients achieved complete response (CR), and the control rate (control rate = partial response (PR = 6/25, 24%) + stable disease (SD = 9/25, 36%) was 60% while disease progression (DP) was demonstrated in (10/25) 40% of patients, the median PFS was 7 Â± 0.777 ms (95% confidence interval: 5.467-8.524 ms), grade 3 neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea, and vomiting were developed in 12%, 8%, 12% and 8% of patients respectively.Conclusions:Docetaxel-oxaliplatin regimen was an active regimen in advanced cancer pancreas based on our encouraging results without occurrence of grade four toxicities.
