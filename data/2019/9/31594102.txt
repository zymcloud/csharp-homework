Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the common causes for chronic liver diseases, which progress gradually from nonalcoholic type simple fatty liver disease to hepatitis, cirrhosis and even liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Sarcopenia is a progressive disease characterized by reduced skeletal muscle mass and function in association to metabolic dysfunctions. Recent studies have shown that the occurrence and development of NAFLD and sarcopenia are related, and there is a common base for the pathogenesis between the two, which may promote each other for mutual risk factors. This article reviews the current research progress of this field in order to clinically further understand the pathogenesis and intrinsic links between the two to look for appropriate interventions.
