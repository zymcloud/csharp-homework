Background:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely used for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to investigate incidence and risk factors of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after TACE in patients with HCC.Methods:In this single-center retrospective study, we examined 461 consecutive TACE sessions in 260 patients between January 2003 and October 2015. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine levels by ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or ≥ 25% from baseline within 72 h after TACE. We calculated incidence rate of CIN and tried to identify its risk factors by logistic regression analysis.Results:Twenty-one cases of CIN (5%) were observed in 461 TACE sessions. One patient required subsequent hemodialysis transiently. In univariate analysis, tumor size > 5 cm [odds ratio (OR) 5.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.34-14.14, p 5 cm (OR 7.81, 95% CI 2.99-20.46, p Conclusions:In this study, HCC tumor size and lower serum albumin level were independent predictors of CIN after TACE.
