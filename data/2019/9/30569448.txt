It is widely accepted that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a risk factor for increased severity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) liver disease. However, owing to better efficacy and safety of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and increased access to HCV therapy, whether this condition remains true is still unknown. Overall, 1,253 HCV mono-infected patients and 175 HIV/HCV co-infected patients with cirrhosis, included in two prospective French national cohorts (ANRS CO12 CirVir and CO13 HEPAVIH), were studied. Cirrhosis was compensated (Child-Pugh A), without past history of complication, and assessed on liver biopsy. Incidences of liver decompensation (LD), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and death according to HIV status were calculated by a Fine-Gray model adjusted for age. Propensity score matching was also performed to minimize confounding by baseline characteristics. At baseline, HIV/HCV patients were younger (47.5 vs. 56.0 years; P
