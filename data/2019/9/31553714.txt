BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a commonly occurring liver malignancy. Its prognosis remains unsatisfactory. Accumulating evidence has revealed that exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) act as biomarkers and play crucial roles in the advancement of HCC. The current study explored the biological role and fundamental mechanism of exosomal miR-744 in HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS The serum exosomes of HCC patients were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation. MiR-744 expression in HCC tissues, cell lines and serum exosomes were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay were conducted to show the impacts of miR-744 or exosomal miR-744 on proliferation and sorafenib resistance in HepG2 cells. The target of miR-744 was ascertained by regulating the level of miR-744 in HepG2 cells. RESULTS MiR-744 is downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines as well as in exosomes derived from patient serum and HepG2 cells. Additionally, downregulated miR-744 promotes HepG2 cell proliferation and inhibits the chemosensitivity of HepG2 cells to sorafenib. PAX2 was identified as the functional target of miR-744. Interestingly, miR-744 is decreased in exosomes derived from sorafenib-resistant HepG2 cells. Furthermore, when treated with the miR-744-enriched exosomes, the proliferation of HepG2 cells was significantly suppressed, and the sorafenib resistance was reduced. CONCLUSIONS MiR-744 has an imperative role in the propagation and chemoresistance of HCC. Serum exosomal miR-744 might act as a biomarker of HCC, and exosomal miR-744 might offer an innovative strategy for HCC treatment.
