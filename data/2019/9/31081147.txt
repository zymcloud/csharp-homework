Objective:To use gene chip technology to study the effects of evodiamine (EVO) on the gene expression profile of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) CAL-27 cell line, for the purpose of analyzing the mechanisms underlying the effects of EVO on gene expression and functional regulation of TSCC cells at the gene level.Method:Differentially expressed genes in CAL-27 cells treated with EVO were detected using gene chip technology and analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis.Results:Microarray results showed that there were 1243 differentially expressed genes following treatment with CAL-27 cells; 684 genes were upregulated and 559 were downregulated. Classical pathway analysis revealed a total of 89 signal transduction pathways with upregulated gene set enrichment, including lipopolysaccharide/interleukin (IL)-1-mediated inhibition of retinoid X receptor (RXR) function, agrin interactions at neuromuscular junctions, cholecystokinin/gastrin-mediated signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, and IL-6 signaling. A total of 39 signal transduction pathways were enriched for the downregulated genes, including interferon signals, liver X receptor/RXR activation signals, and RhoGDI signals. In the disease and function analysis, the upregulated genes were enriched in viral infection, RNA virus replication, viral replication, cancer cell invasion, cell invasion, and other related functions, while downregulated genes were enriched in neuromuscular diseases, and leukocyte differentiation, antiviral response, connective tissue cell death and other functions.Conclusions:Gene chip analysis offers an effective means of screening differential gene expression between EVO-treated TSCCs and controls, thus providing a sound basis for further research.
