Purpose:To determine the consistency of major hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) features between CT and MRI based on Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2018 and to investigate the additional value on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.Materials and methods:Patients who underwent dynamic CT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI within 1 month were investigated. Two radiologists evaluated the presence of major HCC features and categorized observations using LI-RADS v2018 algorithm. In addition, each observation was recorded as hyper-, iso-, or hypo-intensity on hepatobiliary-phase (HBP) images.Results:Sixty-one patients with 110 observations were identified. Among 88 observations classified as LR-3, 4 or 5, arterial phase hyper-enhancement and washout appearance showed higher frequencies on CT than on MRI (75.0% vs. 58.0%, P
