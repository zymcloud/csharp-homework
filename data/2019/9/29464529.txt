Purpose:The effect of adjuvant treatment on those undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for periampullary carcinomas (PAC) is not well studied. Most studies employed chemoradiation as the adjuvant modality. We aimed to analyse clinicopathological differences between types of PACs, the prognostic factors and the role of adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy in the majority).Methods:Patients with PAC who underwent PD from Jan 2011 to Dec 2015 were retrospectively analysed.Results:Ninety-five patients with PAC underwent PD in the study period. Ampullary carcinoma (AC) was the most common. Pancreatic carcinomas (PC) were larger. AC had lower T stage, perineural invasion (PNI) and R1 resections. Median overall survival (OS) was 32.7 months. On multivariate analysis, lymph node ratio (LNR) ≥ 0.2 and advanced T stage adversely affected the OS. Fifty-seven (66.3%) patients received adjuvant treatment, of which 50 had chemotherapy alone. Adjuvant treatment resulted in better OS in patients with T stage ≥ 3, lymph node involvement, LNR ≥ 0.2, lymphovascular invasion, PNI, tumour size > 2 cm, higher grade and distal cholangiocarcinoma.Conclusion:In patients of PAC undergoing PD, AC had favourable clinicopathological profile. LNR ≥ 0.2 and advanced T stage adversely affected OS. Adjuvant treatment resulted in significantly better OS in patients with high-risk features.
