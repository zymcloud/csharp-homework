Background and aims:The impact of biliary invasion on recurrence and survival, after resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases, is not well known as publications are limited to small patient series. The aim was to investigate if biliary invasion in liver resected patients associated with liver relapses and recurrence-free survival. Secondary endpoints included association with other prognostic factors, disease-free survival and overall survival.Materials and methods:All patients with histologically verified biliary invasion (n = 31, 9%) were identified among 344 patients with liver resection between January 2009 and March 2015. Controls (n = 78) were selected from the same time period and matched for, among others, size and number of colorectal cancer liver metastasis.Results:Median liver recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with biliary invasion than in controls (15.3 months versus not reached; p = 0.031) and more relapses were noted in the liver (61.3% versus 33.3%; p = 0.010), respectively. In univariate analyses for liver recurrence-free survival, biliary invasion was the only significant prognostic factor; p = 0.034. There were no statistical differences in disease-free and overall survival between the groups.Conclusion:Biliary invasion was associated with higher liver recurrence rates and shorter liver recurrence-free survival in patients with resected colorectal cancer liver metastasis.
