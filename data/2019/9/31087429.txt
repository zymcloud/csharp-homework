Hepatocellular carcinoma is considered one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies worldwide. Chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents showed a low response rate with possible toxic effects. Recently, some emphases have been placed on the anticancer properties of bovine whey protein and its components, especially lactoferrin. The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the antihepatocarcinogenic activity of bovine whey protein concentrate (WPC, 300 and 600 mg/kg body weight) and lactoferrin (30 and 60 mg/kg body weight), orally and daily for 14 weeks, in the mice model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. The results showed that both WPC and lactoferrin (in a dose-dependent manner) alleviated significantly (P
