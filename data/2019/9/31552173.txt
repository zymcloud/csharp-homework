Objectives: This study compared the diagnostic ability of image-based parameters with texture parameters in the differentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic lymphoma (HL) by positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT). Methods: Patients with pathological diagnosis of HCC and HL were included in this study. Image-based and texture parameters were obtained by manual drawing of region of interest. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to test the diagnostic capacity of each parameter. Binary logistic regression was used to transform the most discriminative image-based parameters, texture parameters, and the combination of these parameters into three regression models. ROC was used to test the diagnostic capacity of these models. Result: Ninety-nine patients diagnosed with HCC (n = 76) and HL (n = 23, 10 primary HL, 13 secondary HL) by histological examination were included in this study (From 2011 to 2018, West China hospital). According to the AUC and p-value, 2 image-based parameters and five texture parameters were selected. The diagnostic ability of texture-based model was better than that of image-based model, and after combination of those two groups of parameters the diagnostic capacity improved. Conclusion: Texture parameters can differentiate HCC from HL quantitatively and improve the diagnostic ability of image-based parameters.
