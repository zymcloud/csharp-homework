Regorafenib is a sorafenib-derived chemotherapy drug belonging to the multikinase inhibitor family. This agent effectively targets a wide range of tyrosine kinases involved in cancer biology, such as those implicated in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor microenvironment control. The beneficial effects of regorafenib in clinical trials of patients who suffer from advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC) or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) refractory to standard treatments led to regorafenib monotherapy approval as a second-line treatment for advanced HCC and as a third-line treatment for advanced CRC and GISTs. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed over the last decade to reveal the molecular mechanisms of the favorable actions exerted by regorafenib in patients. Given the hypothetical loss of sensitivity to regorafenib in tumor cells, preclinical research is also searching for novel therapeutic approaches consisting of co-administration of this drug plus other agents as a strategy to improve regorafenib effectiveness. This review summarizes the anti-tumor effects of regorafenib in single or combined treatment in preclinical models of HCC, CRC and GISTs and discusses both the global and molecular effects that account for its anti-cancer properties in the clinical setting.
