Background:The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of some imaging findings in predicting microvascular invasion (MVI) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence risk after liver transplantation.Method:This retrospective study included 123 patients with histopathologically proven HCC at explant. All HCCs were classified as MVI positive (group I) or negative (group II) based on histopathological findings. In each group, multifocality, largest tumor size, bulging (tumor causing liver capsule expansion), beak sign (the acute angle between the tumor and liver parenchyma), and diffusion restriction on diffusion weighted images (DWI) were evaluated. These findings were compared between the groups by Student's t test. The relation between the parameters and MVI was analyzed by using the Spearman's correlation test.Results:Of the total patients, 30.1% had MVI (group I) and 69.9% (group II) did not have MVI. Presence of beak sign (P â‰¤ .005), bulging sign (P = .002), and diffusion restriction (P = .045) were significantly more frequent in group I than group II. The beak sign, bulging sign, and diffusion restriction were correlated with presence of MVI. Largest tumor size and multifocality were higher in group I than group II, but the differences were not statistically significant.Conclusion:Radiologists and transplant surgeons should be aware of some clue imaging findings, especially beak and bulging signs because these findings may predict the presence of MVI in HCC. These patients might benefit from histologic confirmation of the tumor characteristics through biopsy and subsequent bridging treatment options before liver transplantation to reduce the risk of recurrence.
