Background:Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of chemotherapy could be used in patients with liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to fight against chemoresistance. We previously reported the efficacy of raltitrexed plus oxaliplatin (HAI) in a retrospective series. We performed a randomized two-stage phase-II study to evaluate the efficacy of HAI of the combination of raltitrexed and oxaliplatin in refractory mCRC with only liver metastases in comparison with standard of care.Patients and methods:Eligible patients had unresectable mCRC and were refractory or intolerant to fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, anti-VEGF therapy, and anti-EGFR therapy (for tumors with wild-type KRAS). Patients were randomized between HAI raltitrexed (3 mg/m2 over 1 h) followed by oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 over 2 h) every 3 weeks and standard of care in a 2:1 ratio. A total of 57 patients (38 in the experimental arm and 19 in the standard of care arm) were to be included. The main objective was to demonstrate 6-month PFS of 45% by intention-to-treat analysis in the experimental arm, compared to theoretical PFS of 20%, with a unilateral alpha risk of 5% and beta risk of 10%.Results:After inclusion of 27 patients, the trial was terminated due to insufficient accrual. In the experimental arm, 11 and 4 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 toxicities, respectively. The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia, liver toxicity, and abdominal pain. Median progression-free survival was 6.7 months (95% Confidence Interval; 3.9-7.2) in the HAI group and 2.2 months (95% CI 1.2-4.3) with standard of care [HR 0.32 (95% CI 0.14-0.76), p = 0.01]. Median overall survival did not differ between the two groups, at 11.2 months (95% CI 4.8-17.6) for the HAI group and 11.9 months (95% CI 2.8-14.3) for standard of care [HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.36-2.04), p = 0.73].Conclusion:Although stopped prematurely, this randomized trial provides evidence for the benefit and safety of HAI of a combination of raltitrexed and oxaliplatin in liver-only mCRC with chemoresistant disease.
