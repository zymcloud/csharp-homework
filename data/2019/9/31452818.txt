Increasing evidence has demonstrated that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can be utilized as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of cancer, as well as a prognostic tool for the management of the disease. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the predictive ability of miRNA (miR)-155, miR-96 and miR-99a for the diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tissues were collected from 30 patients with HCC and their matched adjacent normal liver tissues, as well as from serum samples from 30 patients with HCC and 30 healthy controls. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to measure the expression levels of miR-155, miR-96 and miR-99a. The expression levels of miR-155 and miR-96 were upregulated in the tissues and serum of patients with HCC, whereas miR-99a expression levels were decreased. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis revealed that circulating miR-155, miR-96, miR-99a and a combination of these three miRNAs could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for HCC with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.84, 0.824, 0.799 and 0.931, respectively. Serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) was detected using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer. The addition of AFP with the combination of these three miRNAs offered a higher accuracy of HCC diagnosis (AUC, 0.979; sensitivity, 90.0%; specificity, 100.0%). In addition, elevated expression levels of miR-155 and miR-96 were associated with poor survival time of patients with HCC. The panel of miR-155, miR-96, miR-99a and AFP had a higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HCC when compared with a single marker. Furthermore, the present data suggested that miR-155 and miR-96 may be potential prognostic markers for the clinical management of patients with HCC.
