Objective:To investigate the value of combined tests of serum Golgi protein-73, alpha-fetoprotein- L3 and Tat-interacting protein-30 in the diagnosis of hepatitis B virus related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The cross-sectional study was conducted at Yuebei People's Hospital, Guangdong, China, from January to October 2017, and comprised hepatitis B patients and healthy controls. Serum Golgi protein-73, alpha-fetoprotein-L3 and Tat-interacting protein-30 levels in both groups were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Alpha-fetoprotein-L3 was separated and quantified by electrochemiluminescence immunoas says and the percentage of alpha-fetoprotein-L3 to alphafetoprotein was calculated.Results:Of the 721 subjects, 525(%) were patients and 196(%) were healthy controls. Among the patients, 271(%) had chronic hepatitis B, 161(%) had liver cirrhosis and 93(%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum Golgi protein-73, alpha-fetoprotein-L3 and Tat-interacting protein-30 levels were significantly different in the hepatocellular carcinoma patients compared to controls, and those with chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis (pConclusions:Combined detection of Golgi protein-73, alpha fetoprotein-L3 and Tat-interacting protein was found to have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy.
