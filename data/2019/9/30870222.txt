Background:Liver transplantation (LT) is the treatment of choice for most end-stage liver diseases. This treatment increases survival rates and improves quality of life. Because of the shortage of organ donors, as opposed to waiting patients, the need to optimize the matching of donors to recipients for maximum utility is crucial.Aim:The aim of this study was to examine a predictive model based on the combination of donor and recipient risk factors using the liver Donor Risk Index (DRI) and recipient Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) to predict patients' survival following LT.Patients and methods:The charts of 289 adult primary LT patients, who had undergone transplantation in Israel between 2010 and 2015, were studied retrospectively using prospectively gathered data.Results:Two variables, DRI and MELD, were found to significantly affect post-transplant patient survival. DRI negatively affected survival in a continuous fashion, whereas MELD had a significantly negative effect only at MELD more than 30. Both female sex and the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma were associated with increased patient survival.Conclusion:According to our findings, the model described here is a novel prediction tool for the success of orthotopic LT and can thus be considered in liver allocation.
