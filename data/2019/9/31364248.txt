Although the mortality rate due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been gradually decreasing in Japan, approximately 30 000 people died of HCC in 2016. In 2007, the dominant etiology was persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which accounted for 65% of total HCC deaths, and 15% of cases were due to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In managing chronic HBV and HCV infection, it is critically important to know the exact number of infected individuals in a particular country, which then assists in evaluating medical and financial needs in the foreseeable future. Therefore, from an epidemiological perspective, we estimated the numbers of HBV and HCV carriers in four categories: (i) undiagnosed carriers; (ii) carriers who were already hospitalized as patients or were receiving outpatient medical attention; (iii) diagnosed carriers who had not consulted any medical facility, or had discontinued consultation; and (iv) newly infected carriers. From these estimates we determined the current HBV and HCV burden and then reviewed the existing countermeasures for their prevention and control in Japan. While continuing the surveillance on the dynamics of hepatitis virus infections linked with preventive measures against hepatitis virus infection, it is crucially important to promote appropriate measures for each of the four groups of hepatitis virus carriers in society.
