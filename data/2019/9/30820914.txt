Objective:The outcomes of surgically treating pulmonary metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy to assess their survival outcome and prognostic factors.Methods:This retrospective single-center study included 30 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma between January 1980 and December 2016 at the National Cancer Center Hospital.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates after pulmonary metastasectomy were 86.7%, 46.2%, and 33.6%, respectively (median survival time: 25.0 months). The univariate prognostic factors were viral hepatitis (P = 0.019), number of pulmonary metastases (P = 0.002), and other site recurrence before metastasectomy (P = 0.048). Multivariate analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model revealed viral hepatitis (hazard ratio: 3.611, 95% confidence interval: 1.226-10.64; P = 0.02) and â‰¥ 2 pulmonary metastases (hazard ratio: 4.031, 95% confidence interval: 1.594-10.19; P = 0.003) to be independent prognostic factors. Subgroup analyses of the three risk factors (viral hepatitis, number of pulmonary metastases, and other site recurrence before metastasectomy) revealed that the median survival times after pulmonary metastasectomy were 66.0 and 15.5 months for patients with 0-1 risk factors and those with 2-3 risk factors, respectively (P Conclusions:For patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma, median survival time was 25.0 months and decreased with three risk factors which included viral hepatitis, multiple number of pulmonary metastases, and the presence of other site recurrence before metastasectomy.
