This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of three-dimensional (3D)-navigated multiprobe radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with intraprocedural image fusion for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by histopathological examination. From 2009 to 2018, 97 patients (84 men, 13 women; median age, 60 years; range, 1-71) were transplanted after bridging therapy of 195 HCCs by stereotactic RFA (SRFA). The median interval between the first SRFA and transplantation was 6.8 months (range, 0-71). The rate of residual vital tissue (RVT) could be assessed in 188 of 195 lesions in 96 of 97 patients by histological examination of the explanted livers using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Tdt-mediated UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) stains. Histopathological results were compared with the findings of the last computed tomography (CT) imaging before liver transplantation (LT). Median number and size of treated tumors were 1 (range, 1-8) and 2.5 cm (range, 1-8). Complete radiological response was achieved in 186 of 188 nodules (98.9%) and 94 of 96 patients (97.9%) and complete pathological response in the explanted liver specimen in 183 of 188 nodules (97.3%) and 91 of 96 patients (94.8%), respectively. In lesions â‰¥3 cm, complete tumor cell death was achieved in 50 of 52 nodules (96.2%). Residual tumor did not correlate with tumor size (P = 0.5). Conclusion: Multiprobe SRFA with intraprocedural image fusion represents an efficient, minimally invasive therapy for HCC, even with tumor sizes larger than 3 cm, and without the need of a combination with additional treatments. The results seem to justify the additional efforts related to the stereotactic approach.
