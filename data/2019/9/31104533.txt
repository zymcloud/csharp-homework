Background: Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is used to treat unresectable colorectal cancer with liver metastases (CRCLM). This study aimed to assess survival after TARE and to identify potential prognostic factors in this patient population. Methods: Patients with unresectable and chemorefractory CRCLM treated with TARE at our institution between February 2006 and September 2015 were included in the study. Survival rate, hepatic tumor response, and potential prognostic factors were analyzed. Results: In the 43 study patients, the mean follow-up was 15.0 ± 14.2 months, with a median survival of 13.0 months and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates of 52.1%, 24.9%, 21.4%, 21.4%, and 7.1%, respectively. The mean activity of yttrium-90 administered was 1.55 ± 0.28 GBq for the disease-controlled group and 1.19 ± 0.27 GBq for the progressive disease group (p= 0.031). Survival was correlated with Child-Pugh class (p< 0.001), hepatic tumor response (p= 0.001), and baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (p= 0.013). Conclusion: Child-Pugh class B, low degree of hepatic tumor response, and normal baseline CEA levels are prognostic factors for poorer survival after TARE in patients with unresectable and chemorefractory CRCLM. Hepatic tumor response is related to radiation activity delivered to the liver.
