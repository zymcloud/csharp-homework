Primary liver cancer is a major public health challenge that ranks as the third most common cause of cancer worldwide despite therapeutic improvement. Reovirus has been emerging as a potential anti-cancer agent and is undergoing multiple clinical trials, and it is reported that reovirus can preferentially cause the cell death of a variety of cancers in a manner of apoptosis. As few studies have reported the efficacy of oncolytic activity and safety profile of avian reovirus, in our study, LDH assay, MTT assay, DAPI staining, and flow cytometry assay were performed to demonstrate the oncolytic effects of avian reovirus against the HepG2 cells, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and animal experiments were conducted to investigate the dynamic distribution of avian reovirus in infected mice and then illustrate the safety and tissue tropism of avian reovirus. LDH assay, DAPI staining, and flow cytometry assay confirmed the efficacy of the oncotherapeutic effects of avian reovirus, and MTT assay has indicated that avian reovirus suppressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells and decreased their viability significantly. qRT-PCR revealed the dynamic distribution of avian reovirus in infected mice that avian reovirus might replicate better and have more powerful oncolytic activity in liver, kidney, and spleen tissues. Furthermore, histopathological examination clearly supported that avian reovirus appeared non-pathogenic to the normal host, so our study may provide the new insights and rationale for the new strategy of removing liver cancer.Impact statement:We demonstrated the efficacy of oncolytic activity of avian reovirus (ARV) by LDH assay, MTT assay, DAPI staining, and flow cytometry assay, and also investigated the dynamic distribution of ARV in infected mice and then illustrated the safety and tissue tropism of ARV by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and animal experiments. Collectively, our study may provide the new insights and rationale for the new strategy of removing liver cancer.
