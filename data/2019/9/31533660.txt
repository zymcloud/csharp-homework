Background:To investigate the implications of prophylactic intraoperative Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) with D2 radical gastrectomy for locally advanced Gastric Cancer (AGC) in a randomized case control study.Method:Eighty consecutive patients with locally AGC were randomly separated into 2 groups: HIPEC group (Curative Resection + intraoperative HIPEC with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 at 42.0 ± 1.0 °C for 60 min) and Control group (Curative Resection only). Intraoperative and post-operative events, clinical recovery, morbidity and the disease-free survival (DFS) rates were closely monitored.Results:Among the 40 HIPEC group patients, the highest intracranial temperature recorded during the procedure was 38.2 °C but the patient made an eventless recovery. Mild renal dysfunction, hyperbilirubinemia and mild liver dysfunction were recorded in the HIPEC group but their incidences were found to be statistically insignificant when compared with the control group (P > 0.05). The initial post-operative analysis revealed shorter post-operative stay for in the HIPEC group but further analysis revealed that it was related to the incidence of postoperative complication. During a median follow-up time of 41 months, there were 9/39 and 15/38 cases of disease progression in HIPEC and Control groups respectively, with a more favorable 3-year DFS (76.9% vs 60.5%) and a lower peritoneal recurrence rate (5% vs 30%) in the HIPEC group.Conclusion:Prophylactic HIPEC with radical D2 Gastrectomy is safe and shows favorable survival and peritoneal recurrence rates for AGC with acceptable morbidity. Nevertheless, more structured multi-centered RCT should be carried out for more substantial evidence.
