Background:Many patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asian countries seek adjuvant therapy with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). This study aims to explore the benefits of TCM therapy in the long-term survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in China.Patients and methods:In total, 3483 patients with HCC admitted to the Beijing Ditan Hospital of Capital Medical University were enrolled in this study. We used 1:1 frequency matching by sex, age, diagnosis time, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging, and type of treatments to compare the TCM users (n = 526) and non-TCM users (n = 526). A Cox multivariate regression model was employed to evaluate the effects of TCM therapy on the HR value and Kaplan-Meier survival curve for mortality risk in HCC patients. A log-rank test was performed to analyze the effect of TCM therapy on the survival time of HCC patients.Results:The Cox multivariate analysis indicated that TCM therapy was an independent protective factor for 5-year survival in patients with HCC (adjusted HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.40-0.52, p Conclusion:Using traditional Chinese medications as adjuvant therapy can probably prolong median survival time and improve the overall survival among patients with HCC. Further scientific studies and clinical trials are needed to examine the efficiency and safety.
