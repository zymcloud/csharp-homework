Introduction:Patients with a single small Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) may be definitively treated by Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with a very low rate of peri-operative morbidity. However, results are still controversial comparing RFA to Liver Resection (LR).Methods:All consecutive patients treated by RFA or LR for a single untreated small HCC on liver cirrhosis between January 2006-December 2016 were enrolled. Patients were matched 1:1 basing on: age, MELD-score, platelet count, nodule's diameter, HCV status, Î±-fetoprotein level, and Albumin-Bilirubin score. First analysis compered LR to RFA. Second analysis compared Laparoscopic LR (LLR) to RFA.Results:Of 484 patients with single small HCC, 91 patients were selected for each group after a 1:1 propensity score matching (PS-M). The 5-years OS was 70% and 60% respectively for LR and RFA group (P = 0.666). The 5-year RFS was 36% and 21% respectively for LR and RFA group (P Conclusions:LLR confers similar peri-operative complications rate compared to RFA. LLR should be considered as a first-line approach for the treatment of a single small HCC as it combines the effectiveness of open LR and the safety profile of RFA.
