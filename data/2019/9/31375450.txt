Purpose:To compare outcomes of unresectable hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CC) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after locoregional therapy (LRT).Materials and methods:Consecutive patients with histologically confirmed HCC-CC or HCC treated with LRT between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Ten patients (8 men; median age, 60 y) with 12 HCC-CCs (mean diameter, 4.2 cm ± 1.9; mean number, 3.7 ± 3.3) treated with chemoembolization (n = 6), yttrium-90 radioembolization (n = 2), RF ablation (n = 1), or chemoembolization/RF ablation (n = 1) were compared with 124 patients (92 men; median age, 59 y) with 134 HCCs (mean diameter, 4.8 cm ± 4.0; mean number, 2.6 ± 2.2) treated with chemoembolization (n = 51), yttrium-90 radioembolization (n = 17), RF ablation (n = 41), or chemoembolization/RF ablation (n = 15). Propensity score-matched analysis with conditional logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, LRT modality, tumor-specific features, and Child-Pugh class. Tumor-volume doubling time (TVDT) before LRT and objective response rates were compared by Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher exact test; progression-free survival (PFS) and transplant-free survival (TFS) were compared by Cox proportional hazards model.Results:On univariate analysis, HCC-CC was associated with lower median TVDT (2.4 months vs 5.2 months, P = .03), objective response (30% vs 71%, P = .01), and median PFS (2.4 months vs 7.4 months, HR 4.3, 95% CI 2.2-8.4, P Conclusions:HCC-CC was associated with reduced PFS and greater distant progression after LRT compared with HCC, indicating a need for adjunctive treatment strategies to improve outcomes.
