Background:To prospectively determine whether the use of a multiple arterial phase imaging (DISCO) improve the capturing rate of late arterial phase with less motion artifact than single arterial phase obtained with gadoxetate acid disodium.Materials and methods:From 06/2017 to 10/2018, prospectively acquired data of 132 patients who underwent either single (n = 67) or multiple arterial phase (n = 65) gadoxetate acid-enhanced MR imaging were analyzed. Two readers independently assessed arterial phase timing and the degree of motion artifact using a five-point scale. The kappa test was used to determine the agreement between the two readers, χ2 or fisher exact test were used for the categorical variables and Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test were used for the comparison of the motion artifacts.Results:Good to perfect inter-observer agreement was obtained for the arterial phase timing and degree of motion artifact (all kappa value >0.70). Optimal timing of arterial phase was observed in 95.4% (62/65) of multiple arterial phase compared with 73.1% (49/67) of single arterial phase (χ2 = 12.209, p < 0.001). Motion artifact score of the late arterial phase images measured using single arterial phase acquisition (3.22 ± 0.68) was significantly higher than the multiple arterial phase (2.42 ± 0.74) group (t = 5.921, p < 0.001). For the multiple arterial phase comparison, motion artifact score of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th phases were also significant reduced compared with 1st, 5th and 6th phases (all p < 0.05).Conclusion:The use of multiple arterial phase acquisition with gadoxetate acid disodium can improve the capturing rate of well-timed late arterial phase with less motion artifact.
