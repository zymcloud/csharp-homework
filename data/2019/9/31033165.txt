Aim:This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of candidates for second-line therapy, including regorafenib and ramucirumab, for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after sorafenib treatment.Methods:Of 122 patients, 103 were radiologically confirmed as progressive disease (PD) (sorafenib-refractory group), and 19 discontinued sorafenib therapy due to adverse events prior to radiologic PD (sorafenib-intolerant group). Patients in the sorafenib-refractory group were divided into two subgroups each, according to their eligibility for second-line treatment (second-line-in and -out group), regorafenib (RESORCE-in and -out group), or ramucirumab (REACH-2-in and -out group).Results:Patients included in the non-candidate group were those with Î±-fetoprotein level Conclusions:Not all patients refractory to sorafenib were candidates for second-line therapy. A Child-Pugh score of A5 at sorafenib initiation was an important and favorable factor related to eligibility for second-line therapy and good outcomes.
