Objective: To explore the risk factors in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with early recurrence after ablation and to establish predictive model. Methods: A total of 81 patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent ablation from January 2016 to December 2016 were included in Beijing Youan Hospital, including 66 males and 15 females. Standard medical records were collected, which were summarized as follows: demographic data, liver function, the number and size of tumors and the modality of ablation. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify the independent risk factors.The ROC curve was used to determine prognostic value. Cox proportional hazards model was used to establish predictive model, and the scores of risk factors were assigned according to HR value. Patients were divided into high-risk group and low-risk group in accordance with scores.The analysis of early recurrence rate was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Tumor number, fibrinogen (Fib) and platelet-lymphocyte rate (PLR) were independently correlated with recurrence-free survival (RFS). The AUCs of Fib, PLR and Fib-PLR were 72.9%, 71.5% and 81.8%. The recurrence rates of the low-risk group were 4.9%,7.3% and 29.3% at 6 months,12 months and 24 months while 14.6%,43.9% and 78.1% in high-risk group. Two groups revealed statistically significant differences (all P<0.05). Conclusion: Tumor number, Fib, and PLR may be used as a set of predictive indicator of early recurrence in HBV-associated HCC patients after ablation.
