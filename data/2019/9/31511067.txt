Background:Among adipose-derived factors, adipocytokines play roles as hormones and signaling mediators for apoptotic pathway. Among of them, vaspin, regulates the metabolism of adipose tissue itself as an endocrine organ, and stimulates adipocytes to maturation, differentiation, etc. Damaged adipocytes, present in obesity and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) respond with over-production of inflammatory cytokines. Such pro-inflammatory stimulation remains under adipokine control. Pro-inflammatory pathways are connected to oxidative stress and apoptosis, reported as co-existing with an elevated level of some adipokines in cancer cell lines. However, some hormones, such as vaspin, reduce apoptosis, have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative roles in cancer cell lines.Methods:Hep-3B cells were cytometrically evaluated under vaspin treatment for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosiss induction. The statistical significant changes to the untreated controls was calculated by T-tests (indicated at value p Results:Here we studied the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in cells of HCC line Hep-3B after vaspin treatment. A decreased level of nitric oxide and superoxide anion 24 h after vaspin addition at 5 ng/ml was correlated with restricted, to the physiological level, apoptosis. A protective role of vaspin was displayed as enhanced cell viability and proliferation, which could be a poor prognostic in liver cancer.Conclusions:Apoptosis was suppressed after vaspin treatment, together with low levels of nitric oxide and superoxide anions.
