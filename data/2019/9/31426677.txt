Aim: To determine the impact of KRAS mutation status on survival in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CLM). Patients & methods: Patients with resected CLM and KRAS mutations. Survival was compared between mt-KRAS and wt-KRAS. Results: Of 662 patients, 174 (26.3%) were mt-KRAS and 488 (73.7%) wt-KRAS. mt-KRAS patients had significantly lower recurrence-free survival (HR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.10-1.84). There were no differences between the groups for sidedness. Poorer survival was associated with mt-KRAS with positive lymph nodes, >1 metastases, tumors >5 cm, synchronous tumors and R1-R2. Conclusion: KRAS mutation status can help predict recurrence-free survival. Primary tumor location was not a prognostic factor after resection. KRAS mutation status can help design a multidisciplinary approach after curative resection of CLM.
