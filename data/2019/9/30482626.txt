Rationale and objectives:We assessed the value of iodine concentration (IC) as a perfusion-derived response marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in comparison with volume perfusion computed tomography (VPCT) parameters.Materials and methods:Forty-one HCC lesions in 32 patients examined before and after TACE were analyzed retrospectively. VPCT-parameters were calculated and lesion iodine-maps were computed using subtraction of the baseline and the scan 7 seconds after aortic peak enhancement from the corresponding 80 kVp-VPCT data set. Modified RECIST was used as standard response criteria. Comparisons were performed using Student's t test for normal distributed data and Mann-Whitney U test for non-normal distributed data. Additionally, correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and interreader agreement were assessed.Results:In responding lesions, mean pre-TACE IC and blood flow (BF) were 131.2 mg/100 mL and 96.7 mL/100 mL/min, decreasing to IC 25.6 mg/100 mL (P Conclusion:Thus, IC is a meaningful perfusion marker for local therapy response monitoring in HCC that can be acquired with low radiation dose. This information is important for further therapy response applications using dual and single energy CT.
