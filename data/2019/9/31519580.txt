Background/aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor antagonist on hepatic carcinogenesis in mice.Materials and methods:Mice were injected with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and treated with M-CSF receptor antagonist GW2580 (GW) or a saline vehicle just after (early treated group) or 2 weeks after (late treated group) DEN injection. Animals were sacrificed after 28 weeks and incidence of tumor was assessed. Isolated Kupffer cells were co-cultured with M-CSF in the presence or absence of GW, and the concentration of VEGF was measured.Results:The incidence of tumors was significantly blunted both in the early- and the late-treated groups. In addition, angiogenesis within the tumor was also suppressed in both groups. The concentration of VEGF increased in Kupffer cells treated with M-CSF compared to those cultured without M-CSF. This increase was blunted by GW.Conclusion:M-CSF and its receptor could be novel molecular targets for hepatocellular carcinoma.
