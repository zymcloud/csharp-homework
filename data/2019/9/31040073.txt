Background:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a deadly cancer worldwide associated with an increased incidence, limited therapeutic options and absence of reliable prognostic biomarkers. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) emerge as relevant biomarkers in cancer being associated with tumor progression. However, lncRNA have been poorly investigated in iCCA.Aim:To identify lncRNA significantly associated with the survival of patients with iCCA after tumor resection for curative intent.Methods:Gene expression profiling and Q-RT-PCR were performed from a cohort of 39 clinically well-annotated iCCA. Univariate Cox proportional hazards model with Wald Statistic was used to identify lncRNA significantly associated with overall (OS) and/or disease-free (DFS) survival.Results:A signature made of 9 lncRNA was identified to be significantly (P Conclusions:We report a prognosis lncRNA signature in iCCA and the clinical relevance of CDKN2B-AS1 (ANRIL) overexpression in several cancers.
