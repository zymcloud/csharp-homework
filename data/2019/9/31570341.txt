A 57-year-old man with a known anterior mediastinal mass presented with abdominal distension, jaundice, and signs of urinary and bowel obstruction. Labs revealed leukocytosis, transaminitis, direct hyperbilirubinaemia and elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Subsequent imaging revealed the anterior mediastinal mass and diffuse liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease. MRI of the spine and brain were negative for metastases. Liver biopsy and immunohistochemistry revealed basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of thymic origin. Treatment with capecitabine was initiated but was complicated by worsening liver and kidney failure. Eventually, due to continued worsening of the patient's condition and minimal treatment response, capecitabine was stopped during cycle 1 and the patient was discharged to inpatient hospice with comfort care. In this case report, we highlight the presenting features, imaging findings and management of a patient with metastatic thymic carcinoma.
