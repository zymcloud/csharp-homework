Objective:The Milan criteria are recommended as the major reference for liver transplantation in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, alternative anticancer treatments are often utilized due to severe donor organ shortage. This study aimed to develop and validate an albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade-based prognostic model to stratify survival in patients within Milan criteria undergoing nontransplant therapy.Patients and methods:A total of 1655 patients were assigned into the derivation and validation cohort according to treatment modalities. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors of survival in the derivation cohort. An ALBI-based model was evaluated in the validation cohort.Results:In the Cox multivariate model, age 65 years or older (hazard ratio [HR]=1.576, P100 ng/mL (HR=1.671, P100 ng/mL, presence of ascites, performance status 1 to 4, and ALBI grade 2, and 2 points for ALBI grade 3. This model can accurately predict long-term outcome in the validation cohort (PConclusion:The proposed ALBI grade-based model is feasible in predicting survival in HCC patients within the Milan criteria, and helps identify high-risk patients who need timely liver transplantation.
