Background:Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is a rare subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to characterise the genomic alterations and outcomes of SRCC.Methods:Medical records of metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients whose tumours were evaluated by NGS analysis were reviewed. SC-mCRC were classified into two groups: SRCC (>50% signet ring cells) and adenocarcinoma (AC) with SC component (â‰¤50% signet ring cells).Results:Six hundred and sixty-five mCRC patients were included. Of the 93 mCRC cases with SC features, 63 had slides for review. Of those 63 cases, 35 were confirmed SRCC, and 28 were AC with SC component. Compared with AC group, KRAS and PIK3CA mutations (mts) were found in only 11% (OR: 0.13) and 3% (OR: 0.15) of SRCC cases, respectively. In contrast to the 44% rate of APC mts in AC group, only 3% of SRCC patients had APC mts (OR = 0.04).Conclusions:SRCC has distinct molecular features, including low rates of KRAS, PIK3CA and APC mts. Further study to identify activation pathways and potential therapeutic targets are needed.
