Background and aim:The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD-HCC) is increasing. Unfortunately, NAFLD frequently develops into HCC without liver cirrhosis. Therefore, we investigated the clinical features of HCC in NAFLD patients without advanced fibrosis.Methods:We compared clinical characteristics, survival rates, and recurrence rates between 104 NAFLD-HCC patients diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2016, including 35 without (F0-2) and 69 with advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). Risk factors associated with survival and recurrence were evaluated.Results:In total, 66.3% of those diagnosed had advanced fibrosis, 58.8% in men and 80.5% in women (men vs women, P = 0.03). In NAFLD-HCC without advanced fibrosis, tumor size was significantly larger and liver histological activity was lower than those in patients with advanced fibrosis. Survival rates between the two groups did not differ. Among those achieving curative treatment, the recurrence rate was significantly lower in NAFLD-HCC without advanced fibrosis (P Conclusions:In men, HCC tended to develop from NAFLD without advanced fibrosis. Although tumor size in NAFLD-HCC without advanced fibrosis is significantly larger, the recurrence rate is significantly lower. Surgical therapy should be strongly considered in these cases.
