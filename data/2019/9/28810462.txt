We explored the association between socio-demographic factors, coping style, illness perceptions and preferences for disclosure/nondisclosure of cancer diagnosis in 384 Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that (1) 69.3 percent of the patients preferred disclosure and (2) multivariate analysis showed that four variables were significantly positively associated with preference for disclosure, including active emotional-focused coping style, illness perceptions of personal control, chronic infection of hepatitis B virus, and educational level, whereas perceived emotional impact of illness and objective social support (mainly family support) were significantly associated with preference for nondisclosure. The findings provide useful information for understanding patients' preferences for disclosure/nondisclosure of cancer diagnosis from a psychosocial perspective.
