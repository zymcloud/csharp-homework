Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous cancer, both at the molecular and histological level. High-throughput sequencing and gene expression profiling have identified distinct transcriptomic subclasses and numerous recurrent genetic alterations; several HCC subtypes characterised by histological features have also been identified. HCC phenotype appears to be closely related to particular gene mutations, tumour subgroups and/or oncogenic pathways. Non-proliferative tumours display a well-differentiated phenotype. Among this molecular subgroup, CTNNB1-mutated HCCs constitute a homogeneous subtype, exhibiting cholestasis and microtrabecular and pseudoglandular architectural patterns. Another non-proliferative subtype has a gene expression pattern similar to that of mature hepatocytes (G4) and displays a steatohepatitic phenotype. In contrast, proliferative HCCs are most often poorly differentiated, and notably include tumours with progenitor features. A novel morphological variant of proliferative HCC - designated "macrotrabecular-massive" - was recently shown to be associated with angiogenesis activation and poor prognosis. Altogether, these findings may help to translate our knowledge of HCC biology into clinical practice, resulting in improved precision medicine for patients with this highly aggressive malignancy. This manuscript reviews the most recent data in this exciting field, discussing future directions and challenges.
