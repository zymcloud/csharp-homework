Background:Little evidence exists regarding the perioperative and oncologic benefits of microwave ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of hepatic resection and operative microwave ablation (microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy) for single hepatocellular carcinoma ≤5 cm.Methods:Between 1994 and 2015, a total of 551 patients with a single hepatocellular carcinoma ≤5 cm were treated in our institution (hepatic resection: n = 128; microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy: n = 423). We compared overall survival and recurrence-free survival between hepatic resection and microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy. Propensity score matching analysis identified 94 matched pairs of patients to compare outcomes.Results:After propensity score matching, baseline variables, including liver function and tumor size, were well-balanced between the 2 groups. The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 76% and 47% for hepatic resection and 77% and 48% for microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy, respectively (P = .865). The 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival rates were 55% and 41% for hepatic resection and 47% and 32% for microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy, respectively (P = .377). In the subgroup analysis, the hepatic resection group had better recurrence-free survival than the microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy group in patients with tumor size >3 cm, with 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of 56.5% and 32.4% in the hepatic resection and microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy group, respectively (P = .029).Conclusion:Our propensity score matching study confirmed no statistically significant differences in both overall survival and recurrence-free survival between hepatic resection and microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy for single hepatocellular carcinoma ≤5 cm; however, hepatic resection is recommended for hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor size >3 cm when patients have good liver function.
