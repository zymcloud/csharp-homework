Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor. The survival of advanced HCC is very poor. In this case study, we describe the treatment of a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with massive hepatocellular carcinoma, the use of lenvatinib in combination with nivolumab injection in the preoperative adjuvant treatment of advanced massive hepatocellular carcinoma, and the final taking extended right hepatectomy. Molecular targeted drugs and immunotherapy controlled patient's condition to create time and conditions for surgery. After surgery, AFP was greatly reduced, no recurrence of the residual liver and no metastasis in the distance. This treatment is the gospel of patients with advanced liver cancer.
