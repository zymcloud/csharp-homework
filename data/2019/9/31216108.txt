Circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection and numeration are becoming part of the common clinical practice, especially for breast, colon, and prostate cancer. However, their paucity in peripheral blood samples is an obstacle for their identification. Several groups have tried to improve CTC recovery rate by developing highly sensitive cellular and molecular detection methods. However, CTCs are still difficult to detect in peripheral blood. Therefore, their recovery rate could be increased by obtaining blood samples from vessels close to the drainage territories of the invaded organ, when the anatomical situation is favorable. This approach has been tested mostly during tumor resection surgery, when the vessels nearest to the tumor are easily accessible. Moreover, radiological (including echo-guided based and endovascular techniques) and/or endoscopic routes could be utilized to obtain CTC samples close to the tumor in a less invasive way than conventional biopsies. The purpose of this article is to summarize the available knowledge on CTC recovery from blood samples collected close to the tumor (i.e., in vessels located in the drainage area of the primary tumor or metastases). The relevance of such an approach for diagnostic and prognostic evaluations will be discussed, particularly for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer.
