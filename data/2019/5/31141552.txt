Purpose:Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is generally recognized as a prognostic factor in HCC. Our purpose is to assess and compare the survival of patients with PVT and without PVT, after Y-90 Trans-Arterial Radio-Embolization (TARE) of unresectable HCC, unresponsive to other loco-regional treatments.Materials and methods:Between November 2005 and November 2012, Y-90 resin-based TARE was performed in an IRB-approved prospective protocol, on 89 patients with unresectable HCC. 33/89 patients had PVT, the remaining 56 were resistant-to-cTACE or underwent TARE as a downstaging therapy. All patients were studied with Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT), angiography, 99mTc-MAA-scintigraphy and liver biopsy. Gastro-duodenal artery was embolized in most cases. Proton-Pump Inhibitors were administered to prevent gastritis and ulcers. χ2 test with Yates correction and log rank test were used to compare the two proportions and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, respectively.Results:The average activity administered was 1.7 ± 0.4 GBq. After the treatment, CTCAE grade 2 adverse events occurred in 46% (41/89) patients: in particular, fever and abdominal pain were found in 25 and 16 patients, respectively. No major side-effect was observed. According to mRECIST criteria, partial response or complete response was found in 70% of patient three months after the treatment, and in 90.5% nine months after the treatment. No significant difference was found in survival of patients with PVT compared to those without PVT (p-value = 0.672). A complete regression of PVT was observed in almost half patients (13/27, 48.1%).Conclusions:Portal vein invasion does not affect survival in advanced stage HCC-patients undergoing TARE using Y-90 resin-based microspheres. Y90 procedure is associated with regression of portal vein tumor thrombus.
