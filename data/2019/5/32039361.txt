Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has an evolving role in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), largely due to recent advances in imaging technology. Often utilized in situations where other locoregional therapies are not feasible, SBRT has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment that confers high rates of durable local control. However, there is limited evidence to firmly establish its place in the treatment paradigm for HCC. In this article, we review the current evidence and highlight specific considerations in the multiple settings where SBRT may be used, including for primary HCC treatment and bridging/downstaging, as well as exploring the potential for SBRT in the treatment of extrahepatic oligo-metastatic HCC.
