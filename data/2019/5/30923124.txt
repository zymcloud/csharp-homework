Aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction are key metabolic features of cancer cells, but their interplay during cancer development remains unclear. We previously reported that human hepatoma cells with mitochondrial defects exhibit down-regulated lactate dehydrogenase subunit B (LDHB) expression. Here, using several molecular and biochemical assays and informatics analyses, we investigated how LDHB suppression regulates mitochondrial respiratory activity and contributes to liver cancer progression. We found that transcriptional LDHB down-regulation is an upstream event during suppressed oxidative phosphorylation. We also observed that LDHB knockdown increases inhibitory phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) via lactate-mediated PDH kinase (PDK) activation and thereby attenuates oxidative phosphorylation activity. Interestingly, monocarboxylate transporter 1 was the major lactate transporter in hepatoma cells, and its expression was essential for PDH phosphorylation by modulating intracellular lactate levels. Finally, bioinformatics analysis of the hepatocellular carcinoma cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that a low LDHB/LDHA ratio is statistically significantly associated with poor prognostic outcomes. A low ratio was also associated with a significant enrichment in glycolysis genes and negatively correlated with PDK1 and 2 expression, supporting a close link between LDHB suppression and the PDK-PDH axis. These results suggest that LDHB suppression is a key mechanism that enhances glycolysis and is critically involved in the maintenance and propagation of mitochondrial dysfunction via lactate release in liver cancer progression.
