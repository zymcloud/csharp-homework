Background:It has been proved that nucleos(t) ide analogues (NAs) therapy could improve underlying liver disease and reduce the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the difference of effectiveness in reducing HCC occurrence between tenofovir (TDF) and enticavir (ETV), two first-line NAs drugs, is still little known. This meta analysis aims to assess the efficacy in reducing incidence of HCC comparing tenofovir monotherapy with entecavir monotherapy among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients by analyzing their long-term clinical outcomes.Methods:Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial, and ISI Web of Science were fully investigated according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. For the included articles, two of the authors independently extracted and confirmed relevant data. Review Manager software (RevMan 5.3) was using for meta analysis.Results:Seven articles with 3698 patients were finally included in this research, 1574 in tenofovir group and 2124 in entecavir group. For meta analysis, the incidence of HCC was significantly lower among the tenofovir group than entecavir group [rate ratio (95% CI) of 0.66 (0.49, 0.89), P = 0.008], while there was no statistical significance in incidence of death or transplantation [rate ratio (95% CI) of 0.78 (0.55, 1.13), P = 0.19], encephalopathy [risk ratio (95% CI) of 0.72 (0.45, 1.13), P = 0.15] or variceal bleeding [risk ratio (95% CI) of 0.71 (0.34, 1.50), P = 0.37] between the two groups.Conclusion:There is a better effect of tenofovir in reducing HCC incidence than entecavir, which indicates tenofovir should be used more widely while treating chronic hepatitis B patients. However before applying, randomized controlled trial and large prospective cohort study should be performed in the future.
