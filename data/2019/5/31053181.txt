This study evaluated the difference in treatment response and survival profiles between drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) and conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) treatments in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. A total of 120 HCC patients were consecutively enrolled in this prospective cohort study, which showed that DEB-TACE achieved higher complete response (CR) (30.8%) compared with cTACE (7.4%) with no difference in overall response rate (ORR) for patients treated with DEB-TACE and cTACE (80.8% vs. 73.5%). In addition, DEB-TACE was associated with a lower rate of progressive disease (PD) compared with cTACE (1.9% vs. 11.8%). With respect to survival, patients in the DEB-TACE group achieved median progression-free survival (PFS) of 15 months (95% CI 12-18 months), which was longer than the cTACE group [median PFS 11 months (95% CI 10-12 months)]. Median overall survival (OS) was also longer with DEB-TACE [25 months (95% CI 22-28 months)] when compared with cTACE [21 months (95% CI 18-24 months)]. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that DEB-TACE was an independent predictive factor for achieving CR. Univariate Cox's regression analysis revealed that DEB-TACE was a predictive factor for prolonged PFS and OS, while multivariate analysis demonstrated that DEB-TACE was not an independent factor for predicting PFS or OS. In conclusion, we found that DEB-TACE achieved higher treatment response and prolonged survival compared with cTACE in Chinese HCC patients.
