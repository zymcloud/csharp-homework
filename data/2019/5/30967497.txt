The association of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2596542G>A and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been broadly studied, with inconsistent results. Therefore, we conducted the current meta-analysis to better elucidate the roles of SNP rs2596542G>A in HCC. Eligible articles were searched in PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang, Embase, VIP, Web of Science, and CBM databases up to November 2018. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were applied. A total of 11 articles, including 4528 HCC patients and 16,625 control subjects, were analyzed. Results revealed that rs2596542G>A was significantly associated with HCC in the heterozygote (G/A versus A/A, P=0.006, OR = 0.854; 95% CI: 0.763-0.956); and dominant (G/G + G/A versus A/A; P=0.021; OR = 0.796; 95% CI: 0.655-0.967) genetic models. Nevertheless, we also detected significant associations between rs2596542G>A and HCV-induced HCC. Additionally, according to our analyses, SNP rs2596542G>A was not correlated with HBV-induced HCC. In conclusion, our findings suggest that MICA SNP rs2596542G>A is associated with HCC susceptibility amongst the Asian, Caucasian, and African ethnicity in certain genetic models. Specifically, MICA SNP rs2396542G>A is associated with risk of HCV-induced HCC, not HBV-induced HCC.
