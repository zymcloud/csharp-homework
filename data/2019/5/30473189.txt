Background:Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have increased risks of gastrointestinal cancers, including esophageal adenocarcinoma. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is highly prevalent in CF and manifests at early ages. CF patients may be at increased risk for long-term sequelae of chronic GERD, including Barrett's esophagus (BE). We aimed to assess whether patients with CF have an increased risk of BE or related neoplasia.Methods:A matched cohort study was performed of adults with and without CF who had undergone upper endoscopy. Non-CF patients were matched in a 4:1 ratio by age, sex, year of exam, and endoscopist. Odds ratios were calculated for the association between CF and BE or related neoplasia, and multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed to adjust for matching variables and additional potential confounders.Results:122 CF patients underwent endoscopy, and 488 matched controls were identified. Seven (5.7%) CF patients had BE or related neoplasia, including one GE junction adenocarcinoma. Mean age of affected CF patients was 36.0, and 85.7% had a prior solid organ transplant. The odds of BE was significantly increased in CF patients (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.08-7.81). The risk remained significantly increased in a multivariable model including matching variables (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.19-9.22) and in a parsimonious model (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.06-8.42).Conclusions:Adults with CF have a 3-fold increased risk of BE or related neoplasia and appears to develop at younger ages. Consideration should be given to screening for BE in select CF patients, especially those who have undergone solid organ transplantation.
