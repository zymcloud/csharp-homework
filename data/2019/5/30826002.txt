Aim:To evaluate the correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and various histopathological parameters in small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:In 143 surgically resected small HCCs, the mean and minimum ADC values, tumour-to-liver ADC ratio, and normalised ADC (ADC of the HCC/ADC of the spleen) were correlated to the tumour grade, microvascular invasion (MVI), cellularity, fatty change, degree of fibrosis, and lymphocytic infiltration using linear regression analysis, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, or Spearman's rank correlation.Results:No significant correlation was found between the ADC parameters and tumour grade. In the univariate analysis, the ADC ratio of the tumour was significantly correlated with MVI as well as the degree of fibrosis and lymphocyte infiltration of the HCC (p=0.017, 0.042, and 0.002, respectively). The ADC of the tumour was significantly correlated with the degree of lymphocyte infiltration of the HCC (p=0.049). In the multivariate analysis, the ADC ratio of the tumour was an independent parameter for MVI and the degree of lymphocyte infiltration of the HCC (p=0.034 and Conclusion:The tumour grade of small HCCs was not correlated with ADC parameters. The tumour-to-liver ADC ratio was a significant independent parameter for the degree of lymphocyte infiltration and MVI of small HCCs.
