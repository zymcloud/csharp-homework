Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an emerging treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. This technique results in excellent local control rates with favorable toxicity profile despite being predominantly used in heavily pretreated patients or those unsuitable for other local therapies. SBRT may be used as a sole treatment or in combination with other local therapies as well as a bridging strategy for patient awaiting liver transplants. This brief review describes current practice of SBRT with respect to radiation technique, patient selection and treatment concepts. It summarizes available evidence from retro- and prospective studies evaluating SBRT alone, SBRT in combination with other treatments and SBRT compared to other local treatment approaches.
