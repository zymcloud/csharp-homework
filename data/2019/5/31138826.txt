Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell culture systems have facilitated the development of efficient direct-acting antivirals against HCV. Huh-7.5, a subline of the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7, has been used widely to amplify HCV because HCV can efficiently replicate in these cells due to a defect in innate antiviral signalling. Recently, we established a novel cell line, KH, derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma, which showed atypical uptake of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) in a Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging study. KH cells expressed hepatocyte markers including microRNA-122 (miR-122) at a lower level than Huh-7.5 cells. We demonstrated that KH cells could support the entire life cycle of HCV; however, HCV replicated at a lower rate in KH cells compared to Huh-7.5 cells, and virus particles produced from KH cells seemed to have some disadvantages in viral assembly compared with those produced from Huh-7.5 cells. KH cells had more robust interferon-stimulated gene expression and induction upon HCV RNA transfection, interferon-Î±2b addition, and HCV infection than Huh-7.5 cells. Interestingly, both miR-122 supplementation and IRF3 knockout in KH cells boosted HCV replication to a similar level as in Huh-7.5 cells, suggesting that intact innate antiviral signalling and lower miR-122 expression limit HCV replication in KH cells. KH cells will enable a deeper understanding of the role of the innate immune response in persistent HCV infection.
