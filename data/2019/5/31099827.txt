Most genes are alternatively spliced and increasing number of evidences show that alternative splicing (AS) is modified and related to tumor progression. Systematic profiles of AS signature in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is absent and urgently needed. Here, differentially spliced AS transcripts between HCC and non-HCC tissues were compared, prognosis-associated AS events by using univariate Cox regression analysis were selected. Our gene functional enrichment analysis demonstrated the potential pathways enriched by survival-associated AS. Prognostic AS signatures were then constructed for HCC prognosis prediction by Lasso regression model. We also analyzed splicing factors (SFs) regulating underlying mechanisms by Pearson correlation and then built corresponding regulatory networks. In addition, we explored the performance of AS signature in the mutated HCC samples. Genome-wide AS events in 377 HCC patients from TCGA were profiled. Among 34 163 AS events in 8985 genes, 3950 AS events in 2403 genes associated with overall survival (OS) significantly for HCC were detected. In addition, computational algorithm results showed that metabolic and ribosome pathways may be the potential molecular mechanisms regulating the poor prognosis. More importantly, survival-associated AS signatures revealed high performance in predicting HCC prognosis. The area under curve for AS signature was 0.806 in all HCC and 0.944 in TP53 mutated HCC samples at 2000 days of OS. We submitted prognostic SFs to build the AS regulatory network, from which we found prognostic AS events were significantly enriched in metabolism-related pathways. A robust AS signature for HCC patients and revealed the regulatory splicing networks contributing to the potential significantly enriched metabolism-related pathways.
