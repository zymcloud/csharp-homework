History A 70-year-old man presented to the emergency department with fever, chills, rigors, and upper abdominal discomfort. Physical examination revealed jaundice and mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory tests revealed an increased C-reactive protein level of 133 mg/L (normal range, 0.2-0.9 mg/L), a white blood cell count of 11.69 ×109/L (normal range, 4-10 ×109/L), and an obstructive pattern on liver function tests, with a total bilirubin level of 3.5 mg/dL (59.9 µmol/L) (normal range, 0.4-1.9 mg/dL [6.8-32.5 µmol/L]), an alkaline phosphatase level of 716 U/L (11.9 µkat/L) (normal range, 39-99 U/L [0.65-1.65 µkat/L]), and an aspartate aminotransferase level of 88 U/L (1.47 µkat/L) (normal range, 12-42 U/L [0.20-0.70 µkat/L]). Serum amylase level was within normal limits at 84 U/L (1.40 µkat/L) (normal range, 38-149 U/L [0.63-2.48 µkat/L]). A clinical diagnosis of hepatobiliary sepsis due to ascending cholangitis was made. Relevant medical history included gastric carcinoma treated with a Billroth II surgical procedure 17 years earlier that was performed in conjunction with cholecystectomy. In addition, there were episodes of ascending cholangitis 6-12 months prior to the current admission that were managed conservatively with antibiotics at another institution. Blood cultures were positive for Klebsiella oxytoca. Administration of intravenous antibiotics was started, and CT examination of the abdomen was performed. Because a previous Billroth II procedure had been performed, the patient underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.
