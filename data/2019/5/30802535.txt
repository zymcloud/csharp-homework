Background and aims:The extracellular calcium-binding protein family member thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) regulates cell migration, proliferation, attachment, adhesion, angiogenesis, neural development, tissue structure, organ development, pain signal transduction, and tumor growth. The aim of this study was to study THBS4 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determine if it was a prognostic marker for this malignancy.Methods:We used immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays to evaluate THBS4 expression in 84 HCC and matched para-cancerous tissues. Then, we assessed relationships between THBS4 expression and clinicopathological parameters.Results:THBS4 expression was higher in HCCs than in matched para-cancerous tissues (P 40 ng/mL (P = 0.028) and cirrhosis (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that high THBS4 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both overall and disease-free survival.Conclusions:Our data suggest that THBS4 may play a role in HCC development, and thus may be an independent prognostic marker and/or potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.
