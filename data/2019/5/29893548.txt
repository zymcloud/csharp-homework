Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has infected one-third of world population, and 240 million people are chronic carriers, to whom a curative therapy is still not available. Similar to other viruses, persistent HBV infection relies on the virus to exploit host cell functions to support its replication and efficiently evade host innate and adaptive antiviral immunity. Understanding HBV replication and concomitant host cell interactions is thus instrumental for development of therapeutics to disrupt the virus-host interactions critical for its persistence and cure chronic hepatitis B. Although the currently available cell culture systems of HBV infection are refractory to genome-wide high throughput screening of key host cellular factors essential for and/or regulating HBV replication, classic one-gene (or pathway)-at-a-time studies in the last several decades have already revealed many aspects of HBV-host interactions. An overview of the landscape of HBV-hepatocyte interaction indicates that, in addition to more tightly suppressing viral replication by directly targeting viral proteins, disruption of key viral-host cell interactions to eliminate or inactivate the covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, the most stable HBV replication intermediate that exists as an episomal minichromosome in the nucleus of infected hepatocyte, is essential to achieve a functional cure of chronic hepatitis B. Moreover, therapeutic targeting of integrated HBV DNA and their transcripts may also be required to induce hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance and prevent liver carcinogenesis.
