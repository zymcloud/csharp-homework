M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) infiltrating the tumor microenvironment contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. It was reported that cancer cells undergoing EMT will acquire stemness characteristics. Here, the HCC SMMC-7721 cell line was co-cultured with M2-TAMs polarized from THP-1 cells in vitro. In in vivo studies, we used nude mice subcutaneous tumor model to test whether the growth of the tumor was affected by M2-TAMs. Subsequently, EMT, stemness and Wnt/β-catenin pathway related markers were detected in cells and subcutaneous tumor tissues. TNF-α was also assessed in both the co-culture system supernatants and in nude mice serum. We found that SMMC-7721 underwent EMT and acquired stemness after co-culture with M2-TAMs, and resulted in larger tumor size following subcutaneous injection of SMMC-7721 suspended in M2-TAMs supernatants compared with SMMC-7721 alone. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay showed that TNF-α expression was elevated in supernatants of M2-TAMs and positively correlated with tumor size in the serum of nude mice. Furthermore, we found that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was a downstream target of TNF-α and that the Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor ICG-001 partially reversed EMT and attenuated cancer stemness. Our results indicate that TNF-α derived from M2-TAMs promote EMT and cancer stemness cells via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
