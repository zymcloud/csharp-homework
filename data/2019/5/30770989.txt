Purpose:This study aimed at investigating the function and significance of CD110 expression in pancreatic cancer.Methods:We performed immunohistochemical staining for CD110 expression in tumor samples from 86 patients with pancreatic cancer. We evaluated clinical outcomes and other clinicopathological factors to determine the significance of CD110 on survival and liver metastasis. We examine thrombopoietin-CD110 signaling in cancer cell extravasation in vitro and in vivo. We investigated the effects of CD110 knockdown on liver metastasis in a splenic xenograft mouse model.Results:CD110 expression in cancer cells was associated with low-histological-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, and patients with high CD110 expression had poorer prognosis (P = 0.0003). High CD110 expression was an independent predictor of liver metastasis (P = 0.0422). Knockdown of CD110 expression significantly attenuated cell migration and invasion. Treatment with thrombopoietin promoted pancreatic cancer cell extravasation. In the presence of thrombopoietin, CD110 increased cell viability through the activation of the ERK-MYC signaling pathway. Knockdown of CD110 expression inhibited liver metastases in the mouse model.Conclusions:CD110 promotes pancreatic cancer progression and it may serve as a predictive factor for liver metastasis.
