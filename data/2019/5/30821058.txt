Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can induce apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing normal cells, thereby leading to the development of TRAIL receptor agonists for cancer treatment. However, these agonist-based therapeutics exhibit little clinical benefits due to the lack of biomarkers to predict whether patients are responsive to the treatment, as well as determine the resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL-based agonists. Our previous study has demonstrated that ISG12a enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis and might serve as a biomarker to predict the TRAIL response. The downstream mechanism by which ISG12a augments TRAIL-induced apoptosis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that ISG12a was localized in the mitochondria and nucleus and augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis through intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In addition, ISG12a interacted with NR4A1 and promoted its nuclear-to-cytoplasm translocation. Upon translocate to cytoplasm, NR4A1 targeted mitochondria and induced Bcl2 conformational change, thereby exposing its BH3 domain. Moreover, TRAIL treatment can induce NR4A1 expression through the activation of NF-ÎºB in TRAIL-resistant Huh7 hepatoma cells. Knockdown of NR4A1 could overcome TRAIL resistance. However, in TRAIL-sensitive LH86 liver cancer cells, TRAIL activated the Jun N-terminal kinases signalling pathway. Overall, these results showed that both ISG12a and its interaction partner NR4A1 are involved in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in hepatoma cells.
