Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a poor prognosis. 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is currently under preclinical evaluation as a treatment for many malignancies, but the utility of the drug in terms of HCC treatment remains unclear. Here, we explored the effect of 2-ME on human huh7 cell proliferation and apoptosis and discuss the possible molecular mechanisms involved. The MTT assay showed that proliferation was markedly inhibited by 2-ME (at 5, 10, 15, and 20 Î¼mol/L) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, flow cytometry indicated that 2-ME induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, and early apoptosis. We used Western blotting and PCR to detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Bcl-2; 2-ME decreased the mRNA/protein expression levels of both effectors. Furthermore, 2-ME remarkably suppressed xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, and no visible toxicity was observed in either the liver or kidneys. Immunohistochemically, the Bcl-2 and VEGF expression levels were significantly lower than those of controls. Thus, 2-ME inhibited huh7 cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, perhaps reflecting the effects of the drug on VEGF and Bcl-2 expression.
