Background:Management of malignancy in elderly patients is challenging. We aimed to assess the impact of age and ageing on overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), tumour-specific survival (TSS) and potential years of life lost (PYLL) after surgery for hepatocarcinoma (HCC).Methods:Consecutive patients treated for HCC between 2005 and 2015 were evaluated. Patients were divided according to age-decade. Afterwards, elderly patients (≥75 years) were compared with patients Results:Four hundred and thirty-nine patients were stratified: group 1 (age ≤ 55, n = 72), group 2 (age: 56-65, n = 133), group 3 (age: 66-74, n = 141) and group 4 (age ≥ 75, n = 93). Group 1 had the highest median PYLL (27.6, IQR 24.6-32.5) while group 4 the lowest (2.0, IQR 0-9.6; P Conclusion:Ageing per se is not an absolute contraindication for liver resection, given the acceptable oncologic long-term prognosis, but the worse short-term outcomes in the elderly should induce an accurate patient selection.
