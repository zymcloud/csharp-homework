Objective:To compare efficiency of trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) plus high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and TACE alone on patients with primary liver cancer.Study design:A descriptive, analytical study.Place and duration of study:Department of Ultrasound, Daqing Oilfield General Hospital, China, from March 2015 to March 2017.Methodology:A total of 90 primary liver cancer patients were randomly divided into control group and observation group, 45 cases in each group. Control group was treated with TACE alone, while observation group was treated with HIFU plus TACE. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine amino-transferase (ALT), aspartate amino-transferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), and frequency of complications, were compared in the two groups.Results:The total remission rate of observation group was higher than that of control group (p=0.017). At 6 months after treatment, AFP level in observation group was lower than that in control group (p Conclusion:Treatment of primary liver cancer by TACE plus HIFU has a higher overall remission rate, causes little damage to normal liver tissue, can fully kill tumor cells and reduce postoperative local recurrence and metastasis rate with less adverse reactions.
