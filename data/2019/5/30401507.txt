Background:Tumor recurrence after curative resection is common in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but large-scale long-term prediction on an individual basis has seldom been reported. We aimed to construct an albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade-based nomogram to predict tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing surgical resection.Methods:A total 1038 patients with newly diagnosed HCC undergoing curative resection between 2002 and 2016 were enrolled. Baseline characteristics, tumor status and severity of liver functional reserve were collected. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to predict tumor recurrence and construct the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the discrimination and calibration tests.Results:After a mean follow up time of 30 months, 510 (49%) patients developed tumor recurrence. The cumulative recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 79%, 51%, 38% and 26%, respectively. In the Cox multivariate model, ALBI grade 2-3, multiple tumors, tumor size equal or large than 2 cm, serum É‘-fetoprotein level equal or greater than 20 ng/ml and total tumor volume equal or larger than 227 cm3 were independent risk factors associated with tumor recurrence. A nomogram was constructed based on these five variables. Internal validation with 10,380 bootstrapped sample sets had a good concordance of 0.607 (95% of confidence interval: 0.587-0.627). The calibration plots for 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free survival well matched the idealized 45-degree line.Conclusions:ALBI is a feasible marker for tumor recurrence. This easy-to-use ALBI grade-based nomogram may predict tumor recurrence for individual HCC patient undergoing surgical resection.
