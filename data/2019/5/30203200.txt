Objective:Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important indications for the minimally invasive approach. Our study aims to analyze the experience of the Italian Group of Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery with laparoscopic surgical treatment of HCC, with a focus on tumor location and how it affects morbidity and mortality.Methods:38 centers participated in this study; 372 cases of LLR for HCC were prospectively enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to the HCC nodule location. Group 1 favorable location and group 2 unfavorable location. Perioperative outcomes were compared between the two groups before and after a propensity score match (PS) 1:1.Results:Before PS in group 2 surgical time was longer; conversion rate was higher; postoperative transfusion and comprehensive complication index were also higher. PS was performed with a cohort of 298 patients (from 18 centers), with 66 and 232 patients with HCC in unfavorable and favorable locations, respectively. After PS matching, 62 patients from group 1 and group 2 each were compared. Operative and postoperative course were similar in patients with HCC in favorable and unfavorable LLR locations. Surgical margins were found to be identical before and after PS.Conclusions:These results show that LLR in patients with HCC can be safely performed in all segments because of the extensive experience of all surgeons from multiple centers in performing traditional open liver surgery as well as laparoscopic surgery.
