Objective: To estimate the incidence, mortality and characteristics of cancer in Pearl River Delta Area of Guangdong Province between 2009-2013. Methods: Based on five population-based cancer registration data from Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhongshan, Jiangmen and Sihui spanning from 2009 to 2013, along with those corresponding population data, the incidence and mortality rates were estimated by gender and age groups. Chinese standard population derived from the 2000 Population Census and Segi's standard population were used for age-standardized incidence and mortality rates. Results: Between 2009 and 2013, the crude cancer incidence rate was 262.50/100 000, 274.76/100 000 in male and 249.49/100 000 in female. After adjusting for Chinese and Segi's standard population, the age-standardized incidence rates were 225.63/100 000 and 219.88/100 000, respectively. The crude mortality rate was 175.51/100 000, 222.92/100 000 in male and 127.46/100 000 in female, respectively. After adjusting for Chinese and Segi's standard population, the age-standardized mortality rates were 116.02 /100 000 and 114.31/100 000, respectively. The incidence rates were at low levels in the population less than 40 years old, thereafter went up rapidly with age especially in male, and then reached the peak in the population aged 80 and above. As with incidence, the mortality rates kept at low levels in the population before their 50 s and then rose up steadily with age until peaking in the 85+ age group. The most common cancers were female breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer with descending incidence rate. Lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, female breast cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer were the top five cancer-attributable causes of death. Conclusions: Currently, Pearl River Delta Area were faced with huge cancer burden. Lung cancer, colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, female breast cancer and male liver cancer are predominant cancers and more efforts should be made to fight against them.
