Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been reported as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, how PTP1B is regulated in HCC remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs involved many biological processes including tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated whether miRNA participated in the regulation of PTP1B in HCC. We found that miR-206, which was down-regulated during tumorigenesis, inhibited HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Overexpression of miR-206 inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh7. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that miR-206 directly targeted PTP1B by binding to the 3'-UTR of PTP1B mRNA as demonstrated by the luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression miR-206 inhibited PTP1B expression while miR-206 inhibition enhanced PTP1B expression in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. Functionally, the regulatory effect on cell proliferation/migration/invasion of miR-206 was reversed by PTP1B overexpression. Furthermore, tumor inoculation nude mice model was used to explore the function of miR-206 in vivo Our results showed that overexpression of miR-206 drastically inhibited tumor development. In summary, our data suggest that miR-206 inhibits HCC development by targeting PTP1B.
