Objectives:To evaluate the effect of pegylated interferon maintenance therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C who failed initial antiviral therapy.Methods:This is a meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials that met the eligibility criteria. In all, 2438 chronic hepatitis C patients who failed to achieve sustained virologic response after initial treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (antiviral therapy nonresponders or relapsers) were enrolled; 1237 patients received maintenance therapy (Maintenance group) and 1201 received no treatment (Observation group).Results:The pooled analyses found that patients in the Maintenance group had a significantly higher rate of normal alanine aminotransferase than did patients in the Observation group (pooled odds ratio [OR] 4.436, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.225-16.064, P = .023), but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (pooled OR 0.872, 95% CI 0.501-1.519, P = .630), or the mortality rate (pooled OR 1.564, 95% CI 0.807-3.032, P = .185).Conclusions:Interferon-based maintenance therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C who failed initial antiviral therapy improved liver inflammation as indicated by blood chemistry (alanine aminotransferase).
