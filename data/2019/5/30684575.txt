Glioma is a kind of malignant brain tumor which damages the central nervous system of adults. Recent years, the molecular mechanism involved in the initiation and progression of glioma has been widely reported. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proved to be significant modulators in the biological processes of glioma. In this study, we found that lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 was differentially expressed in glioma tissue samples and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the correlation between AGAP2-AS1 expression and the overall survival of glioma patients. Higher expression of AGAP2-AS1 was correlated with the lower overall survival of glioma patients. Functionally, AGAP2-AS1 knockdown inhibited glioma cell proliferation and accelerated glioma cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, AGAP2-AS1 upregulated HDGF by sponging miR-15a/b-5p. The function of AGAP2-AS1-miR-15a/b-5p-HDGF axis was confirmed by performing rescue assays. Experimental results suggested that miR-15a/b-5p and HDGF involved in AGAP2-AS1-mediated glioma cell proliferation. Moreover, AGAP2-AS1 and HDGF were found to activate Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway in glioma cell lines. In summary, this study demonstrated that AGAP2-AS1 promoted glioma cell proliferation by sponging miR-15a/b-5p to upregulate the expression of HDGF.
