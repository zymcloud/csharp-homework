Background:Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant micro (mi)RNA-448 expression plays a critical role in the progression of several human cancers. However, the function of miRNA-448 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully investigated.Methods:miRNA-448 expression levels in HCC tissues, adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANTs), and HCC cell lines were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). HCC cells were treated with a miRNA-448 mimic or inhibitor, followed by cell viability measurements with the CCK-8 assay. Venn diagram analysis predicted, and dual luciferase reporter assays verified, the target gene of miRNA-448. Expression of the target gene was detected by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Growth of miRNA-448- or target gene-expressing HCC xenograft tumors in nude mice was measured.Results:miRNA-448 was expressed at a lower level in HCC tissues than ANTs, and correlated with a larger tumor size, incomplete tumor encapsulation, and advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. miRNA-448 inhibited HCC cell growth. The downstream target of miRNA-448 was BCL-2, which was highly expressed in HCC tissues and its mRNA level was negatively correlated with miRNA-448 expression. In vivo, BCL-2 attenuated the tumor inhibiting effect of miRNA-448.Conclusion:miRNA-448 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting BCL-2 in HCC.
