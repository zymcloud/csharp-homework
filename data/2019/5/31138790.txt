Growing evidence indicates that clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a metabolism-related disease. Changes in fatty acid (FA) and cholesterol metabolism play important roles in ccRCC development. As a nuclear transcription factor receptor, Liver X receptor (LXR) regulates a variety of key molecules associated with FA synthesis and cholesterol transport. Therefore, targeting LXR may provide new therapeutic targets for ccRCC. However, the potential regulatory effect and molecular mechanisms of LXR in ccRCC remain unknown. In the present study, we found that both an LXR agonist and an XLR inverse agonist could inhibit proliferation and colony formation and induce apoptosis in ccRCC cells. We observed that the LXR agonist LXR623 downregulated the expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and upregulated the expression of ABCA1, which resulted in reduced intracellular cholesterol and apoptosis. The LXR inverse agonist SR9243 downregulated the FA synthesis proteins sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-coA desaturase 1 (SCD1), causing a decrease in intracellular FA content and inducing apoptosis in ccRCC cells. SR9243 and LXR623 induced apoptosis in ccRCC cells but had no killing effect on normal renal tubular epithelial HK2 cells. We also found that SRB1-mediated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in cholesterol influx is the cause of high cholesterol in ccRCC cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that an LXR inverse agonist and LXR agonist decrease the intracellular FA and cholesterol contents in ccRCC to inhibit tumour cells but do not have cytotoxic effects on non-malignant cells. Thus, LXR may be a safe therapeutic target for treating ccRCC patients.
