The natural course of compensated liver cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is still a very interesting problem in hepatology. The prognostic usefulness of the Child-Pugh and MELD score in compensated liver cirrhosis is still debated. Consequently, several attempts have been made to determine parameters other than included in the Child-Pugh score, which could be helpful in the prognosis of compensated liver cirrhosis assessment.Aim:The aim of study was to identify a clinical or laboratory markers correlated with higher risk of liver decompensation among HCVinfected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and presence or absence of esophageal varices.Materials and methods:The study included 176 HCV-infected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis (74 women and 102 men) registered in the Clinical Database of Patients with Liver Cirrhosis - e-Hepar. All patients were monitored during 252 weeks for the occurrence of liver failure symptoms and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:The presence of esophageal varices was significantly associated with total bilirubin ≥2.0 mg/dl, platelets ≤110.0 G/L and 6 points in Child-Pugh score (pConclusions:Our findings underline the prognostic value of serum bilirubin (even mild elevation) and platelet count in HCV-infected patients with compensated liver cirrhosis. We have confirmed that liver decompensation is more frequent and more rapid in patients with compensated liver disease and concomitant oesophageal varices.
