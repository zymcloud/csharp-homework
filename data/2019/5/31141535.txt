Background:Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is a prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients treated with resection or non-surgical treatment. Here, we investigated the association of elevated CRP (≥1 vs. Methods:Adult HCC patients undergoing orthotopic deceased donor LT at the Medical University of Vienna between 1997 and 2014 were retrospectively analysed.Results:Among 216 patients included, 132 (61.1%) were transplanted within the Milan criteria and forty-two patients (19.4%) had microvascular invasion on explant histology. Seventy patients (32.4%) showed elevated CRP (≥ 1 mg/dL). On multivariate analysis, a CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL was an independent risk factor for HCC recurrence with a 5-year recurrence rate of 27.4% vs. 16.4% (HR 2.33; 95% CI 1.13-4.83; p = 0.022). OS was similar in patients with normal vs. elevated CRP levels.Conclusions:Elevated serum CRP is associated with HCC recurrence after LT and may be a marker for more aggressive tumor biology. Future studies should evaluate whether patients with elevated pre-transplant CRP levels benefit from closer monitoring for HCC recurrence.
