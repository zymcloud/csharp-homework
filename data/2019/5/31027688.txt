Introduction:Median survival of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients is usually around 1 year. The advent of new drugs may have slightly improved their prognosis. We aimed to assess whether SCLC response to chemotherapy and survival had changed over time.Methods:Consecutive SCLC patients were included at Grenoble University Hospital, France. We compared the patients' characteristics, response to chemotherapy and survival between 1997-2009 (period 1) and 2010-2017 (period 2).Results:A total of 529 patients were identified, of whom 498 received a first line of chemotherapy and 279 a second line. The majority (n = 290, 58%) had extensive disease. The objective response rate (ORR) to first-line chemotherapy in metastatic patients was 63% in period 1 and 62% in period 2; the ORRs to second-line chemotherapy were 39% and 29%, respectively. Median overall survival from first-line chemotherapy was 13.2 months (interquartile range [IQR] 7.4-24.4) in period 1 and 11.2 months (IQR 7.1-21.2) in period 2. Mortality in these two periods did not differ significantly even after adjustment for prognostic factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-1.00). The factors independently associated with death were cardiovascular comorbidities (HR = 1.28 [95%CI 1.05-1.55]), liver comorbidities (HR = 1.31 [95%CI 1.03-1.65]), poor ECOG performance status (3-4vs. 0-1, HR = 2.45 [95%CI 1.83-3.30]) and extensive disease (HR = 2.69 [95%CI 2.18-3.33]).Conclusions:Since 1997, there has been no improvement in the survival or response rate to chemotherapy of SCLC patients. There is a desperate need for new approaches in this setting.
