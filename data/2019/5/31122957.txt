A 28-year-old man previously diagnosed and treated for testicular sex cord-stromal tumour (TSCST) presented with symptoms of fever, night sweats and fatigue. Following initial investigations for an infectious aetiology, imaging studies detected two large liver lesions. Histopathological assessment of the tumours revealed that they were metastases from the TSCST for which the patient had radical inguinal orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection 5 years prior. The curative-intent management of the bilobar liver metastases necessitated staged resection due to the chemoresistant and radioresistant properties of TSCST. The size of the lesions was such that procedures to induce rapid liver hypertrophy were required between surgeries. Both liver metastases were successfully removed following this approach. The patient remains recurrence-free 1 year after surgery and has maintained predisease levels of performance. Nevertheless, he continues to be followed for routine CT scans at regular intervals.
