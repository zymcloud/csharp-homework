Backgrounds/aims:Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has evolved and broadened in scope. While open liver resections are currently being performed safely in our hospital, LLRs are being implemented in fewer cases. The aim of this study was to review our initial experience in LLR to assess early outcomes of the procedure.Methods:A retrospective chart review was conducted for 37 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resections for various indications between January 2014 and July 2017 by a single surgeon who had performed 161 open liver resections and 50 live donor hepatectomies during the same period.Results:Of 37 laparoscopic liver resections performed, male to female ratio was 23 to 4. Their mean age was 61.4 years. There were 13 cases of wedge resections, 7 cases of left lateral sectionectomy, 9 cases of left hepatectomy, and 8 cases of right hepatectomy. Pathology included hepatocellular carcinoma (n=20), cholangiocarcinoma (n=3), intrahepatic duct stones (n=6), metastatic liver carcinoma (n=6), primary neuroendocrine tumor of liver (n=1), and huge hemangioma (n=1). The mean operation time was 174.7 minutes (range, 40-410 minutes). Mean blood loss was 200.5 ml (range, 10-2200 ml). There were no open-conversion cases. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications except that a case of severe portal vein stenosis in the laparoscopic right hepatectomy occurred postoperatively. The patient underwent reoperation (portal vein resection and anastomosis, stenting). The mean hospital stay was 8.7 days (range, 2-44 days).Conclusions:Even though our experience in laparoscopic liver resection is still developing, our results are comparable to those of other studies. Therefore, an experienced surgeon in performing open liver resection should be able to perform the laparoscopic liver resection safely.
