We report on the feasibility of C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) parenchymal blood volume imaging (PBVI) performed immediately following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to assess the need for repeat treatment. Eighteen TACE procedures were included. A retrospective assessment was made for the presence or absence of residual disease requiring treatment on immediate post-TACE PBVI and on interval follow-up multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In 9/18 cases, both PBVI and MDCT/MRI showed that no further treatment was required. In 6/18 cases, further treatment was required on both PBVI and MDCT/MRI. In three cases, PBVI showed that further treatment was not required but MDCT/MRI showed residual disease requiring repeat treatment. There were no cases with PBVI showing residual disease not detected on follow-up MDCT/MRI. The PBVI sensitivity for detecting disease requiring repeat TACE was 67% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30-93%), and specificity was 100% (95% CI 66-100%). The use of C-arm CBCT PBVI for the detection of residual viable tumor within a treated lesion immediately after TACE is feasible. It may allow repeat TACE to be planned without performing interval imaging with MDCT or MRI.
