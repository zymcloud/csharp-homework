Background:Current advancements in dynamic contrast imaging of the liver have enabled increased sensitivity in the diagnosis of liver lesions. Evaluation and characterisation of the enhancement pattern of liver lesions in respect to the liver parenchyma aids in making a specific diagnosis.Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine the liver findings on dynamic contrast computed tomography (CT) scanning and correlate them with clinicopathologic findings.Methods:This prospective cross-sectional study included 61 patients and took place between August 2017 and February 2018. Dynamic contrast CT was performed and the images were evaluated by two experienced radiologists. Correlation of the CT findings with histology results from an ultrasound-guided biopsy was done. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0.Results:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the most common malignant lesion seen and showed three patterns of enhancement: homogenous, abnormal internal vessels and heterogeneous enhancement. Abnormal internal vessel pattern was most specific (90.6%) and showed a high positive predictive value (PPV) of 78.6%. Rapid washout showed a specificity of 87.5% and a PPV of 72.2% in the diagnosis of HCC. Dynamic contrast CT scan had a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 50%, PPV of 91% and diagnostic accuracy of 95.5% in differentiation of benign and malignant liver lesions. Considering only Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category 5 as conclusive for HCC diagnosis, our study did not miss a significant number of HCCs. Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System category 5 showed specificity of 81.3% and PPV of 75%.Conclusion:Enhancement patterns on a dynamic contrast CT scan of the liver are useful in the interpretation of CT images for specific diagnoses.
