Background: Oxaliplatin (OXA)-based chemotherapy is critical in the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, acquired drug resistance has largely restricted its clinical efficacy. This study aims to explore the key mechanisms and regulatory factors determining chemosensitivity in HCC. Methods: We developed OXA-resistant (OR) HCC cells and used multiple methods, including real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, transwell invasion assay, wound-healing assay, MTT assay, gene transfection, and immunohistochemistry to achieve our goals. Results: We found that OR HCC cells showed a typical epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. Meanwhile, the expression of Cx32, a major member of the liver connexin (Cx) family, was lowly expressed in OR HCC cells. Downregulation of Cx32 in parental HCC cells led to EMT induction and thereby reduced OXA cytotoxicity, while Cx32 upregulation in OR HCC cells could reverse the EMT phenotype and partially restore chemosensitivity to OXA. Finally, in human HCC tissue samples, Cx32 was positively correlated with the expression of the EMT marker E-cadherin and negatively correlated with the expression of Vimentin. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that downregulation of Cx32 may be an important determinant for HCC cells to acquire EMT-related acquired drug resistance to OXA, and targeting Cx32 could be a novel strategy to overcome OXA resistance in HCC.
