Background & aims:As surrogate markers for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) are convenient to measure under immunosuppression. However, the long-term prognosis of patients who achieve complete biochemical remission (CBR) in comparison with patients who achieve only biochemical remission (BR) is uncertain.Methods:A total of 291 patients (89.7% female) diagnosed with AIH were retrospectively reviewed. CBR was defined as normal ALT and IgG levels with immunosuppression, while BR was defined as normal ALT levels. CBR was further divided into early CBR (Results:With immunosuppressive treatment, 222 (76.3%) patients achieved CBR (early CBR: 168 and late CBR: 54). BR was achieved in 55 (18.9%) patients and 14 (4.8%) patients remained non-remission. With a median follow-up duration of 6.6 years, the risk of liver-related mortality was the lowest in patients with CBR, followed by patients with late CBR, BR and non-response. The cumulative risk of liver-related adverse outcomes was the highest in patients with non-response (8.51/100 person-years [PYs]), followed by BR (1.95/100 PYs), late CBR (1.89/100 PYs) and early CBR (0.75/100 PYs). By multivariable analysis, age, cirrhosis and treatment responses were independently associated with liver-related adverse outcomes.Conclusions:Patients with CBR within 1 year after treatment initiation had the lowest risk of liver-related adverse outcomes. Patients with late CBR and those with only BR had a comparable risk of long-term outcomes.
