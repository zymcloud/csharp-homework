Objective Few reports have analyzed the diagnostic process of carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) or have focused on the frequency of nonmalignant lesions among patients with suspected malignant diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and characteristics of nonmalignant diseases that tend to be mistaken for malignant diseases. Patients We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with suspected CUP who were referred to the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between April 2007 and December 2014. All patients underwent a thorough history and physical examination as well as radiological and ultrasonography imaging tests for the CUP diagnostic work up. Results Among 830 patients with suspected CUP, 46 were diagnosed with nonmalignant diseases, and 780 were diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm (409 neoplasms with detected primary site and 371 CUP neoplasms). Four patients discontinued the diagnostic workup because they refused further examinations or had a poor general status. The final diagnosis of the 46 patients with nonmalignant disease comprised 10 benign tumors, 10 benign diseases, and 26 with no evidence of disease. The nonmalignant tumors comprised three hemangiomas, two schwannomas, two uterine myomas, two pseudomyxoma peritonei, one lymphangioma, one meningioma, and one poroma. Conclusion The incidence of nonmalignant diseases among patients with suspected CUP was 46 out of 830 patients in our institution. It is important to perform a thorough pathological examination in the CUP diagnostic workup. To confirm a diagnosis, some patients may need to visit specialized institutions, especially those with liver and bone lesions.
