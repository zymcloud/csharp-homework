Background:While achieving sustained virological response (SVR) following interferon-based or direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA) treatments reduces the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), an increase in unexpected early occurrence or recurrence of HCC after hepatitis C virus elimination by DAA treatments has been reported. We prospectively investigated the incidence and risk factors of HCC after DAA treatment in a large multicenter cohort in Japan.Methods:Patients with chronic hepatitis C with or without cirrhosis who were treated with DAAs and obtained SVR were enrolled. DAAs were administered for 3 or 6 months. A total of 2552 patients were enrolled.Results:Of these, 70 patients (2.7%) developed HCC. The 12-, 24-, and 36-month cumulative HCC incidences were 1.3%, 2.9%, and 4.9% in all patients; 2.5%, 5.2%, and 10.0% in those with cirrhosis; and 0.9%, 2.1%, and 2.9% in those without cirrhosis, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed age, sex, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level, and fibrosis-4 index to be independent factors associated with HCC. Patients with these four factors had an approximately six-to-sevenfold increased risk for HCC development. Five patients with large and early tumor occurrence did not receive contrast imaging examinations before treatment.Conclusion:Although the results of our prospective study suggested that achieving SVR by DAA treatment reduces the incidence of HCC, HCC development still occurs. Careful follow-up is important in patients with risk factors.
