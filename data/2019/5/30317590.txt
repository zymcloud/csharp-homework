Increasing evidence has demonstrated that abnormal expression of lncRNA is correlated with various malignant tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our current study was aimed to investigate the role of LINC00707 in HCC development. We observed that LINC00707 was upregulated in HCC cell lines compared with normal liver cell lines. Then, Hep3B cells and SNU449 cells were infected with LV-shLINC00707 and LV-LINC00707. LINC00707 silencing could greatly repress the proliferation and colony formation of HCC cells in vitro. On the contrary, overexpression of LINC00707 induced HCC cell proliferation and colony formation. In addition, HCC cell apoptosis was significantly enhanced and HCC cell cycle was blocked in G1 phase by LV-shLINC00707. Hep3B cells and SNU449 cell invasion capacity was restrained by the knockdown of LINC00707, whereas upregulation of LINC00707 exhibited an opposite phenomenon. Accumulating evidence has reported that ERK/JNK/AKT signaling is involved in multiple cancers, including HCC. Here, in our study, we identified that ERK/JNK/AKT signaling was dramatically restrained by silencing of LINC00707 while activated by LV-LINC00707 in HCC cells. Subsequently, an in vivo experiment was conducted, and it demonstrated that LINC00707 could modulate HCC development through activating ERK/JNK/AKT signaling. Taking the above results together, it was implied in our study that LINC00707 contributed to HCC progression through modulating the ERK/JNK/AKT pathway.
