Background:Deficiency in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), a condition commonly noticed in liver damage, inflammation, and malnutrition, has previously been associated with impaired prognosis in different malignancies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of pretreatment serum BChE levels as a prognostic biomarker in patients with cervical cancer treated with primary (chemotherapy-[chemo-])radiation therapy.Methods:We retrospectively evaluated data of a consecutive series of patients with cervical cancer treated with primary (chemo-)radiation therapy between 1998 and 2015. Pretreatment serum BChE levels were correlated with clinico-pathological parameters and response to treatment. Uni- and multivariate survival analyses were performed to assess the association between decreased serum BChE levels and progression-free (PFS), cancer-specific (CSS), and overall survival (OS).Results:A total of 356 patients were eligible for inclusion into the present study. The median (IQR) pretreatment serum BChE level was 6180 (4990-7710) IU/l. Lower serum BChE levels were associated with lower BMI (p < 0.001), advanced tumor stage (p = 0.04), poor treatment response (p = 0.002), the occurrence of disease recurrence (p = 0.003), and the risk of death (p < 0.001). In uni- and multivariate analyses, low pretreatment serum BChE levels were independently associated with shorter PFS (HR 1.8 [1.2-2.6]; p = 0.002), CSS (HR 2.2 [1.4-3.5], p < 0.001), and OS (HR 2.0 [1.4-2.9]; p < 0.001).Conclusions:Low pretreatment serum BChE levels are associated with advanced tumor stage and poor response to treatment, and serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for shorter PFS, CSS, and OS in patients with cervical cancer treated with primary (chemo-)radiation therapy.
