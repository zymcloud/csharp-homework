The long non-coding RNA DUXAP10 has been involved in the development, progression, and metastasis in several human cancers, but its biological function and underlying mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still undetermined. The present study was proposed to explore the effect of DUXAP10 on the growth and metastasis of HCC cells and the potential mechanisms involved. The results showed that DUXAP10 is dramatically elevated in HCC tumor tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of DUXAP10 by DUXAP10 si-RNA significantly inhibited the cell viability, proliferation and induce the apoptosis of HCC cell line. Meanwhile, inhibition of DUXAP10 attenuates the cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. No significant change of JNK MAPK pathway was detected in DUXAP10 siRNA transfected HCC cell lines. The β-catenin and pAkt levels were decreased in the Hep G2+DUXAP10 siRNA and SMMC7721+DUXAP10 siRNA groups, while the activation of Wnt/β-catenin or PI3K/Akt suppressed the inhibition of DUXAP10 siRNA on cell proliferation and migration. Collectively, DUXAP10 plays a critical role in regulating HCC development, potentially by regulating EMT and cell proliferation through the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Inhibition of DUXAP10 in HCC HepG2 cells could attenuate the EMT and cell proliferation and invasion. Therefore, DUXAP10 might be a promising therapy target to inhibit the growth of HCC.
