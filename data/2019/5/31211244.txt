LTX-401 is a novel oncolytic compound designed for the local treatment of solid tumors. In the present study, we have examined the applicability and efficacy of LTX-401 in a rat model JM1 hepatocellular carcinoma, with particular interest in its ability to induce antitumor immunity. LTX-401 induces necrotic cell death followed by the release of immunogenic cell death mediators such as high-mobility group box 1 protein, ATP, and cytochrome c. When injected into subcutaneous and orthotopic JM1 tumors, LTX-401 treatment resulted in a strong antitumoral effect followed by complete tumor regression in the majority of animals. Additionally, LTX-401 could affect the growth of distal tumor deposits simulating metastases, hence indicating immune-mediated abscopal responses. Furthermore, LTX-401 treatment induced tumor-specific immune responses as seen by protection against tumor rechallenge and increased production of interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) by splenic cells in response to stimulation with tumor cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the oncolytic compound LTX-401 provides local tumor control followed by protective immune responses and may be exploited as a novel immunotherapeutic agent in hepatocellular carcinoma.
