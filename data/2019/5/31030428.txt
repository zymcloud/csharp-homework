Objective:To assess the association of KIR/HLA alleles with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among ethnic Han Chinese patients from southern China.Methods:For 95 patients with HCC and 171 healthy controls, the genotype of HLA-C alleles was determined with a PCR sequence-specific oligonucleotides typing method on an Illumina GenDx NGSgo platform. Genotypes comprised of HLA-C and KIR gene alleles were also subjected to statistical analysis.Results:In total 16 KIR genes (2DL2, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS5, 3DS1, 2DS1, 2DL5, 2DS4, 3DL1, 3DP1, 2DL3, 2DP1, 3DL3, 2DL1, 3DL2 and 2DL4) were discovered in the two groups. The frequencies of KIR2DL3 alleles and combinational genotypes of KIR2DL3/HLA-C1C2 were significantly lower in the patient group compared with the controls (0.9368 vs. 0.9883, χ²>3.84; P3.84; PConclusion:Above results suggested that the KIR2DL3 allele is associated with lower risk for HCC. There may be individual difference in patients with HCC and HBV infection but various combinations of KIR/HLA alleles.
