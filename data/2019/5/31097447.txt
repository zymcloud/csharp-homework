Iron overload in the liver causes oxidative stress and inflammation, which result in organ dysfunction, making it a risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary iron restriction on disease progression in rats fed a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet. Male F344 rats were fed a choline-sufficient amino acid-defined (control) diet, a CDAA diet or an iron-restricted CDAA diet for 4, 8 and 12 weeks. At each time point, hepatic iron levels, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The iron-restricted CDAA diet significantly decreased serum iron levels for 12 weeks compared with the CDAA diet. Histological analysis confirmed that feeding with the CDAA diet induced hepatic iron overload and that this was associated with oxidative stress (number of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive cells), inflammation (CD68 positive area) and fibrosis (Sirius Red positive area). Iron restriction with the CDAA diet significantly led to a reduction in the hepatic iron levels, oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. Therefore, dietary iron restriction could be a useful therapeutic approach for NASH patients with hepatic iron overload.
