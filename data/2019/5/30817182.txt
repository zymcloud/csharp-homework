This study was conducted to observe the effect and possible mechanism of TO901317 in vivo and in vitro to provide a new basis for the targeted therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expressions of liver X receptor (LXR)-α, glucose transporter (Glut)-1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 were analyzed from HCC public database (NCBI PubMed database). The result showed that LXRα was downregulated, whereas Glut1, PCNA, and MMP9 were upregulated in human HCC compared with normal liver. Furthermore, LXRα mRNA was negatively correlated with Glut1 mRNA. At the same time, HCC cells were cultivated in vitro and axillary injected in nude mice to establish the xenograft model. The xenograft in the TO901317-treated group was slower and smaller than the control group. The protein expression of LXRα, Glut1, and MMP9 could be detected by Western blot and glucose level. As a result, TO901317 could inhibit the cell proliferation of HCC in a dose-dependent manner by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. With the increase of TO901317 concentration, the cellular glucose concentration and ATP level were gradually decreased. Western blot results showed TO901317 could upregulate LXRα expression but downregulate MMP9 and Glut1 expression. Transwell and wound-healing analysis confirmed that, by increasing the concentration of TO901317, the cell invasion and migration were both decreased. LXRα small-interfering RNA (siRNA) could relieve the suppression effect of TO901317 on the cell invasion and migration and the expression of LXRα, Glut1, and MMP9. The glucose concentration was also raised. TO901317 could repress the progress of HCC cells by reducing the glucose concentration, upregulating LXRα expression, but downregulating the expression of Glut1 and MMP9. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This subject confirmed that TO901317, a specific liver X receptor agonist, could inhibit the progression of liver cancer through upregulating liver X receptor-α, downregulating the expression of glucose transporter-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9, and decreasing the glucose content in SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells.
