Background:99mTc-labelled methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) uptake can occasionally be identified in extraosseous neoplasms on whole-body scans (WBSs) and may be misinterpreted as bone metastasis. The purpose of our study was to investigate the frequency of 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms and to assess the additional value of SPECT/CT for the localization and characterization of this unusual uptake.Methods:Data from 7308 patients (SPECT/CT was performed in 2147 patients) with known cancer who underwent WBSs for metastatic work-up between May 2015 and July 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The locations, numbers, and intensities of extraosseous 99mTc-MDP uptake were evaluated by WBS, and the intratumoural calcification was evaluated by SPECT/CT. The diagnostic accuracy of SPECT/CT in locating 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms was compared to that of WBS.Results:A total of 41 patients showed 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms. Of these patients, 23 patients had uncertain lesions by WBS, and further SPECT/CT was performed. The incidence of 99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms was observed to be 0.6% by WBS and 1.1% (by) SPECT/CT. During imaging analysis, WBS had an accuracy of only 35% (14/40), whereas SPECT/CT correctly located and diagnosed all 40 lesion sites in the 23 patients. Twenty-three lesion sites (57.5%, 23/40) showed moderate or high intensity of extraosseous 99mTc-MDP uptake. Of the 23 patients, 17 patients (73.9%, 18/23) with 31 lesion sites (77.5%, 31/40) presented with intratumoural calcification.Conclusions:99mTc-MDP uptake in extraosseous neoplasms can be observed as 0.6% on WBS and is usually localized to the breast, liver, and lung. Nuclear physicians should be familiar with such extraosseous uptake when interpreting WBSs. SPECT/CT offers better accuracy than WBS alone for locating the majority of lesions present with intratumoural calcification.
