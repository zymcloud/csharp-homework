Aims: This study was designed to determine if vitamin D receptor (VDR), carrier globulin/binding protein (GC), and cytochrome P-450 family 2, subfamily R, polypeptide 1 (CYP2R1) gene polymorphisms are risk factors in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients from Northeast India. Materials and Methods: A total of 351 HCV-infected patients were enrolled of which 167 were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), 124 with liver cirrhosis (LC), and 60 with HCC together with 102 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. VDR (BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI), GC (rs4588, rs7051), and CYP2R1 (rs10741657) gene polymorphisms were genotyped for all subjects. Statistical data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 22.0. Results: The frequency of the ApaI CC genotype, ApaI C allele, and bAt haplotype of the VDR gene was significantly higher in HCC and LC patients than controls. After adjusting for other covariates (age, gender, platelet count, AST, ALT, serum albumin, and viral load) logistic regression analysis showed that the ApaI CC genotype and bAt haplotype were independent predictors of HCC development. No significant associations was found for the GC and CYP2R1 polymorphisms examined with the occurrence of HCC. Conclusions: The presence of the VDR ApaI CC genotype and bAt haplotype appear to be important indicators in the development of HCC among HCV-infected patients. Larger studies are needed to further clarify and establish this potential causal relationship.
