Background:This study evaluated the functions of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and assessed the effects of MMP2 on HCC cell sensitivity to cisplatin.Methodology:HepG2 and Huh7 cells were cultured. A pre-experiment was performed to explore the optimal transduction conditions of the MMP2-siRNA lentivirus (si-MMP2). Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot assays were performed to measure the expression levels of MMP2 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. An MTT assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation, and flow cytometry analysis was applied to examine cell apoptosis. A Transwell assay was carried out to assess cell invasion.Results:The optimal virus:cell ratio was 100 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for both cells, and the optimal transduction times for HepG2 and Huh7 cells were 48 h and 72 h, respectively. MMP2 knockdown significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of MMP2 in both cell lines (PConclusion:MMP2 may act as an oncogene and may be a potential therapeutic target in HCC.
