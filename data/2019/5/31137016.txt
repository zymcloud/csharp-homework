Circular RNA (circRNA) exerts an essential role in tumor development. Hsa_circ_0001649 (circ-0001649) was produced at the SHPRH gene locus containing exon 26-29. This study analyzed the specific mechanism of circ-0001649 in influencing the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Relative levels of circ-0001649 in HCC cell lines and tissues were examined by qRT-PCR. The direct binding between circ-0001649 and miR-127-5p/miR-612/miR-4688 were verified through Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and western blot detection. In vitro and in vivo regulatory roles of circ-0001649 in proliferative and migratory abilities of HCC were evaluated by EdU, Transwell and tumourigenicity assay, respectively. Results showed that circ-0001649 was markedly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and tumor tissues. Overexpression of circ-0001649 greatly inhibited proliferation and migration of HCC in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, we confirmed that circ-0001649 regulated cellular behaviors of HCC cells by targeting SHPRH. Furthermore, we determined that circ-0001649 served as a ceRNA to sponge miR-127-5p, miR-612 and miR-4688, thus activating SHPRH. In summary, our study showed that circ-0001649 was lowly expressed in HCC and inhibited HCC progression via multiple miRNAs sponge.
