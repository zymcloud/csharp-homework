The problem of HBV and HCV infections in addition to the HIV-infection in sub-Saharan African countries remains important due to the high prevalence and mortality after fast progressing fibrogenesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite of the large number of investigations on diagnostics and prediction of the disease course, the exact role of the proinflammatory influence of IP-10 and IL-17A on the fibrogenesis during HIV/HBV-co-infection is still unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate IP-10 and IL-17A concentration in blood serum among HIV/HBV patients to consider their potential role in improvement of diagnostics of liver fibrosis progression. 53 HIV/HBV patients of Lewanika General Hospital (West Zambia) and 21 healthy blood donors were checked for serological markers, liver biopsy and IP-10, IL-17A in blood serum. The obtained results were analyzed by statistical package SPSS 12.0. Mean IP-10 was 753,6 pg/ml among HIV/HBV co-infected patients with F3-4 and it was reliably higher than in F1-2 patients and healthy responders (р=0,005). This group had also higher level of IL-17A (37,54 pg/ml) than comparison groups (р=0,032). We found out strong correlation between increasing IP-10 (r=0,6), IL-17A (r=0,52) and fibrotic severity (р
