Aim:To compare the therapeutic efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria with or without the use of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).Materials and methods:Patients with HCC within the Milan criteria who underwent conventional angiography-guided TACE (Angio-TACE group: 58 patients from January 2010 to December 2011) were compared with those who underwent CBCT-guided TACE (CBCT-TACE group: 55 patients from January 2013 to December 2014). Local progression-free survival (LPFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared. Adverse events after TACE were also investigated.Results:Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. LPFS was significantly longer in the CBCT-TACE group than in the Angio-TACE group (median: not reached for 36 versus 19.2 months, respectively; Log-rank p=0.029). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, CBCT guidance had a significantly lower risk of local progression or death (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.585; 95% confidence interval, 0.344-0.995; p=0.048); however, there was no significant difference in PFS (3-year PFS: 15.9% versus 26.8%, respectively; p=0.122) or OS (3-year OS: 85% versus 88.2%, respectively; p=0.761) between the Angio-TACE and CBCT-TACE groups. Post-embolisation syndrome occurred significantly less frequently in the CBCT-TACE group (p=0.002).Conclusion:CBCT-guided TACE could improve local tumour control for HCC within Milan criteria and showed fewer cases of post-embolisation syndrome.
