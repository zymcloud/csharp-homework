Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world. Dysregulation of mRNAs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) plays critical roles in the progression of HCC. Here, we investigated HCC samples by RNA-seq and identified a series of dysregulated RNAs in HCC. Various bioinformatics analyses established long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-mRNA co-expression and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks in circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis, indicating the potential cis and/or trans regulatory roles of lncRNAs and circRNAs. Moreover, GO pathway analysis showed that these identified RNAs were associated with many biological processes that were related to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. In conclusion, we systematically established functional networks of lncRNA-mRNA, circRNA-miRNA-mRNA to further unveil the potential interactions and biological processes in HCC. These results provide further insights into gene expression network of HCC and may assist future diagnosis of HCC.
