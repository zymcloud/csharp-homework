Interest in cancer metabolism has increased in recent years. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a major glucose catabolism pathway that directs glucose flux to its oxidative branch and leads to the production of a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and nucleic acid. The PPP serves a vital role in regulating cancer cell growth and involves many enzymes. The aim of the present review was to describe the recent discoveries associated with the deregulatory mechanisms of the PPP and glycolysis in malignant tumors, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, breast and lung cancer.
