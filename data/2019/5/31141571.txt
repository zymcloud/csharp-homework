The utility of glypican-3 (GPC3) expression for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to identify associations between the presence of GPC3-positive CTCs and clinicopathological factors of these patients, furthermore, to evaluate whether CTC can predict microscopic portal vein invasion (mPVI). This study was done on 85 patients who underwent hepatectomy as the first-line treatment and whose preoperative imaging showed no evidence of macroscopic PVI and distant metastases. Peripheral blood was collected from all patients immediately before surgery. Cells were purified initially by density gradient centrifugation followed by immunomagnetic positive enrichment based upon the expression of GPC3. The numbers of CTCs contained in the enriched samples were enumerated via flow cytometry. Protocol validation using HepG2 cells spiked into 8.0 mL of blood from a healthy volunteer indicated that we were able to recover 12.1% of the tumor cells. A median number of 3 CTCs (range: 0-27) was detected in the 8.0 mL of peripheral blood of the 85 analyzed HCC patients. Thirty-three patients had CTCs â‰¥5, and these patients had a higher incidence of mPVI (p
