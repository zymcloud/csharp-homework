Prediction of prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has shown an important role in improving treatment outcomes and preventing disease progression, however, the prognostic indicator of HCC is still lacking. The purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive value of GLR (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase to lymphocyte count ratio) in single HCC with a tumor size (TS) ≤ 5 cm. A retrospective analysis was performed on 272 patients with TS ≤ 5 cm who underwent radical resection. The Pearson χ2 test was applied to discuss the relationship between HCC and GLR, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Then univariate and multivariate analysis was utilized to predict the risk factors for survival prognosis in patients. In this study, GLR showed a positive relation with tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, microvascular invasion, early recurrence, and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, while the AFP value only correlated with drinking. Elevated GLR value had poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of TS ≤ 5 cm HCC patients, GLR level and tumor size were closely related to the prognosis of small HCC patients compared with AFP. GLR may serve as a prognostic marker for dynamic monitoring of HCC patients with single TS ≤ 5 cm after radical resection.
