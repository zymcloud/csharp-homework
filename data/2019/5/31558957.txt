Sarcomas are connective tissue tumors accounting for only 1% of all adult malignancies. Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a sarcoma arising from smooth muscle cells, and accounts for 10-20% of all sarcomas. A subtype of LMS are those originating from the smooth muscle of blood vessels. Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava is a sarcomatous tumor, with less than 350 cases described in the literature. It carries a poor prognosis, with 5- and 10-year survival rates of 31.4% and 7.4%, respectively. We present a case of a 46-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with mild abdominal pain and distention, early satiety, and weight loss for three weeks, found to have unresectable metastatic leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava.
