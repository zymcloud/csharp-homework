Imaging and pathology can be considered as two sides of the same diagnostic coin. Yet, pathology remains the gold-standard technique for the diagnosis of most diseases. Nevertheless, significant and constant progress in imaging has been made thanks to fruitful rad-path correlations. The aim of this article is to show how much imaging has benefited from pathology and to illustrate the different ways in which imaging has evolved according to different types of pathological references. Imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma shows how image-based knowledge and expertise can be exploited to yield a non-invasive diagnosis approaching that of a fixed, robust pathological reference. Hepatocellular adenomas provide an example of the constant radiological evolutions triggered by changing pathological definitions. Finally, hepatic steatosis illustrates the possibility for imaging to surpass its historical reference, and become a new gold-standard. For these three examples, we have taken a historical approach to demonstrate how rad-path interminglement creates knowledge.
