Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major causative agent of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The rapid progress in the development of direct-acting antivirals has greatly elevated the cure rate to â‰¥95% in recent years. However, the high cost of treatment is not affordable to patients in some countries, necessitating the development of less expensive treatment.Methods:We adopted a cell culture-derived HCV system to screen a library of the pure compounds extracted from herbs deposited in the chemical bank of the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Taiwan.Results:We found that saikosaponin B2 inhibited viral entry, replication, and translation. Saikosaponin B2 is a plant glycoside and a component of xiao-chai-hu-tang, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine extracted from the roots of Bupleurum falcatum. It also inhibited daclatasvir-resistant mutant strains of HCV, especially in combination with daclatasvir.Conclusion:Our results may aid the development of a new combination therapy useful for patients with HCV who are intolerant or refractory to the currently available medications, including pegylated interferon and direct-acting antiviral agents.
