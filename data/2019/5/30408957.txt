Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infects 10-20 million individuals worldwide and causes severe fulminant hepatitis with high likelihood of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HDV infection cannot occur in the absence of the surface antigen (HBsAg) of the hepatitis B virus. RNA interference is an effective mechanism by which to inhibit viral transcripts, and siRNA therapeutics sharing this mechanism have begun to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Here we assessed the outcome of HBV-targeting siRNA intervention against HDV and compared it to a direct anti-HDV siRNA approach in dually infected humanized mice. Treatment with ARB-1740, a clinical stage HBV-targeting siRNA agent delivered using lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology, effectively reduced HBV viremia by 2.3 log10 and serum HBsAg by 2.6 log10, leading to 1.6 log10 reduction of HDV viremia. In contrast, HDV-targeting siRNA inhibited HDV in both blood and liver compartments without affecting HBV and PEGylated interferon-alpha reduced HBV viremia by 2.0 log10 but had no effect on HDV viremia under these study conditions. These results illustrate the inhibitory effects of siRNAs against these two viral infections and suggest that ARB-1740 may be of therapeutic benefit for hepatitis delta patients, a subpopulation with high unmet medical need.
