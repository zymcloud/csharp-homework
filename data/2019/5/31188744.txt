Purpose We aimed to determine optimal cut-off points of plasma levels of ghrelin and serum levels of pepsinogen I, II, and their ratio for screening of gastric cancer (GC). Methods Blood samples were taken from 41 patients with confirmed gastric cancer along with 82 patients without malignancy. Serum levels of pepsinogen I and II, plus plasma levels of acylated ghrelin were measured using commercial ELISA kits. Results The case group had significant lower plasma levels of ghrelin, pepsinogen I, and pepsinogen I/II ratio in comparison to the control group (P<0.001). In the control group, there was significant higher serum pepsinogen I (P=0.028) and pepsinogen II (P=0.003) and lower pepsinogen I/II ratio (P=0.020) in males versus females; significantly higher serum pepsinogen II (P=0.047) and lower pepsinogen I/II ratio (P=0.030) in overweight compared to normal weight patients; and significantly lower pepsinogen I/II ratio (P=0.030) in smokers versus non-smoker. In the case group, there was only significantly lower pepsinogen I (P=0.006) in males versus females, and significantly lower plasma ghrelin (P=0.017) in overweight compared to normal weight patients. The characteristic curve analysis indicated that pepsinogen I at a cut-off of 70.95 Î¼g/L and pepsinogen I/II ratio at cut-off of 2.99, had good sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions Just serums levels of pepsinogen I and the ratio of pepsinogen I/II can be used as biomarker to screen GC.
