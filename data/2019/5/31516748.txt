Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism whereby HBx modulates the targeting of NUSAP1 by miR-18b to enhance hepatocarcinogenesis.Methods:We employed an integrated approach of bioinformatics analysis and molecular experiments in hepatoma cells, HBV transgenic mice, and clinical liver cancer tissues to investigate the role of HBx-regulated miR-18b in the development of liver cancer.Results:In this study, we report that the HBx-mediated tumor suppressor miR-18b modulates hepatocarcinogenesis during the host-HBV interaction. The expression levels of miR-18b were lower in clinical HBV-positive liver cancer tissues and liver tissues of HBV-transgenic mice. Interestingly, HBx inhibited miR-18b expression by inducing the methylation of CpG islands in its promoter. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that HBx enhanced hepatocarcinogenesis by increasing the expression of target genes of miR-18b. Moreover, we identified nucleolar spindle-associated protein 1 (NUSAP1) as one of the target genes of miR-18b. NUSAP1 was expressed at high levels in liver cancer tissues. Interestingly, HBx up-regulated NUSAP1 by suppressing miR-18b. Functionally, miR-18b significantly inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma cells by depressing NUSAP1 levels in vivo and in vitro.Conclusions:Thus, we conclude that the targeting of NUSAP1 mRNA by the tumor suppressor miR-18b is controlled by HBx-modulated promoter methylation during the host-virus interaction, leading to hepatocarcinogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which HBx-mediated miRNAs modulate hepatocarcinogenesis.
