Background:R1 vascular resection for liver tumors was introduced in the early twenty-first century. However, its oncologic adequacy remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the oncologic adequacy of R1 vascular hepatectomy in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.Methods:A prospective cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma resected between the years 2005 and 2015 was reviewed. R0 was any resection with a minimum 1 mm of negative margin. R1 vascular was any resection with tumor exposure attributable to the detachment from major intrahepatic vessel. R1 parenchymal was any resection with tumor exposure at parenchymal margin. The end points were the calculation of the local recurrence of R0, R1 parenchymal, and R1 vascular hepatectomy and their prognostic significances.Results:We analyzed 327 consecutive patients with 532 hepatocellular carcinoma and 448 resection areas. We found that 205 (63%) resulted R0, 56 (17%) resulted R1 parenchymal, 50 (15%) resulted R1 vascular, and 16 (5%) resulted both R1 parenchymal and R1 vascular. After a median follow-up of 33.5 months (range 6.1-107.6), the 5-year overall survival rates were 54%, 30%, 65%, and 36%, respectively for R0, R1 parenchymal, R1 vascular, and R1 parenchymal + R1 vascular (P = .031). Local recurrence rates were 3%, 14%, 4%, and 19%, respectively for R0, R1 parenchymal, R1 vascular, and R1 parenchymal + R1 vascular (P = .001) per patient, and 4%, 4%, 12%, and 18%, respectively for R0, R1 vascular, R1 parenchymal, and R1 parenchymal + R1 vascular (P = .001) per resection area. At multivariate analysis R1 parenchymal and R1 vascular + R1 parenchymal were independent detrimental factors.Conclusion:R1 vascular hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma is not associated with increased local recurrence or decreased survival. Thus, detachment of hepatocellular carcinoma from intrahepatic vessels should be considered oncologically adequate.
