Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more frequently observed and aggressive in men compared with women. Increasing evidence demonstrates that the sex disparity appears to be mediated by the stimulatory effects of androgens and the protective effects of estrogen in the development and progression of HCC. In the past few decades, studies on the sex difference of HCC mainly focused on the effect of sex hormones on the transactivation of hepatitis B virus X protein and the release of inflammatory cytokines, and these studies have further intensified in recent years. Sex hormones are also involved in genetic alterations and DNA damage repair in hepatocytes through binding to their specific cellular receptors and affecting the corresponding signaling pathways. Furthermore, the theory of sex chromosomes participating in HCC has been considered. The present review discussed the recent advances in the molecular mechanisms of sex disparity in HCC, with the aim of improving the understanding of the underlying critical factors and exploring more effective methods for the prevention and treatment of HCC.
