Hepatitis B infection is a major global health problem and a primary cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While various antiviral treatments have been explored, there is not yet a reliable method for preventing the progression of chronic hepatitis B infection into HCC. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) plays a major role in viral replication, chronic inflammation and the pathogenicity of chronic liver disease. Modulation of purinergic receptors using their specific agonists has become a popular new strategy for modifying disease processes. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of the P2Y11 receptor using its specific antagonist NF157 in some key aspects of HBx-induced liver disease in human MIHA hepatocytes, including mitochondrial dysfunction due to compromised mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), oxidative stress resulting from overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased antioxidant glutathione (GSH), production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2), as well as activation of cellular signaling pathways including the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38/MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. Our findings present a novel new strategy for the treatment and prevention of chronic liver infection and subsequent morbidities induced by HBx via specific antagonism of the P2Y11 purinergic receptor.
