Interleukin-37 (IL-37) has recently been recognized as a strong anti-inflammatory cytokine having anti-tumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. HCC is a typical inflammation-related cancer, and genetic variations within the IL-37 gene may be associated with the risk of HBV infection. Identification of the allelic patterns that genetically have a high disease risk is essential for the development of preventive diagnostics for HBV-mediated liver disease pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IL-37 gene and disease sequelae associated with HBV infection. We genotyped ten IL-37 SNPs in 1274 patients infected with HBV and 599 healthy controls from a Saudi Arabian population. Among the selected SNPs, two SNPs (rs2723175 and rs2708973) were strongly associated with HBV infection, and six SNPs (rs2723176, rs2723175, rs2723186, rs364030, rs28947200, rs4392270) were associated with HBV clearance, comparing healthy controls and HBV infected-patients respectively. A suggestive association of rs4849133 was identified with active HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier and HBV-related liver disease progression. In conclusion, our findings suggest that variations at the IL-37 gene may be useful as genetic predictive risk factors for HBV infection and HBV-mediated liver disease progression in the Saudi Arabian population.
