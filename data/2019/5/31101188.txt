Aim:This study aims to evaluate survival rates in elderly patients after liver transplantation (LT) and to analyze the factors associated with mortality.Patients and methods:Our study includes 535 patients over the age of 18 who had undergone LT in our clinic between June 2004 and January 2018. Data were collected prospectively and scanned retrospectively. Data concerning the patients' age, sex, LT indication, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, presence of hepatocellular cancer (HCC), coexisting disease, LT types, and post-transplant survival were investigated. The patients were grouped under 2 categories (18-59 years of age and 60 years of age and over) and were compared in terms of their characteristics. In patients aged 60 and over, the causes of mortality and related factors were investigated.Results:The study included 535 patients, 458 (85.6%) of whom were between 18 and 59 years of age and 77 (14.4%) were over 60 years of age. The median follow-up period was 86.7 (1 to 247) months. The elderly group's survival rate was significantly lower than that of the younger group (P = .002). In elderly patients, survival rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 67.4%, 56.4%, 53.8%, and 46.1%, respectively.Conclusion:In elderly patients, factors that increase post-LT mortality require thorough consideration. Equally important is the physiological status of the candidates for transplantation. Correct patient selection in the preoperative stage and good postoperative care can provide successful survival results in elderly patients.
