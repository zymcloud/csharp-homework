EndMT has an important effect on metastasis and progression of tumor. This work will elucidate the effect of miR-494 on EndMT and development of HCC. Therefore, the differential miRNA expression among non-tumorous, para-tumorous and tumorous tissues was analyzed. Moreover, luciferase activities of SIRT3 3'UTR treated with miR-494 were determined. Then human hepatoma cell lines were dealt with mimics or inhibitors of miR-494, migration and proliferation ability were assessed. The expression of SIRT3 and markers of mesenchymal cell were analyzed. The influences of miR-494 on development of HCC through inducing EndMT by targeting SIRT3 and TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathways in hepatoma cell lines were investigated. Xenograft mice were used to explore the potential roles of miR-494 on EndMT and development of HCC in vivo. Our results showed that, compared with non-tumorous tissues, 17 miRNAs were upregulated and 3 miRNAs were down-regulated in tumor tissues. In tumor tissues, the miR-494 expression level was much more than the expression of para-tumorous and non-tumorous tissues. MiR-494 suppressed SIRT3 expression, additionally enhanced expression of mesenchymal cell markers, while exerted effects on cell proliferation and migration of hepatoma cell lines. Moreover, the antagomir of miR-494 could protect against development process in xenogarft murine model. In conclusions, our work demonstrated that miR-494 targeted to SIRT3, and was a crucial mediator of EndMT and development of HCC through regulating SIRT3/TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. It suggested that aim at SIRT3/TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway through suppressing the miR-494 expression level, was a feasible therapy strategy for HCC.
