Serotonin and its receptors have been shown to play critical regulatory roles in cancer biology. Nevertheless, the contributions of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1D (5-HT1D), an indispensable member of the serotonergic system, to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that the 5-HT1D expression level was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. The 5-HT1D expression level was closely correlated with unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics. Survival analyses show that elevated 5-HT1D expression level predicts poor overall survival and high recurrence probability in HCC patients. Functional studies revealed that 5-HT1D significantly promoted HCC proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 5-HT1D could stabilize PIK3R1 by inhibiting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The interaction between 5-HT1D and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) enhanced the expression of FoxO6 through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway; FoxO6 could also be directly transcriptionally activated by 5-HT1D in an Akt-independent manner. MicroRNA-599 was found to be an upstream suppressive modulator of 5-HT1D. Additionally, 5-HT1D could attenuate tryptophan hydroxylase 1 expression through the PI3K/Akt/cut-like homeobox 1 axis in HCC. Conclusion: Herein, we uncovered the potent oncogenic effect of 5-HT1D on HCC by interacting with PIK3R1 to activate the PI3K/Akt/FoxO6 pathway, and provided a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
