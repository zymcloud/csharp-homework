Analysis and comparison of gene expression profile among molecules, correlated with essential and crucial biological processes, is of primary importance in cancer research, since it provides significant info regarding the resistance to chemo/radiotherapy, risk for relapse or prediction of metastasis etc. In this study, gene expression profile is used for discriminating efficiently colon cancer cell lines from normal cells and cancer cells in blood samples of colon cancer patients and categorizing different types of gastrointestinal cancer. In particular, blood samples were collected from normal donors as well as from colon cancer patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and gene expression analysis was performed for more than fifty genes. The same assays were performed for commercial cancer cell lines representing different types of gastrointestinal cancer. In order to examine whether the comparison of gene expression profile can lead to a thorough discrimination between cancer and normal states as well as between different cancer types, we performed clustering analysis based on hierarchical, and k-means algorithms. The clustering analysis efficiently separated: a) colon cancer cell lines from colon patients' samples, b) normal from the colon cancer samples, c) gastric and pancreatic cancer from liver and colon types based. The exploitation of gene expression profile can be successfully used for the discrimination between normal vs cancer samples and/or for categorizing various types of cancer. This of course has important implications in cancer management since it enables the quick discrimination based on cells, isolated from bloodstream, needless of tissue examination or protocols requiring specialized equipment.
