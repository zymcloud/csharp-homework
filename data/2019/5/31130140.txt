Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma in children with hepatitis B virus infection is rarely reported. Metastases to the vertebrae are an even more unusual phenomenon.Case presentation:We report on a case of a 10-year-old Ethiopian boy with hepatitis B infection presenting with paraplegia and incontinence of 10 days' duration. A diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with vertebral metastases was confirmed with serum Î±-fetoprotein, fine-needle aspirate cytology, and abdominal imaging.Conclusion:Surveillance of children not immunized against hepatitis B virus prevents infection and its complications, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Among children in endemic countries prone to development of hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic disease can present as sudden weakness of extremities with radiologic findings of vertebral body collapse.
