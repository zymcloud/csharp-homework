Interferon alpha (IFN-α) is a glycoprotein with antitumor, antiviral, and immunomodulatory activity, used widely in the treatment of viral infections (hepatitis B and C, condylomata acuminata, herpes zoster, etc.), hematological disorders (leukemia, multiple myeloma, T cell lymphoma, and essential thrombocythemia), and solid tumors (clear cell carcinoma in the metastatic stage, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cervical neoplasia). Studies have proven the effectiveness of IFN-α in the treatment of ophthalmic disorders involving the anterior segment of the eye (conjunctival papilloma, squamous neoplasia, conjunctival mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, Mooren's ulcer, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis) and the posterior segment of the eye (serpiginous choroidopathy, posterior uveitis, pseudophakic and diabetic cystoid macular edema, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy). The therapy with IFN-α remains a promising alternative in cases of a failing response to conventional therapy, helping to maintain or improve visual acuity, prevent vision loss, and ameliorate the prognosis of the patient. However, clinicians who decide to use IFN-α in their patients must be aware of general and ophthalmological side effects and inform their patients to undergo a systemic evaluation such as a physical examination, blood and serological tests, and a chest X-ray before the beginning of treatment. This review presents the current knowledge of the use of IFN-α, its efficacy, and properties in ophthalmological diseases, and thus may encourage clinicians to administer this drug as a treatment modality in ophthalmological diseases in the future.
