Background and aim:hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of cancer related with inflammation, as 90% of cases develop in a chronic inflammation condition. Excess inflammation can affect tissue homeostasis. Cytokines and inflammatory mediators are immunological components that can influence the functioning of cells and tissues. In addition, the estrogen receptor appears to play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of inflammatory markers and ER in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:data from 143 patients of ISCMPA were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry was performed of cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and ER in paraffin-embedded hepatic tissue. The percentage of the stained area, intensity of staining and of the number of ER positive nuclei were evaluated using the ImageJ 1.50 software.Results and conclusion:there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the percentage of marked area (p = 0.040) for COX-2 and the intensity of staining of TNF-α (p = 0.030). No significant differences were observed in any of other parameters evaluated. In conclusion, COX-2 and TNF-α are possible markers that should be further studied to determine their immunohistochemical profile and role in HCC development.
