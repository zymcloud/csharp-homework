As the main metabolic and detoxification organ, the liver constantly adapts its activity to fulfill the energy requirements of the whole body. Despite the remarkable adaptive capacity of the liver, prolonged exposure to noxious stimuli such as alcohol, viruses and metabolic disorders results in the development of chronic liver disease that can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is currently the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Metabolic rewiring is a common feature of cancers, including HCC. Altered mito-nuclear communication is emerging as a driving force in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, affecting all aspects of cancer biology from neoplastic transformation to acquired drug resistance. Here, we explore relevant aspects (and discuss recent findings) of mito-nuclear crosstalk in the metabolic reprogramming of hepatocellular carcinoma.
