Prognostic significance of family with sequence similarity 83, member D (FAM83D) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients has not been well-investigated using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) series and TCGA database, we compared FAM83D expression levels between tumor and adjacent tissues, and correlated FAM83D in tumors with outcomes and clinico-pathological features in HCC patients. Validated in GSE33006, GSE45436, GSE84402 and TCGA, FAM83D was significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues than that in adjacent tissues (all P<0.01). FAM83D up-regulation was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in HCC patients (Log rank P=0.00583 and P=4.178E-04, respectively). Cox analysis revealed that FAM83D high expression was significantly associated with OS in HCC patients [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.005-2.063, P=0.047]. Additionally, patients deceased or recurred/progressed had significantly higher FAM83D mRNA levels than those living or disease-free (P=0.0011 and P=0.0238, respectively). FAM83D high expression group had significantly more male patients and advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage cases (P=0.048 and P=0.047, respectively). FAM83D mRNA were significantly overexpressed in male (P=0.0193). Compared with patients with AJCC stage I, those with AJCC stage II and stage III-IV had significantly higher FAM83D mRNA levels (P = 0.0346 and P=0.0045, respectively). In conclusion, overexpressed in tumors, FAM83D is associated with gender, AJCC stage, tumor recurrence and survival in HCC.
