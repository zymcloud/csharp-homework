Background/aim:High-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (iBT) has been shown to provide high tumor control rates in the treatment of primary or secondary malignancies at various sites. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of image-guided iBT in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).Materials and methods:A total of 14 patients with a cumulative number of 54 unresectable RCC liver metastases after treatment with computed tomography (CT)- or open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided iBT using an iridium-192 source (single fraction irradiation) were included in this retrospective study.Results:Local tumor control rate was 92.6% during a median follow-up of 10.2 months (range=2.4-73.6 months). Median progression-free survival after iBT was 3.4 months (range=1.0-27.8 months). Median overall survival was 51.2 months (range=10.2-81.5 months). No severe adverse events (grade 3 or more) were recorded.Conclusion:Image-guided iBT is a safe and feasible treatment in patients with mRCC.
