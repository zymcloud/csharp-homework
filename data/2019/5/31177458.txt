We studied the effect of lithium carbonate on hepatocellular carcinoma-29 cells in CBA male mice after injection in a dose of 20 mM along the tumor periphery. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a decrease in the volume density of the granular endoplasmic reticulum in the cell cytoplasm and an increase in the total numerical and volume density of autophagosomes and autolysosomes and zones of destruction of intracellular organelles. The ability of lithium carbonate to activate intracellular degradation processes in tumor cells and to stimulate cell death can be used to develop new combined strategies in the chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
