Background:The study examines the expression and function of hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (HIG2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cells.Methods:Forty patients with HCC were included in the study. Bioinformatic analysis was used to analyze the clinical relevance of HIG2 expression in HCC tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry was employed to determine the expression of target proteins in tumor tissues. Hepatic HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were transfected with HIG2-targeting siRNA with Lipofectamine 2000. qRT-PCR was carried out to determine gene expression levels, while Western blotting was used to determine protein expression. A CCK-8 assay was performed to detect proliferation of cells, while migration and invasion of cells were studied by Transwell assay. Flow cytometry was carried out to detect surface markers and effector molecules in Nature killercells, as well as the killing effect of NK cells.Results:HIG2 expression was upregulated in HCC. Silencing of HIG2 suppressed HCC cell migration and invasion. The killing effect of NK cells on HCC cells was enhanced after HIG2 was silenced in HCC cells. Conditioned media from HIG2-silenced SMMC-7721 cells inhibited the phenotype and function of NK cells. HCC cells with silenced expression of HIG2 modulated the activity of NK cells via STAT3. HIG2 promoted the evasion of HCC cells from killing by NK cells through upregulation of IL-10 expression.Conclusion:The study demonstrates that HIG2 activates the STAT3 signaling pathway in NK cells by promoting IL-10 release by HCC cells, thereby inhibiting the killing activity of NK cells, and subsequently promoting the recurrence and metastasis of HCC.
