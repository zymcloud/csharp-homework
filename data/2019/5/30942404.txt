B7 family members have been associated with the signaling transduction pathways underlying tumor immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma. In the present study, associations between the clinical characteristics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the expression of B7‑H2 and B7‑H3 were analyzed. A total of 63 formalin‑fixed and paraffin‑embedded HCC tissues were collected to be used as a tissue microarray. Following this, the association between B7‑H2/B7‑H3 and the prognosis of patients with HCC was analyzed using Pearson's χ2 test, the Kaplan‑Meier method and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The results demonstrated that the expression of B7‑H2 was significantly associated with recurrence (within 1 year) in patients with HCC (P
