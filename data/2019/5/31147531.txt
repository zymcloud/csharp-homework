BACKGROUND Hepatitis B and C viruses have been recognized as undoubtedly carcinogenic to humans. In the Polish population, where most people are protected by HBV vaccinations, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its main cause, persistent HCV infection, significantly affect the demand for liver transplantations. MATERIAL AND METHODS The purpose of this study was to categorize the number of primary liver transplantations in Poland in the years 2001-2017 by cause and to analyze changes in LTx indications during this period. Data were sourced from POLTRANSPLANT, the Organization and Coordination Center for Transplantation in Poland. Additionally, we compared the numbers of HCC cases and hepatitis B and C cases during this period. RESULTS In the analyzed period, in Poland, 3332 primary liver transplantations were performed. Overall, 44% (1456) of LTx cases were combined with HBV and/or HCV and/or HCC. In this group, transplants in patients with only 1 specific factor - HCV - formed the largest cohort, accounting for about 40% (581) of cases. Transplants in patients who only had HBV and in those who only had HCC accounted for 12% (185) and 5% (69), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The analyzed data suggest that HCV infections are a significant public health problem in Poland, as is also reflected by the growing number of LTx performed due to HCC. To limit the numbers of HCV and HCC cases, immediate implementation of a Polish National Program against HCV should be considered.
