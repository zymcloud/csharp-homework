BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between TRMT6 mRNA expression levels and clinicopathological features in primary HCC patients and to evaluate their prognostic value. MATERIAL AND METHODS The clinical information and the mRNA sequencing data of the patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Liver Cancer database. The correlation between the clinicopathological features and the expression of TRMT6 was analyzed by t test and chi-square test. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the potential mechanisms of TRMT6 dysregulation in primary HCC patients. RESULTS Compared to normal tissues, TRMT6 was significantly upregulated in primary HCC tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that higher TRMT6 expression was associated with reduced RFS (p=0.0146) and OS (p=0.0224) in HCC patients. Moreover, multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that TRMT6 upregulation independently predicted poor RFS (HR: 1.871, 95% CI: 1.204, 2.905, p=0.005) and OS (HR: 2.176, 95% CI: 1.234, 3.836, p=0.007). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that primary HCC samples in the TRMT6 high expression group were enriched for the G2M checkpoint, spermatogenesis, and MYC target genes. CONCLUSIONS TRMT6 was upregulated in HCC tissues, and higher TRMT6 expression levels was correlated with reduced OS and RFS in patients with primary HCC. TRMT6 might be a promising prognostic biomarker for poor clinical outcomes in primary HCC patients.
