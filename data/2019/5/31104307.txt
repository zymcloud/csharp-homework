In solid organ transplant recipients (sOTRs), 5 years after transplantation cancer is a relevant cause of death. We aimed to report cancer incidence in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) between 2008 and 2014 and conducted a prospective cohort study of kidney, heart, lung, pancreas and liver transplant recipients enrolled into the STCS by retrospective analysis of collected data. The STCS provided data on 2758 solid organ transplants. In total, 134 cases of cancer were observed (30 liver, 21 prostate, 18 lung, 13 kidney, 52 other cancers). Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were highest for liver cancer, kidney cancer, thyroid cancer, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, cancer of the oral cavity and the pharynx and for lung cancer. Cancer occurrence differed according to the transplanted organ. Cancers were mainly diagnosed at World Health Organisation (WHO) stages I and IV. Treatment received was mainly surgery and, in some cases, included also radiation and/or chemotherapy. Bladder, kidney, liver, lung and prostate cancer were detected at a younger age compared with the general population. Cumulative hazards for death were increased for transplant recipients with cancer. Solid organ transplant recipients show an organ specific increase of cancer compared with the general Swiss population. Clinical trial registration number: NCT02333279.
