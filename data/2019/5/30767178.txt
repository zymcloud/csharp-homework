Background:Vascular invasion is a major determinant of survival outcomes after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) in patients with HCC with hepatic vein tumor thrombus (HVTT).Methods:Data from patients who underwent LR for HCC with HVTT at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The survival outcomes for patients who underwent PA-TACE after LR were compared with those who underwent LR alone. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to match patients in a ratio of 1:1.Results:All included 319 patients who underwent LR for HCC with HVTT, 134 underwent LR alone (the LR group), and 185 patients underwent in adjuvant TACE (the PA-TACE group). PSM matched 107 patients in two groups. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were significantly better for patients in the PA-TACE group than the LR group (for OS: before PSM, P Conclusions:PA-TACE was associated with significantly better survival outcomes than LR alone for patients with HCC and HVTT (pHVTT and mHVTT). There was no survival benefits in patients whose HVTT had extended to form IVCTT.
