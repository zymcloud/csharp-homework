To date 14 human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) have been identified. The newly found HPyVs have not been examined with regard to post-transplant skin carcinogenesis. To determine the occurrences in skin and possible pathological associations of the HPyVs, we studied their genoprevalences in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ or actinic keratosis and benign skin in liver transplant recipients (LiTRs); and of healthy skin in immunocompetent adults. We used highly sensitive and specific HPyV PCRs of two types. Overall, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6), human polyomavirus 7 (HPyV7), trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus (TSPyV), and Lyon IARC polyomavirus (LIPyV) were found in 58/221 (26.2%) skin biopsies. MCPyV DNA was detected in 5/14 (35.7%) premalignant vs. 32/127 (25.2%) benign skin of LiTRs, and in 12/80 (15%) healthy skin of immunocompetent adults, with no statistically significant difference in viral DNA prevalence or load. TSPyV DNA was found in a single skin lesion. LIPyV, HPyV6 and HPyV7 DNAs occurred exclusively in benign skin. Overall, the viral findings in premalignant versus benign skin were alike. The occurrences of HPyVs in skin of LiTRs and immunocompetent individuals speak against a role for any of the 14 HPyVs in SCC development.
