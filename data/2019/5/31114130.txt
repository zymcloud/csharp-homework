The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rising exponentially worldwide. The spectrum of NAFLD includes non-alcoholic fatty liver, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Evidence shows that microbial metabolites play pivotal roles in the onset and progression of NAFLD. In this review, we discuss how microbe-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, endogenous ethanol, bile acids and so forth, contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD.
