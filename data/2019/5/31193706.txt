In this study, we investigated possible hepato-protective effects of N. Sativa, P. Ginseng, and C. Sempervirens in Aflatoxin B1 (AFB-1) induced hepatocellular carcinoma rat model. Fifty-four male albino rats were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Alcoholic extracts of aforementioned herbs were administered orally for 28 days at different doses. IL-6, hs-CRP, MDA, SOD and NFE2L2 were determined using ELISA. Histopathological changes in treated groups were examined. Herbal treatment significantly reduced IL-6, hs-CRP, and MDA (P < 0.001) whereas it significantly increased SOD (p < 0.001). C. Sempervirens 600 and N. Sativa 1000 increased NFE2L2 level compared to P. Ginseng 500 group (P value<0.01). Histopathological evaluation of treated groups showed different grades of healing of the liver. This study confirms a beneficial hepatoprotective effect for aforementioned herbal extracts orally administered in rat model of AFB1 induced HCC. This effect is putatively mediated via modulation of inflammatory cytokines as well as amelioration of oxidative stress.
