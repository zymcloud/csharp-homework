Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying HCC progression and metastasis are still in obscure. Here, we used bioinformatic analysis to identify miRNAs that regulate GP73, a specific marker for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. The correlations between miR-141-3p and clinic-pathological factors were analyzed in HCC patient samples; proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation were studied using established HCC cell lines. Expression levels of target genes (miR-141-3p, GP73, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, occludin, vimentin, and cytokeratin 18) were detected by either Western blot or qRT-PCR analysis. Xenograft models were established to evaluate tumor growth and metastasis. MiR-141-3p was significantly reduced in HCC tumors and cell lines, highly correlated with tumor progression. In contrast, GP73 was negatively correlated with miR-141-3p in HCC tumors. MiR-141-3p overexpression significantly decreased HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). GP73 overexpression partially restored the inhibitory effects of miR-141-3p, while miR-141-3p overexpression markedly inhibited tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, which were partially reversed by GP73 overexpression. Our findings suggest that miR-141-3p targets GP73 to reverse EMT, subsequently inhibiting HCC progression and metastasis. Thus, overexpression of miR-141-3p could serve as a therapeutic strategy to arrest HCC.
