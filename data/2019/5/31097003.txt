Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most notable lethal malignancies worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of this disease remain poorly understood. Over the past decade, many studies have demonstrated the important regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in HCC. Here, we comprehensively review recent discoveries regarding HCC-associated lncRNA functions, which we have classified and described according to their mechanism models.
