Objective:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes inflammation of the liver and is the leading cause of both liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) is an acute-phase response protein that is overexpressed in liver cancer tissue. This study investigated the clinical value of SPINK1 with regard to the diagnosis of HBV-related diseases and its regulatory mechanism.Methods:Serum levels of SPINK1 in HBV-infected patients and healthy participants were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were used to detect differential expression of SPINK1 mRNA and protein in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. The HBV infectious clone pHBV1.3 and its individual genes were cotransfected into HepG2 cells with the SPINK1 promoter coupled to a luciferase reporter; luciferase activity was measured, and the expression levels of SPINK1 were examined.Results:Serum SPINK1 levels of HBV-infected patients were significantly higher than those of healthy participants, and the serum levels of SPINK1 in patients who tested positive for HBeAg were significantly higher than those in patients who tested negative for HBeAg. The serum SPINK1 levels of patients with LC or HCC were markedly higher than those of patients with chronic hepatitis. The HBV X protein (HBx) activated the SPINK1 promoter to upregulate expression of SPINK1 at both mRNA and protein levels.Conclusions:HBV enhances expression of SPINK1 through X. SPINK1 levels are increased during progression of HBV-related diseases and might be utilized as a biomarker for the diagnosis of HBV-related diseases.
