Background:Activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a frequent event in hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with enhanced cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, targeting this signaling pathway is discussed as an attractive therapeutic approach for HCC treatment. BCL9 and BCL9L, two homologous coactivators of the β-catenin transcription factor complex, have not yet been comprehensively characterized in HCC. We aimed to elucidate the roles of BCL9 and BCL9L, especially regarding Wnt/β-catenin signaling and their prognostic value in HCC.Methods:Expression of BCL9/BCL9L was determined in HCC cell lines (HLE, HLF, Huh7, HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh6) and normal liver cell lines (THLE-2 and THLE-3). To analyze proliferation and apoptosis, BCL9 and/or BCL9L were knocked down in Wnt-inactive HLE and Wnt-active HepG2 and Huh6 cells using siRNA. Subsequently, Wnt reporter assays were performed in HepG2 and Huh6 cells. BCL9 and BCL9L expression, clinicopathological and survival data of public HCC datasets were analyzed, taking the Wnt signaling status into account.Results:Knockdown of BCL9L, but not of BCL9, reduced Wnt signaling activity. Knockdown of BCL9 and/or BCL9L reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis of Wnt-inactive HCC cells, but had no effect in Wnt-active cells. Expression of BCL9 and BCL9L was upregulated in human HCC and increased with progressing dedifferentiation. For BCL9L, higher expression was observed in tumors of larger size. Overexpression of BCL9 and BCL9L correlated with poor overall survival, especially in HCC without activated Wnt signaling.Conclusion:Oncogenic BCL9 proteins represent promising targets for cancer therapy and inhibiting them may be particularly beneficial in Wnt-inactive HCCs.
