Use of gadoxetate disodium, a hepatobiliary gadolinium-based agent, in patients with chronic parenchymal liver disease offers the advantage of improved sensitivity for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Imaging features of liver observations on gadoxetate-enhanced MRI may also serve as biomarkers of recurrence-free and overall survival following definitive treatment of HCC. A number of technical and interpretative pitfalls specific to gadoxetate exist, however, and needs to be recognized when protocoling and interpreting MRI exams with this agent. This article reviews the advantages and pitfalls of gadoxetate use in patients at risk for HCC, and the potential impact on Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) imaging feature assessment and categorization. Level of Evidence: 5 Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;49:1236-1252.
