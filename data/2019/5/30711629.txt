Background & aims:Inhibitors of MET have not produced satisfactory outcomes in trials of patients with liver cancer. We investigated the mechanisms of liver tumor resistance to MET inhibitors in mice.Methods:We tested the effects of MET inhibitors tivantinib and capmatinib in the mouse hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line HCA-1 and in immune-competent and immunodeficient mice with subcutaneous tumors grown from this cell line. Tumors were collected from mice and tumor cells were analyzed by time-of-flight mass cytometry. We used short hairpin RNAs to weaken expression of MET in Hep3B, SK-HEP-1, HA59T, and HA22T liver cancer cell lines and analyzed cells by immunoblot, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation assays. Mass spectrometry was used to assess interactions between MET and glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK3B), and GSK3B phosphorylation, in liver cancer cell lines. C57/BL6 mice with orthotopic tumors grown from Hep1-6 cells were given combinations of capmatinib or tivantinib and antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1; also called PD1); tumors were collected and analyzed by immunofluorescence. We analyzed 268 HCCsamples in a tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry.Results:Exposure of liver cancer cell lines to MET inhibitors increased their expression of PD ligand 1 (PDL1) and inactivated cocultured T cells. MET phosphorylated and activated GSK3B at tyrosine 56, which decreased the expression of PDL1 by liver cancer cells. In orthotopic tumors grown in immune-competent mice, MET inhibitors decreased the antitumor activity of T cells. However, addition of anti-PD1 decreased orthotopic tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice compared with anti-PD1 or MET inhibitors alone. Tissue microarray analysis of HCC samples showed an inverse correlation between levels of MET and PDL1 and a positive correlation between levels of MET and phosphorylated GSK3B.Conclusions:In studies of liver cancer cell lines and mice with orthotopic tumors, MET mediated phosphorylation and activated GSK3B, leading to decreased expression of PDL1. Combined with a MET inhibitor, anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 produced additive effect to slow growth of HCCs in mice.
