HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) has been widely regarded as a functional lncRNA contributing to multiple cancers. However, few studies have examined the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HOTAIR on the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, three potentially functional HOTAIR SNPs (rs17105613, rs12427129, and rs3816153) were selected using bioinformatic tools. A case-control study including 1262 cases and 1559 controls was conducted to explore the association of HOTAIR SNPs with the risk of HCC in a Southern Chinese population. We found that SNPs rs12427129 and rs3816153 were associated with the risk of HCC in dominant genetic models (CC: CT + TT, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57-0.90 and GG: GT + TT, adjusted OR = 1.30, 95%CI = 1.08-1.57). Additionally, SNP-environment interactions for rs12427129, rs3816153, and HBsAg status were found to enhance the risk of HCC, with FDR-P as an additive interaction equal to 0.0006 and 0.0144, respectively. In multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis, the three-factor model (HBsAg status, rs12427129 and rs3816153) yielded the highest test accuracy of 77.74% (permutation P
