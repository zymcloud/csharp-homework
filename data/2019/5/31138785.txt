Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the one of the most common cancers worldwide. Because the side effects of current treatments are severe, new effective therapeutic strategies are urgently required. Pterostilbene (PT), a natural analogue of resveratrol, has diverse pharmacologic activities, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities. Here we demonstrated that PT inhibits HCC cell growth without the induction of apoptosis in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress- and autophagy-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies indicated that the combination of salubrinal and PT modulates ER stress-related autophagy through the phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α/activating transcription factor-4/LC3 pathway, leading to a further inhibition of eIF2α dephosphorylation and the potentiation of cell death. An in vivo xenograft analysis revealed that PT significantly reduced tumour growth in mice with a SK-Hep-1 tumour xenograft. Taken together, our results yield novel insights into the pivotal roles of PT in ER stress- and autophagy-dependent cell death in HCC cells.
