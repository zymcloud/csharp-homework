Objective:To evaluate the effects of Celastrus Orbiculatus extracts (COE) on metastasis in hypoxia-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.Methods:The effect of COE (160, 200 and 240 µ g/mL) on cell viability, scratch-wound, invasion and migration were studied by 3-4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), scratch-wound and transwell assays, respectively. CoCl2 was used to establish a hypoxia model in vitro. Effects of COE on the expressions of E-cadherin, vimentin and N-cadherin were investigated with Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis, respectively.Results:COE inhibited proliferation and metastasis of hypoxia-induced hepatocellular carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner (PConclusions:COE significantly inhibited the tumor metastasis and EMT by suppressing Hif-1 α/Twist1 signaling pathway in hypoxia-induced HepG2 cell. Thus, COE might have potential effect to inhibit the progression of HepG2 in the context of tumor hypoxia.
