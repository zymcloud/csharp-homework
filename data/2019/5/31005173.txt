Purpose:This study was designed to assess the feasibility and safety of a single-step combined therapy using radiofrequency ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (RFA + TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and uncontrolled coagulopathy. The study also aimed to compare the effectiveness of this approach with TACE alone, performed in a control group.Material and methods:One hundred and forty-three consecutive cirrhotic patients having a single HCC Results:Technical success was achieved in all patients, without any major complications. Minor complications rate was significantly higher in group C after RFA; however, the patients were successfully treated with subsequent TACE therapy, without any differences between pre- and post-procedural laboratory values. One-month complete response rates were similar in all the three groups; however, the response rates of group C were significantly higher as compared to that of the control TACE Group (p Conclusion:The single-step RFA plus TACE therapy allows expansion of the indication for percutaneous thermal ablation, allowing to also include cases previously contraindicated due to the procedural high-risk of complications associated with bleeding, thus improving short-term patient outcome.
