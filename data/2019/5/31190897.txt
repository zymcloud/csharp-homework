Background: MiR-1323 was identified in 2006. Until now, the roles and mechanisms of miR-1323 in the progression of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the expressions, roles and mechanisms of miR-1323 in HCC development. Methods: QRT-PCR was used to evaluate the expressions of miR-1323, GAS5 and TP53INP1 in HCC tissues and cell lines. CCK-8 assay, transwell invasion assay and flow cytometry assay were conducted to evaluate the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of HCC cells. Luciferase assay was used to identify microRNA-target interaction. Results: Firstly, our results showed that miR-1323 promoted proliferation and invasion, and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells. Secondly, we found that TP53INP1 was a direct target of miR-1323 and could reverse the effects of miR-1323 on proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of HCC cells. Thirdly, our results showed that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) GAS5 and miR-1323 could interact with each other and affect biological processes of HCC cells. Furthermore, we identified the negative correlations between miR-1323 and TP53INP1, and between miR-1323 and GAS5 in tumor tissues of patients with HCC. Conclusion: Taken together, our study revealed the important roles of GAS5/miR-1323/TP53INP1 axis in HCC progression. This study also provided promising strategies for targeted therapy of patients with HCC.
