Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer worldwide with a very high recurrence rate and very dismal prognosis. Diagnosis and treatment in HCC remain difficult, and the identification of new therapeutic targets is necessary for a better outcome of HCC treatment. AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) is an essential intracellular energy sensor that plays multiple roles in cellular physiology and the pathological development of chronic diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the important regulation of AMPK in HCC. This review aims to comprehensively and critically summarize the role of AMPK in HCC. Methods: Original studies were retrieved from NCBI database with keywords including AMPK and HCC, which were analyzed with extensive reading. Results: Dysregulation of the kinase activity and expression of AMPK was observed in HCC, which was correlated with survival of the patients. Loss of AMPK in HCC cells may proceed cell cycle progression, proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion through different oncogenic molecules and pathways. Conclusions: We identified several AMPK activators which may possess potential anti-HCC function, and discussed the clinical perspective on the use of AMPK activators for HCC therapy.
