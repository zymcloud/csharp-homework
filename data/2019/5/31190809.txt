Background: Supramolecular vesicles are a novel class of nanocarriers that have great potential in biomedicine.Methods: A multifunctional supramolecular vesicle (CAAP5G) based on the complex of CAAP5 and galactose derivative (G) assembled via host-guest interaction was constructed. Results: Using Human embryonic kidney T (293T) cells as experimental models, the cytotoxic effects of CAAP5G was investigated to 0-50 Âµmol/L for 24 h. Notably, the CAAP5G vesicles revealed low-toxicity to 293T cells, it was critical to designing drug nano-carriers. Simultaneously, we have evaluated doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX)-loaded CAAP5G vesicles anticancer efficiency, where DOX-loaded CAAP5G vesicles and free DOX incubated with Human hepatocellular carcinoma cancer cell (HpeG2 cells) and 293T cells for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h. It turned out that CAAP5G vesicles encapsulated anticancer drug (DOX) could decrease DOX side-effect on 293T cells and increase DOX anticancer efficiency. More importantly, the cysteamine as an adjuvant chemotherapy drug was released from CAAP5G vesicles in HepG2 cells where a higher GSH concentration exists. The adjuvant chemotherapy efficiency was evaluated, where free DOX and DOX-loaded CAAP5G vesicles incubated with DOX-resistance HepG2 cells (HepG2-ADR cells) for 24, 48, 72 h, respectively. Conclusion: The results revealed that the DOX encapsulated by CAAP5G vesicles could enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX and provide insights for designing advanced nano-carriers toward adjuvant chemotherapies.
