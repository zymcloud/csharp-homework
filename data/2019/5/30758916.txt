Most of the current cancer therapies may induce serious side effects and affect patient quality of life. Recently, a novel treatment using an alternating low-intensity and intermediate-frequency electric field was proposed and found to be a noninvasive and minimally toxic approach. However, additional fundamental studies and scientific evidence are required to further support the development of this treatment into a standard cancer therapy. In the current work, an in-house fabricated culture plate was developed to study the responses of hepatocellular carcinoma spheroids to treatment with an alternating electric field. From the results of the viability study, the electric field was confirmed to influence the dividing cells in the spheroids. Fluorescent staining of live and dead cells revealed that a fraction of the cells were damaged in the field-treated spheroids. Moreover, flow cytometry analyses were conducted and showed that a fraction of the cells in the spheroids underwent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Additionally, the apoptosis pathway (Bax/caspase) and cell cycle arrest pathway (p53/p21) were found to be activated after exposure to the electric field. In summary, the results further elucidated the cellular and molecular mechanism inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the field-treated hepatocellular carcinoma spheroids. This study provides more evidence to support the efficacy of electric-field-based cancer therapy.
