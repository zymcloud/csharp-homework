The detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is of great importance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis, but it needs to be further improved because of poor sensitivity and complicated operating steps. In this paper, a simple and sensitive homogeneous apatasensor for AFP has been developed based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) where the AFP aptamer labeled luminescent CdTe quantum dots (QDs) as a donor and anti-AFP antibody functional gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as an acceptor. In the presence of AFP, the bio-affinity between aptamer, target, and antibody made the QDs and AuNPs close enough, thus the fluorescence of CdTe QDs quenched though the FRET between QD and AuNP. The fluorescent aptasensor for AFP showed a concentration-dependent decrease of fluorescence intensity in the low nanomolar range and a detecting linear range of 0.5-45 ng mL-1, with a detection limit of 400 pg mL-1. Moreover, this homogeneous aptasensor is simple and reliable, and obtained satisfying results for the detection of AFP in human serum samples. With more and more aptamers for biomarkers have been selected gradually, this approach could be easily extended to detection of a wide range of biomarkers. The proposed aptasensor has great potential for carcinoma screening in point-of-care testing and even in field use.
