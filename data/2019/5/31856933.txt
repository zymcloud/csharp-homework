This study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and prognostic factors of drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in treating Chinese patients with liver cancer. A total of 367 liver cancer patients from 24 medical centers were consecutively enrolled in this multiple-center, prospective cohort study, including 275 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases, 37 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) cases, and 55 secondary liver cancer cases. All the patients received CalliSpheres® DEB-TACE treatment. Treatment response, overall survival (OS), change of liver function, and adverse events (AEs) were assessed. DEB-TACE treatment achieved 19.9% complete response (CR) and 79.6% objective response rate (ORR), with mean OS of 384 days [95% confidence interval (CI): 375-393 days]. CR and ORR were both higher in HCC patients compared with primary ICC patients and secondary liver cancer patients, while no difference was discovered in OS. Portal vein invasion was an independent risk factor for CR, while portal vein invasion, previous conventional TACE (cTACE) treatment, and abnormal blood creatinine (BCr) were independent risk factors for ORR. In addition, largest nodule size ≥5.0 cm, abnormal albumin (ALB), and abnormal total bilirubin (TBIL) independently correlated with unfavorable OS. Most liver function indexes were recovered to baseline levels at 1-3 months after DEB-TACE. Common AEs were pain, fever, vomiting, and nausea; most of them were at mild grade. CalliSpheres® DEB-TACE is efficient and well tolerated in Chinese liver cancer patients. Portal vein invasion, previous cTACE treatment, largest nodule size, abnormal BCr, ALB, and TBIL correlate with worse prognosis independently.
