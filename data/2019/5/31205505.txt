The gut microbiota is involved in the maintenance of the homeostasis of the human body and its alterations are associated with the development of different pathological conditions. The liver is the organ most exposed to the influence of the gut microbiota, and recently important connections between the intestinal flora and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been described. In fact, HCC is commonly associated with liver cirrhosis and develops in a microenvironment where inflammation, immunological alterations, and cellular aberrations are dramatically evident. Prevention and diagnosis in the earliest stages are still the most effective weapons in fighting this tumor. Animal models show that the gut microbiota can be involved in the promotion and progression of HCC directly or through different pathogenic mechanisms. Recent data in humans have confirmed these preclinical findings, shedding new light on HCC pathogenesis. Limitations due to the different experimental design, the ethnic and hepatological setting make it difficult to compare the results and draw definitive conclusions, but these studies lay the foundations for a pathogenetic redefinition of HCC. Therefore, it is evident that the characterization of the gut microbiota and its modulation can have an enormous diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic potential, especially in patients with early stage HCC.
