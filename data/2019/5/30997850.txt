Aim: MTHFD1 was the enzyme providing one-carbon derivatives of tetrahydrofolate. We sought to investigate the impact of MTHFD1 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Bioinformatic analysis, western blot and immunohistochemistry were conducted to detect MTHFD1 expression in HCC. The relationships between MTHFD1 and prognosis of 172 HCCs were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: High MTHFD1 expression in HCC represented poor prognosis (overall survival p = 0.025; time to recurrence p = 0.044). Combining MTHFD1 with serum AFP, survival analysis demonstrated the prognosis of the MTHFD1 low expression and AFP â‰¤20 ng/ml group was better than that of the MTHFD1 high expression or AFP >20 ng/ml group and the MTHFD1 high expression and AFP >20 ng/ml group (overall survival p < 0.0001; time to recurrence p < 0.0001). Conclusion: High MTHFD1 expression in HCC indicated poorer prognosis. Combining MTHFD1 with serum AFP improved the accuracy of prognostic prediction.
