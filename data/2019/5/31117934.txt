Background:Our previous study described the crucial role of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing-kinases (ROCK) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the potential significance of long noncoding RNA downstream of ROCK is largely unknown. Here, a comprehensive comparative bioinformatics analysis of a microarray of an MHCC-97H cell line overexpressing ROCK1 or ROCK2 was performed.Results:Numerous lncRNAs and mRNAs were deregulated by Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases 1 and 2. These results were consistent with the qRT-PCR results. Compared with MHCC-97H-Con, which was transfected with a null vector, the GO analysis revealed differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) in MHCC-97H-ROCK1 (ROCK1 was overexpressed) enriched in apoptotic cell clearance, the cyclooxygenase pathway and bone trabecula morphogenesis; the DEmRNAs in MHCC-97H-ROCK2 (ROCK2 was overexpressed) were enriched in VEGF production, chemokine-associated signaling pathways, acute inflammatory response and vasoconstriction. Compared with MHCC-97H-ROCK2, the DEmRNAs in MHCC-97H-ROCK1 were involved in the JAK-STAT cascade, the Akt signaling pathway and the activity of several different peptidases. The pathway analysis of ROCK1 and ROCK2 revealed an overlap in the VEGF signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction, and adhesion and differences in the PPAR signaling pathway and mismatch repair. The predicted targets of the differentially expressed lncRNA (DElncRNAs) were enriched in the p53 signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, etc. Several hub DElncRNAs were identified.Conclusions:ROCK1 and 2 modulate the expression of numerous mRNAs and lncRNAs and may participate in several signaling pathways in HCC. Several hub molecules were identified in the lncRNA-mRNA networks. Our results provide baseline data for ROCK1 and 2 regulation in HCC that might have implications for further research.
