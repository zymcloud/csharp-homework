Purpose:N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant mRNA modification in mammals, is involved in various biological processes. KIAA1429 is an important methyltransferase participating in m6A modification. However, the role of KIAA1429 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still not well understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the function of KIAA1429 and its corresponding regulation mechanisms in HCC.Patients and methods:HCC-related genes were analyzed by clinical and expression data of HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Expression of KIAA1429 was verified by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, and interference efficiency was obtained using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed by cell counting kit-8 and transwell assays, and the m6A modification was detected by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-PCR (MeRIP-PCR).Results:We found a difference in the expression of KIAA1429 between HCC and normal hepatic tissues by analyzing data from the TCGA database. Comparing HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh-7, HepG2.2.15) with normal hepatic cells (HL-7702), we observed an identically significant difference in KIAA1429 expression. KIAA1429 significantly enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis and correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between KIAA1429 and ID2. In the subsequent MeRIP-PCR assay, downregulation of KIAA1429 inhibited m6A modification of ID2 mRNA.Conclusion:KIAA1429 facilitated migration and invasion of HCC by inhibiting ID2 via upregulating m6A modification of ID2 mRNA.
