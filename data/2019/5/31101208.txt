Unresectable liver metastases of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are an accepted indication for liver transplant. Patients undergoing liver transplant because of neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases have similar long-term survival compared with hepatocellular carcinoma; however, recurrence rates are reported to be higher.Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who received transplants for neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases in the Department of Transplantation and Surgery of Semmelweis University between January 1995 and August 2018. The median follow-up period was 33 months.Results:Ten liver transplants have been performed because of neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases during the observed period. Recurrence occurred in 5 cases, and 3 patients died. Estimated 1- and 5-year patient survival rates after transplant were 89% and 71%, respectively. Estimated 1- and 5-year recurrence-free rates were 80% and 43%, respectively. Every patient whose primary tumor was of pancreatic origin or those recipients who had Ki67 index values in the explanted liver higher than 5% had disease recurrence.Conclusion:Patient survival and recurrence rates after liver transplant were comparable with the results reported by other centers. In line with previous findings, primary pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and higher Ki67 index values in the explanted livers were both associated with higher recurrence rates. We believe that an international registry would be helpful to better understand factors leading to tumor recurrence in these cases.
