Backgrounds/aims:Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a rare benign tumor that has a risk of malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and bleeding. The aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of HCA by performing molecular classification.Methods:We retrospectively collected data from nine patients who were diagnosed with HCA from 1995 to 2016. The patients underwent liver surgery due to the existence of clinical symptoms. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to classify the subgroups of HCA.Results:Four patients with both β-catenin and inflammation were classified as β-IHCA. Two patients were defined as β-HCA. Two patients were classified as HHCA. Only one patient was defined as IHCA. None of the patients had unclassified HCA. Seven of nine patients had a malignant transformation. By comparing the characteristics of HCA between two groups, we found the mean tumor size in the malignant transformation group was greater than the non-malignant transformation group.Conclusions:Taken together, the mean tumor size and activation of catenin β1 mutation status might be the risk factors for the malignant transformation of HCA into HCC. Moreover, IHCA without the catenin β1 mutation could also have a possibility of malignant transformation into HCC.
