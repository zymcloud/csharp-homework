Rationale:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases to the zygomatic bone are extremely uncommon, and the treatment of target drugs against such case is unknown.Patient concerns:A 48-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital under suspicion of an advanced liver tumor due to an increase in levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) after radiofrequency ablation for independent nodule in his liver 1 month before. He had a hepatitis B virus (HBV) history for 20 years without treatment.Diagnosis and interventions:A diagnosis of primary HCC was made based on pathological examination following right hepatectomy. Seven months after the surgery, a mass in S8 was identified and treated by ARF. Twenty days later, a right zygomatic mass was observed and the incisional biopsy revealed metastasis from HCC. Due to side effects of chemotherapy, the metastatic zygomatic mass was treated with radioactive seed implantation. Despite these interventions, there was steady increase in AFP values as well as increase in size of the zygomatic mass. Hence, the patient was started on apatinib with a dose of 500 mg/day from 1 to 28 days per cycle for a duration of 10 months.Outcomes:The AFP values were significantly decreased but the size of the zygomatic mass continued to increase indicating progression of disease. But the progression-free survival was more than 10 months. The patient exhibited adverse reactions which were controllable by symptomatic treatments. As of last follow-up, the patient is unwell with pain in the face, blurred vision in the right eye, dyscrasia, and exhibited difficulty in opening his mouth.Lessons:HCC metastases to the zygomatic bone are very aggressive with a very low incidence and immunohistochemistry is useful diagnostic indicators. Still now, there is no optimal treatment strategy for these patients. Apatinib may be a promising drug in the treatment of HCC metastases to the zygomatic bone.
