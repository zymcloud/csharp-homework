Radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres has a growing role in the interventional oncological management of patient's with hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer early or intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma may be offered radioembolization in order to control tumor burden while awaiting a transplant organ-referred to as "bridging" a patient to transplantation-or to reduce tumor burden such that patients will subsequently meet criteria for curative therapies-known as "downstaging" a patient to eligible tumor characteristics. More specific applications of radioembolization have been developed over the past two decades. Radioembolization may be employed to perform a radiation "lobectomy" in order to induce regression of the treated segments and hypertrophy of the untreated liver lobe such that the future liver remnant is sizeable enough to sustain life following resection. Similarly, the concept of radiation "segmentectomy"-involving the more selective administration of yttrium-90 microspheres with the intention of treating tumor and leading to the regression of the treated segment over time-has been proposed as a potential curative application of radioembolization. These radioembolization applications combine to augment the treatment options available to hepatocellular carcinoma patients both within and beyond transplantation criteria.
