Purpose: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients combined with microvascular invasion (MVI). Patients and methods: Eligible studies were searched by PubMed, MedLine, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2018, comparing the overall survival (OS) rates and disease-free survival (DFS) rates between postoperative adjuvant TACE and operation only for HCC patients with MVI. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to determine the effect size. Results: Eight studies were enrolled in this meta-analysis, including 774 patients in the postoperative adjuvant TACE group and 856 patients in the operation only group. The pooled HR for the OS and DFS rates were significantly different between the postoperative adjuvant TACE group and the operation only group (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.48 ∼ 0.68, p < .00001; HR 0.66, 95%CI 0.58 ∼ 0.74, p < .00001; respectively). However, in the subgroup analysis stratified by proportion of multiple-nodules, no significant differences were observed in the pooled HR for the OS/DFS rates between the postoperative adjuvant TACE group and the operation only group (HR 0.83, 95%CI 0.60 ∼ 1.13, p = .23; HR 0.76, 95%CI 0.41 ∼ 1.40, p = .37; respectively). Conclusions: Postoperative adjuvant TACE will benefit patients with HCC and MVI, but not for multiple-HCC with MVI. However, more high-quality studies are warranted to validate the conclusion.
