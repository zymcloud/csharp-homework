Aim:Liver transplantation (LT) is the most promising treatment method in hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Due to the shortage of organ donors and the possible risks associated with living donation, the selection of patients for LT is critical. The aim of this study is to investigate the predictive ability of the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), modified GPS (mGPS), and hepatic GPS (hGPS) on prognoses in a patient group who underwent deceased donor LT (DDLT) or living-donor LT (LDLT) for HCC.Patients and methods:This study includes 62 DDLT and 55 LDLT patients who underwent LT for HCC between 1998 and 2016 in a single center. The study endpoints were recurrence, 0- to 1-year mortality, 0- to 3-year mortality, mortality, and overall survival (OS).Results:The median follow-up time was 70.24 Â± 48.47 months. GPS and hGPS positivity were found to be prognostic indicators of 0- to 3-year mortality and overall mortality in DDLT (P = .012, P = .006; P = .044 and P = .022 respectively). In the LDLT group, GPS was found to be effective in predicting 0- to 1-year and 0- to 3-year mortality (P = .045, P = .022 respectively); GPS and hGPS were also found to be effective in predicting overall mortality (P = .001 and P = .046 respectively). The OS was significantly longer in the GPS 0 group and hGPS 0 group compared to the GPS 1-2 and hGPS 1-2 group in both DDLT and LDLT.Conclusion:The findings of this study and the literature indicate that using GPS and hGPS is appropriate in selecting patients with HCC who are candidates for LT.
