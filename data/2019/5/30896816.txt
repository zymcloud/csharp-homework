Four phospholipase C β (PLCB) isoforms, PLCB1, PLCB2, PLCB3 and PLCB4, have been previously investigated regarding their roles in the metabolism of inositol lipids and cancer. The present study aimed to explore the association between PLCB1‑4 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Data from 212 patients with hepatitis B virus‑associated HCC were used to analyze the diagnostic and prognostic significance of PLCB genes in. A nomogram predicted the survival probability. Gene set enrichment analysis explored gene ontology terms and the metabolic pathways associated with PLCB genes. Validation of the prognostic values of PLCB genes was performed using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis website. PLCB1 and PLCB2 were revealed to have diagnostic value for HCC (0.869 and 0.836 area under the curve, respectively; both P≤0.05). The combination analysis of these genes had an advantage over each alone (0.905 PLCB1 and PLCB2, and 0.877 PLCB1 and PLCB3 area under the curve; P≤0.05). PLCB1 was associated with overall survival (OS) and recurrence‑free survival (RFS; adjusted P=0.002 and P=0.001, respectively). A nomogram predicted survival probability of patients with HCC at 1, 3‑ and 5‑years. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that PLCB1 and PLCB2 are involved in the cell cycle, cell division and the PPAR signaling pathway, among other functions. Validation using GEPIA revealed that PLCB1 and PLCB2 were associated with OS and PLCB1 and PLCB4 were associated with RFS. PLCB1 and PLCB2 exhibited diagnostic value for HCC and their combination had an advantage over each individually. PLCB1 has OS and RFS prognostic value for patients with HCC.
