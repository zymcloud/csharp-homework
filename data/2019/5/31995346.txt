Background:Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are more likely to develop cancer. Malignant lymphomas are the main cancer group seen in these patients. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma including central nervous system lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma account for 90% of HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.Clinical case:A 22-year-old man with fever up to 39 Â° C, malaise, excessive tiredness and night sweats, loss of 8 kg of weight, abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium, all 5 months before hospitalization. Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL, leukocytes 5.13 x 103/mm3, platelets 124 000 cel/mm3; albumin 2.9 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase 28 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 105 IU/L; HIV reactive, beta 2 microglobulin: 20 000 ng/mL. Viral load for HIV 100 034 cp/mL, CD4: 76 cel/mcL (5%). It was performed abdominal ultrasound and denoted cysts in the liver and spleen. Abdominal-pelvic computed tomography with hepatosplenomegaly, retroperitoneal and inguinal adenopathies and free fluid in abdominal cavity. Splenectomy was performed and Burkitt's lymphoma was reported in the histopathological study.Conclusion:HIV predisposes patients to any type of cancer. Intra-abdominal findings should be a warning of lymphoma suspicious and may occur from infiltration of the small intestine, solid organ and soft tissues.
