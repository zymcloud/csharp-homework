Background:Long non-coding RNAs are involved in the pathology of various tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma. The expression of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is increased in numerous types of tumors and is involved in tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. MALAT1 level was reported to be upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, but its roles and the specific molecular mechanisms are still unclear.Methods:The expression of MALAT1 and miR-142-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, cell lines and adjacent non-tumor tissues was assessed by Q-PCR. The putative-binding sites between MALAT1 and miR-142-3p were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. The expression of MALAT1 in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells was knocked down by transfection with MALAT1 siRNAs. Cell viability was assessed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay after the indicated transfection in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. Cell proliferation was assessed by EdU assay, and cell apoptosis was explored by flow cytometry. The migration and invasion potency of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells was assessed by the cell migration assay and matrigel invasion assay. Protein level of vimentin, E-cadherin and SMAD5 were assessed by Western blot.Results:Overexpressed MALAT1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA sponge for miR-142-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma. The knockdown of MALAT1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial cell-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promoted apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via miR-142-3p. MiR-142-3p inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT, and promoted the cell apoptosis by targeting SMAD5 in hepatocellular carcinoma. MALAT1 promoted tumor growth by regulating the expression of miR-142-3p in vivo.Conclusion:MALAT1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by antagonizing miR-142-3p.
