Introduction:Scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare primary liver tumor characterized by extensive fibrosis and production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide. There have been conflicting reports on patient survival in scirrhous versus non-scirrhous HCC. The objective of the present study was to define the clinical features, practice patterns, and long-term outcomes of patients with scirrhous HCC versus non-scirrhous HCC in a propensity score-matched cohort.Methods:A propensity score-matched cohort was created using data from the National Cancer Database for 2004 to 2015. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of the scirrhous HCC variant on overall survival.Results:Among the 70,426 patients with a diagnosis of HCC who met the inclusion criteria, 99.8% had non-scirrhous HCC (n = 70,290) whereas a small subset had scirrhous HCC (n = 136, 0.19%). While 20,330 (28.9%) patients underwent liver-directed therapy (resection, ablation, and transplantation), the majority did not (n = 50,096, 71.1%). After propensity matching, there were no difference in 1-, 3-, or 5-year overall survival among patients with scirrhous versus non-scirrhous HCC (1-year overall survival (OS), 53.7% versus 51.0%; 3-year OS, 34.6% versus 28.7%; and 5-year OS, 18.0% versus 21.0%, respectively; p = 0.52). While the scirrhous HCC variant was not associated with survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.74-1.16), non-receipt of liver-directed therapy (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.18-0.32), advanced AJCC stage (III/IV) (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.55-2.95), and non-academic facilities (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49-0.73) remained associated with worse survival.Conclusion:Patients with the scirrhous variant had a comparable overall survival compared with individuals who had non-scirrhous HCC. Failure to receive liver-directed therapy, advanced AJCC stage (III/IV), and treatment at a non-academic facility was strongly associated with a worse long-term prognosis.
