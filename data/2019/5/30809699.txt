As medical imaging advancements have improved the detectability of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in early stages, the approach to percutaneous thermal ablation for curative treatment has concomitantly advanced. Although many centers are adopting cross-sectional imaging to guide percutaneous ablation, the majority of procedures are still performed under ultrasound (US) guidance worldwide. Challenges to ultrasound guidance may present due to relatively poor resolution particularly with small or isoechoic lesions, or due to intervening structures such as the bowel or diaphragm that obstruct lesional visualization. Fusion imaging (FI) systems have been employed to address these challenges. By merging or synchronizing the real-time images from US with a previously obtained cross-sectional study, FI mitigates the inherent limitations of each individual imaging modality and expands procedural feasibility and technical outcomes. This manuscript reviews the current literature on the use of FI during percutaneous thermal ablation of HCC.
