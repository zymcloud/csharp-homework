BACKGROUND Liver failure after resection for liver cancer is associated with increased patient mortality. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the protective effects of resveratrol, a natural plant-derived compound, on liver injury in a rat model of partial hepatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n=60) were divided into the sham group (n=20), the liver resection group (n=20), and the liver resection plus resveratrol-treated group (n=20). Liver resection removed 2/3 of the liver resection; resveratrol was given at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day from one week before surgery until death. Liver injury was assessed by serum liver function tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl-transferase (γ-GT) and total bilirubin, histological examination of the rat liver, and liver cell apoptosis using the TUNEL assay. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression was measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and acetylated HMGB1 (Ac-HMGB1) expression were detected by Western blot. Normal human liver cells and HepG2 liver cancer cells were incubated with acetylated HMGB1, and albumin production and ammonia elimination assays were performed. RESULTS Resveratrol reduced postoperative liver injury as shown by reduced ALT, AST, γ-GT, and total bilirubin levels, maintained liver structure, and reduced cell apoptosis. Resveratrol treatment reduced the expression and acetylation levels of HMGB1 via the SIRT1 signaling pathway. Resveratrol reversed Ac-HMGB1 induced dysfunction in liver cells cultured in vitro. CONCLUSIONS Resveratrol reduced liver damage after liver resection in a rat model by upregulating SIRT1 and reducing the acetylation of HMGB1.
