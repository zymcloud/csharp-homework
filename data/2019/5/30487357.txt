Owing to changes in lifestyle, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a common form of chronic liver injury. NAFLD comprises a wide variety of disease stages, from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because animal models for NAFLD are needed to investigate the precise pathogenesis, we aimed to establish a new mouse model employing mice deficient for apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM-/-), which exhibit accelerated lipid storage in the liver and high susceptibility to developing HCC in response to a high-fat diet (HFD). AIM-/- mice were fed the D09100301 diet, which contains 40 kcal% fat (trans fat 30 kcal%), high cholesterol (2%), and 40 kcal% carbohydrates (20 kcal% fructose), and then features of obesity and NAFLD including steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and HCC development were analyzed. Although a comparable grade of liver steatosis was promoted in AIM-/- mice by the D09100301 diet and the standard HFD (60 kcal% largely lard fat), significantly less lipid storage in visceral fat was observed when the mice were fed the D09100301 diet. Accelerated liver inflammation was promoted by the D09100301 diet compared with the HFD, but interestingly, HCC development was decreased in mice fed the D09100301 diet. Our findings suggest that AIM-/- mice fed the D09100301 diet exhibited a phenotype that resembled nonobese NAFLD patients and thus could be an appropriate tool to study the pathophysiology by which obesity increases the risk of HCC.
