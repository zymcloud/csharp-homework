Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) appear to be a potential vehicle for anticancer drugs due to their excellent tumor tropism ability. However, the interactions between MSCs and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are quite controversial and the underlying mechanisms are ambiguous. In this study, an investigation was conducted into the effect of human MSCs (hMSCs) on tumor proliferation and metastasis both in xenograft and orthotopic models. It was discovered that hMSCs could promote tumor growth though activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and promote metastasis by epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vivo. To test whether hMSCs could induce immunosuppressive effects, the expression of the Natural killer (NK) cell marker CD56 was measured by immunohistochemical staining and the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were measured by qRT-PCR. It was found out that CD56 expression significantly decreased, while TNF-α and IL-6 expression increased in the hMSCs-treated tissues. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing was performed, which led to a discovery that integrin α5 (ITGA5) was over-expressed in hMSCs-treated HCC. ITGA5 siRNAs blocked the hMSCs-induced migration and invasion of HCC, while over-expression of ITGA5 promoted the migration and invasion ability in HCC-hMSCs, indicating that the expression of ITGA5 is associated with hMSCs-induced tumor metastasis. These findings suggest that hMSCs may play a vital role in HCC proliferation and metastasis and could be identified as a putative therapeutic target in HCC.
