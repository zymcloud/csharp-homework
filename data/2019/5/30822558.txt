Background:While European air quality policies reduce ambient carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in general, there are still areas affected by high environmental CO exposure from transportation, industry and burning low-quality fossil fuels. We investigated, how these CO amounts might influence exhaled CO measurements used to monitor the smoking status of healthy subjects.Methods:A cross-sectional study of healthy adults living in areas of high air pollution (N = 742) and low air pollution (N = 197) in Poland. They completed a survey regarding their smoking habits and underwent necessary body measurements including exhaled CO concentration levels.Results:Ambient CO levels were much higher in highly pollutes cities. Also exhaled CO levels in subjects from high pollution areas were significantly higher, independent of subject smoking status (8.25 ppm vs. 3.26 ppm). Smokers exhaled more CO than non-smokers. Although the duration of smoking did not affect the CO levels, they were proportional to the number of cigarettes smoked during the day, especially for higher amounts of cigarettes and in unpolluted areas. It was possible to differentiate active from passive smokers in all areas, but the difference for passive smokers vs. non-smokers was significant only in low pollution city inhabitants.Conclusions:Exhaled CO levels were confirmed to be a good indicator of smoking status and smoking pattern in healthy subjects. However, high environmental CO levels both increase baseline exhaled CO concentrations in non-smokers affecting their discrimination from passive smokers, and obscure categorizing cigarette consumption in heavy smokers. These findings add important evidence on both understanding of exhaled CO monitoring results and a significance of environmental CO exposure in areas with high pollution.
