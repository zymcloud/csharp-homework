A 76-year-old Japanese woman with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma presented with acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (AE-IIP) after transcatheter arterial therapy using miriplatin. She had a history of preexisting IIP five years before presenting at our hospital. On day 4 after transcatheter arterial therapy, she complained of shortness of breath. Subsequently, she developed acute respiratory failure on day 11 after transcatheter arterial therapy. Chest computed tomography revealed extensive ground-glass opacity and traction bronchiectasis in bilateral lung fields; subsequently, she was diagnosed with AE-IIP triggered by transcatheter arterial therapy using miriplatin. Despite systemic administration of high-dose corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide, she died of respiratory failure on day 36.
