Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths around the world. Recent advances in genomic technologies have allowed the identification of various molecular signatures in HCC tissues. For instance, differential gene expression levels of various cytochrome P450 genes (CYP450) have been reported in studies performed on limited numbers of HCC tissue samples, or focused on a small subset on CYP450s. In the present study, we monitored the expression landscape of all the members of the CYP450 family (57 genes) in more than 200 HCC tissues using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using stringent statistical filters and data from paired tissues, we identified significantly dysregulated CYP450 genes in HCC. Moreover, the expression level of selected CYP450s was validated by qPCR on cDNA samples from an independent cohort. Threshold values (sensitivity and specificity) based on dysregulated gene expression were also determined to allow for confident identification of HCC tissues. Finally, a global look at expression levels of the 57 members of the CYP450 family across ten different cancer types revealed specific expression signatures. Overall, this study provides useful information on the transcriptomic landscape of CYP450 genes in HCC and on new potential HCC biomarkers.
