Lung cancer is regarded as one of the dominant causes in cancer patients among men and women all over the world. Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase l (ROCK1) is characterized as pivotal downstream effectors of the small GTPase RhoA and reported to participate in tumor metastasis. miR-335-5p acts as tumor suppressor microRNA and is identified to be downregulated in tumor tissues. miR-335-5p/ROCK1 axis has been demonstrated to promote cell proliferation and metastasis in gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and so on. However, the role it plays in promoting cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the upregulated expression of ROCK1 was highly correlated with downregulated expression of miR-335-5p in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Mechanistically, Knockdown of ROCK1 inhibited cell proliferation in vitro, accompanied by cell cycle change confirmed by flow analysis. Furthermore, miR-335-5p can downregulate the ROCK1 expression by directly binding to the 3'-untranslated region in posttranscriptional level. In vivo animal model showed similar results. Our findings highlighted the crucial role that miR-335-5p acted as a tumor suppressor to modulate cell proliferation and cell cycle progression via downregulating ROCK1 expression. And this miR-335-5p/ROCK1 axis contributed to NSCLC pathogenesis and might be promising targets for NSCLC therapy.
