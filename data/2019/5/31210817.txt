Background:Hepatitis C is the second leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the discovery of direct-acting agents made the disease curable, HCV elimination can be achieved solely by the host's immunologic arsenal.Case report:We report the case of a 29-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C infection - elevated transaminases, positive serology. HCV was detectable on two occasions, and histology showed mild disease - A1F1. Upon follow up and without any treatment, the patient achieved spontaneous clearance confirmed by two consecutive undetectable HCV RNA tests. Spontaneous HCV clearance rarely occurs - 0.5% per person-year. This is sometimes accompanied by special circumstances like additional disease or medical interventions. Host factors like gender and interleukin-28B polymorphisms have been known to contribute to clearance. Viral factors like HCV RNA levels are also a factor. The characteristics of host-viral interplay - age of acquisition and fibrosis stage - cannot be overlooked.Conclusion:All of the abovementioned factors contribute to the complex immunological interaction between virus and host and the result, although rarely can be spontaneous clearance.
Hepatitis C; interferon free treatment; spontaneous clearance.
