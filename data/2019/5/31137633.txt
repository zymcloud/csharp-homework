Increased glycolysis in tumor cells is associated with increased risk of tumor progression and mortality. Therefore, disruption of glycolysis, one of the main sources of cellular energy supply, can serve as a target for suppressing tumor growth and progression. Of note, hexokinase-2 (HK2) plays vital roles in glucose metabolism. Moreover, the expression of HK2 alters the metabolic phenotype and supports the continuous growth of tumor cells, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Quercetin (QUE), a bioactive flavonoid, has a profound anti-tumor effect on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the precise underlying mechanism of this effect is unclear. In the present study, we reported that QUE inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells that relied on aerobic glycolysis. We further found that QUE could decrease the protein levels of HK2 and suppress the AKT/mTOR pathway in HCC cells. In addition, QUE significantly restrained the growth of HCC xenografts and decreased HK-2 expression in vivo. Taken together, we have revealed that QUE suppresses the progression of HCC by inhibiting HK2-dependentglycolysis, which may have a promising potential to be an effective treatments for HCC, especially for those patients with high HK2 expression.
