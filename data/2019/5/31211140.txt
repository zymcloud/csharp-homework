Background:The chromobox (CBX) proteins CBX2, CBX4, CBX6, CBX7, and CBX8, also known as Polycomb (Pc) proteins, are canonical components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Abundant evidence indicates that abnormal expression of Pc proteins is associated with a variety of tumors, but their role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed a case-control study to investigate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CBX genes and HCC.Methods:Nine SNPs on CBX genes (rs7217395, rs2036316 of CBX2; rs3764374, rs1285251, rs2289728 of CBX4; rs7292074 of CBX6; and rs710190, rs139394, rs5750753 of CBX7) were screened and genotyped using MassARRAY technology in 334 HCC cases and 321 controls. The association between SNPs and their corresponding gene expressions was analyzed through bioinformatics methods using the Ensembl database and Blood eQTL browser online tools.Results:The results indicated that rs2289728 (G>A) of CBX4 (P = 0.03, OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33-0.94) and rs139394 (C>A) of CBX7 (P = 0.02, OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.90) decreased the risk of HCC. Interaction between rs2036316 and HBsAg increased the risk of HCC (P = 0.02, OR = 6.88, 95% CI: 5.20-9.11), whereas SNP-SNP interaction between rs710190 and rs139394 reduced the risk of HCC (P = 0.03, OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12-0.91). Gene expression analyses showed that the rs2289728 A allele and the rs139394 A allele significantly reduced CBX4 and CBX7 expression, respectively.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that CBX4 rs2289728 and CBX7 rs139394 are protective SNPs against HCC. The two SNPs may reduce the risk of HCC while suppressing the expression of CBX4 and CBX7.
