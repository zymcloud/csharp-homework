Prognostic significance of serum microcystin in hepatocellular carcinoma has not been well investigated. The aim of the study was to reveal the relationship between serum microcystin-LR and prognosis in these patients. There were 650 early-stage hepatitis B-induced hepatocellular carcinoma patients, who were not affected by hepatitis C, cirrhosis, heavy drinking or excessive aflatoxin exposure. All of them underwent hepatectomy and were followed up for 5 years. Tumor relapse and overall death were recorded. Blood specimens were collected on admission and at the time of relapse. Serum levels of microcystin-LR and fluorescent oxidation products (FlOP_360, FlOP_320 and FlOP_400) were measured separately using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fluorescence spectrometry. Multifactorial COX regression analysis suggested that serum microcystin-LR ≥ 0.97 ng/ml was associated with the increased risk of the tumor relapse (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.35-1.77) and serum microcystin-LR ≥ 1.09 ng/ml was related to the higher risk of the overall death (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.35-1.84) in the follow-up period. Furthermore, there was a linear relationship between serum level of microcystin-LR and serum levels of FlOP_360, FlOP_320 and FlOP_400 (P = 0.001, P = 0.023, P = 0.047). Serum levels of these fluorescent oxidation products were also higher in the patients with tumor relapse (P
