Introduction:The intermediate stage of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification includes a heterogenous population of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and palliative treatment with transarterial chemoembolization is recommended for all of them. In this regard, 2 other classifications could be useful, the subclassification BCLC-B (SUB) and the classification Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC).Objective:To determine the indication of curative or palliative treatment between SUB and HKLC in BCLC-B patients.Patients and methods:A retrospective study in HCC patients seen between 2011 and 2016 in southern Brazil. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. HCC staging was performed with BCLC, SUB, and HKLC.Results:A total of 570 patients with HCC were assessed, of whom 95 were classified as BCLC-B: 25 (26.0%) B1, 48 (50.5%) B2, 9 (9.5%) B3, and 13 (13.7%) B4. Overall median survival was 21.1 (95% confidence interval, 14.2-28.0) months. Median survival was higher for BCLC-B1 patients than in subgroups B3 (P=0.046) and B4 (P=0.001), and this was also seen for B2 versus B4 (P=0.044). Regarding the HKLC classification, a significantly higher median survival was observed for HKLC-I and HKLC-IIB in relation to the categories HKLC-IIIA (PConclusion:In intermediate HCC, SUB was able to identify a subset of patients with a higher overall survival. According to HKLC, 55.8% of BCLC-B patients could receive curative treatment.
