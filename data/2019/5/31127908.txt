Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most frequent cancers worldwide, for the treatment of which various therapy protocols and drugs have been introduced; however, none of them has suppressed cancer tissues completely. New research programs have been developed on cancer and the accompanied effects of novel synthesized compounds on cancer cell lines. Our latest reports on the molecular basis of cancer revealed a pattern of changes in gene expression triggered in the cancer pathway. Methods: HepG2 cell lines were cultured under similar conditions in both test and control groups. The IC50 concentration of the (2R, 4S)-N-(2, 5-difluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-1-(2, 2, 2-trifluoroacetyl) pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide compound was used in the treatment group. After 48 hours from the culture, the expressional profiles of apoptosis pathway genes (84 genes) were studied using the PCR array method. Results: The findings demonstrated that the expression of some apoptosis-related genes pertaining to TNF, BCL2, IAP, and caspase families was regulated by (2R, 4S)-N-(2, 5-difluorophenyl)-4-Hydroxy-1-(2, 2, 2-Trifluoroacetyl) Pyrrolidine-2-Carboxamide. In the same vein, an alteration was observed in the expression of both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes associated with the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways. Conclusions: According to the data obtained, the pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide compound was demonstrated to be able to regulate the apoptotic activities of HepG2 cells by affecting both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic relevant genes.
