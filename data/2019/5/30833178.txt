IL-15 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an essential role in the development and activation of natural killer (NK) cells. Adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ that secretes cytokines and is an important reservoir for lymphocytes. We hypothesized that activation of the IL-15 signaling in adipose tissue will activate and expand the NK cell population and control tumor growth. We recently developed an adipocyte-targeting recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector with minimal off-target transgene expression in the liver. Here, we used this rAAV system to deliver an IL-15/IL-15Rα complex to the abdominal fat by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Adipose IL-15/IL-15Rα complex gene transfer led to the expansion of NK cells in the adipose tissue and spleen in normal mice without notable side effects. The i.p. injection of rAAV-IL-15/IL-15Rα complex significantly suppressed the growth of Lewis lung carcinoma implanted subcutaneously and exerted a significant survival advantage in a B16-F10 melanoma metastasis model. The antitumor effects were associated with the expansion of the NK cells in the blood, spleen, abdominal fat, and tumor, as well as the enhancement of NK cell maturity. Our proof-of-concept preclinical studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the adipocyte-specific IL-15/IL-15Rα complex vector as a novel cancer immune gene therapy.
