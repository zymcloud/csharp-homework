Liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are life-threatening conditions frequently associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Asian countries, including Indonesia. HBV genotypes and several specific mutations are associated with disease progression. To clarify the geographical variation in viral characteristics, HBV genotypes and gene mutations were investigated in patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Sera were collected from 41 patients with ALD at Abdul Wahab Sjahranie Hospital and HBV carriers from Red Cross Center blood bank in Samarinda, and screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e-antigen. Liver function data were obtained from the medical records from each patient. HBV genotype and gene mutations were determined by polymerase chain reaction sequencing. Analysis of HBV isolates indicated that genotype B was the most frequent genotype, at 85.4 and 97.8%, followed by C, at 14.6 and 2.2%, in patients with ALD and in HBV carriers, respectively. The C1505A mutation in X region, T1753V and A1762T/G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter region and C1858T in precore (PC) region were frequent and only detected in patients with ALD (28.9, 40, 73.5 and 17.6%, respectively), whereas the G1896A mutation in the PC region was frequently detected in HBV carriers. The presence of HBV genotype B and certain HBV gene mutations were characteristic of patients with ALD in East Kalimantan.
