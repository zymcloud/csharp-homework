Aims:Thrombocytopenia is often associated with chronic liver disease. Lusutrombopag is a small molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonist designed to temporarily increase the platelet count in patients with chronic liver disease for whom elective invasive procedures are planned. In the present study, the efficacy and safety of repeated use of lusutrombopag prior to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma were examined.Methods:Eight patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had a platelet count Results:The platelet count increased to 103 100 ± 22 800/μL 14 days after the first treatment and to 110 700 ± 17 800/μL 14 days after the repeated use. None of the patients required platelet transfusion. None of the patients developed clinical symptoms such as thrombosis, fever, rash, portal vein thrombosis, bleeding, or any other serious adverse events.Conclusions:Repeated use of lusutrombopag increased the platelet count. It did not cause any serious adverse events and led to avoidance of platelet transfusion. Radiofrequency ablation was carried out safely in all patients. Future studies with more cases of repeated use are needed to examine the long-term efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag.
