Objective:Long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) frequently exhibited abnormal levels in numerous tumors and other diseases in current biological researches. LINC01287, a newly discovered lncRNA, has been found to act as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this research was to explore the expressions and functions of LINC01287 in breast cancer (BC).Patients and methods:The relative expressions of LINC01287 in BC tissues and cells were determined using RT-PCR. The associations between the LINC01287 expression, the clinicopathological factors, and the overall survival of BC patients were statistically examined. The apoptosis and proliferation abilities of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells were analyzed by MTT and flow cytometry assay after LINC01287 knockdown. The effects of LINC01287 in migration and invasion were determined using wound-healing and transwell assays. The protein expressions of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway were determined using Western blot.Results:We showed that the levels of LINC01287 were significantly upregulated in BC tissues and BC cell lines, and the abnormal expressions of LINC01287 were correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. A distinct difference was observed and indicated that BC patients with higher LINC01287 expressions had significantly shorter overall survival than patients with lower LINC01287 expressions. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that LINC01287 expression was independently correlated with the overall survival. Si-LINC01287 transfection significantly inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of BC cells, and further promoted apoptosis. Besides, the knockdown of LINC01287 suppressed Wnt/β-catenin activation and affected the expressions of β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-myc.Conclusions:Our findings indicated that the new lncRNA LINC01287 was correlated with poor clinical outcome and may function as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in the development of antineoplastic therapies for BC.
