Background: Preoperative treatments are considered for patients with worse outcome to improve overall survival and reduce tumor relapse. This study developed a prognostic risk estimation for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related solitary hepatocellular carcinoma after curative resection, including preoperative computed tomography (CT) signatures. Methods: Preoperative multiphasic CTs for 166 patients with operable HCC were performed in our hospital from 15 November 2013 through 15 May 2015. Follow-up information, until 5 June 2017, included: CT, pathological and clinical characteristics, and recurrence and metastases of HCC confirmed by pathological or radiological diagnosis. The parameters were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: In multivariate analyses, overall survival was not significantly associated with any of the analyzed prognostic risk factors, but did show that the following were significant prognostic risk factors for disease-free survival: larger tumor size, positive radiogenomic venous invasion, non-smooth tumor margin, and histological microvascular invasion. These were all incorporated into the nomogram. The calibration curves for predicting the probability of disease-free survival between the nomogram and actual observation showed good conformity. Conclusion: In patients with HBV-related HCC, CT signatures were a noninvasive significant indicator of disease-free survival. Thus, consideration of CT signatures may optimize preoperative treatment strategies for the individual patient.
