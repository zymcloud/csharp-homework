Hepatocarcinogenesis and distant metastasis pose major challenges for physicians. They are regulated by several genes, such as AKT, JUK, Wnt, and P53, and their expression activates several important processes such as cell proliferation, migration, motility, and interaction in the microenvironment. The leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR-5) is a novel biomarker, particularly in stem cells, and is involved in embryogenesis, tumor development, and tumor cell signal transduction. Here, we investigated LGR-5 expression using immunohistochemistry and analyzed the correlation between clinical features and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that LGR-5 expression was higher in tumor tissues than in normal liver tissues, and that high LGR-5 expression possibly favored poor outcomes in HCC, especially in well/moderate differentiation grade, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative, and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive groups. Thus, the LGR-5 marker is suggested to be a routine biomarker for poor prognosis, thereby providing a platform for anti-LGR-5-targeted therapy in the future.
