We aimed to determine the surveillance performance of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lectin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3), des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), and their combinations for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using prospectively collected longitudinal samples in patients at risk. Among 689 patients with cirrhosis and/or chronic hepatitis B who participated in four prospective studies, 42 HCC cases were diagnosed, selected, and matched with 168 controls for age, sex, etiology, cirrhosis, and duration of follow-up in a 1:4 ratio. Levels of AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP at the time of HCC diagnosis, month -6, and month -12 were compared between cases and controls. Of 42 HCC cases, 39 (93%) had cirrhosis, 36 (85.7%) had normal alanine aminotransferase levels, and 31 (73.8%) had very early-stage HCC (single
