Lenvatinib inhibits VEGF- and FGF-driven angiogenesis, and proliferation of tumor cells with activated FGF signaling pathways in preclinical models, and we previously demonstrated antitumor activity in human HCC xenograft tumor models. Here, we examined the inhibitory activity of lenvatinib against FGF-driven survival of human HCC cell lines. First, we conducted a histological analysis of FGF19-overexpressing Hep3B2.1-7 xenograft tumors collected from mice treated with lenvatinib. Second, we examined the effects of pharmacological inhibition on survival of cultured HCC cells with an activated FGF signaling pathway under nutrient-starved culture condition to mimic tumor microenvironments induced by angiogenesis inhibition. In the first analysis, area of histological focal necrosis was greater in Hep3B2.1-7 xenograft tumors with the lenvatinib treatment than that after the treatment with sorafenib, which does not inhibit FGFRs. Lenvatinib and E7090 (a selective FGFR1-3 inhibitor), but not sorafenib, induced death of Hep3B2.1-7, and another FGF19 overexpressing HuH-7 cells. Lenvatinib and E7090 decreased phosphorylation of downstream molecules of the FGF signaling pathway (such as FRS2, Erk, and p38 MAPK), and induced PARP cleavage, even under limited nutrients. PD0325901, MEK inhibitor, caused the same changes in HCC cells as those described above for lenvatinib and E7090. These results reveal that the FGF signaling pathway through MAPK cascades plays an important role in survival of HCC cell lines with an activated FGF signaling pathway under limited nutrients, and FGFR-MAPK cascades likely contribute to survival of HCC cells with an activated FGF signaling pathway under tumor microenvironments with limited nutrients, where tumor angiogenesis is inhibited.
