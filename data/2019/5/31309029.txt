Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 90% of all renal cancers. Patients may present with weight loss, hematuria, abdominal mass, abdominal pain, fever, and night sweats. The classic symptoms of flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable flank mass occur in less than 10% of patients and suggest advanced disease. However, most patients are typically asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally. RCC metastasizes most commonly to the lung parenchyma, bone, liver, and brain and less commonly to the thyroid, pancreas, muscle, skin, and soft tissue. It is very rare for RCC to metastasize to the orbital bone. We present a case of a patient who presented with left cheek pain, tingling, and numbness and was ultimately found to have orbital metastasis of RCC.
