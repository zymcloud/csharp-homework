As an effective antimalarial drug, Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is readily isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine of Artemisia annua. DHA is not only an autophagy promoter but also a substance with strong antitumor efficiency. The relationship between autophagy and inflammasomes has been suggested in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are few reports describing relationships between inflammasomes and autophagy in HCC therapy. The present study demonstrated that DHA suppressed cell proliferation in HepG2215 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibitory activity is mediated by autophagy, in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage. Then, DHA were first shown to promote AIM2/caspase-1 inflammasome. Compared with the DHA group, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA significantly inhibited the expressions of activated Caspase-1, a pyroptotic marker proteins. Meanwhile, repression of mTOR by rapamycin promoted autophagy and AIM2/caspase-1 activation. The caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK also notably blocked autophagy cell death characterized by the downexpression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II. Additionally, the study demonstrated that DHA suppressed pseudopodium formation and cell mobility. Therefore, we first reveal a novel mechanism that DHA promotes AIM2/caspase-1 inflammasome, which contributes to autophagy in HepG2215 cells. Moreover, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage was also involved in this process via ROS production.
