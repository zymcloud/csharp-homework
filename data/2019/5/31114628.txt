Aim:To evaluate the correlation of serum PIVKA-II levels and development of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:One hundred and twenty-three patients with newly diagnosed HCC were included in this study between March 2016 and October 2018. Thirty-five of these patients were detected with PVTT and all subjects were randomly divided to analysis group (N = 73) and validation (N = 50) group. Serum levels of PIVKA-II, laboratory tests including serum aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, platelet count, albumin levels were demonstrated in all the patients. T-test, chi-squared test and logistic regression was used for analyzing data. Diagnostic efficiency and cut-off value of PIVKA-II in PVTT development of HCC patients were calculated using receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis.Results:Serum level of PIVKA-II in HCC patients with PVTT was significantly higher than that in HCC patients without PVTT (995.8 mAU/ml vs 94.87 mAU/ml; P = 0.003), as well as D-dimer levels (2.12 mg/L vs 0.56 mg/L P = 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that high serum D-dimer level was an independent risk factor for development of PVTT (OR = 1.22, 95%CI 1.02-1.45). ROC curve showed that among analysis group, the area under ROC curve (AUROC) of PIVKA-II was 0.73 (95%CI 0.59-0.86). For the detection of PVTT in HCC, PIVKA-II had a sensitivity of 83.7% and a specificity of 69.2% at a cutoff of 221.26 mAU/ml, which had a sensitivity of 85.71% and a specificity of 55.56% in validation group, respectively.Conclusion:Serum PIVKA-II level is a potential marker for diagnosis of PVTT in HCC patients, which may guide therapeutic strategy and assessment of tumor prognosis of HCC.
