The study aimed to estimate cancer mortality among indigenous peoples in Acre State, Brazil. This was a descriptive observational study based on the nominal bank of the Brazilian Mortality Information System for the period from January 1st, 2000, to December 31st, 2012. The study analyzed the distribution death frequencies by sex and age. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated taking Goiânia (Goiás State), Acre State, and the North Region of Brazil as the references. A total of 81 deaths were identified, the majority in men (59.3%) and in individuals over 70 years of age. The five main sites in men were stomach, liver, colon and rectum, leukemia, and prostate. The five main sites in women were uterine cervix, stomach, liver, leukemia, and uterus. In indigenous men there was an excess of deaths from stomach cancer compared to the populations of Goiânia (SMR = 2.72; 2.58-2.87), Acre State (SMR = 2.05; 1.94-2.16) and North region (SMR = 3.10; 2.93-3.27). The same was observed for deaths from hepatic cell carcinomas referenced against Goiânia (SMR = 3.89; 3.66-4.14), Acre State (SMR = 1.79; 1.68-1.91), and the North of Brazil (SMR = 4.04; 3.77-4.30). Among indigenous women, there was an excess of cervical cancer in comparison to Goiânia (SMR = 4.67; 4.41-4.93), Acre State (SMR = 2.12; 2.00-2.24), and the North (SMR = 2.60; 2.45-2.75). The estimates show that preventable neoplasms such as cervical cancer and those linked to underdevelopment, such as stomach and liver cancer, account for 49.4% of deaths among indigenous peoples. Compared to the reference population, mortality from liver, stomach, and colorectal cancer and leukemias was more than twice as high in indigenous men; among indigenous women, cervical, stomach, and liver cancer and leukemias were 30% higher.
