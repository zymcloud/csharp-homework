Hepatic arterial pseudoaneurysm is a rare but potentially fatal condition that requires prompt management. We report a case of hepatic arterial pseudoaneurysm developed after radiofrequency ablation of a hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was successfully treated with percutaneous absolute ethanol injection under ultrasound guidance. Follow-up studies with ultrasound and computed tomography for 2 years after treatment revealed no evidence of local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and of the pseudoaneurysm.
