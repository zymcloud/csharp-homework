Background:Programmed cell death protein-1-targeted immunotherapy has shown promising results in phase II studies of hepatocellular carcinoma.Aim:To evaluate safety and efficacy of nivolumab and pembrolizumab in an international, multicentre, real-world cohort of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Sixty-five patients treated with nivolumab (n = 34) or pembrolizumab (n = 31) between July 10, 2015 and December 31, 2018 (data cut-off) across six centres in Austria and Germany were retrospectively analysed.Results:Child-Pugh class A/B/C was 32 (49%)/28 (43%)/5 (8%). Immunotherapy was used as systemic first-/second-/third-/fourth-line treatment in 9 (14%)/27 (42%)/26 (40%)/3 (5%) patients. Fifty-four patients had at least one follow-up imaging and were, therefore, available for radiological response assessment. The overall response and disease control rates were 12% and 49% respectively. Of 52 evaluable patients, four (8%) had hyperprogressive disease. Median time to progression was 5.5 (95% CI, 3.5-7.4) months, median progression-free survival was 4.6 (95% CI, 3.0-6.2) months, and median overall survival was 11.0 (95% CI, 8.2-13.8) months. Most common adverse events were infections (n = 7), rash (n = 6), pruritus (n = 3), fatigue (n = 3), diarrhoea (n = 3) and hepatitis (n = 3). Efficacy and safety results were comparable between Child-Pugh A and B patients; however, median overall survival (OS) was shorter in Child-Pugh B patients (16.7 vs 8.6 months; P = 0.065). There was no difference in terms of efficacy and adverse events between patients who received immunotherapy as first-/second-line and third-/fourth-line respectively.Conclusions:Programmed cell death protein-1-targeted immunotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab showed promising efficacy and safety in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, including subjects with Child-Pugh stage B and patients with intensive pretreatment.
