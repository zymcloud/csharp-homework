The ubiquitous intracellular protease dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) has roles in antigen presentation and B cell signaling. To investigate the importance of DPP9 in immune regeneration, primary and secondary chimeric mice were created in irradiated recipients using fetal liver cells and adult bone marrow cells, respectively, using wild-type (WT) and DPP9 gene-knockin (DPP9S729A) enzyme-inactive mice. Immune cell reconstitution was assessed at 6 and 16 weeks post-transplant. Primary chimeric mice successfully regenerated neutrophils, natural killer, T and B cells, irrespective of donor cell genotype. There were no significant differences in total myeloid cell or neutrophil numbers between DPP9-WT and DPP9S729A-reconstituted mice. In secondary chimeric mice, cells of DPP9S729A-origin cells displayed enhanced engraftment compared to WT. However, we observed no differences in myeloid or lymphoid lineage reconstitution between WT and DPP9S729A donors, indicating that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment and self-renewal is not diminished by the absence of DPP9 enzymatic activity. This is the first report on transplantation of bone marrow cells that lack DPP9 enzymatic activity.
