Aim: To assess the diagnostic value of selected miRNAs from various material collected from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Patients & methods: Tissue, serum, urine and fecal samples from HCC patients and healthy individuals were screened for associated miRNAs using microarray analysis; the selected miRNAs were then validated by real time-quantitative PCR on 65 patients. Results: Serum miR-122, a combination of serum miR-155 with miR-885-5p, a combination of urinary miR-532-3p with miR-765, and fecal miR-320a displayed 100% efficiency in discriminating patients from controls. A combination of urinary miR-532-3p and miR-765 allowed patients with neoplastic grade G3 to be distinguished from those with G1 and G2. Conclusion: Additionally to serum, urine and feces also appeared to be valuable source of potential HCC noninvasive miRNA biomarkers.
