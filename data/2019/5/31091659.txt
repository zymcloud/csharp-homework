Dysregulation of cellular energy metabolism is closely linked to cancer development and progression. Calorie or glucose restriction (CR or GR) inhibits energy-dependent pathways, including IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR, in cancer cells. However, alterations in proton dynamics and reversal of the pH gradient across the cell membrane, which results in intracellular alkalinization and extracellular acidification in cancer tissues, have emerged as important etiopathogenic factors. We measured glucose, lactate, and ATP production after GR, plant-derived CR-mimetic curcumin treatment, and curcumin plus GR in human hepatoma cells. Intracellular pH regulatory effects, in particular, protein-protein interactions within mTOR complex-1 and its structural change, were investigated. Curcumin treatment or GR mildly inhibited Na+/H+ exchanger-1 (NHE1). vATPase, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)-1, and MCT4 level. Combination treatment with curcumin and GR further enhanced the inhibitory effects on these transporters and proton-extruding enzymes, with intracellular pH reduction. ATP and lactate production decreased according to pH change. Modeling of mTOR protein revealed structural changes upon treatments, and curcumin plus GR decreased binding of Raptor and GÎ²L to mTOR, as well as of Rag A and Rag B to Raptor. Consequently, 4EBP1 phosphorylation was decreased and cell migration and proliferation were inhibited in a pH-dependent manner. Autophagy was increased by curcumin plus GR. In conclusion, curcumin treatment combined with GR may be a useful supportive approach for preventing intracellular alkalinization and cancer progression.
