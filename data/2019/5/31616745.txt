Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death and one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. HCC prognosis remains poor with an average survival rate between 6 and 12 months. Obstructive jaundice, as a main clinical feature, is uncommon in HCC. HCC with bile duct invasion is much rarer than HCC with vascular invasion. We present a case where a patient's HCC was diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and digital cholangioscopy because his HCC manifested as an obstructing lesion in the intrahepatic duct, but not in the liver.
