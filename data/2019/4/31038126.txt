BACKGROUND Modern medicine has suggested exercise therapy is one of the main treatments for postoperative rehabilitation of tumors. It can influence the recovery of cancer patients by changing the body's material metabolism and energy metabolism. However, studies on metabolic changes of exercise therapy on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after surgery are limited. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of aerobic exercise on mice after orthotopic HCC surgery by serum metabolomics test and explore the related mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 60 C57Bl/6 mice were used to establish an orthotopic xenograft model of H22 mouse hepatoma cells. Mice were randomly divided into 6 groups and it was found that the metabolic products of the early postoperative exercise group and sedentary group mainly included L-tryptophan, citric acid, and other energy-related metabolites. RESULTS Energy metabolites, such as succinic acid of the high-intensity exercise group were increased after surgery, whereas phospholipid metabolites, including phosphatidylethanolamine (18: 0/0: 0), were decreased. In the moderate-intensity exercise group, the change tendency was consistent, and the level of various metabolites decreased. CONCLUSIONS Thus, it is likely that aerobic exercise reduced the degree of postoperative stress responses and improved energy metabolism in mice. The underlying mechanism involves improving the tricarboxylic acid cycle, intervening in energy metabolism, reorganization caused by the tumor, reducing the abnormal increase of phospholipase activity caused by the stress of liver cancer, reducing the level of hemolytic phospholipids, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial pathway-initiated apoptosis.
