Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic compound derived from many common herbal plants. Although it is known that RA has many important biological activities, its effect on proteasome inhibitor-induced changes in cancer treatment or its effects on any experimental proteasome inhibition model is unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of RA on MG132-induced cytotoxicity, proteasome inhibition, autophagy, cellular stresses, and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were treated with 10, 100, and 1000 µM RA in the presence of MG132 for 24 h; 10 and 100 µM RA did not affect but 1000 µM RA decreased cell viability in HepG2 cells. MG132 caused a significant decrease in cell viability and phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin and a significant increase in levels of polyubiquitinated protein, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B-II (LC3B-II), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), protein carbonyl, and cleaved poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1); 10 and 100 µM RA did not significantly change these effects of MG132 in HepG2 cells; 1000 µM RA caused a significant decrease in cell viability and a significant increase in polyubiquitinated protein, LC3B-II, HSP70, BiP, ATF4, protein carbonyl, and cleaved PARP1 levels in MG132-treated cells. Our study showed that only 1000 µM RA increased MG132-induced cytotoxicity, proteasome inhibition, autophagy, cellular stresses, and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. According to our results, cytotoxic concentration of RA can potentiate the effects of MG132 in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
