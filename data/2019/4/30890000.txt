Objective:Citation analysis represents one of the best available methods to identify the most influential articles. This study aimed to identify and characterize the top 100 highly cited articles (T100) that focus on hepatocellular carcinoma and to reveal the trends in accomplishments within this field.Methods:A search of the Thomson Reuters Web of Science citation indexing database was conducted using terms related to hepatocellular carcinoma. The T100 were selected and analyzed further based on the number of citations, authorship, year of publication, journal, country of origin, institution, and article type.Results:Hepatology published the highest number of papers (n = 15), and the United States produced the highest number of contributions (n = 31). Barcelona University was the institution with the highest number of articles in the T100 (n = 9). The T100 articles included 35 observational studies, 13 randomized control studies, 25 basic research articles, 18 reviews, seven clinical guidelines, and two meta-analyses.Conclusions:This is the first bibliometric study to identify the most influential papers in hepatocellular carcinoma research. This report presents major advances and changes in research regarding hepatocellular carcinoma and can serve as a guide for writing a citable article.
