With the advent of several new systemic agents for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and the prospect of more to come it is expected that many more clinical trials will be undertaken to establish the best treatment paradigm(s). In order to help develop the most efficient and most relevant clinical trials this review concentrates on endpoints that have been used in the past. Survival is the gold standard. None of the surrogate endpoints correspond completely with survival. In addition, alternative clinical trial designs are presented that may be more efficient than the usual phase I, II, and III clinical trial strategy that has been used in the past.
