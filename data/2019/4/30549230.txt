Introduction:Surgical techniques for Spiegel lobectomy remain technically difficult because of its deep anatomical location. Laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy has not yet been standardized or widely reported. In the current study, we introduce technical improvements, including the liver hanging maneuver, to laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy. Additionally, we demonstrate the safety and feasibility of this procedure.Materials and surgical technique:We performed consecutive laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy on six patients: five with hepatocellular carcinoma and one with colorectal liver metastasis. As preparation before liver parenchymal resection, necessary and sufficient mobilization of the Spiegel lobe was performed. A few Glissonian pedicles of the Spiegel lobe were exposed from the hilar plate and divided to reduce the inflow to the Spiegel lobe. After that, vessel tape was used in the hanging maneuver. The tape was pulled forward to give the cutting plane moderate tension during liver parenchymal resection. Lifting this tape provided better exposure for determining the correct cutting plane during liver parenchymal transection. The median operation time was 207 min (range, 147-240 min) and the median intraoperative blood loss was 35 mL (range, 15-85 mL). There were no severe postoperative complications.Discussion:We safely performed laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy. To maintain a sufficient surgical view, especially during liver parenchymal resection, the hanging maneuver may be a useful technique. This single-center investigation into standardized laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy featuring improvements in technique showed potential for favorable results.
