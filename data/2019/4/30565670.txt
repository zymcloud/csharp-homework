Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and characterized by metastasizing and infiltrating adjacent and distant tissues. Notably, microRNA-1271 (miR-1271) is a tumor suppressor in various cancers. Therefore, we evaluate the ability of miR-1271 to influence cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in HBV-associated HCC through the Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway via targeting CCNA1. HBV-associated HCC and adjacent normal tissues were collected to identify the expression of miR-1271 and CCNA1. To verify the relationship between miR-1271 and CCNA1, we used bioinformatics prediction and the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The effects of miR-1271 on HBV-associated HCC cell behaviors were investigated by treatment of the miR-1271 mimic, the miR-1271 inhibitor, or small interfering RNA against CCNA1. The HBV-DNA quantitative assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromid assay, scratch test, transwell assay, and flow cytometry were used to detect HBV-DNA replication, cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis. MiR-1271 showed a low expression, whereas CCNA1 showed a high expression in HBV-associated HCC tissues. We identified that miR-1271 targeted and negatively regulated CCNA1. Upregulated miR-1271 and downregulated CCNA1 inhibited the HBV-associated HCC cell HBV-DNA replication, proliferation, migration, and invasion, while accelerating apoptosis by activating the AMPK signaling pathway. MiR-1271 promotes the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway by binding to CCNA1, whereby miR-1271 suppresses HBV-associated HCC progression. This study points to a potential therapeutic approach of downregulation of miR-1271 in HBV-associated HCC treatment.
