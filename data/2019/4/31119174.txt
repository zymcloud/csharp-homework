The high invasion and metastasizing abilities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the primary reasons for the high mortality rate of patients. Therefore, identification of agents to inhibit invasion and metastasis is very important for treatment of HCC. We analyzed the anti-invasion and antimetastatic effects of porcine recombinant NK-lysin, which was designed and expressed in vitro by our research group, on SMMC-7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cells via wound-healing assays, adhesion assays, invasion assays, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Western blot analysis. MTT assay results indicated that NK-lysin inhibited the growth of SMMC-7721 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. NK-lysin reduced the ability of cell migration, adhesion, and invasion. Based on gene and protein expression analysis, NK-lysin decreased β-catenin and MMP-2 expression. These results suggested that NK-lysin has anti-invasion and antimetastatic effects on hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro by reducing the level of the β-catenin and MMP-2.
