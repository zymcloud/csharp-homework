Purpose:To compare the imaging characteristics of intra-arterial cone-beam computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CBCTHA) versus intra-arterial computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) for intraprocedural transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) planning.Materials and methods:This single-institution retrospective study included 144 patients (96 men, mean age 67.9 years; 48 women, mean age 62.3 years) who underwent 181 TACE sessions between January 2015 and July 2017. Intraprocedural CBCTHA (111 procedures) or CTHA (70 procedures) was performed for TACE planning. Reformatted maximum intensity projection CBCTHA and CTHA images were reviewed by two radiologists and classified using an ordinal scoring system (for tumor identification, tumor feeder vessel identification, and streaking artifact) and a binary scoring system (for the presence of breathing motion artifact and field of view encompassing the entire liver). Data were analyzed using an F test and a z-score test.Results:There were no significant differences in demographic and tumor characteristics between the CBCTHA and CTHA patient cohorts. CTHA was superior to CBCTHA for tumor identification (P Conclusion:CTHA provides improved clinical relevant imaging information compared to CBCTHA for intraprocedural TACE planning.Level of evidence:Level III, retrospective comparative study.
