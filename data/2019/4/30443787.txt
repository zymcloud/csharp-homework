The treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has changed tremendously over the past 2 years, with an increasing variety of all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment regimens available for different HCV genotypes and distinct clinical settings. These treatments have significantly improved safety in patients with advanced liver disease compared with interferon (IFN)-based regimens. HCV modifies the human immune system to escape immunosurveillance via several mechanisms. One of the basic mechanisms of HCV is the ability to "switch" the immune response by reducing the activity of cells responsible for the elimination of virus-infected cells. IFN-free DAA treatment regimens provide a unique opportunity to assess the effect of HCV elimination on the immune system. Abrupt changes in the immune system can in some cases be responsible for two alarming processes: viral reactivation in patients with chronic hepatitis B and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with previous successful cancer treatment.
