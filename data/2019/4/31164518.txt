We report a case of systemic chemotherapy after biliary stent placement for obstructive jaundice due to hepatic portal lymph node metastasis after colorectal cancer surgery. The patient was a 40s woman. Laparoscopic anterior resection for rectosigmoidRS cancer was performed. The pathological diagnosis was T3N0M0PUL0R0, pStage â…¡ according to the 8th edition of colorectal cancer handling regulations. Because multiple liver metastases were observed 8 months after the surgery, partial resection of the posterior region of the liver was performed. Multiple lung metastases were observed 1 year after hepatectomy, but she wantedto undergo follow-up observation. Jaundice was observed 1 year after the diagnosis of lung metastasis, and obstructive jaundice due to hepatic portal lymph node metastasis was diagnosed. Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage(ERBD)was performed, and a bile duct stent was placed. After improving jaundice, 12 courses of mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab therapy were performed. Currently, because of the exacerbation of lung metastasis, FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab therapy is being administered. Systemic chemotherapy containing a molecular-targeted drug is being administered in our case, but complications relatedto the biliary stent have not been observed. There are few reports on similar cases, andfollow - up observation with careful attention to long-term safety is necessary.
