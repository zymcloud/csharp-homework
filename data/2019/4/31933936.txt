Emerging studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in regulating progression of pancreatic cancer (PaCa). miR-103 has been reported to serve as an oncomiR in hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer. However, litter is known regarding the function and molecular mechanism of miR-103 in PaCa. Here, we observed that miR-103 was markedly highly expressed in PaCa tissues and cell lines. Up-regulation of miR-103 expression was associated with advanced TNM stage, positive lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Furthermore, knock-down of miR-103 by its inhibitor resulted in inhibited cell invasion and migration. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, we identified that USP10 (Ubiquitin specific peptidase 10) was a directly target of miR-103. In addition, by using qRT-PCR assay and western blotting analysis, we found that miR-103 down-regulated the expression of USP10 in PaCa tissues and cell lines. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that up-regulation of miR-103 is associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis in PaCa patients. Our data further indicates that miR-103 is an upregulated oncomiR and promotes cell metastasis by targeting USP10, suggesting miR-103 may be a potential prognosis and treatment target for PaCa.
