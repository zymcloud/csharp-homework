Midkine antisense oligonucleotide (MK-ASODN) nanoliposomes have previously been shown to have inhibitory activity against hepatocellular carcinoma growth. Herein we report the 4-week sub-chronic toxicity of MK-ASODN nanoliposomes in SD rats. The adverse effects included loss of body weight gain and food consumption, peri-rhinal bleeding, piloerection, peri-anal filth, and kidney, liver, spleen, thymus, lung, and injection site lesions at high doses. Macroscopic changes were observed in the kidneys of the high-dose group, accompanied by a variation in urine protein and white blood cells, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine. The increased spleen and liver coefficient, and the variation in circulating white blood cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in the high-dose group demonstrated that inflammation was caused by MK-ASODN nanoliposomes and was consistent with the macroscopic changes in the spleen and liver. The main necropsy findings of the animals that died were macroscopic changes in the lung. No severe toxic effects or mortalities occurred in the low- and medium-dose groups. However, a No Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified since there were changes in organs deemed to be adverse at all dose levels. Thus, the maximum tolerated dose of MK-ASODN nanoliposomes for rats was considered to be 6 mg/kg/day.
