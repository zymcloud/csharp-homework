To explore the clinical significance of the altered expression of polycomb group (PcG)-associated protein RYBP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. Methods: The expression levels of RYBP in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues in 77 HCC cases were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the relationships between RYBP expression levels and HCC clinicopathological characteristics, five-year survival rates or prognosis of HCC patients were analyzed. Results: RYBP expression level was significantly decreased in HCC tumor tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues (P
