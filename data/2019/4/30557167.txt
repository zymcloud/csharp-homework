Introduction:The long-term risk of somatic disease in hepatoblastoma survivors has not been thoroughly evaluated in previous studies. In this population-based study of 86 five-year HB survivors, we used inpatient registers to evaluate the risk for a range of somatic diseases.Methods:In total, 86 five-year survivors of hepatoblastoma were identified in the Nordic cancer registries from 1964 to 2008 and 152,231 population comparisons were selected. Study subjects were followed in national hospital registries for somatic disease classified into 12 main diagnostic groups. Standardized hospitalization rate ratios (RRs) and absolute excess risks were calculated.Results:After a median follow-up of 11 years, 35 of the 86 five-year hepatoblastoma survivors had been hospitalized with a total of 69 hospitalizations, resulting in an RR of 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-3.5) and an overall absolute excess risk of 4.2 per 100 person-years. Highest risk was seen for benign neoplasms (RR=16) with 6 hospitalizations for benign neoplasms in the colon and one in rectum.Conclusions:The pattern of hospitalizations found in this first comprehensive follow-up of hepatoblastoma survivors seems reassuring. Less than 50% of the 5-year survivors had been hospitalized and often for diseases that were not severe or life-threatening.
