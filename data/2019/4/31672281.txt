Background:Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can lead to secondary pancreatic tumors even years after nephrectomy was performed. Surgical resection in selected patients shows appropriate survival rates.Methods:A systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. This review finished in May 2019 and included patients with resected pancreatic metastasis(es). The main purpose was to evaluate the results of surgical resection of pancreatic tumors secondary to kidney cancer.Results:After the screening process of articles, 21 were selected for the systematic review, which included 354 patients, whose disease-free interval (DFI) was 105.11 (0-361.56) months. Of these patients, 34.6% had additional metastases elsewhere at the time of the surgery, and 48.6% were symptomatic. Postoperative morbidity was 40.2%, The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 53.9% (26-75).Conclusion:Pancreatic surgery for the resection of RCC metastasis(es) is considered safe and shows low morbidity and mortality rates among selected patients in medical institutions where this type of procedure is commonly performed.
