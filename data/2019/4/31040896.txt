Background:Main portal vein tumor thrombus (MPVTT), which has a high incidence, is the major complication of terminal liver cancer. The occurrence of MPVTT is always a negative prognostic factor for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, attention should be paid to the treatment of MPVTT and its complications.Aim:To evaluate the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization/transarterial embolization (TACE/TAE)+125I seeds implantation with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in treating MPVTT and its complications.Methods:From January 2007 to March 2015, 85 consecutive patients with MPVTT were nonrandomly assigned to undergo treatment with TACE/TAE + TIPS and 125I implantation (TIPS-125I group) or TACE/TAE + TIPS only (TIPS only group) in Beijing Shijitan Hospital, and all clinical data were collected. During 24 mo follow-up, the incidence of overall survival, stent stenosis and symptom recurrence was analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of TIPS-125I.Results:During 24 mo follow-up of all patients, we collected data at 6, 12 and 24 mo. The rates of survival were 80%, 45%, and 20%, respectively, in the TIPS-125I group, whereas those in the TIPS only group were 64.4%, 24.4%, and 4.4%, respectively (P < 0.05). The rates of symptom recurrence were 7.5%, 22.5%, and 35%, respectively, in the TIPS-125I group, whereas those in the TIPS only group were 31.1%, 62.2%, and 82.2% (P < 0.05). The rates of stent restenosis were 12.5%, 27.5%, and 42.5%, respectively, in the TIPS-125I group, and 42.2%, 68.9%, and 84.4%, respectively, in the TIPS only group (P < 0.05). TIPS-125I was found to be significantly favorable in treating MPVTT and its complications in patients with HCC.Conclusion:TACE/TAE+125I combined with TIPS is effective in treating MPVTT and its complications, improving quality of life of patients and reducing mortality.
