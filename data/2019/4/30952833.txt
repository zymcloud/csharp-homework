Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive cancers worldwide. Despite such a public health importance, efficient therapeutic agents are still lacking for this malignancy. Most tumor cells use aerobic glycolysis to sustain anabolic growth, including HCC, and the preference of glycolysis often leads to a close association with poorer clinical outcomes. The histone methyltransferase SET8 plays crucial roles in controlling cell-cycle progression, transcription regulation, and tumorigenesis. However, it remains largely undefined whether SET8 affects the glucose metabolism in HCC. Here, we report that upregulation of SET8 is positively correlated with a poor survival rate in HCC patients. Both in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that SET8 deficiency conferred an impaired glucose metabolism phenotype and thus inhibited the progression of HCC tumors. By contrast, SET8 overexpression aggravated the glycolytic alterations and tumor progression. Mechanistically, SET8 directly binds to and inactivates KLF4, resulting in suppression of its downstream SIRT4. We also provided further evidence that mutations in SET8 failed to restrain the transactivation of SIRT4 by KLF4. Our data collectively uncover a novel mechanism of SET8 in mediating glycolytic metabolism in HCC cells and may provide a basis for targeting SET8 as a therapeutic strategy in HCC.
