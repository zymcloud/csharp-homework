Background and purpose:This study documents the utilization and efficacy of proton beam therapy (PBT) in western patients with localized unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods and methods:Forty-six patients with HCC, Child-Pugh class of A or B, no prior radiotherapy history, and ECOG performance status 0-2 received PBT at our institution from 2007 to 2016. Radiographic control within the PBT field (local control, LC) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from the start of PBT.Results:Most (83%) patients had Child-Pugh class A. Median tumor size was 6 cm (range, 1.5-21.0 cm); 22% of patients had multiple tumors and 28% had tumor vascular thrombosis. Twenty-five (54%) patients received prior treatment. Median biologically effective dose (BED) was 97.7 GyE (range, 33.6-144 GyE) administered in 15 fractions. Actuarial 2-year LC and OS rates were 81% and 62% respectively; median OS was 30.7 months. Out-of-field intrahepatic failure was the most common site of disease progression. Patients receiving BED â‰¥90 GyE had a significantly better OS than those receiving BED Conclusions:High-dose PBT is associated with high rates of LC and OS for unresectable HCC. Dose escalation may further improve outcomes.
