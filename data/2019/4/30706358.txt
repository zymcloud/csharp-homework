Science is still unable to develop a specific strategy for predicting breast cancer in humans. Several attempts are done to obtain the best and closest prognostic predictive biomarkers for breast cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of novel ratios calculated between the blood indices with CA15.3, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase as prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer. This study was conducted on two groups (Breast cancer Patients group in comparison to a control group who has no tumor family history). All the volunteers are subjected to the routine analysis included liver and kidney function tests, complete blood count with blood indices, tumor markers (CA15.3) assessment, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase analysis. Thirty different ratios were calculated in the present research between blood indices and three inexpensive serum biomarkers; CA15.3, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Fifteen ratios of them were significant in breast cancer group than the control group. Three ratios (PDW/lymphocytes, MPV/lymphocytes, and ALP/RDW) of them gave a sensitivity of 100% with high specificity as indicators for breast cancer incidence. The correlation between significant ratios was very interesting. The more interesting was in the results of subgroup analysis which showed that the ALP/RDW ratio is more specific for pre-menopause while PDW/lymphocytes ratio is more specific for post-menopause. The ratios PDW/lymphocytes, MPV/lymphocytes, and ALP/RDW can be used as prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer patients. The interesting advantage in the results depends on the availability of these indicators in routine blood analysis and will not increase the cost of the diagnostic plan.
