Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its pathologically more severe form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), have become prevalent worldwide and carry an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma and other metabolic diseases. Diverse animal models have been proposed to replicate particular characteristics of NAFLD and NASH and have provided significant clues to the critical molecular targets of NASH treatment. In this review, we summarize the histopathology, pathogenesis, and molecular basis of NAFLD progression and discuss the benchmark animal models of NAFLD/NASH.
