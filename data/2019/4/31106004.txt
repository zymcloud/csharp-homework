The present study aims to investigate retrospectively the efficacy and safety of sorafenib combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to treat unresectable remnant large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The 229 consecutive patients with unresectable remnant large HCC (diameter ≥ 5 cm) received RFA and sorafenib (RFA + Sor group, n = 102) or sorafenib (Sor group, n = 127) from January 2010 to January 2016. Complications and overall survival (OS) of the two groups were compared and subgroup analysis carried out. Survival curves were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method. The RFA + Sor group had no additional serious adverse events. The average OS was 18.3 ± 1.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.2-21.4) in the RFA + Sor group and 14.1 ± 1.1 months (95% CI: 11.8-16.3) in the Sor group, a difference the log-rank test indicated was significant (P = 0.03). The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates of the RFA + Sor group were 56.9%, 34.3%, and 11.7%, and those of the Sor group were 42.5%, 22.0%, and 5.5%, respectively. The between-group differences in 1- and 2-year survival rates were statistically significant, but not the difference in 3-year survival rates. Subgroup analysis showed that the RFA + Sor group achieved significantly more lifetime benefits than the Sor group in: patients with tumors 5-10 cm in diameter (hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-1.06 vs. HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63-1.22); patients with an isolated tumor (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.81 vs. HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55-1.24); and patients with remnant lesion volume
