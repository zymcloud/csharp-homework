Background:Oncogenic insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to analyze the dynamic alteration of IGF-II CpG site methylation status and its molecular mechanism in HCC progression.Methods:IGF-II alterations were observed in rat hepatocarcinogenesis models induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene. Liver IGF-II expression was compared by immunohistochemistry or tissue IGF-II specific concentration (nmol/mg protein). Status of human IGF-II promoter 3 (P3) or rat IGF-II P2 CpG site methylation was amplified by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). Serum IGF-II levels were quantitatively detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:The levels of hepatic IGF-II expression were significantly elevated in the HCC group (P s = -0.89, P < 0.001) or liver IGF-II level (rs = -0.84, P < 0.001).Conclusions:The increase of serum IGF-II and the alteration of oncogenic gene IGF-II methylation may be biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and DNA methylation may be the therapeutic target of HCC.
