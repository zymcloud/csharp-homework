Hepatocellular carcinoma is a rising cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA and around the world. Surgical resection and liver transplantation are the preferred management strategies; however, less than 30% of patients are eligible for surgery. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a promising local treatment option for non-surgical candidates. Local control rates between 95 and 100% have been reported at 1-2 years post-treatment, and classical radiation-induced liver disease described with conventional radiation is an unlikely complication from stereotactic radiotherapy. Enrollment in randomized trials will be essential in establishing the role of stereotactic radiation in treatment paradigms for hepatocellular carcinoma.
