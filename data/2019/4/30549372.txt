Aims:The liver function of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who obtained sustained virologic response (SVR) has been known to improve after HCV eradication. However, a predictor of liver function after SVR has not been definitively identified. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify a predictor of deteriorated liver function and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index after SVR was achieved by direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment.Methods:This study retrospectively enrolled 248 patients who obtained SVR by DAA treatment. None of the patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma during this study. Liver function was assessed at the end of treatment (EOT) and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 weeks after EOT.Results:At 96 weeks after EOT, the serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly decreased from those at EOT. The platelet count was significantly increased from 14.9 × 104 /μL at EOT to 17.1 × 104 /μL at 96 weeks after EOT. Ten patients showed an increased FIB-4 (>1.00) index. Multivariate analysis with 171 patients who underwent endoscopic assessment revealed that the presence of varices was an independent predictor of deterioration in the FIB-4 index (odds ratio, 5.56; P = 0.041).Conclusion:Most of the study patients who obtained SVR showed improved liver function after EOT. Patients without increasing platelet counts after SVR due to DAA therapy should be evaluated for complications induced by portal hypertension.
