Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that is used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting tumor cell growth and angiogenesis. Cutaneous adverse events of sorafenib are commonly reported, with alopecia and hand-foot skin reactions most frequently encountered. Acneiform eruptions represent rare adverse events that have only been reported at high doses of sorafenib. We present a patient who started low dose sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma and subsequently developed a fulminant facial acneiform eruption in the absence of other cutaneous adverse events. Treatment included topical clindamycin and tretinoin with some improvement. Facial acneiform eruption represents a rare consequence of sorafenib that has not previously been described at low doses. Additionally, acneiform papules in the absence of other cutaneous adverse events is unusual. The cutaneous mechanism is not well understood but may be related to indirect epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition or direct cytotoxic effects on eccrine glands. Topical treatment produces only minimal improvement in patients who continue sorafenib therapy. Discontinuation of the drug is usually unwarranted except in special circumstances.
