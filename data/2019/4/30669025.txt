Liver disease is a complicated pathological status with acute or chronic progressions, causing a series of damages to liver and massive burden to public health and society. Th17 and Treg, two subsets of CD4+ T helper cells, seem to keep a subtle balance in the maintenance of organic immune homeostasis including liver. The dysfunction of Th17/Treg balance in liver has been proved associated with hepatic injury and disease. Herein, we summarized the research advance of Th17 and Treg cells in different phenotypes of liver diseases in the past decade. It is known to all that hepatic diseases start from stimulations or infections like virus, autoimmune, alcohol and so on in the early stage, which would cause inflammation. With the disease consistently existed, severe outcomes like cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma appear finally. In conclusion, it is found that Th17 and Treg cells serve as an important role in the immune response imbalance of liver diseases from the beginning to the end stage. However, the effect of these two subsets of CD4+ T helper cells is not a stereotype. Pathological role which exacerbates the disease and protective character which inhibits damage to liver are co-existed in the effect of Th17 and Treg cells. Still, more studies should be carried out to enrich the understandings of liver disease and Th17/Treg immune balance in the future.
