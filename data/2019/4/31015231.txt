Malignant transformation of giant cell tumour of the bone is extremely rare. In addition, bone transformation in giant cell tumour may occur in different phases. With conventional X-rays, CT scans or MRIs, it may be challenging to distinguish among different phases of bone transformation, normal bone, soft tissue disease and bone disease (benign vs malignant lesions) and changes in multiple organs such as lung, liver and lymph nodes unless every lesion is biopsied, which is not practical. Molecular imaging with different isotopes (Tc-99m phosphonate, 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-d-glucose and sodium fluoride-18) may help to better characterise the disease. We hypothesised that molecular imaging could offer qualitative and quantitative characterisation of all stages of bone formation, destruction, reactivity or neoplasia in a patient with giant cell tumour of the bone, and we present the first case of molecular imaging where bone formation was seen in multiple soft tissues, such as lungs, muscles, lymph nodes and liver.
