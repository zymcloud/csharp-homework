Herba Epimedii, a commonly used Chinese medicine, has attracted much attention recently because of its potential hepatotoxic effects. 2″-O-Rhamnosyl icariside II, baohuoside I and baohuoside II are the main components of Herba Epimedii, and previous research indicates that these three compounds are related to the hepatotoxicity of Herba Epimedii. To test this idea, in this study, HL-7702 and HepG2 cells were chosen as the in vitro models and the influences of these three compounds on a series of cytotoxicity indices, including ALT, AST, LDH, SOD, GSH, MDA, ROS and MMP, were determined. The results showed that at certain concentrations, the three compounds had different effects on the indices. Among them, baohuoside I at high concentration (32 μg/mL) displayed more significant cytotoxicity than the other two compounds; therefore, it was inferred to be more closely correlated with the liver injury induced by Herba Epimedii combined with the previous study, and its toxic mechanisms may be involved in increasing oxidative stress and inducing apoptosis. The findings of this study may provide evidence of the toxic composition of Herba Epimedii to preliminarily discuss the toxic mechanisms and provide improved guidance for its clinical safety.
