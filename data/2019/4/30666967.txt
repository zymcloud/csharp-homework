Background/aims:As the most common liver disease in hemodialysis patients, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) can cause cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, even increase in renal-related mortality. In Turkey, the frequency of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies in hemodialysis patients ranged from 31.4% to 51%. Until recently, the mainstay of the CHC treatment for these patients was pegylated interferon with potential toxicities and low sustained virological response. The 3D regimen, a combination of four drugs (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, dasabuvir, and ritonavir), has recently been used for patients with chronic kidney disease infected with genotype 1a and 1b HCV. The aim of the present study was to present results of 3D treatment for patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic renal failure (CRF) who were chronically infected with HCV.Materials and methods:Overall, 25 patients with hemodialysis-dependent CRF who were infected with genotype 1a/1b HCV have been treated using the 3D regimen in our gastroenterology clinic between July 2016 and October 2017. Three patients were administered additional ribavirin 200 mg/day. Serum HCV RNAs, blood chemistry, blood count, and side effects were recorded at 0, 4, and 12 weeks.Results:All 25 patients completed and well tolerated their planned treatment. At the end of 4 weeks, the viral response (defined as HCV RNA clearance) rate was 92%. At the end of 12 weeks of treatment and 3 months after treatment, viral response rates were both 100%.Conclusion:We observed that the treatment with 3D regimen in hemodialysis patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C is highly effective and well tolerated.
