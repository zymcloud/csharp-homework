For many years, sorafenib has been the only approved systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For over a decade, randomized controlled trials exploring the efficacy of new drugs both in first- and second-line treatment have failed to prove any survival benefit. However, in the past few years, several advances have been made especially in pretreated patients; phase III trials of regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab in patients with elevated Î±-fetoprotein have demonstrated efficacy in patients progressing after or intolerant to sorafenib. In addition, early phase I and II trials have shown promising results of immunotherapy alone or in combination with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies in the same setting of patients. In this review, we will discuss the evidence on second-line options for HCC, focusing on the latest results that are currently refining the treatment scenario.
