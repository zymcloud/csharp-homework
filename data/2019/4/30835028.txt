Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality around the world. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the primary cancer of the liver, accounting for the majority of liver cancers. The risk factors associated with HCC include chronic infections with HBV and HCV, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Additionally, male patients have higher risk for than females, and the risk increases with older age. Mortality rates for HCC parallel its increasing incidence rates. In this context, incidence rate for HCC shows geographic variations in different parts of the world and is heavily affected by regional differences in risk factor for liver disease. The highest incidence rates for HCC are observed in Asia and Africa, while Europe and North America have lower rates. In fact, HBV is still regarded as the leading cause of HCC globally, while HCV is the most common cause of HCC in the USA. Recently, it has been suggested that HCC cases related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is on the rise, while the proportion of HCC attributed to alcoholic liver disease remains stable.
