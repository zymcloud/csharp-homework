Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a reliable clinical marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A highly sensitive fluorometric aptamer nanoprobe is described for AFP detection. It is based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between AFP aptamer labelled with 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs). The PdNPs quench the green fluorescence of the FAM-AFP aptamer via interactions between nitrogen functional groups of the AFP aptamer and PdNPs. When AFP was introduced into the FAM-AFP aptamer-PdNPs FRET system, the AFP aptamer preferentially combines with AFP. This results in a conformational change and weakens the interaction between the aptamer and the PdNPs. Thus, the fluorescence of FAM recovers. The fluorescence recovery of FAM increases linearly in the 5.0-150 ng·mL-1 AFP concentration range and has a 1.4 ng·mL-1 detection limit. The assay was applied to the analysis of spiked diluted human serum. The recovery values ranged from 98.3 to 112.9%, with relative standard deviations of <1.1%. This biosensing strategy provides a reliable and ultrasensitive protocol for the quantification of biomarkers with relevant antigens and aptamers.
