Tripartite motif-containing protein 7 (TRIM7), which is involved in the biosynthesis of glycogen, has been reported to drive lung tumorigenesis. In the present study, we aimed to examine the expression, roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of TRIM7 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to test the expression of TRIM7 in HCC tissues. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and tumorigenicity experiments were conducted to determine the function of TRIM7. The results showed that TRIM7 expression was elevated in human HCC tissues and that TRIM7 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, pTNM stage, serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA copy number and overall survival (OS) of HCC patients. TRIM7 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. TRIM7 knockdown also induced a G1/S checkpoint in HCC cell lines. Additionally, TRIM7 knockdown led to decreased phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) and increased expression of p53 and p21. Ectopic expression of TRIM7 promoted HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and p38 activation, but not in the presence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Moreover, TRIM7 overexpression enhanced the polyubiquitination and degradation of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6). DUSP6 overexpression abolished the promotional effect of TRIM7 overexpression on HCC cell proliferation and the activation of p38. Furthermore, HBV X protein (HBx), a protein coded by HBV, was demonstrated to upregulate TRIM7 expression. Collectively, TRIM7 overexpression may contribute to the highly proliferative characteristics of HCC cells, and targeting TRIM7 might be a potential strategy for HCC treatment.
