Purpose: Numerous studies have shown that the expression of microRNA-181c (miR-181c) is inhibited in various cancers, which suggests that it has a cancer suppressive effect. In the current study, we evaluated the regulation and characteristics of miR-181c in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and methods: Samples of tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected from 52 patients with HCC, and expression levels of miR-181c in these samples were investigated via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. HCC cell migration and invasion were investigated via wound healing assays and transwell assays. HCC cell apoptosis rates were assessed via flow cytometry, and HCC proliferation was assessed via 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine assays. In vivo tumors were initiated by subcutaneously inoculating HCC cells into nude mice. And various biomarkers were investigated via western blotting. Results: In microarray datasets and tumor tissues, significant downregulation of miR-181c was apparent compared with non-tumorous adjacent tissues. Expression of miR-181c in HCC cells was also significantly lower than it was in normal human liver cells. miR-181c regulated the migration, invasion, apoptosis, and proliferation of HCC cell lines in vitro, and tumor development in vivo. Observations also suggest that miR-181c regulates NCAPG in HCC cells, and its expression affects cellular invasion, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis. There was a negative correlation between miR-181c expression and NCAPG in HCC tissue samples. Conclusion: miR-181c exhibits tumor-suppression via the regulation of NCAPG levels.
