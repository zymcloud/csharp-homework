The incidence of oral cancer is increasing all over the world, with rates particularly high in Southeast Asian countries, such as Taiwan. Coronarin D (CD) has been confirmed to have anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial effects, and anti-apoptotic effects in human hepatocellular carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to explore whether CD has a suppression effect on oral cancer cells and the mechanisms involved. The results of our study revealed the significantly decreased cancer cell viability and increased activation of apoptosis via increased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased death receptors, leading to the activation of caspase-8, -9, -3. Moreover, the rate of apoptosis of cells treated with CD plus JNK inhibitors was decreased compared to CD-treated cells. This is the first study to demonstrate that CD induces apoptosis in human oral cancer cells and can be expected to be a promising anticancer agent for oral cancer treatment.
