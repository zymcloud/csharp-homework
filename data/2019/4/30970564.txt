Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most widespread tumors in the world and its prognosis is poor because of lack of effective treatments. Epidemiological studies show that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and advanced fibrosis represent a relevant risk factors to the HCC development. However little is known of pathophysiological mechanisms linking liver fibrogenesis to HCC in NASH. Recent advances in scientific research allowed to discover some mechanisms that may represent potential therapeutic targets. These include the integrin signaling, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, Hedgehog signaling and alteration of immune system. In the near future, knowledge of fibrosis-dependent carcinogenic mechanisms, will help optimize antifibrotic therapies as an approach to prevent and treat HCC in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis.
