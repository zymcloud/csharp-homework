Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting the Ras/Raf/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathways is an established treatment option for patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, despite its clinical benefit, chemoresistance and disease progression eventually occur almost invariably during treatment. Activation of the PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/serine/threonine kinase) pathway plays a role in the pathogenesis of HCC and may contribute to determine resistance to sorafenib. We thus evaluated in vitro the effects of the combination of sorafenib and copanlisib, a PI3K inhibitor recently approved for clinical use. The effects of copanlisib alone and in combination with sorafenib were assessed in several HCC cell lines by proliferation and colony formation assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses, and western blot. In addition, sorafenib-resistant cell clones were used. Copanlisib strongly reduced cell viability and colony formation in different native and sorafenib-resistant HCC cell lines by affecting cyclin D1/CDK4/6 signaling and causing cell cycle arrest. Elevation of phosphorylated (p)-AKT was observed upon incubation with sorafenib and was consistently found in six different unstimulated sorafenib-resistant cell clones. Copanlisib counteracted sorafenib-induced phosphorylation of p-AKT and synergistically potentiated its antineoplastic effect. In summary, copanlisib shows potent anticancer activity as a single agent and acts synergistically in combination with sorafenib in human HCC. Combination of sorafenib with copanlisib represents a rational potential therapeutic option for advanced HCC.
