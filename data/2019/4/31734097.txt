Background & aims:Egypt has one of the highest burdens of HCV infection worldwide. It has a large treatment programme, but reaching rural communities represents a major challenge. We report on the feasibility and effectiveness of a comprehensive community-based HCV prevention, testing and treatment model whose goal was to eliminate infection from all adult villagers.Methods:An HCV "educate, test and treat" programme was implemented in 73 villages across 7 governorates in Egypt between 06/2015 and 06/2018. The programme model comprised community mobilisation facilitated by a network of village promoters to support the education, testing and treatment of patients, as well as fundraising in the local community. Comprehensive testing, linkage to care and treatment were provided for all eligible villagers aged 12 to 80 years.Results:Of 221,855 eligible villagers, 204,749 (92.3%, 95% CI 91.6-93.5) were screened for HCV antibody and HBsAg, of whom 33,839 (16.5%, 95% CI 12.2-16.1) and 763 (0.4%, 95% CI 0.3-0.5) were positive, respectively. Nearly all 33,839 HCV antibody positive individuals had a sample immediately collected for HCV RNA testing, and 15,892 were HCV RNA positive. The overall prevalence of HCV viraemia was 7.8%. A total of 14,495 (91.2%, 95% CI 89.9-96.4) patients received treatment within a median of 2.1 weeks from serological diagnosis (IQR 0.6-3.3 weeks) and a sustained virological response was achieved among 14,238 of the treated cases (98.3%, 95% CI 96.7-98.6). Cirrhosis was present in 3,192 patients (20.1%), of whom 166 (5.2%) were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. There was treatment coverage and cure of 84.6% of the estimated 17,137 infected persons aged 12-80 years across the 73 villages.Conclusion:In this study of more than 200,000 villagers, we demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of a community-based "educate, test and treat" programme as a model for the elimination of HCV infection in rural communities.Lay summary:A large community-based educate, test and treat hepatitis C programme was conducted in more than 200,000 villagers across 73 villages in Egypt. This study demonstrates that a simplified care model can achieve high uptake of testing, linkage to care and treatment, with high cure rates. We consider this a model for the elimination of hepatitis C virus infection in rural communities, which can be applied to other countries highly affected by hepatitis C.
