Objective: To investigate TLR2 and TLR4 expressional situation on the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their relationship with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Methods: Flow cytometry was used to detect TLR2 and TLR4 expressional situation on the surface of PBMC in 78 cases with HCC, 56 cases with cirrhosis and 33 healthy controls. Furthermore, lactose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) was used to detect small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Results: Of the 78 cases with HCC, 56 cases (71.8%) were SIBO-positive, 23 cases (41.1%) were SIBO- positive in 56 cases with cirrhosis, and 1 (3.0%) was SIBO-positive in 33 healthy controls. The incidence of SIBO in HCC patients was higher than cirrhosis patients (χ(2) = 12.72, P < 0.05) and healthy controls (χ(2) = 41.18, P < 0.05). The expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 in HCC patients (100.55 ± 24.22, 42.76 ± 15.96) were significantly higher than cirrhosis (67.42 ± 18.36, 24.38 ± 8.68)and healthy control group (33.06 ± 11.72, 12.52 ± 4.46) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 in SIBO-positive patients (108.75 ± 20.40, 48.1 ± 14.98) were higher than SIBO-negative patients (79.67 ± 20.60, 28.62 ± 7.36) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The expression of TLR2 and TLR4 and the incidence of SIBO in HCC patients are significantly higher than cirrhosis and healthy control group. Moreover, the high expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 in SIBO-positive HCC patients may promote the development of HCC.
