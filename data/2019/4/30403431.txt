Aim:The clinical impact of serosal invasion by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the significance of serosal invasion as a prognostic factor for patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC.Methods:This retrospective study investigated patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between October 2003 and September 2016 in Ehime University Hospital (Toon, Japan). A total of 161 cases were enrolled after excluding cases of concomitant distant metastasis, macroscopic tumor remnant, mixed HCC, and rehepatectomy. We classified these 161 patients into groups with serosal invasion detected (S[+]) and serosal invasion undetected (S[-]). We compared patient characteristics, perioperative data, pathological findings, and prognosis between S(+) and S(-) groups.Results:Serosal invasion was observed in 19 of the 161 patients (12%). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was lower for S(+) (13.0%) than for S(-) (28.7%, P = 0.006). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was lower for S(+) (24.7%) than for S(-) (63.9%, P Conclusions:Serosal invasion was a strong predictor of worse outcomes after hepatectomy for HCC. Patients showing serosal invasion need close postoperative follow-up or consideration of adjuvant treatment.
