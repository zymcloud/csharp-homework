Non-anatomical liver resection with appropriate resection margin is regarded as a potential curative treatment for selected major hepatic carcinoma due to preserving maximal normal liver, especially in cirrhotic patients. But occurrence of cutting surface related complications becomes a main challenge. From June 2010 to June 2016, 448 patients with major hepatic carcinoma received non-anatomical liver resection in our liver surgery center. After excluding 66 cases that were incongruent with the purpose of study, 235 patients undergoing transparenchymal compressing suture (TCS) to "not good" cutting surface were allocated as study group; 147 patients with exposed surface (ES) were matched as control group. The characteristics of postoperative drainage, postoperative hepatic and renal functions, hospital days, and outcomes were collected retrospectively. We further compared cutting surface related complications under different levels of liver cirrhosis between the two groups. Compared with ES group, patients in TCS group had a decreased incidence of cutting surface related complications (14.3% vs. 6.8%, P=0.011) and a decreased probability of interventions for cutting surface related complications (8.2% vs. 3.4%, P=0.042). TCS application was much more effective to prevent cutting surface related complications in patients with moderate and severe cirrhosis (5.4% vs. 15.8%, P=0.003). Postoperative hepatic and renal function, hospital days and mortality did not differ between the two groups. In conclusion, TCS decreases the probability of cutting surface related complications and postoperative interventions for related complications, especially in patients with moderate and severe cirrhosis.
