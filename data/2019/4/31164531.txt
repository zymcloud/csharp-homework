This report describes a case of primary adenosquamous carcinoma of the liver with hepatolithiasis. A 70's man was followed up at a clinic for hepatolithiasis, gallbladder stone, and dilatation of the intrahepatic duct. He visited our hospital for computed tomography(CT)examination. CT showed a 30mm diameter low-density mass in the S2 liver and dilatation of the intrahe- patic duct filled with hepatolithiasis. Blood examination showed elevated levels of tumor markers(CEA 8.0 ng/mL, CA19-9 19,196 U/mL). We diagnosed the tumor as cholangiocellular carcinoma(cT2N1M0, cStage ⅣA)with hepatolithiasis and performed left hepatectomy and lymphadenectomy. In the specimen, a 39×22mm diameter solid tumor was detected and the intrahepatic duct was filled with haptolithiasis. Pathologically, a mixture of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma was observed adjacent to the bile duct. Accordingly, a diagnosis of adenosquamous carcinoma was made(pT3N0M0, pStage Ⅲ). Multiple liver metastases were detected 8 months after the operation, and chemotherapy was started. He remains alive 11 months after the operation. We experienced a rare case of adenosquamous carcinoma in the liver with hepatolithiasis.
