Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a huge threat to human health even though the diagnosis and treatment strategies have improved rapidly in the past few decades. Increasing evidence has illustrated the critical role noncoding RNA and their regulatory network play in the pathology of HCC. Here, we identified a novel long noncoding RNA, RP5-1120P11.3, that is ectopically expressed in HCC. Further characterization of RP5-1120P11.3 revealed that it promoted proliferation and invasion of HCC cells while inhibiting apoptosis. Importantly, our data revealed that miR-196b-5p interacted with and was regulated by RP5-1120P11.3 via a sponging mechanism. Inhibition of miR-196b-5p attenuated the phenotypes resulting from RP5-1120P11.3 inhibition. Moreover, our data showed that miR-196b-5p inhibited the expression of WIPF2 in HCC, illustrating a regulatory axis of RP5-1120P11.3-miR-196b-5p-WIPF2 that facilitated the progression of HCC. In addition, our data showed that RP5-1120P11.3 contributed to xenograft generation in vivo by regulating miR-196b-5p and WIPF2. These findings suggested that the RP5-1120P11.3-miR-196b-5p-WIPF2 axis is a potential target for treatment of HCC.
