We determined the role of miR-520e in the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. MiR-520e and EPH receptor A2 (EphA2) in HBV-positive HCC tissues and cells were detected, and we studied the impact of miR-520e and the EphA2 receptor in cellular and murine HBV replication models. We find that MiR-520e was upregulated and EphA2 was downregulated in HBV-positive HCC tissues and cells. MiR-520e was decreased in Huh7-X and HepG2-X cells in which HBx was stably expressed, but was dose-dependently elevated after interfering with HBx. Additionally, miR-520e mimic and si-EphA2 groups were reduced in association with increases in HBV DNA content, HBsAg and HBeAg levels, cell proliferation and were enhanced in the expressions of EphA2, p-p38MAPK/p38MAPK, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2)/ERK1/2 and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, si-EphA2 reversed the promotion effect of miR-520e inhibitor on HBV replication and tumour cell growth. Upregulating miR-520e in rAAV8-1.3HBV-infected mouse resulted in reduced EphA2 in liver tissues and HBV DNA content in serum. We find that MiR-520e was decreased in HBV-positive HCC, while overexpression of miR-520e blocked p38MAPK and ERK1/2 signalling pathways by an inhibitory effect on EphA2 and ultimately reduced HBV replication and inhibited tumour cell growth. These data indicate a role for miR-520e in the regulation of HBV replication.
