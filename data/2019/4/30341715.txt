An 82-year-old man presented with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) 24 years after achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) to an interferon for hepatitis C. His hepatic fibrosis stage was F1 when he was treated at 58 years. He was followed-up by annual blood tests and abdominal ultrasonography or computed tomography. After the IFN treatment, he had drunk approximately 100 g of ethanol. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had been elevated since 2012. To investigate the possible factors that affect hepatocarcinogenesis over 10 years after achieving an SVR, we reviewed the literature. Of 39 reported patients, 26, as well as ours, had one or more lifestyle-related factors, including body mass index â‰¥ 25 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, hepatosteatosis, or alcohol consumption. In our patient, aging and daily alcohol consumption might have triggered the development of HCCs.
