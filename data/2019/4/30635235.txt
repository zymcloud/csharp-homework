Various types of liver impairment have been described in patients with end-stage heart failure who are awaiting heart transplantation. The liver impairment may be severe, characterized by a high model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) Score and/or the presence of ascites, both of which are associated with a high risk of failure after single heart transplantation. A liver function assessment is therefore necessary before registration on the heart transplant list, moreover in case of long-developing heart failure, such as with congenital heart disease or in the presence of risk factors for chronic liver disease including excessive alcohol consumption, metabolic syndrome or chronic viral hepatitis B or C. In these instances, screening for cirrhosis with liver biopsy and for hepatocellular carcinoma through imaging must be systematic and when present, the indication for combined heart-liver transplantation must be considered. Its benefits, however, in case of liver failure with a high MELD score or multi-organ failure remains to be demonstrated. An exception in which the liver shows no morphological or functional alteration is with familial amyloid neuropathy, during which moderate to severe heart failure implies surgical treatment consisting of a liver or even heart-liver transplantation. These must be done early and are mainly contraindicated according to the level of neurological damage.
