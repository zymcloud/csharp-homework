The NDC80 (nuclear division cycle 80) complex takes part in chromosome segregation by forming an outer kinetochore and providing a platform for the interaction between chromosomes and microtubules, thus impacting the progression of mitosis and the cell cycle. The clinical significance of its components, NDC80, nuf2, spc24, and spc25, were widely explored in various malignancies respectively, yet seldom were they studied from the perspective of a complex. This paper explores the clinical importance of the NDC80 kinetochore complex components in terms of their expression level, prognostic value, and therapeutic potential in HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) patients. With the data from several paired HCC samples from Nanfang Hospital, HCC patients from the TCGA database and other cases from GSE89377, we analyzed the expression levels of the NDC80 complex components, NDC80/nuf2/spc24/spc25, along with the survival data as well as other clinical features using statistical methods and GSEA. The study found that a high expression of NDC80 complex predicts poor survival, and these components have the potential to be used as therapeutic targets.
