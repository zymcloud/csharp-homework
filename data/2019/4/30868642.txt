Introduction:It is well known that chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHBV) can be associated with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma but it can also be associated with extra-hepatic effects, of which cardiac manifestations are the one of the least known. There is a limited amount of data about myocardial dysfunction in CHBV and insufficient data of strain echocardiography in CHBV. The aim of this study was to detect early myocardial dysfunction in CHBV using strain echocardiography.Method:This prospective study included 40 CHBV patients without anti-viral treatment, 40 CHBV patients under anti-viral treatment, and 40 healthy volunteers as control group from 2017 October to 2018 May. The patients in all groups were aged 30-60 years, with no co-morbid diseases. Any patients with pathologies that would cause myocardial dysfunction were excluded from the study. All patients were evaluated with transthoracic two-dimensional (2D), tissue Doppler, and strain echocardiography.Results:The mean age and gender distribution were similar in all groups (P = 0.677). A statistically significant difference was determined between the groups in respect of the global circumferential strain and global longitudinal strain values (P Conclusion:As it is a chronic necro-inflammatory period, chronic HBV can affect myocardial functions. Traditional echocardiographic parameters may not be useful in the detection of early myocardial dysfunction. The results of this study showed that strain echocardiography may be more valuable in early myocardial dysfunction rather than routine 2D echocardiography in CHBV patients.
