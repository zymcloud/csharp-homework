Objective:To determine the outcome and prognostic variables associated with long-term survival and complications in dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division.Study design:Multi-institutional retrospective case series.Animals:Sixty-one client-owned dogs with central division masses.Methods:Medical records of dogs undergoing hepatic lobectomy of the central division from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2015 were reviewed for signalment, clinical signs, preoperative staging, preoperative cytology or biopsy results, date of procedure, location of mass, surgical technique, whether cholecystectomy or cholecystopexy was performed, complications, histopathologic diagnosis and margin evaluation, date of local recurrence or detection of metastatic disease, and survival.Results:Hilar resection was associated with increased intraoperative and postoperative complications. Intraoperative complications occurred in 29 dogs, with 20 dogs experiencing intraoperative hemorrhage. Nineteen dogs required transfusions. Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 20 dogs. Perioperative mortality rate was 11%, and 2-week mortality rate was 14.7%. The median survival time for dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not reached. The 1- and 3-year censored survival rates for dogs with HCC was 82.1% and 82.1%, respectively. Margin status did not impact survival time.Conclusion:Hepatic lobectomy of the central division was associated with hemorrhage in approximately 33% of dogs, but there was a relatively low perioperative mortality rate. Hepatic lobectomy for HCC resulted in long-term survival, regardless of margin status.Clinical significance:Surgeons should anticipate the requirement for blood products in dogs that may require hepatic lobectomy of the central division. Long-term survival can be expected after surgical treatment of HCC, regardless of margin status.
