Selenium is an important trace element. Many studies have proved that selenium can protect liver tissues by reducing response of immune inflammation and inducing high levels of ROS to promote tumor apoptosis. It can also participate in metabolism and involve in expression of selenoproteins. Selenoproteins also play a key role in liver diseases with regulating ROS and relating factors. In this review, we summarized the metabolic pathways of selenium intake and their bio-functions on liver diseases (Hepatoma, Cirrhosis and hepatitis). Moreover, the related molecular mechanisms are analyzed and discussed. Selenoproteins may be a promising target for liver diseases treatment.
