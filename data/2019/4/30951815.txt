The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway coordinates organismal growth and homeostasis in response to growth factors, nutrients, and cellular energy stage. The pathway regulates several major cellular processes and is implicated in various pathological conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This review summarizes recent advances of the mTOR pathway, highlights the potential of the mTOR pathway as a therapeutic target, and explores clinical trials targeting the mTOR pathway in HCC. Although the review focuses on the mTOR pathway involved in HCC, more comprehensive discussions (eg, developing a rational design for future trials targeting the mTOR pathway) are also applicable to other tumors.
