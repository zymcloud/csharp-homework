To investigate the expression of zinc finger protein 207 (ZNF207) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and analyze the correlation of ZNF207 with clinicopathological factors and HCC patients' survival. Methods: Real-time PCR was used to detect ZNF207 mRNA expression in 10 paired fresh HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver tissue samples. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was used to detect ZNF207 protein expression in 135 cases of randomly selected paraffin-embedded HCC tissues. The correlation of ZNF207 expression with clinicopathological factors and survival of HCC was analyzed. Results: The ZNF207 mRNA expression level in HCC was significantly higher than that in the adjacent non-tumor liver tissue (P
