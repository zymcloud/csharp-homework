Shenqi Fuzheng Injection (SFI) is a traditional Chinese medicine injection with anticancer properties and is mainly composed of ginseng and astragalus. Its efficacy has been confirmed in clinical trials, but the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the effect of SFI on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and identified its possible mechanism of synergistic effects when combined with the chemotherapeutic drug interferon (IFN-) α. An MTT assay was used to measure the inhibition effects of low-dose IFN-α (6000 IU) with or without SFI (0.5 g/L) on the HCC cell line MHCC97. VEGF-silenced MHCC97L-mir200 cell lines were prepared using lentiviral vectors and evaluated by real-time PCR to determine the inhibition effect. We examined MHCC97L-mir200 and MHCC97L cells by MTT assay, using IFN-α alone or in combination with SFI. The inhibition ratio of IFN-α (6000 IU) was -29.5%, while that for IFN-α (6000 IU) + SFI (0.5 g/L) was 17.0%, which was significantly higher than that for the IFN-α group (P < 0.01). The VEGF gene was silenced successfully in MHCC97-L cells. After interference of VEGF, the inhibition by SFI and IFN-α in MHCC97L-mir200 did not differ from that in MHCC97-L cells (P > 0.05). SFI can reduce the expression of VEGF in HCC, which can increase the efficacy of IFN-α, providing a theoretical basis for clinical application.
