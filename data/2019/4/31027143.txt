Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), as the most widely used biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), was correlated with ongoing liver damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of inflammatory correction-based AFP to identify HCC from other liver diseases.From March 2012 to March 2017, among 926 participants, a total of 501 patients whose transaminases were higher than the upper limit of normal range, including 166 treatment-na√Øve HCC patients were enrolled in our retrospective study. The liver function, white blood cell (WBC) count and serum AFP level of all patients were collected at the initial stage of admission. The area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC) of AFP, AFP/(Aspartate aminotransferase*Alanine aminotransferase) [AFP/(AST*ALT)] and AFP/WBC were compared between the HCC group and the control groups for the quantifying diagnostic efficacy.AUROCs of our novel index AFP/(AST*ALT) were up to 0.853 (95% confidence interval, CI 0.818-0.887, P
