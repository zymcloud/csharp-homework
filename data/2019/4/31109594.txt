Purpose:The aim of this study is to analyze the methylation levels of SPG20 promotor region and explore the association between the methylation levels and clinical features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:We collected paired of HCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANT) from 160 HCC patients and analyze the methylation levels through MassARRAY Analyzer 4. The statistical calculations were performed using SPSS version 22.0. Real-time-quantification PCR was performed to assess expression levels of SPG20 in HCC cell lines. Wound healing assay and transwell assay was used to measure cell migration capacity.Result:We found that mean methylation level of SPG20 in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in ANT (7.3% vs. 16.2%, PConclusion:The hypermethylation status of SPG20 gene promoter is significantly associated with intra-hepatic metastasis and contribute to HCC metastasis.
