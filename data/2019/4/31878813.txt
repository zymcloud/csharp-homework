Objective:Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a worldwide disease and the most common cause of liver cancer. This study aimed to identify specific areas of research activity concerning CHB treatment between 1973 and 2018 and to aid in identifying new areas for future development.Methods:The literature was searched from the GoPubMed and Web of Science databases using terms related to CHB treatment, analyzed with bibliometric methods and visualized using VOSviewer.Results:A total of 9486 and 5883 papers were collected from PubMed and Web of science, respectively. The studies focused on two clusters of topics: antiviral therapy for CHB and progressive diseases, and drug resistance. Studies related to antiviral drugs concentrated on lamivudine (n = 788), entecavir (n = 390), and adefovir dipivoxil (n = 376). Studies addressing conditions developing from CHB highlighted hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 403) and cirrhosis (n = 223). China (n = 1978) contributed the most publications. The 10 most quantitatively prolific organizations were in France. All 20 of the most cited papers investigated antiviral treatments for CHB or CHB-associated cirrhosis.Conclusions:Research on CHB treatment over the past 45 years has concentrated on antiviral therapy, CHB-associated progressive conditions, drug resistance and immunization. Although work on CHB treatment has made considerable progress, new approaches must be explored.
