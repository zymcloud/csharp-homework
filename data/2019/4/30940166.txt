Background:Previous studies have shown that zinc-finger CCHC-type containing 13 (ZCCHC13) is located in an imprinted gene cluster in the X-inactivation centre, but few published studies have provided evidence of its expression in cancers. The CCHC-type zinc finger motif has numerous biological activities (such as DNA binding and RNA binding) and mediates protein-protein interactions. In an effort to examine the clinical utility of ZCCHC13 in oncology, we investigated the expression of the ZCCHC13 mRNA and protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expression of the ZCCHC13 mRNA and protein was evaluated using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR, Western blotting and immunochemistry. DNA methylation was measured by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. The role of ZCCHC13 methylation was further evaluated using the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The presence of anti-ZCCHC13 antibodies was determined by an ELISA.Results:ZCCHC13 expression was frequently upregulated in human liver cancer cells and tissues. Compared with heathy individuals, sera from patients with HCC displayed a significant response to the recombinant ZCCHC13 protein. The overexpression of ZCCHC13 in HCC was attributed to DNA hypomethylation in the promoter region. Moreover, overexpression of ZCCHC13 in liver cancer cells promoted cell cycle progression by facilitating the G1-S transition, which was related to aberrant activation of the ATK/ERK/c-MYC/CDK pathway.Conclusions:Based on our findings, ZCCHC13 functions an oncogene for HCC, and DNA hypomethylation is a driving factor in carcinogenesis.
