Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) is recognized as a risk factor for early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria after curative treatment.Methods:One hundred eleven consecutive patients with HCC within the Milan criteria who underwent hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Independent preoperative predictors of MVI were identified, and a scoring system was developed using significant predictors.Results:MVI was identified in 51 of 111 patients (46%). Multivariate analysis identified the following independent predictors of MVI: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) of > 95 ng/mL (odds ratio [OR], 9.87; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.24-56.8; P = 0.002), des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) of > 55 mAU/mL (OR, 5.50; 95% CI, 2.09-15.4; P 2.8 cm (OR, 6.10; 95% CI, 2.07-20.0; P Conclusions:Our clinical scoring system, consisting of AFP, DCP, tumor size, and tumor margin in Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, can be valuable for predicting MVI in HCC within the Milan criteria before curative treatment.
