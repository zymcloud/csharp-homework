Background and aim:Although the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score is useful for prognostication of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a previous study has reported that the CLIP score was unable to stratify the postoperative outcomes of HCC patients in whom the score was low (0-1). Recent studies have reported that the preoperative lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) is useful for prognostication of patients with various cancer.Methods:We reviewed 329 HCC patients with a low CLIP score (0-1) undergoing curative resection. This study had the approval of the Institutional Review Board (28068). Multivariate analyses were carried out to detect clinical factors correlating with overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used for comparison of OS.Results:Multivariate analysis showed that LMR (P = 0.016) as well as portal vein invasion (HR, 2.410; 95%CI, 1.258-4.618; P = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test showed a significant difference in OS and relapse-free survival between patients with high LMR and those with low LMR.Conclusion:Preoperative LMR is useful for stratifying the prognosis of HCC patients with a low CLIP score (0-1) undergoing curative resection.
