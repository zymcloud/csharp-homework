Chloride channel 3 (CIC-3) has been suggested to be implicated in the carcinogenesis though; it still remains ill understood in hepatocarcinoma, especially in terms of clinicopathological meaning of its expression. Given this, herein, to understand the clinicopathological significance of CIC-3 expression in hepatocarcinoma, Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the level of CIC-3, followed by statistical analysis of the correlation between expression versus clinicopathological variables, including gender, age, TNM classifications, tumor size, lymph node metastasis and overall prognosis. It was shown that positive staining of CIC-3 can be present in both hepatocarcinoma and its paired normal controls; and that CIC-3 was significantly over-expressed in hepatcarcioma on the whole relative to paired normal controls. Moreover, up-regulation of CIC-3 markedly correlated with tumor size and overall prognosis, suggesting that CIC-3 expression could predict both tumor size and overall prognosis in hepatocarcinoma.
