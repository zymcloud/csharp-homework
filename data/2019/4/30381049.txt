Objectives:Veno-occlusive disease after liver transplant has been sporadically reported, and significant uncertainty exists concerning the best treatment and the long-term outcomes. Here, we reviewed our experience to evaluate clinical presentation, treatment, and the long-term outcomes of these patients.Materials and methods:Between 2000 and 2015, 2165 patients underwent liver transplant at our center. The incidence of veno-occlusive disease was 0.3% (7/2165).Results:Timing of veno-occlusive disease onset (median 4.7 mo; interquartile range, 2.5-11.1 mo) varied widely as did clinical presentation, which was characterized by a variable association of liver failure and portal hypertension and different disease pro-gression rates. In all cases, diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease was confirmed by liver biopsy. Six patients (85.7%) presented with veno-occlusive disease after a previous episode of acute cellular rejection. Three patients died due to veno-occlusive disease (n = 2) or due to hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence (n = 1). Two patients were treated by increasing immunosuppression and with interventional procedures (pleurodesis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, respectively), and 2 had successful retransplants. 5-year patient and graft survival rates were 57.1% and 28.6%, respectively.Conclusions:A tailored approach based on clinical features and including retransplant can achieve acceptable long-term survival in patients with veno-occlusive disease after liver transplant.
