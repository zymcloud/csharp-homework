Aims:To identify the optimal transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) approach in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; >5 cm) by comparing conventional TACE (cTACE) and drug-eluting-bead (DEB)-TACE.Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 63 consecutive HCC patients who received TACE at a single medical centre from September 2009 to October 2015. Primary endpoints were 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and time-to-progression (TTP). Hazard ratios (HRs) from Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated to compare survival estimates.Results:The median OS was shorter in the cTACE group, but was not significantly different from the DEB-TACE group (33.9 versus 35.6 months, respectively; p=0.52). The mean TTP was shorter in the cTACE group than in the DEB-TACE group (13.9 versus 17.5 months, respectively; p=0.01). There was no difference in 3-year survival (HR=0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-1.78; p=0.880) and TTP (HR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.42-1.16; p=0.147) between the groups; however, patients treated with DEB-TACE were more likely to have longer TTP in the first 2 years following treatment (HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.29-0.88; p=0.009).Conclusion:Although DEB-TACE is not superior in terms of TTP or OS in patients with large HCC, it may have greater efficacy in the first 24 months following therapy.
