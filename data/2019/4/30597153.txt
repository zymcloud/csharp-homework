We investigated the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to elucidate its uniqueness. Samples from 120 resected HCC cases underwent immunohistochemical analysis. Tumor area containing fibrous stroma and the percentage of steatotic cells within the tumor were evaluated. In our previous report, tumors were immunohistochemically subclassified as biliary/stem cell markers-positive (B/S) (cytokeratin 19 and/or sal-like protein 4 and/or epithelial cell adhesion molecule positive), Wnt/β-catenin signaling-related markers-positive (W/B) (β-catenin and/or glutamine synthetase positive), or all markers-negative (-/-) groups. Thirty-seven cases (31%) with fibrous stroma making up ≥50% of the largest tumor area were defined as scirrhous HCC (sHCC); the other 83 cases (69%) were categorized as common HCC (cHCC). Clinicopathologically, sHCC had fewer poorly differentiated tumors (P = .037) and a higher percentage of cases with steatosis (P = .025) than cHCC. sHCC cases were further divided into two subgroups: those with ≥5% steatotic cells (steatotic sHCC) and those with
