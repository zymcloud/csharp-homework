Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors, with a high degree of malignancy and a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and prognosis in patients with HCC. The expression levels of PKM2 and PKM1 in 86 cases of HCC were detected by immunohistochemistry. An H score was used to evaluate the expression of PKM, and all patients were further divided into PKM high-expression and PKM low-expression groups. The relationship between PKM2 expression and the clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of patients were subsequently analyzed. Our data suggested that the expression level of PKM2 was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent tissues and the negatively expression of PKM1 in HCC tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that PKM2 expression was strongly associated with survival in HCC patients (P = 0.001). The patients in the PKM2 high-expression group had significantly shorter survival times than the patients in the PKM2 low-expression group (hazard ratio for death, 2.358; 95% confidence interval [1.156, 4.812]; P = 0.018). In conclusion, these data indicate that PKM2 expression in HCC tissue samples can be used as a prognostic factor for patients with HCC and that high PKM2 expression is correlated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients.
