Chronic viral hepatitis is a risk factor for liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with advanced HCC have limited effective therapeutic options and are considered potential candidates for early phase clinical trials of anti-cancer agents. The impact of chronic viral hepatitis on the efficacy of anticancer agents for patients with HCC in phase I trials (P-Is) still remains unclear and has not been reported. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of consecutive HCC patients in P-Is conducted in a single institute, focusing on chronic viral hepatitis. Of 85 patients enrolled in P-Is, 46 (54%) patients positive and 39 (46%) patients negative for chronic viral hepatitis showed no significant difference in clinical and laboratory variables and on the point of the best response based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria; moreover, the frequency of Grade â‰¥3 adverse events (AE) was not significantly different. The median time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) from the P-I enrolment were 2.0 and 13.7 months, respectively. No patient experienced reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or treatment-related death. Chronic viral hepatitis does not independently affect the outcomes of anticancer drugs. Advanced HCC patients with chronic viral hepatitis could be feasible for P-Is.
