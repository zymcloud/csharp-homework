Capturing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood for subsequent analyses has shown potential in precision medicine for cancer patients. Broad as the prospect is, there are still some challenges that hamper its clinical applications. One of the challenges is to maintain the viability of the captured cells during the capturing and releasing processes. Herein, we have described a composite material that could encapsulate a magnetic Fe3O4 core in a MIL-100 shell (MMs), which could respond to pH changes and modify the anti-EpCAM antibody (anti-EpCAM-MMs) on the surface of MIL-100. After the anti-EpCAM-MMs captured the cells, there was no need for additional conditions but with the acidic environment during the cell culture process, MIL-100 could realize automatic degradation, leading to cell self-release. This self-release model could not only improve the cell viability, but could also reduce the steps of the release process and save human and material resources simultaneously. In addition, we combined clinical patients' case diagnosis with the DNA sequencing and next generation of RNA sequencing technologies in the hope of precision medicine for patients in the future.
