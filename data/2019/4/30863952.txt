The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is dependent on the stage of tumor at diagnosis. The earlier the tumor is found, the higher the chances to offer a curative treatment. In order to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma early, patients at risk should be enrolled in a surveillance program. The population at risk is usually defined as patients with cirrhosis. These patients should have twice a year a ultrasonographic examination of the liver. However, more and more patients will develop hepatocellular carcinoma in the context of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease which is tightly linked to obesity and diabetes. In these patients, this approach is jeopardized by the difficulty to perform a sonography of good quality due to the obesity and more importantly by the fact that hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in the context of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease before the cirrhosis. This article reviews the impact of the changing epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma on its screening.
