Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare disorder primarily associated with mutations in the KMT2D and KDM6A genes. Several tumors have been reported with KS; however, there have been no reports of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or hepatic adenomatosis. We present an adolescent girl with KS and a novel KMT2D mutation who developed diffuse adenomatosis, HCC, and subsequently underwent liver transplantation.
