Primary clear cell carcinoma of the liver (PCCCL) is a rare and special type of primary hepatocellular carcinoma. However, treatment methods for multiple metastatic PCCCL are lacking. Here, we report the case of a 55-year-old male PCCCL patient with multiple metastatic lesions who was clinically cured by sunitinib-based systematic treatment. This patient was diagnosed with PCCCL in Liver Segment 7, Child-Pugh A liver function, Stage A in November 16, 2009, and received radical excision of the cancer immediately. His disease recurred with multiple metastatic lesions in the liver and other parts of the body, including the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, lung and bilateral adrenal nodules in June 29, 2012. The biopsy results showed that the lung mass was lung metastasis of PCCCL. With Child-Pugh A liver function, Stage C of PCCCL was diagnosed. Sunitinib (37.5 mg, oral, once a day [qd]) in combination with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) was given. The tumor size steadily reduced, and the lesions were no longer obvious in May 21, 2014. The patient had multiple metastases and is in complete response (CR) state until now. He is considered as clinically cured. From the initial diagnosis of PCCCL, the survival period reached 8 years.
