Objective:The present study aimed to investigate the molecular events in alisol B 23-acetate (ABA) cytotoxic activity against a liver cancer cell line.Methods:First, we employed a quantitative proteomics approach based on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to identify the different proteins expressed in HepG2 liver cancer cells upon exposure to ABA. Next, bioinformatics analyses through DAVID and STRING on-line tools were used to predict the pathways involved. Finally, we applied functional validation including cell cycle analysis and Western blotting for apoptosis and mTOR pathway-related proteins to confirm the bioinformatics predictions.Results:We identified 330 different proteins with the SILAC-based quantitative proteomics approach. The bioinformatics analysis and the functional validation revealed that the mTOR pathway, ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle, and apoptosis pathways were differentially regulated by ABA. G1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and mTOR inhibition were confirmed.Conclusions:ABA, a potential mTOR inhibitor, induces the disruption of ribosomal biogenesis. It also affects the mTOR-MRP axis to cause G1 cell cycle arrest and finally leads to cancer cell apoptosis.
