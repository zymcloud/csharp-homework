The roles of concealed microproteins encoded by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are gradually being exposed, but their functions in tumorigenesis are still largely unclear. Here, we identify and characterize a conserved 99-amino acid microprotein named KRASIM that is encoded by the putative lncRNA NCBP2-AS2. KRASIM is differentially expressed in normal hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and can suppress HCC cell growth and proliferation. Mechanistically, KRASIM interacts and colocalizes with the KRAS protein in the cytoplasm of human HuH-7 hepatoma cells. More importantly, the overexpression of KRASIM decreases the KRAS protein level, leading to the inhibition of ERK signaling activity in HCC cells. These results demonstrate a novel microprotein repressor of the KRAS pathway for the first time and provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic signaling and HCC therapy.
