Objective:The abnormal expression of the key enzymes in glycolytic pathways, including glucose transporter-1, glucose transporter-3, hexokinase-II, lactate dehydrogenase 5, pyruvate kinase M2, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase-like protein 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 was reported to be associated with poor prognosis of various cancers. However, the association remains controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of glycolysis-related proteins.Materials and methods:We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, using Pubmed and Ovid as search engines and Google Scholar from inception to April 2017. Eighty-six studies with 12,002 patients were included in the study.Results:Our pooled results identified that glycolysis-related proteins in cancers were associated with shorter overall survival of colorectal cancer (HR 2.33, 95% CI 1.38-3.93, P = 0.002), gastric cancer (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.82, P Conclusion:Glycolytic transcriptional regulators and glycolysis-related proteins in cancers were significantly associated with poor prognosis, suggesting glycolytic status may be potentially valuable prognostic biomarkers for various cancers.
