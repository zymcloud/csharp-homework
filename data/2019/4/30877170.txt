Hepatic iron overload is a risk factor for progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although the molecular mechanisms underlying this association have remained unclear. We now show that the iron-sensing ubiquitin ligase FBXL5 is a previously unrecognized oncosuppressor in liver carcinogenesis in mice. Hepatocellular iron overload elicited by FBXL5 ablation gave rise to oxidative stress, tissue damage, inflammation, and compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes and to consequent promotion of liver carcinogenesis induced by exposure to a chemical carcinogen. The tumor-promoting outcome of FBXL5 deficiency in the liver was also found to be effective in a model of virus-induced HCC. FBXL5-deficient mice thus constitute the first genetically engineered mouse model of liver carcinogenesis promoted by iron overload. In addition, dysregulation of FBXL5-mediated cellular iron homeostasis was found to be associated with poor prognosis in human HCC, suggesting that FBXL5 plays a key role in defense against hepatocarcinogenesis.
