Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related death worldwide. However, the molecular mechanism underlying HCC carcinogenesis remains to be further elucidated. Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1) is a RNA/DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent RNA helicase. Here, we explored the expression and function of UPF1 in HCC. In this study, we demonstrated that UPF1 expression was significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. And further functional assays revealed that knockdown of UPF1 promoted HCC cells growth and invasion. Furthermore, we found that UPF1 could bind to long non-coding RNA urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1) and was negatively correlated with UCA1. UCA1 expression also affected HCC growth and invasion. Knockdown of UCA1 ameliorated the effect of UPF1 knock down on HCC growth and invasion. Knockdown of UPF1 enhances glycolysis in HCC. Taken together, our results provided new insights for finding novel therapeutic targets for hepatocellular carcinoma progression.
