Increasing evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to tumorigenesis, progression and recurrence of various malignancies including Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Lnc-DILC is reported to be the tumor suppressor gene to play an important role in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, the role of lnc-DILC in GBC remains to be elucidated. Herein, we show that lnc-DILC is upregulated in gallbladder CSCs and GBC patients' tissues. Knockdown of lnc-DILC attenuates the self-renewal, tumorigenicity, proliferation and metastasis of gallbladder CSCs. Mechanistically, lnc-DILC promotes gallbladder CSCs expansion via Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Special Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor FH535 diminishes the discrepancy of self-renewal, growth and metastasis between lnc-DILC interference GBC cells and their control cells. In conclusion, lnc-DILC drives gallbladder CSCs self-renewal, tumorigenicity, proliferation and metastasis by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and may therefore prove to be a potential therapeutic target for GBC patients.
