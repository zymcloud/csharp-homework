The patient was a 72-year-oldwoman. She had been diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura(ITP), hepatitis B, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to our hospital because of anemia andvomiting of blood vomiting and was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma at S6. A splenectomy was performed, with a temporary improvement of her platelet count. We tried to control the platelet count with medication and performed transcatheter arterial embolization(TACE)3 times. However, the tumor size decreased only slightly anda new tumor was observed on S2. Therefore, we increased the patient's platelet count to 109Ã—10 4/mL and performed a partial hepatectomy of 4 lesions. The postoperative complications included intraabdominal abscess, but there was no bleeding and the patient was discharged on POD 114. Platelet count is often difficult to maintain in patients diagnosed with ITP. We report our experiences and also provide a discussion of a case of operated hepatocellular carcinoma complicated with refractory ITP.
