Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in the world. The majority of the patients present at an advanced or incurable stage where neither locoregional treatment nor combination treatment of locoregional treatment and systemic therapies is feasible. For decades sorafenib was the only treatment option available for advanced HCC. However, with the advent of new and more effective therapies recently, the overall prognosis of advanced HCC has improved significantly. Areas covered: This review summarises the current systemic treatment options available and future prospects in the management of advanced HCC where patients are not suitable for locoregional treatment. Expert opinion: New effective targeted therapeutics have dramatically changed the treatment landscape for advanced HCC. The incorporation of sequential therapy including sorafenib or lenvatinib as first-line treatment and immunotherapy, regorafenib or cabozantinib as second-line treatment have significantly improved outcomes for patients with advanced HCC. Further development of novel combinations of these new agents and predictive/prognostic biomarkers are being explored. Efforts should also be made to tailor treatment to individual patients based on etiology, clinical and molecular factors.
