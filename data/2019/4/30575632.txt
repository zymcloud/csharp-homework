Background:Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. First-line therapy is either sorafenib or lenvatinib. Several treatment options have been recently added to the second-line treatment of advanced HCC. The aim of this network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was to compare the second-line treatments of advanced HCC.Methods:Network meta-analyses were computed for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, rates of grade 3 to 5 adverse events, and for treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. OS was considered to be the primary outcome of this study, and everolimus was chosen to be the common comparator for efficacy analyses and placebo for safety analyses. Subgroup analyses were computed for OS in patients with hepatitis B, patients with hepatitis C, Asian patients, patients with macrovascular invasion, and patients with extrahepatic metastases.Results:Thirteen randomized controlled trials including 5076 patients and evaluating 11 agents were found to be eligible. Regorafenib [hazard ratio (HR)=0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.44-0.81] and cabozantinib (HR=0.72, 95% CI=0.55-0.95) were found to significantly prolong OS compared with everolimus. The effect of regorafenib on OS tended to be conserved across patient subgroups. Regorafenib was also found to significantly prolong progression-free survival (HR=0.46, 95% CI=0.35-0.62) and significantly increase the rates of grade 3 to 5 adverse events (odds ratios=3.18, 95% CI=2.22-4.54) and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (odds ratios=2.67, 95% CI=1.21-5.87).Conclusions:This network meta-analysis concludes that, based on current evidence, regorafenib could be the agent of choice in the second-line treatment of HCC, with cabozantinib as a possible alternative for sorafenib-intolerant patients.
