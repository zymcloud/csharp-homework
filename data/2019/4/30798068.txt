Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an uncommon but significant outcome of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A serum biomarker for predicting progression to HCC would have a major impact on patient monitoring and clinical management. We explored circulating liver-expressed lectins, ficolin-2, ficolin-3 and mannose binding lectin (MBL), as potential biomarkers for the development of HCC. The activity of these three lectins were analysed in HCV positive patients who developed HCC (n = 31) with comparable HCV-positive HCC-negative patients (n = 106) and healthy controls (n = 79). Serum binding activity of ficolin-2 and MBL were elevated compared to controls. Analysis of pre-HCC onset samples revealed that MBL levels were significantly elevated up to 3 years, and ficolin-2 was elevated up to 1 year, prior to diagnosis of HCC over controls. This preliminary study identifies MBL and ficolin-2 as potential biomarkers for the development of HCC in chronic HCV infection.
