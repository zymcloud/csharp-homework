Background:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common among people living with HIV. There are limited data available on the pathophysiology of NAFLD and the development of fibrosis in this population.Objectives:The aim of this study was to investigate the association of bacterial translocation, adipose tissue dysfunction, monocyte activation and gut dysbiosis in patients with HIV monoinfection and NAFLD.Methods:Cases with biopsy-proven NAFLD and HIV monoinfection were age and sex-matched to HIV-positive and HIV-negative controls. Markers of bacterial translocation [lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], adipose tissue dysfunction (leptin, adiponectin) and monocyte activation (sCD14 and sCD163) were measured by ELISA. Hepatic patterns of macrophage activation were explored with immunohistochemistry. 16 s rRNA sequencing was performed with stool.Results:Thirty-three cases were included (≥F2 fibrosis n = 16), matched to HIV-positive (n = 29) and HIV-negative (n = 17) controls. Cases with NAFLD were more obese (BMI 31.0 ± 4.4 vs. 24.1 ± 2.8 kg/m, P < 0.001) and had significantly increased levels of sCD14, sCD163 and higher leptin to adiponectin ratio vs. HIV-positive controls. Cases with ≥F2 verses < F2 fibrosis had increased sCD14 (1.4 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.3 μg/ml, P = 0.023) and sCD163 (1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 0.8 ± 0.3 μg/ml, P = 0.060), which correlated with waist circumference (sCD14 P = 0.022, sCD163 P = 0.011). Immunohistochemistry showed increased hepatic portal macrophage clusters in patients with fibrosis. No markers of bacterial translocation or changes to the microbiome were associated with NAFLD or fibrosis.Conclusion:NAFLD fibrosis stage in HIV monoinfected patients is associated with monocyte activation in the context of obesity, which may be independent of bacterial translocation and gut microbiome.
