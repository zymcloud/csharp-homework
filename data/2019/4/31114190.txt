Purpose: To further enhance the antitumor efficacy through targeted delivery, DTX loaded lipid-based-nanosuspensions (DTX-LNS) were prepared and functionalized by PEGylation or NGR modification to develop DSPE-PEG2000 modified DTX-LNS (P-DTX-LNS) or DSPE-PEG2000-NGR modified DTX-LNS (N-DTX-LNS), respectively. Methods: Based on our previous work, functionalized DTX-LNS including P-DTX-LNS and N-DTX-LNS were prepared using thin-film hydration, and then characterized. Release behavior, stability in vitro, cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of functionalized LNS were observed. To demonstrate tumor targeting efficiency of functionalized DTX-LNS, in vivo real-time and ex vivo imaging study were conducted. Furthermore, therapeutic efficacy in vivo was evaluated in an H22-bearing mice model. Results: Functionalized DTX-LNS 100-110 nm in diameter were successfully prepared and exhibited good stability under various conditions. In vitro release studies demonstrated that DTX was released from functionalized DTX-LNS steadily and reached approximately 95% at 48 hrs. Functionalized DTX-LNS showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity and time-dependent internalization in human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) cells. In vivo real-time and ex vivo imaging results indicated that tumor targeting efficiencies of P-DiR-LNS and N-DiR-LNS were 29.9% and 34.3%, respectively. Moreover, evaluations of in vivo antitumor efficacy indicated that functionalized DTX-LNS effectively inhibited tumor growth with low toxicity. Conclusion: The functionalized LNS exhibited suitable particle size, nearly spherical structure, enough drug loading and great potentials for large-scale production. The results in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that functionalized LNS could realize tumor targeting and antitumor efficacy. Consequently, functionalized DTX-LNS could be expected to be used for tumor targeting therapy.
