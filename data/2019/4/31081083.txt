Objective:Detecting a single serum marker, such as Golgi protein 73 (GP73) or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), may not meet the requirements for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to low sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a simultaneous multiplex assay of GP73 and AFP.Patients and methods:Anti-human GP73- and AFP-coupled microsphere beads and biotin-labeled detectable antibodies were prepared to develop a multiplex assay of GP73 and AFP using the Luminex xMAP technology. The assay was evaluated for cross-reactivity, standard curve, sensitivity, range of detection, and precision. Additionally, the assay was used to determine the levels of serum GP73 and AFP in healthy controls and patients with chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and HCC.Results:The multiplex assay was successfully developed to simultaneously detect GP73 and AFP without cross-reactivity. The sensitivity for GP73 detection was 0.215 ng/mL and that for AFP detection was 0.666 ng/mL. The ranges of GP73 and AFP detection were 0.98-861.08 ng/mL and 2.01-1848.73 ng/mL, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were Conclusions:A multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of GP73 and AFP with high sensitivity and accuracy was developed for the diagnosis of HCC. This assay may provide a reliable reference for the early diagnosis of HCC.
