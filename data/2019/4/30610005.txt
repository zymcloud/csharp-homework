Aims:To evaluate stromal histopathological features and immunostaining expression for differential diagnosis of low- and high-grade dysplastic nodules (HGDN) to early and progressed hepatocellular carcinomas (eHCC, pHCC).Materials:We evaluated sinusoid capillarisation (SC), solitary artery (SA), ductular reaction (DR), stromal invasion and expression of six biomarkers (GPC3, HSP70, GS, CD34, CK19, EpCAM) in a series of 97 cases.Results:Stromal morphological changes, including SC, DR and SA, exhibited significant differences in differential diagnosis. In one indicator, SC had the best sensitivity (90.00%) and accuracy (85.42%), and SA had the best specificity at 88.89 %. In combinations, SC +and SA +were favourable and optimal. The immunoreactivity of GPC3, HSP70 and GS increased significantly in line with the stepwise progression of hepatocarcinogenesis.Conclusions:Stromal histopathology features are useful for diagnosing HGDN, eHCC and small HCC. The immunostaining panel of GPC3, HSP70 and GS can also be supplementary.
