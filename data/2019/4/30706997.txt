A new series of (sulfonamido)propanamides (6a1-6a13, 6b1-6b15, 7c1-7c5, 6d1-6d5, 6e1-6e6) was designed and synthesized. All the synthesized compounds were characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry. The target compounds were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), mouth epidermal carcinoma (KB), and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines with the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, with gemcitabine and mitomycin C as positive controls. Most of these compounds exhibit a more potent cytotoxic effect than the positive control group on various cancer cell lines and the most potent compound, 6a7, shows the IC50 values of 29.78±0.516 μm, 30.70±0.61 μm, and 64.89±3.09 μm in HepG2, HT-1080, KB, and MCF-7 cell lines, respectively. Thus, these compounds with potent cytotoxic activity have potential for development as new chemotherapy agents.
