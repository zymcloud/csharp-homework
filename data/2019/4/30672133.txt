Evidence indicated that GATA5 may suppress hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell malignant transformation, but the mechanism of how GATA5 affects cancer cell reprogramming to inhibit HCC malignant behaviour is still unclear. In this study, we report that the expression of β-catenin and reprogramming genes p-Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-myc and EpCAM was significantly higher in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. In contrast, the expression of GATA5 was significantly lower in HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues. Transfection of CDH-GATA5 vectors into HCC cells (HLE, Bel 7402 and PLC/PRF/5 cells) increased the GATA5 expression and decreased the expression of β-catenin and reprogramming genes p-Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, c-myc and EpCAM. Increased GATA5 expression by transfection with its expression vectors was also able to inhibit the cell growth, colony formation and capability of migration, invasion, while promoting apoptosis in HCC cells. Results revealed that GATA5 co-localization with β-catenin in the cytoplasm, preventing β-catenin from entering the nucleus. Treatment with the specific Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor salinomycin was able to reduce the expression of β-catenin and reprogramming genes. Salinomycin exerted a similar influence as GATA5, and siRNA-GATA5 restored β-catenin and reprogramming gene expression. This study demonstrates that an increase in the expression of GATA5 inhibits the expression of β-catenin and reprogramming genes and suppresses tumour growth, colony formation, metastasis and invasion, while promoting apoptosis in HCC cells. The mechanism of GATA5 inhibiting the malignant behaviours of HCC cells may involve in the disruption of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the reduction of reprogramming gene expression.
