Objective:To explore the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of percutaneous cryoablation combined with systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of liver metastases from esophageal carcinoma (ECLM).Materials and methods:We retrospectively collected data of 16 patients who received CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation concurrent systemic chemotherapy for liver metastases after primary esophageal carcinoma resection. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) was used for the assessment of quality of life (QOL), and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and complications were also evaluated.Results:The technical success rate was 96%, and no major complications related to cryoablation procedure were detected. Median OS and PFS after cryoablation were 14.5 months (range, 4-51 months) and 7.5 months (range, 1-31 months), respectively. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates were 56.3%, 31.3%, and 18.8%, respectively. The PFS rate at 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year after procedure were 68.8%, 31.3% and 18.8%, respectively. Furthermore, the QOL of patients was improved after cryoablation therapy compared with preoperative scores (P < 0.05).Conclusions:Percutaneous cryoablation combined with systemic chemotherapy is a safe, feasible and effective method to treat liver metastases from esophageal carcinoma. And to a certain extent, this approach is very efficacious in improving the QOL of patients with ECLM.
