Background:Several studies have focused on the association between KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and susceptibility to hepatitis B virus-related (HBV-related) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the conclusions have been inconsistent. We have conducted this updated meta-analysis to explore the association between KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and HCC susceptibility.Methods:Eligible studies were identified through systematic searches in PubMed, OVID, ISI Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases. The quality of evidence was systematically assessed by use of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case control studies in meta-analyses.Results:Ten studies containing 18 independent case-control studies were included. The results revealed a significant association between KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism and susceptibility to HCC under a random-effect allelic model (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.94, P = 0.003); HBV-positive subgroup (OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.95, P = 0.007); and Chinese-subgroup (OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.93, P = 0.002).Conclusions:G-allele appears to be a protective allele of KIF1B for HCC, especially in HBV-positive and Chinese populations. More well-designed studies with larger sample size and various ethnic groups and risk factors are needed to establish that KIF1B rs17401966 polymorphism is significantly associated with risk of HCC.
