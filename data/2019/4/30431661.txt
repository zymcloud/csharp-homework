Introduction:Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype G has been associated with increased liver fibrosis levels compared with other genotypes in cross-sectional studies, yet its role in fibrosis evolution remains to be established.Methods:In this prospective cohort study, 158 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HBV coinfected patients had available HBV genotyping at baseline. Liver fibrosis was assessed at baseline and every 6 to 12 months by the FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France). Risk factors for fibrosis regression (F3-F4 to F0-F1-F2) and progression (F0-F1-F2 to F3-F4) between baseline and end of follow-up were evaluated.Results:Most patients were male (88.6%) with a median age of 39 years. HBV genotype A was more prevalent compared with other HBV genotypes (62.7% vs D = 10.8%, E = 10.8%, and G = 15.8%). Patients were followed up for a median of 83 months (IQR = 37-97). In the 43 (27.2%) patients with F3-F4 baseline liver fibrosis, 7 (16.2%) regressed to F0-F1-F2 fibrosis at the last follow-up visit. In the 115 (72.8%) with F0-F1-F2 fibrosis at baseline, 19 (16.5%) progressed to F3-F4 fibrosis at last visit. In multivariable analysis, fibrosis progression was independently associated with older age (P <0.005), baseline CD4+ cell count less than 350/mm 3 ( P <0.01), longer antiretroviral therapy duration ( P <0.03), and HBV genotype G infection (vs non-G, P <0.01). When examining averages over time, the rate of FibroTest increase was faster in genotype G vs non-G-infected patients with baseline F0-F1-F2 fibrosis ( P for interaction = 0.002).Conclusion:In HIV-HBV coinfected patients, HBV genotype G is an independent risk factor for liver fibrosis progression as determined by noninvasive markers. HBV genotype G-infected patients with low initial liver fibrosis levels may require more careful monitoring.
