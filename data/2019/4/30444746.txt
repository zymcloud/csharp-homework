Background:Direct-acting antiviral (DAAs) represent advancement in the management of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatic cirrhosis. A high proportion of patients achieve a sustained virologic response; eradication of HCV is coupled with a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent evidence suggests that shortening of the DNA telomere may be linked to cellular senescence as well as predisposition to malignant transformation.Objective:This study aimed to assess pretreatment leukocytic DNA telomere length in HCV-related cirrhosis and post viral eradication using DAAs.Patients and methods:This study included 24 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, Child-Pugh A. Whole-blood samples were obtained from patients before treatment and 12 weeks after the end of treatment, as well as from 24 healthy controls. Terminal restriction fragment, corresponding to telomere length, was measured using a nonradioactive Southern blot technique, detected by chemiluminescence.Results:DNA telomere length was significantly shorter before treatment compared with 12 weeks after end of treatment in HCV-related cirrhotic patients. Also, it was significantly shorter in patients before treatment compared with healthy individuals.Conclusion:Telomere elongation in blood leukocytes can be considered a marker of recovery of inflammation after DAAs-induced HCV eradication. Still, the possibility of activation by cancer initiation cannot be excluded.
