Background:DNA methylation plays an important role in multiple biological processes that are closely related to human health. The study of DNA methylation can provide an insight into the mechanism behind human health and can also have a positive effect on the assessment of human health status. However, the available sequencing technology is limited by incomplete CpG coverage. Therefore, it is crucial to discover an efficient and convenient method capable of distinguishing between the states of CpG sites. Previous studies focused on identifying methylation states of the CpG sites in single cell, which only evaluated sequence information or structural information.Results:In this paper, we propose a novel model, LightCpG, which combines the positional features with the sequence and structural features to provide information on the CpG sites at two stages. Next, we used the LightGBM model for training of the CpG site identification, and further utilized sample extraction and merged features to reduce the training time. Our results indicate that our method achieves outstanding performance in recognition of DNA methylation. The average AUC values of our method using the 25 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) cell datasets and six human heptoplastoma-derived (HepG2) cell datasets were 0.9616 and 0.9213, respectively. Moreover, the average training times for our method on the HCC and HepG2 datasets were 8.3 and 5.06 s, respectively. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model was much lower compared with other available methods that detect methylation states of the CpG sites.Conclusions:In summary, LightCpG is an accurate model for identifying the DNA methylation status of CpG sites in single cells. Furthermore, three types of feature extraction methods and two strategies used in LightCpG are helpful for other prediction problems.
