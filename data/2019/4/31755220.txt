Antiviral therapy has been shown to improve the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical treatment, but antiviral treatments require further optimization. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacies of different antiviral strategies with HCC patients after hepatectomy/ablation. This prospective, randomized, controlled and multi-centre trial enrolled HBV DNA-positive primary HCC patients after hepatectomy/ablation between January 2007 and January 2009. Patients were divided into four groups: early combination (entecavir plus Peg-interferon [IFN]α-2a co-administration during year 1); late combination (addition of Peg-IFNα-2a for 48 weeks after 1 year of entecavir); nucleos(t)ide analogue[NA] monotherapy; and non-antiviral treatment. Primary endpoints included recurrence-free survival and overall survival. A total of 447 patients were enrolled. The 2-year and 8-year recurrence-free survival and 8-year overall survival rates were significantly higher in the early combination group than in the other two antiviral groups (P 1500 IU/mL and the mean HBsAg level was significantly lower in the early combination group compared with the late combination and NA monotherapy groups (P 1500 IU/mL after 48 weeks of therapy correlated with reduced mortality and disease recurrence. Early introduction of combination antiviral treatment may represent a more effective therapeutic strategy for patients with HBV DNA-positive HCC after hepatectomy/ablation. A reduction in HBsAg by >1500 IU/mL after 48-week treatment is associated with reduced mortality and disease recurrence of HBV DNA-positive HCC patients after hepatectomy/ablation.
