Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing carcinoma which microscopically mimics hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare entity known as hepatoid adenocarcinoma (HC). They usually arise in the stomach, while oesophageal origin is only occasionally encountered. This tumour is highly aggressive and is associated with a poor prognosis. They frequently metastasise to the liver, thus giving rise to diagnostic difficulty, especially in cases where simultaneous oesophageal and liver mass are present. We reported a case of oesophageal hepatoid carcinoma with multiple liver metastasis, that was associated with an increased serum AFP. The distinction between HCC and HC is important because HC is more aggressive and has a poorer prognosis with limited therapeutic options. An extensive diagnostic work-up which include a thorough clinical history, radiological investigations (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) as well as tissue biopsy supported by a panel of immunohistochemical markers are necessary to aid in the diagnosis of HC.
