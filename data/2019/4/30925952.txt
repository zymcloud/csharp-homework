Objective:To compare the reduction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk between long-term treatment of entecavir and low genetic barrier antiviral agents in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhotic patients.Study design:An observational study.Place and duration of study:Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, the Second Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China, from October 2008 to October 2016.Methodology:HBV-related cirrhotic patients with antiviral treatment for at least 12 months were consecutively included. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to improve comparability of the data from both entecavir group and the control group. Log-rank test was used to compare influence of various nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) for incidence of HCC. Independent risk factors were estimated by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.Results:The total cohort included 207 HBV-related cirrhotic patients, of which 83 patients were treated with entecavir initially. The present study found no statistical difference for the incidence of HCC between entecavir group and the control group in the total cohort (p=0.525). However, the difference became statistically significant (p=0.014) after propensity score matching. Number needed to treat (NNT) were 8 patients, 6 patients and 3 patients at years 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression in propensity score matching cohort revealed older age (HR: 1.066, p=0.041), NAs of low generic barrier (HR: 6.944, p=0.016), NAs resistance (HR: 3.648, p=0.041), and lower platelet counts (Conclusion:Entecavir is more efficient in reducing the incident HCC risk for HBV-related cirrhotic patients in comparison to low genetic barrier NAs.
