Liver diseases such as hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are one of the major health challenges in the world and many conditions such as inadequate nutrition, viral infection, ethanol and drug abuse, xenobiotic exposure, and metabolic diseases have been implicated in the development and progression of liver diseases. Several factors including lipid peroxidation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxynitrite formation, complement factors and proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, are involved in hepatic diseases. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural phenolic compound found mainly in the family Lamiaceae consisting of several medicinal plants, herbs and spices. Several biological activities have been reported for RA and these include antioxidant properties as a ROS scavenger and lipid peroxidation inhibitor, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and antiangiogenic among others. This review is aimed at discussing the effects of RA on the liver, highlighting its hepatoprotective potential and the underlying mechanisms.
