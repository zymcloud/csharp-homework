We report a 64-year-old woman with a 9-cm liver tumor in the left lateral section. The patient had neither hepatitis B or C virus infection, nor cirrhosis. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level was 1,889 U/ml. We also suspected bulky hilar lymph node metastasis, and a left lateral sectionectomy without lymph node dissection (R2) was performed. The pathological findings led to diagnosis of combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma. Three weeks post-operation, the patient underwent hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and mitomycin C. In addition, a total dose of 45 Gy of irradiation for the hilar lymph node was performed; while oral tegafur-uracil (UFT) has been administered for 10 years at a dose of 400 mg/day. The CA19-9 level of the patient was normalized after hepatectomy, hepatic arterial infusion, irradiation for hilar lymph node, and oral UFT administration. Currently, the patient is alive without any relapse for 12 years post-operation.
Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma; chemoradiotherapy; long-term survivor; lymph-node metastasis; multidisciplinary therapy.
