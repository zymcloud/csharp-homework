Pyroptosis is a novel programmed cell death form which is distinct from other types of cell death. As an inherently inflammatory process, it plays a vital role in cellular lysis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines when hosts defend against infections. Recent studies have reported that pyroptosis was involved in liver diseases and had important functions in the progress and development of liver diseases. Here, we addressed the potential role of pyroptosis in liver diseases on the basis of brief introduction of the morphological characteristics, molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms of pyroptosis.
