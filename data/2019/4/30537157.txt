Chronic liver inflammation caused by chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, the role of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as a predictor of liver inflammation has been questioned. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of noninvasive fibrosis markers including hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen type IV (CIV), N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), and laminin (LN) in identifying significant liver inflammation in patients with CHB, especially in patients with normal or near-normal ALT. A total of 242 CHB patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled. The serum levels of ALT, aspartate aminotransferase, HA, CIV, PIIINP, and LN were quantified and the relationship between histological staging and serum markers was systematically analyzed. Serum CIV, PIIINP, HA, and LN levels increased significantly along with the increasing severity of liver inflammation. Multivariate analysis showed that CIV and LN were independently associated with significant inflammation. CIV, PIIINP, HA, and LN levels were found to have high diagnostic values for predicting significant inflammation in patients with CHB (area under the curve, AUC = 0.807, 0.795, 0.767, and 0.703, respectively). The combined index for the identification of significant inflammation, including CIV, PIIINP, HA, and LN levels, significantly improved diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.851). Moreover, the combined index also achieved excellent diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.861) in patients with CHB with normal or near-normal ALT. In conclusion, the combined index may be a strong indicator for discriminating significant liver inflammation, especially in patients with CHB with normal or near-normal ALT.
