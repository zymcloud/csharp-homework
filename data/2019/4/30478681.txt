Background:The aim was to evaluate the prognoses and clinicopathological characteristics of solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) originating from the caudate lobe (HCC-CL).Methods:We analyzed 584 patients with a solitary tumor Results:HCC-CL had a similar rate of portal venous invasion (PVI) as HCC-NCL (21% vs. 19%); however, the frequency of tumor thrombus at the first branch of the portal vein (PV) or extension to the trunk or the opposite side of the PV was significantly higher in HCC-CL (8% vs. 2%). HCC-CL had similar OS rates compared to HCC-NCL; however, HCC-CL showed significantly poorer RFS. Although there were no significant differences among the three surgical procedures, blood loss and complication rates tended to be higher in cases who underwent an isolated caudate lobectomy. Tumor size ≥5 cm, PVI, and liver fibrosis or cirrhosis (LF or LC) were independent unfavorable factors for both OS and RFS. PIVKA-II ≥120 mAU/ml was an independent unfavorable factor for RFS.Conclusion:HCC-CL presented a poorer RFS rate. Patients with a tumor size ≥5 cm, PIVKA-II ≥120 mAU/ml, portal venous invasion, and LF or LC should be diligently followed up as these cases have a high risk of recurrence.
