Background:Although sorafenib is the global standard first-line systemic treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it does not have reliable predictive or prognostic biomarkers. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has shown promise as a biomarker for various cancers. We investigated the use of cfDNA to predict clinical outcomes in HCC patients treated with sorafenib.Methods:This prospective biomarker study analyzed plasma cfDNA from 151 HCC patients who received first-line sorafenib and 14 healthy controls. The concentration and VEGFA-to-EIF2C1 ratios (the VEGFA ratio) of cfDNA were measured. Low depth whole-genome sequencing of cfDNA was used to identify genome-wide copy number alteration (CNA), and the I-score was developed to express genomic instability. The I-score was defined as the sum of absolute Z-scores of sequenced reads on each chromosome. The primary aim of this study was to develop cfDNA biomarkers predicting treatment outcomes of sorafenib, and the primary study outcome was the association between biomarkers with treatment efficacy including disease control rate (DCR), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in these patients.Results:The cfDNA concentrations were significantly higher in HCC patients than in healthy controls (0.71 vs. 0.34 ng/Î¼L; P Conclusion:Pretreatment cfDNA concentration and genome-wide CNA in cfDNA are potential biomarkers predicting outcomes in advanced HCC patients receiving first-line sorafenib.
