Cell division cycle associated 5 (CDCA5) is an important element for the interaction between cohesin and chromatin in interphase. It is abnormally expressed in many types of cancer and works as an indicator of poor prognosis, but little is known about its activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we found that the expression of CDCA5 was upregulated in HCC tissues compared to paracancerous tissues and had a negative correlation with patient survival. Cell proliferation and tumorigenesis were inhibited and cell apoptosis was induced with the knockdown of CDCA5, suggesting an oncogenic role of CDCA5 in liver cancer. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that CDCA5 was transcribed by E2F1. Furthermore, we confirmed that CDCA5 interrupted cell behavior via the AKT pathway. These findings demonstrated that CDCA5 plays an important role in HCC progression.
