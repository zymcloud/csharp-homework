To better understand the toxicological activities of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), we examined the effects of PFOA on apoptosis and its molecular mechanism in SMMC-7721 hepatoma cells. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR were used to examine the protein and gene expressions of Bax and Bcl-2. Our results showed that PFOA inhibited SMMC-7721 cell growth and induced apoptosis. PFOA treatment increased Bax expression and increased Bcl-2 expression at both gene and protein levels. Our study demonstrated that PFOA had toxic effects on SMMC-7721 cells, such as inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, we showed that PFOA-mediated induction of apoptosis involved inducing Bax and decreasing Bcl-2 expression as a molecular mechanism of its toxicological effects.
