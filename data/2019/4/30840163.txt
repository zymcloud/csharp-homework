Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Liver transplantation is also the optimal treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially in the setting of chronic liver disease. Unfortunately, due to the worldwide shortage of organs, this treatment is not available for all patients with HCC. Strict selection criteria have been developed in order to obtain optimal results. A surgical perspective of the preoperative selection, perioperative management, and postoperative care of patients is reviewed in depth and provides an overview for obtaining optimal long-term results from liver transplantation for HCC. With rigorous selection and patient management, excellent long-term outcomes can be obtained with liver transplantation for patients with HCC.
