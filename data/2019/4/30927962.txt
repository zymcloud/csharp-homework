Objective:To retrospectively evaluate the value of MR features based on Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS ver.2017) for identifying the status of cytokeratin (CK) 19 expression of HCC before surgery.Methods:A total of 201 patients with 207 HCCs who underwent MR imaging were reviewed retrospectively. MR features based on LI-RADS ver.2017 as well as clinical data were compared between CK19-positive (n = 51) and CK19-negative (n = 156) HCCs groups. Potential predictive parameters were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and diagnostic odds ratios (ORs) were recorded.Results:MR features including targetoid appearance (p = 0.001) was more frequently observed while non-peripheral "washout" (p 20 ng/ml (OR = 5.9) and targetoid appearance (OR = 4.2) and non-peripheral "washout" (OR = 0.2) were significant independent predictors of CK19-positive HCCs.Conclusion:Targetoid appearance and absence non-peripheral "washout" combined with elevated AFP were useful for differentiating CK19-positive HCCs from CK19-negative HCC.
