Objective:This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) DWI and R2* (transverse relaxation rate) mapping to monitor the hyperacute therapeutic efficacy of desacetylvinblastine monohydrazide (DAVLBH) on an experimental hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model within 24 hours.Materials and methods:Forty-four mice were implanted with hepatocellular carcinoma and divided into three random groups. A treatment group and a control group underwent IVIM-DWI and R2* mapping examinations before and after a single injection of DAVLBH or saline at 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours. The pathology group was set for pathologic analysis, including H and E staining and CD31 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α immunohistochemical staining.Results:DAVLBH caused hyperacute disruptions on the tumor capillaries in the treatment group. Water molecule diffusion (D), microcirculation perfusion (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) decreased initially but then gradually recovered to the baseline level by 24 hours after the first injection of DAVLBH. In contrast, R2* increased dramatically at 1 hour and then gradually decreased from 1 hour to 24 hours after treatment. D*, f, and D showed similar trends and were positively correlated with CD31 expression (r = 0.868, 0.721, and 0.730, respectively), but were negatively correlated with HIF-1α expression (r = -0.784, -0.737, and -0.673, respectively). R2* showed a negative correlation with CD31 expression (r = -0.823) and a positive correlation with HIF-1α expression (r = 0.791).Conclusion:Both IVIM-DWI and R2* mapping can adequately detect the vascular-disrupting effect of DAVLBH as early as 1 hour after injection in a mouse xenograft model. Moreover, D* and R2* are the two most sensitive hemodynamic parameters and can monitor the hyperacute changes associated with DAVLBH treatment in vivo.
