Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver cirrhosis occurs in about 20% of chronically infected patients over a duration of 10-20 years, and within 5 years approximately 10-20% of these cirrhotic patients will develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies report that the X-ray repair cross-complementing group1 gene (XRCC1) is important in the risk of HCC development; however, results obtained from these studies are conflicting rather than conclusive. We hypothesised an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in XRCC1 with the HCC risk on a background of chronic hepatitis C.Materials and methods:We recruited 210 subjects, 70 with HCC, 70 with cirrhosis and 70 healthy controls. Two SNPs [c.1254C>T(rs2293035) and c.1517G>C(rs139599857)] in XRCC1 were genotyped using created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction (CRS-PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods.Results:The TT genotype, CT genotype and T-allele in c.1254C>T (rs2293035) were linked to risk of HCC compared to the CC genotype: OR 3.58 [confidence interval (CI) 95%: 1.19-10.7] p = 0.019; OR 2.16 (CI 95%: 1.04-4.47) p = 0.037 and OR 2.10 (CI 95%: 1.2-3.3) p = 0.006, respectively. Regarding c.1517G>C (rs139599857), the CC genotype, GC genotype and C-allele were linked with higher risk of developing HCC compared to GG genotype: OR 4.77 (CI 95%: 1.3-16.9), p = 0.016; OR 3.02 (CI 95%: 1.46-6.2), p = 0.002 and OR 2.4 (CI 95%: 1.4-4.0), p = 0.001, respectively.Conclusion:We conclude that the T-allele of c.1254C>T (rs2293035) and the C allele of c.1517G>C (rs139599857) genetic variants may be associated with increased HCC risk among chronic hepatitis C patients.
