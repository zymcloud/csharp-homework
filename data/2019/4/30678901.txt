BRM270 is the most leading phytochemical extract that possesses potent anticancer properties. A major challenge associated with this drug is its low bioavailability and thus requires high dosages for cancer treatment. Here, we report the novel nano-synthesis of phyto-composite, BRM270 for the first time by mechanical milling method with specific modifications for enhanced cytotoxicity against HepG2 human hepatoma cancer cells. Unlike free BRM270 and other phytomedicines, BRM270 nanoparticles (BRM270 NPs) are well-dispersed and small sized (23 to 70 nm) which is believed to greatly enhanced cellular uptake. Furthermore, the acidic tumor microenvironment attracts BRM270 NPs enhancing targeted therapy while leaving normal cells less affected. The comparative cytotoxicity analysis using MTT assay among the three treatment groups, such as free BRM270, BRM270 NPs, and doxorubicin demonstrated that BRM270 NPs induced greater cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an effective drug concentration of 12 Î¼g/ml. From FACS analysis, we observed an apoptotic cell death of 44.4% at BRM270 NPs treated cells while only 12.5% found in the free BRM270 treated cells. Further, the comparative relative expression profiling of the candidate genes were showed significant (p
