Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a well-recognized health problem, with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 25%.1 It is associated with metabolic syndrome (MetSx) and complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the main cause of death in patients with NAFLD is derived from cardiovascular disease, and outcome seems to be determined by the degree of hepatic fibrosis.2 The prevalence of NAFLD and associated cardiovascular risk factors in asymptomatic patients in Mexico are poorly documented, despite having one of the highest rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome worldwide.3.
