Treatment recommendations for primary liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), are complex and require a multidisciplinary approach. Despite surgical options that are potentially curative, options for nonsurgical candidates include systemic therapy, radiotherapy (RT), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is now in routine use for the treatment of lung cancer, and there is growing evidence supporting its use in liver tumors. SBRT has the advantage of delivering ablative radiation doses in a limited number of fractions while minimizing the risk of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) through highly conformal treatment plans. It should be considered in a multidisciplinary setting for the management of patients with unresectable, locally advanced primary liver malignancies and limited treatment options. Recently, the combination of immunotherapy with SBRT has been proposed to improve antitumor effects through engaging the immune system. This review aims at shedding light on the novel concept of the combination strategy of immune-radiotherapy in liver tumors by exploring the evidence surrounding the use of SBRT and immunotherapy for the treatment of HCC and CCA.
