microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the roles of miR-196a and miR-196b as well as mechanism in HCC progression remain poorly understood. The expressions of miR-196a, miR-196b and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) were measured in HCC tissues and cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or immunohistochemistry. HCC progression was investigated by cell proliferation, glycolysis, cycle, clones, apoptosis, and necrosis. The interaction between SOCS2 and miR-196a or miR-196b was explored by luciferase activity and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses. The expressions of proteins in Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway were measured by western blot. A xenograft model was established to investigate the roles of miR-196a or miR-196b in vivo. We found that miR-196a and miR-196b were highly expressed in HCC tissues and cells. High expression of miR-196a or miR-196b was correlated with tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis stage, lymph node metastasis, albumin-bilirubin grade and poor 5-year survival. Knockdown of miR-196a or miR-196b suppressed cell proliferation, glycolysis, cell cycle process, colony formation but induced apoptosis or necrosis in HCC cells. SOCS2 was targeted by miR-196a and miR-196b and its interference ablated abrogation of miR-196a or miR-196b-mediated inhibitory effect on HCC progression. SOCS2 was negatively associated with activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Besides, knockdown of miR-196a or miR-196b limited xenograft tumor growth by blocking the JAK/STAT pathway. We concluded that downregulation of miR-196a or miR-196b inhibited HCC progression through regulating the JAK/STAT pathway via targeting SOCS2, providing novel targets for prognosis and therapeutics of HCC.
