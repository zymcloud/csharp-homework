Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be dysregulated and play a crucial role in the progression of cancer. LncRNA DANCR has recently been revealed to be involved in tumorigenesis of numerous types of cancer, including osteosarcoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. However, the expression profiles and biological relevance of DANCR in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) have not yet been reported. In the present study, the expression level of DANCR in PTC tissues and adjacent normal tissues was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR in PTC patients, and then we analyzed the association with clinical pathological characteristics of patients and DANCR expressions. These results demonstrated that the expression of DANCR was notably decreased in tumor tissues in comparison with adjacent normal tissues (P<0.001). Furthermore, the present study found that DANCR expression level was correlated to T grade (P<0.01) and TNM stage (P=0.017). The present study demonstrated that DANCR was associated with PTC aggressive clinical features and may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for detecting PTC patients.
