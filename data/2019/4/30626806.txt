We performed split drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in a patient with huge unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple intrahepatic metastases. However, TACE was discontinued at the fourth application because the tumor was fed by the cholecystic artery. As most intrahepatic metastases disappeared following DEB-TACE, the patient was able to undergo radical hepatectomy, and has maintained a complete response. DEB-TACE enables cancer treatment without reducing the liver or renal function. However, it is associated with a risk of ischemia in other organs in patients whose arteries feed both tumors and other organs; thus appropriate selection is required.
