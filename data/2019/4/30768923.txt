Objective:To explore the clinical significance and potential molecular mechanism of endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Immunohistochemistry was used to detect EDNRB protein expression level in 67 HCC paraffin embedded tissues and adjacent tissues. Correlations between EDNRB expression level and clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed in our study. The expression level and clinical significance of EDNRB in HCC were also evaluated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics was employed to analyze the EDNRB related genes, and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network were conducted for those EDNRB related genes.Results:Lower expression level of EDNRB in HCC was verified by immunohistochemistry than adjacent tissues (P heterogeneity = 0.116, I2 = 32.4%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that HCC patients with lower EDNRB expression were more prone to poor prognosis (P = .0041). The top terms of GO annotation in biological process, cellular component and molecular function were vasculature development, actin filament and transmembrane receptor protein kinase activity, respectively. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis confirmed that EDNRB related genes mainly participated in Vascular smooth muscle contraction, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and Focal adhesion pathways. The result of PPI network construction showed that KDR, VEGFC, FLT1, CDH5 and ADCY4 were possible to become the core genes of EDNRB related genes, which need further experiments to confirm.Conclusion:Our study provides novel findings and insights on the molecular pathogenesis of HCC from EDNRB view.
