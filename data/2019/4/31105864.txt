Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and novel therapeutic approaches are urgently required. Anemoside B4 (AB4) is a compound extracted from Pulsatilla chinensis (P. chinensis). Previous studies have indicated that P. chinensis extract P. chinensis saponins has anti-cancer activity. However, the pharmacological effect of AB4 in cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer efficacy of AB4 in HCC. We used CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay to evaluate the cytotoxicity of AB4 and found that this agent markedly inhibited SMMC7721 cell proliferation. By using a panel of morphological and molecular experiments, we reported that AB4 induced HCC SMMC7721 cell apoptosis and autophagy. Notably, AB4 treatment acts on the Bcl-2-caspase-3 pathway and Beclin-1-LC3-p62 pathway, thereby regulates both apoptosis and autophagy. Finally, we showed that AB4-induced apoptosis and autophagy converges at the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. AB4 treatment inhibits this signaling transduction pathway and leads to HCC cell death. Collectively, our study highlighted the anti-cancer efficacy of AB4 and suggested that AB4 might be a novel way to treat HCC.
