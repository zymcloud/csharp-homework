Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are leading causes of cancer mortality and morbidity around the world. Despite the recent advances in their diagnosis and therapy, their prognosis remains poor owing to the development of drug resistance and metastasis. Raloxifene (RX), a drug first used in the treatment of osteoporosis, was recently approved for NSCLC and HCC prevention. Unfortunately, many of the therapies that use RX are likely to become ineffective due to drug resistance. Herein, we developed a novel delivery strategy by utilizing hyaluronic acid (HA) and chitosan (CS) complexation to increase the half-life and activity of RX. Consequently, we explored the pro-apoptotic and cytotoxic effects of RX-HA-CS nanoparticles (NPs) against NSCLC (A549) and HCC (HepG2 and Huh-7) cell lines. The highest entrapment efficiency (EE%) was noted in RX-HA-CS NPs (92%) compared to RX-HA NPs (87.5%) and RX-CS NPs (68%). In addition, RX-HA-CS NPs induced the highest cytotoxicity against A549 cells compared to other platforms. The significant suppression of A549 cell viability was achieved via glucose uptake reduction resulting in diminished bioenergetics of cancer cells and activation of apoptosis via nitric oxide level elevation. This study is the first to assess the efficacy of RX in its HA-CS nano-formulation against lung and liver cancer cells and demonstrated its selective cytotoxic and apoptotic potential against human lung A549 cancer cell line. These findings demonstrate a promising drug delivery system to help mitigate drug resistance in lung cancer.
