In 2015, liquid biopsy was rated one of the top 10 breakthrough technologies of the year by MIT Technology Review. Liquid biopsy is a type of in vitro diagnostic method involving a noninvasive blood test. It is also a breakthrough technology used to detect tumors and cancers and assist in therapeutic strategies. The most widely used markers are circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Primary carcinoma of the liver is a malignancy of hepatocytes or intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the causes of which mainly include infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol abuse, aflatoxicosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/ nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. As there are few typical clinical characteristics during the early stage of the disease, early diagnosis of HCC is very challenging. However, CTCs and ctDNA carry tumor-specific information. Therefore, the detection and analysis of CTCs and ctDNA can provide evidence for the early diagnosis of HCC and guide treatment. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that different inducers of HCC cause different DNA mutations, and accordingly, detection of specific mutations in ctDNA will facilitate the determination of the HCC type and help physicians provide distinctive therapies.
