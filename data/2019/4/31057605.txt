Transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 3 (TMED3) is a metastatic suppressor in colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its function in the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is unknown. Here, we report that TMED3 could be a new prognostic marker for ccRCC. Patient data were extracted from cohorts in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Differential expression of TMED3 was observed between the low stage (Stage I and II) and high stage (Stage III and IV) patients in the TCGA and ICGC cohorts and between the low grade (Grade I and II) and high grade (Grade III and IV) patients in the TCGA cohort. Further, we evaluated TMED3 expression as a prognostic gene using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, multivariate analysis, the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of Uno's C-index, and the AUC of the receiver operating characteristics at 5 years. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that TMED3 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis for ccRCC patients. Analysis of the C-indices and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve further supported this. Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of TMED3 expression levels (P = 0.005 and 0.006 for TCGA and ICGC, respectively). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that TMED3 is a potential prognostic factor for ccRCC.
