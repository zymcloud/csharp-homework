Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 infection is thought to be an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), current evidence is limited because only a few Western studies have evaluated the occurrence of HCC in patients with HCV genotype 3 infection. We evaluated the impact of genotype 3 and non-3 on HCC incidence and on disease progression in chronic HCV patients; this is the first study reporting such findings in an Asian population. We performed a retrospective cohort study using the data of 1448 consecutive chronic HCV patients evaluated at three centres in Korea between January 2005 and December 2016. Of these, 604, 675 and 169 had genotype 1, genotype 2 and genotype 3 HCV infections, respectively. Over a mean follow-up period of 53.2 months, 75 and 143 patients of all the patients developed HCC and experienced disease progression, respectively. The incidences of HCC were 1.10, 0.92 and 2.50 per 100 person-years, and those of disease progression were 1.95, 1.62 and 6.72 per 100 person-years for HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, genotype 3 was associated with an increased risk of HCC (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.02-8.97) and an increased risk of disease progression (HR = 4.88, 95%; CI = 2.94-8.08). Our study proposes that HCV genotype 3 is an independent risk factor for HCC and disease progression in chronic HCV patients.
