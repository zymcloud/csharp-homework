We have performed a combination therapy of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(HAIC), radiation therapy(RT), and surgical resection for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)with portal vein tumor thrombosis(PVTT)since 2013. We retrospectively analyzed 36 patients with HCC with PVTT who underwent hepatectomy between 1995 and 2016 to evaluate the clinical outcomes. Ten patients received preoperative HAIC, 7 underwent RT, and 14 received postoperative HAIC. The median survival time(MST)was 19.3 months, and the MST was significantly longer in the patients who underwent curative resection than those in patients who did not. In the non-curative resection group, postoperative HAIC prolonged the survival.
