The natural history of HCV chronic infection has drastically changed after direct-acting antiviral treatment. Due to the high sustained virological response (SVR) achieved, noninvasive estimation of liver fibrosis regression has become a major key point. The present study tries to evaluate the relation between liver histology and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) after SVR.
