Purpose:The purpose of this paper was to describe local control, overall survival, progression-free survival and toxicity of CyberKnife®-based stereotactic body radiation therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.Material and methods:Records of all the patients treated for hepatocellular carcinoma at the Eugene-Marquis cancer centre, Rennes and the Bretonneau hospital, Tours (France), between November 2010 and December 2016, were reviewed. Radiation therapy was performed as a salvage treatment, while awaiting liver transplantation or if no other treatment was possible.Results:One hundred and thirty-six patients were consecutively included in the study. The median follow-up was 13months. Median total dose prescribed, fractionation and overall treatment time were respectively 45Gy, three fractions and 5 days. Overall survival, progression-free survival and local control rates at 1year and 2years were 79.8 % and 63.5 %, 61.3 % and 39.4 %; 94.5 % and 91 %. Two grade 3 acute toxicity events and two grade 4 late toxicity events corresponding to a duodenal ulcer have been reported. Seven patients underwent classic radiation-induced hepatitis and 13 patients showed non-classical radiation-induced hepatitis. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, World Health Organisation grade and planning target volume were correlated with overall survival in univariate Cox analysis.Conclusion:Stereotactic body radiation therapy is effective and well-tolerated for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma or as a bridge to liver transplantation. Toxicity is mainly related to cirrhotic background and requires a selection of patients and strict dose constraints.
