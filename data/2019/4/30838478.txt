Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common illness that affects patients worldwide. The disease remains poorly understood though several recent advances have increased the understanding of HCC biology and treatment.Methods:A literature review was conducted to understand the role of biomarkers in HCC clinical practice and highlight areas of critical investigation.Results:Candidate biomarkers may include differential alterations in HCC genomics, epigenomics, gene expression and transcriptomic profiles, protein expression, cellular composition of the microenvironment, and vasculature. To date no circulating or tumor diagnostic markers have been established in this disease. Likewise, prognostication is currently adjudicated by clinicopathologic features and it remains unclear if the incorporation of any biomarkers may help enhance the prognostic understanding following curative intents like surgery, transplant, and select regional therapy or palliative treatment including embolization or systemic therapy. Predictive biomarkers are investigational and are under evaluation for molecular pathways like TOR, MET, VEGFA, and FGF19. Tumoral genomics, HLA allele diversity and tumoral immune activation as predictive markers for immune checkpoint inhibitors are key focuses of ongoing research.Conclusions:Diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tumor and circulating biomarkers for HCC have not been defined though several markers have been proposed to guide patient care.
Biomarkers; Diagnostic; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Predictive; Prognostic.
