Background:LincRNA-p21 is involved in the initiation and progression of many human diseases. We aimed to investigate the expression of LincRNA-p21 in different types of liver diseases.Methods:Serum from patients with primary liver diseases (chronic HBV or HCV infection, hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus-related HCC, non-HBV/HCV-related HCC, alcoholic liver disease) and HBV negative liver metastatic cancer and control healthy individuals was collected and serum lincRNA-p21 levels were determined by RT-qPCR. Clinicopathological characteristics of the patients were also recorded.Results:Serum lincRNA-p21 levels in patients with chronic HBV infection, hepatitis B cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus-related HCC, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, non-HBV/HCV-related HCC, and alcoholic liver disease were higher than those in the control individuals (P Conclusion:Serum lincRNA-p21 may serve as a potential biomarker for liver cell damage in patients with hepatitis virus infection, hepatitis B cirrhosis, HBV-related HCC and alcoholic liver disease.
