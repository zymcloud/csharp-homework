Background and aim:To examine the effect on recurrence and survival of treatment by interferon (IFN)-free direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent primary curative treatment.Methods:This was a retrospective cohort study of 250 patients with HCV who had received curative treatment for primary HCC. As anti-HCV treatment after HCC treatment, 38 patients received IFN-free DAA therapy (DAA patients) and 94 received IFN-based therapy (IFN patients). The recurrence of HCC and overall survival of the patient groups were compared in a case-control study.Results:The cumulative HCC recurrence rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 5%, 39%, and 39% for DAA patients and 0%, 46%, and 62% for IFN patients, respectively (P = 0.370). Multivariate analysis of the HCC recurrence identified treatment responses (sustained virological response [SVR]: hazard ratio [HR] 2.237; P = 0.003) as an independent predictive factor. The cumulative overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 96%, 96% for DAA patients and 93%, 73% for IFN patients, respectively ( P = 0.163). Multivariate analysis identified treatment responses (SVR: HR 8.742; P Conclusions:We found that SVR obtained after curative treatment for primary HCC suppressed recurrence and improved overall survival. And, IFN-free DAA therapy after curative treatment for primary HCC could predict improving overall survival and suppressed HCC recurrence.
