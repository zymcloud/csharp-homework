Two new phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids (1: and 2: ) and a new piperidine derivative (3: ) were isolated from the leaves of Pilea aff. martinii together with 3 known alkaloids: julandine (4: ), cryptopleurine (5: ), and 1,3,6,6-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-8-one (6: ). Their structures were determined by spectral data analyses including mass spectrometry and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance data. The absolute configurations of 1: -3: were established by comparison of their experimental circular dichroism data with the calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra. The isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against 4 cancer cell lines: KB (mouth epidermal carcinoma cells), HepG-2 (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells), LU-1 (human lung adenocarcinoma cells), and MCF-7 (human breast cancer cells). The new phenanthroquinolizidine pileamartine D (2: ) showed strong and selective proliferation inhibition toward KB and HepG-2 cells with IC50 values of 25 and 27 nM, respectively. Pileamartine C (1: ), julandine (4: ), and cryptopleurine (5: ) exhibited cytotoxicity against 4 tested cancer cell lines with IC50 values less than 1 ÂµM.
