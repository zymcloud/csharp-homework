Inflammasomes are a set of innate receptors which are the responsible molecules for activation of pro-interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-18 and induction of inflammation. Due to the key roles of the inflammasomes in the induction of inflammation, it has been hypothesized that the molecules may be the main parts of immune responses against viral infections and the tissue damage. Because some cases of viral hepatitis infections, including hepatitis B and C, are diagnosed as chronic and may be associated with various complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several studies focused on the roles played by the inflammation on the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. Based on the roles played by inflammasomes in induction of inflammation, it has been hypothesized that inflammasomes may be the main parts of the puzzle of the viral hepatitis complications. This article reviews the roles of the inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B and C viral infections and their complications, liver cirrhosis, and HCC.
