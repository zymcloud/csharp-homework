Imaging of primary hepatic neoplasms in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in patients with otherwise normal livers relies on proper multiphase image acquisition technique, with emphasis on a high-quality, late arterial phase, using either CT or MRI for accurate image interpretation. The introduction of liver imaging reporting and data system in 2011, with subsequent multiple updates, the most recent in 2018, has provided standardization of image interpretation, reporting and management recommendations for liver observations in patients at risk for HCC. This review article will emphasize key points of imaging primary liver tumors with emphasis on liver imaging reporting and data system, including strengths of this system. We will also review imaging of less common primary liver tumors such as cholangiocarcinoma and angiosarcomas. Imaging pitfall associated with primary liver malignancies will be demonstrated as well as ways to mitigate them. Finally, imaging and reporting of findings following locoregional treatment of HCC will be reviewed.
