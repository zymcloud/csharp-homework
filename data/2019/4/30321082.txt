Background:Inconsistent results were reported on the association of TLRs polymorphisms with the risk of HCV infection and HCV-related diseases.Objective:to assess the relation between TLR3 rs3775290, TLR7 rs17900 and TLR9 rs352140 SNPs and chronic HCV in the Egyptian cohort and to study their relation to interferon response.Methods:TLR3 rs3775290, TLR7 rs179008 and TLR9 rs352140 gene polymorphisms were typed by RFLP for 100 patients with chronic HCV and 25 with HCC in addition to 100 healthy controls.Results:A significant higher frequency has been found for the CT genotype of TLR3 rs3775290 in chronic HCV infection (p Conclusion:The heterozygous CT genotype of TLR3 rs3775290 may be a susceptibility risk factor for chronic HCV infection and the homozygous CC and the combined CC-AT-GA ♀ genotypes may be protective. The HCV viral load and the grades of liver fibrosis could be considered a risk factor for interferon treatment failure. It seems that the studied SNPs have no role in HCC development or failure of treatment. However, the small sample size is a limiting factor of the present study when interpreting the negative associations and that the current used cohort does not permit such conclusion.Abbreviations:cHCV=chronic Hepatitis C virus, HCC=hepatocellular carcinoma, TLR=Toll like Receptor, RFLP=Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism, SNP=Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, IFN-α= interferon alpha.
