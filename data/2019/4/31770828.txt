Background:Most of previous researches on anatomic resection (AR) in early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were conducted in high-volume centres with controversial results. This study aims to provide evidence of the utilization of AR in early HCC at population level.Methods:The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries database (2004-2015) of the USA was utilized to identify early HCC cases â‰¤5 cm. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were both analysed.Results:A total of 976 AR and 409 wedge resection (WR) cases were identified. For the post-operative (death within 1 month) and middle-term (death within 3 years) survival, effect of AR was found to be similar to that of WR after adjusting other covariates. However, for the long-term (death within 5 years) survival, the therapeutic effect of AR proved to be superior to that of WR (relative risk (RR) 0.655 for overall survival; RR 0.658 for cancer-specific survival, both P Conclusions:This study suggests that AR, when adopted at population level, is a better choice in comparison with WR in early HCC based on the evidences that it could provide equivalent post-operative, middle-term prognosis and superior long-term survival.
