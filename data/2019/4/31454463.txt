Background & aims:The eradication of Hepatitis C (HCV) infection by direct-acting antiviral (DAAs) agents has been linked to an amelioration of liver synthesis and regression of fibrosis. Although changes in number and type of circulating microvesicles (MVs) have been reported in cirrhosis, conclusive data on the effect of DAAs treatment on MVs profile in HCV cirrhotic patients remain scarce.Methods:We measured the levels of endothelial, platelet and hepatocyte MVs, as well as MVs-expressing versican core protein (VCAN+) in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), at 12, 24 and 48 weeks (W) after EOT by new generation flow cytometry.Results:Fifty-eight patients were enrolled (86% Child's A). MVs were increased at EOT vs baseline, though only platelet MVs revealed a statistically significant difference (P Conclusions:VCAN + MVs appear to mirror the profibrotic status of the cirrhotic disease; hepatocyte MVs correlate with liver stiffness and increased platelet MV levels could be associated with a worse clinical outcome.
