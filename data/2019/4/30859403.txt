The most common primary liver malignancy, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has a high likelihood of mortality, and much effort into early detection and treatment has occurred. Multiple staging systems have surfaced of which some guide treatment. Curative intent is a goal of early-staged HCC treatment, and this can be achieved with surgical resection, liver transplantation, and minimally invasive percutaneous therapies such as tumor ablation. Many of the newer ablation techniques have evolved from shortcomings of prior methods which have resulted in an expanded number of applications for tumor ablation. Our review focuses on current mainstream image-guided percutaneous ablation modalities which are commonly performed as an alternative to surgery.
