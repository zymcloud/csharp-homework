Purpose: There is still lacking of highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for the prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) early recurrence, which has hindered further improvement of the clinical outcomes. We aim to find highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for the prediction of HCC recurrence. Patients and methods: By using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based multidimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) technique, we have quantitatively investigated and monitored the proteome alterations of a series of serum after radical resection during the follow-up of 4 HCC patients. Results: A total of 27 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in serum were identified to be closely associated with the early recurrence of HCC, and these DAPs were particularly concentrated within ERK1/2 and nuclear factor-Îº beta signaling pathways, suggesting the dysregulation of these two pathways played an important role in the pathological process of HCC early recurrence. Further investigation of a cohort of patients confirmed that the high serum level of PGK1 was closely associated with HCC early recurrence and poor prognosis. In addition, the serum level of PGK1 could be complementary with AFP to further improve the sensitivity and specificity for predicting the relapse of HCC. Conclusion: PGK1 might be an independent factor for the recurrence of HCC. And the PGK1 could be complementary with AFP to further improve the sensitivity and specificity in prognostic prediction of HCC relapse.
