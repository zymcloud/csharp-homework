Background:The prognostic value of microRNA-375 (miR-375) expression in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) had been reported in the previous studies; however, the results remain inconsistent. This study was performed to investigate the prognostic significance of miR-375 expression in SCC based on all eligible evidences.Methods:Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embace, Medline, Cochrane Library, and China Biology Medicine disk. Survival outcome including overall survival (OS) and other survival outcomes were used as the primary endpoint to evaluate the prognostic outcome of patients with SCC. All statistical analyses were performed in RevMan software version 5.3 and STATA software version 14.1. Furthermore, the quality of included studies was assessed by The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Results:In total, 13 studies, including 1340 patients, met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. The pooled analysis results indicated that downregulation of miR-375 significantly predicted poor OS (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.34-1.88, P < 0.001). Downregulated miR-375 was also correlated with the other survival outcomes. Subgroup analysis based on tumor type found that lower expression of miR-375 was significantly related with poor OS in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.29-1.94, P < 0.001) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.16-2.18, P = 0.004).Conclusions:This meta-analysis demonstrated that the downexpression of miR-375 was significantly correlated with poor OS in patients with SCCs and indicated the potential clinical use of miR-375 as a molecular biomarker, particularly in assessing prognosis for patients with ESCC and HNSCC.
