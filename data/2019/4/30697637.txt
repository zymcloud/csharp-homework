Purpose:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of irreversible electroporation (IRE) in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A retrospective study was conducted from September 2014 to June 2017. A total of 21 HCCs in 21 patients with cirrhosis were treated with IRE. There were eight subcapsular or exophytic, ten perivascular and three peribiliary tumors. The median tumor size was 26 mm (range 14-40 mm). The technical success of the procedure was recorded. Median follow-up, median time to local recurrence, median local tumor progression-free survival (PFS) and complications were recorded.Results:Technical success was achieved in all the patients. The median follow-up was 10 months (range 2-30 months). The median time to local recurrence and local tumor PFS were 4 months (range 3-4 months) and 7 months (range 3-30 months), respectively. The tumor-related factor that was significantly associated with local PFS was the size. Maximum tumor diameter Conclusion:IRE is an effective treatment for ablation of small HCCs. Larger prospective studies with strict selection criteria will establish the safety and efficacy of IRE in the treatment of unresectable HCC in patients who cannot undergo thermal ablation.
