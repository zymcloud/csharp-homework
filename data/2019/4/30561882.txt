Peptide-stabilized platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) were developed that have significantly greater toxicity against hepatic cancer cells (HepG2) than against other cancer cells and non-cancerous liver cells. The peptide H-Lys-Pro-Gly-dLys-NH2 was identified by a combinatorial screening and further optimized to enable the formation of water-soluble, monodisperse PtNPs with average diameters of 2.5 nm that are stable for years. In comparison to cisplatin, the peptide-coated PtNPs are not only more toxic against hepatic cancer cells but have a significantly higher tumor cell selectivity. Cell viability and uptake studies revealed that high cellular uptake and an oxidative environment are key for the selective cytotoxicity of the peptide-coated PtNPs.
