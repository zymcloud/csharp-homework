Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the third leading cause of cancer-related death. MicroRNA-506 (miR-506) has been reported to exhibit abnormal expression in HCC; however, the role of miR-506 in HCC and the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-506 in HCC remain unclarified.Methods:Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was performed to detect the expression of miR-506 and Rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays were performed to identify the regulation between miR-506 and ROCK2. Western blot assay was performed to detect the expression of ROCK2, RhoA, and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1). The tumor growth in vivo was evaluated in a HCC xenograft mice model.Results:The mRNA levels of ROCK2 were significantly upregulated, while miR-506 levels were significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cells. The expression of ROCK2 was negatively correlated with miR-506 in HCC tissues. In vitro, upregulation of miR-506 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis, and downregulation of miR-506 promoted proliferation and blocked apoptosis in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. ROCK2 was a target gene of miR-506 and miR-506 regulated the expression of ROCK2 in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-506 partially attenuated the tumor-suppressive effect of ROCK2 knockout on HepG2 and Hep3B cells, and upregulation of miR-506 partially attenuated the oncogenic effect of ROCK2 overexpression on HepG2 and Hep3B cells; Overexpression of ROCK2 increased and ROCK2 knockdown decreased the expression of Rac1, which were attenuated by upregulation of miR-506 or downregulation of miR-506, respectively. In addition, ROCK2 overexpression or knockdown hadno significant effect on RhoA expression. In vivo, upregulation of miR-506 suppressed tumor growth, while downregulation of miR-506 promoted tumor growth.Conclusion:miR-506 was involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis by affecting RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in HCC cells. Our results provide a novel mechanism of miR-506-mediated suppressive effects on HCC tumorigenesis.
