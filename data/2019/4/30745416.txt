Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common chronic hepatic disease, with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as a major and severe subcategory that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and thereby to a high mortality rate. Currently, there has been no approved drug to treat NAFLD or NASH. The current study has presented RLA8, a novel and balanced quadruple agonist for hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation-related peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)-α/γ/δ and G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40), as a NASH drug candidate. The efficacy of RLA8 to treat NASH was evaluated in vivo using two mouse models induced by methionine/choline-deficient diet or by high-fat diet, respectively. RLA8 was shown to improve serum alanine aminotransferase and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, reduce hepatic free fatty acid and triglyceride levels, and alleviate insulin resistance. Cytokine and lipoperoxide analysis revealed that RLA8 could reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Histochemical and morphologic examination of mouse livers showed that RLA8 could improve pathologic changes such as steatosis, ballooning, collagen fiber, and inflammation. Polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses proved that RLA8 could result in PPARs and GPR40 activation, accompanied by upregulation of the 5'AMP-activated protein kinase-acetyl-CoA carboxylase pathway and inhibition of the expression of lipogenic genes and proteins, which provided more insights into its action mechanisms. In summary, RLA8 has significantly better efficacy to improve NASH-induced liver damage such as steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, and, consequently, it represents a new and highly promising NASH drug candidate that is worthy of further investigation and development.
