The present study aimed to systematically analyze the value of microRNA-122 (miRNA-122) in the diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other types of cancer. First, the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect the expression levels of miRNA-122 in the serum samples of patients with HCC, benign lesions and healthy volunteers. Next, miRNA-seq data of miRNA-122 from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were used to analyze the differential expression and overall survival rate associated with a variety of types of cancer. Meanwhile, the target gene prediction of miRNA-122 was performed using four different software programs. Finally, 353 significant target genes were identified for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis. Finally, it was demonstrated that the expression levels of miRNA-122 in the HCC group were increased compared with the healthy group (P
