Background:Suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication with nucelos(t)ide analogues should be considered for patients with chronic hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection and ongoing HBV replication.Aim:To verify the clinical outcome after long-term entecavir or tenofovir treatment in patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, ineligible to peg-interferon therapy.Methods:Patients were prospectively followed-up at 3-6 month intervals; measured outcomes were decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplant and liver related death. HBV monoinfected patients receiving the same treatment served as reference after 1:1 matching by age, gender, platelet count, albumin level, bilirubin and INR.Results:56 HDV patients (48 with cirrhosis; median follow-up 50 months) were enrolled; all achieved HBV DNA suppression. Death or liver transplant occurred in 19 patients, with a rate (n/1000 patient-months) of 2.92 in HDV patients vs 0.38 in HBV monoinfected patients (P Conclusion:Patients with HDV infection and advanced liver disease maintain an increased risk of severe clinical events as compared with HBV monoinfected patients, during prolonged HBV DNA suppression with potent NA.
