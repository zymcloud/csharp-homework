Background:Patients who receive a liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often receive poorer-quality livers. Tumor recurrence also has a negative effect on posttransplant outcomes. We compared mortality of HCC and non-HCC recipients in different posttransplant time periods (epochs) to separate the impact of these different risk factors on short-term and longer-term posttransplant survival.Methods:We identified a population-based cohort of first-time liver transplant recipients (aged â‰¥16 years) between 2008 and 2016 in the United Kingdom. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) comparing posttransplant mortality between HCC and non-HCC patients in 3 posttransplant epochs: 0 to 90 days, 90 days to 2 years, and 2 to 5 years, with adjustment first for recipient and later also for donor characteristics.Results:One thousand two hundred seventy HCC and 3657 non-HCC transplant recipients were included. Five-year posttransplant survival was 74.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71.2%-77.5%) in HCC patients and 84.6% (83.0%-86.1%) in non-HCC patients. With adjustment for recipient characteristics only, mortality of HCC patients was lower but not statistically significantly different in the first 90 days (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.53-1.09; P = 0.11), but significantly higher thereafter (90 days to 2 years: HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.48-2.66; P Conclusions:HCC recipients have poorer 5-year posttransplant survival than non-HCC recipients, most likely because of tumor recurrence. The more frequent use of poorer-quality donor organs for HCC does not explain this difference.
