Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC)is a primary liver cancer with its incidence only after hepatocellular carcinoma.Liver resection is currently the only established effective treatment for patients with ICC.However,the resectability of ICC is low and the long-term survival after surgery is far from satisfactory. With the advances in the understanding of the biological characteristics and prognostic characteristics of ICC, surgical strategy and techniques have improved in recent years, and the long-term survival has also been increased. The accurate clinical diagnosis of ICC, R0 resection, routine lymphadenectomy, effective adjuvant therapy after R0 resection, and multidisciplinary treatment including re-hepatectomy for recurrent ICC are important for achieving an optimal outcome.Down-staging management for patients with unresectable ICC may provide a chance of R0 resection in some patients. Further research on the biological heterogeneity of ICC,and the improvement of surgical treatment or the establishment of new treatment methods are the main research directions in the future.
