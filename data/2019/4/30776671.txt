Background:Clinical histological grading of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) differentiation is of great significance in clinical diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses. However, it is challenging for radiologists to evaluate HCC gradings from medical images.Purpose:In this study, a novel deep neural network was developed by combining the squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) in a three-dimensional (3D) densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet), which is referred to as a 3D SE-DenseNet, for the classification of HCC grading using enhanced clinical magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained from two different clinical centers.Method:In the proposed architecture, the SENet was added as an additional layer between the dense blocks of the 3D DenseNet, to mitigate the impact of feature redundancy. For the HCC grading task, the 3D SE-DenseNet was trained after data augmentation, and it outperformed the 3D DenseNet based on the clinical dataset.Results:The quantitative evaluations of the 3D SE-DenseNet on a two-class HCC grading task were conducted based on the dataset, which included 213 samples of the dynamic enhanced MR images. The proposed 3D SE-DenseNet demonstrated an accuracy of 83%, when compared with the 72% accuracy of the 3D DenseNet.Conclusion:Owing to the advantage of useful automatic feature learning by the SE layer, the 3D SE-DenseNet can simultaneously handle useful feature enhancement and superfluous feature suppression. The quantitative experiments confirm the excellent performance of the 3D SE-DenseNet in the evaluation of the HCC grading.
