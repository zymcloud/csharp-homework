Objective:To evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgery for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Background:HCC recurs with high incidence after liver resection. Little is known about long-term outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for recurrent HCC.Methods:Among 989 patients who underwent R0/R1 liver resection for HCC between 1995 and 2014, 676 patients who exhibited recurrence were included. Repeat surgery was performed in 128 patients (RS group), and not in the remaining 548 patients (NS group). Prognostic value after repeat surgery was evaluated by comparing survival after recurrence (SAR) between the RS and NS groups. Subgroup analyses according to the 3 recurrence patterns [intrahepatic recurrence (IHR), extrahepatic recurrence (EHR), and intra plus extrahepatic recurrence (IHR + EHR)] were performed.Results:Seventy-three of 430 patients (17.0%) with IHR, 17 of 57 patients (29.8%) with EHR, and 38 of 189 patients (20.1%) with IH + EHR underwent repeat surgery. Compared with the NS group, the RS group had better liver function and their time to recurrence was significantly longer (16.5 vs 11.4 months; P Conclusion:Surgery for recurrent HCC may yield long-term survival for not only IHR but also for EHR in selected patients.
