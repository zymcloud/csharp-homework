Background:Skin lesions are very common among organ transplant recipients (OTR), particularly infections and tumors, because of the immunosuppressive state these patients are put in.Methods:177 OTR were examined. Skin lesions were categorized into neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory diseases.Results:The mean age of OTR was 52 years, the mean age at transplantation was 42.7 years, and kidney was the most common organ transplanted (72%). Skin lesions were found in 147 patients (83%). Cutaneous infections were seen in 106 patients (60%). Warts (30%) had the larger incidence and were associated with azathioprine (P = 0.026), cyclosporine (P = 0.006), and tacrolimus (P = 0.009). Superficial mycoses occurred in 16% of OTR, mostly onychomycosis, which was associated with tacrolimus (P = 0.040). Actinic keratosis (AK) occurred in 31% of patients and cutaneous tumors in 56%. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the most common tumor type affecting 36% of OTR (n = 64), with invasive SCC predominating over in situ SCC, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) accounted for 17%. Both SCC and BCC were more numerous in patients' skin type I (P < 0.05). SCC was more frequent (36%) in combined kidney and liver recipients (P = 0.004), and BCC was associated with cyclosporine (P = 0.047). Inflammatory complications (acne, alopecia, hypertrichosis, and gingival overgrowth) were observed in 17.5% of patients.Conclusions:Organ transplant recipients must be regularly evaluated by dermatologists, who should be alert to the onset of infections and skin (pre)malignant diseases in these patients.
