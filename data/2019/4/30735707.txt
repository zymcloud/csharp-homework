Phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of Digitalis grandiflora Miller (Plantaginaceae) led to the isolation of an undescribed cardenolide type glycoside digigrandifloroside (1) along with five known compounds, rengyoside A (2), rengyoside B (3), cleroindicin A (4), salidroside (5), and cornoside (6), from its aqueous fraction of methanolic extract. Structures of the isolated compounds were determined by means of spectroscopic techniques. 1-6 were isolated for the first time from D. grandiflora. 2 and 3 are being reported for the first time from Digitalis genus and Plantaginaceae family with this study. This is the second report for occurrence of 4 from a Digitalis species. Cytotoxic activity of the aqueous fraction was also tested against HEp-2 (Human larynx epidermoid carcinoma) and HepG2 (Human hepatocellular carcinoma) cancer cell lines and L929 (Mouse fibroblast cell) non-cancerous cell line. Aqueous fraction showed stronger cytotoxicity on HEp-2 cells than HepG2. Therefore, the cytotoxic activity of 1, 2, 4, and 6 were tested against HEp-2 and L929 cell lines. 3 and 5 couldn't be tested due to their insufficient amount. 1 showed the highest cytotoxicity against HEp-2 cells with IC50 value 10.1 μM when compared with the positive control, etoposide and 2-6 (IC50 of etoposide; 39.5 μM).
