Background:Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitute the majority of primary liver cancers. This retrospective review aimed to determine whether site of care is a significant predictor of patient outcome after hepatectomy as measured by overall survival, hazard ratios (HRs), and resection margin status.Methods:Data regarding patients with a new diagnosis of ICC and HCC who underwent hepatectomy were analyzed from the national cancer database. The patients were divided into two cohorts: those receiving treatment at academic cancer centers (ACCs) and those receiving treatment at community cancer centers (CCCs). The study adjusted for confounding variables and selection bias using propensity score matching. Median overall survival (months), hazard ratios, and resection margin status (R0, R1/R2, unknown) were examined.Results:The inclusion criteria were met by 10,463 patients. After propensity matching, 5600 patients remained, with half receiving treatment at ACCs and half at CCCs. Median overall survival from the date of diagnosis for patients undergoing hepatectomy was longer at ACCs than at CCCs (28.3 vs 24.8 months; p Conclusion:Hepatectomy for ICC and HCC performed at ACCs was associated with improved outcomes compared with CCCs. Centralization of care to ACCs may lead to improved patient outcomes.
