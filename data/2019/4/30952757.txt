Background/aim:The aim of this study was to compare the ability of different lymph nodal staging systems to predict cancer recurrence in a multicenter European series of patients who underwent proctectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer.Patients and methods:Data on 170 consecutive patients undergoing proctectomy after neoadjuvant therapy for cT3-4 or cN+ rectal adenocarcinoma were retrieved from the European MRI and Rectal Cancer Surgery database. The prognostic role of the number of retrieved and examined nodes, nodal ratio, and log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) was analyzed and compared by receiver operating characteristic curves, Pearson test, and univariate and multivariate analysis.Results:At multivariate analysis, ypN, nodal ratio, and LODDS were all significantly associated with disease-free survival, but LODDS showed the strongest association (hazard ratio(HR)=2.39; 95% confidence interval(CI)=1.05-5.48; p=0.039).Conclusion:LODDS appears to be a useful prognostic indicator in the prediction of disease-free survival of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and proctectomy for locally advanced rectal cancer.
