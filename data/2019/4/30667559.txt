The management of severe aplastic anaemia is particularly challenging when it occurs in the context of recent liver transplantation. Rapid identification of a suitable donor followed by allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative option. This scenario is often complicated by potentially life-threatening infections that develop as a consequence of immunosuppression. Alternative donor transplantation using suitably matched unrelated donors can be potentially life-saving when suitably matched sibling donors are unavailable. Above all, a dedicated interdisciplinary approach with seamless communication between hepatology, transplant surgery, haematology, and stem cell transplant services is essential to achieving optimal outcomes. Herein, we describe a case of severe hepatitis leading to hepatic failure who was treated with liver transplantation from a deceased donor, and later received an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched unrelated donor for hepatitis-associated aplastic anaemia.
