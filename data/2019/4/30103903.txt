Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) has recently been reported to be an independent prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study compared the outcomes of adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (A-TACE) after hepatic resection (HR) in patients with HCC involving MVI.Methods:This prospective study involved 200 consecutive patients with MVI-HCC who underwent HR alone (n = 109) or HR with A-TACE (n = 91).The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:The two groups showed similar DFS at 1, 2, and 3 years (P = 0.077). The A-TACE group showed significantly higher OS than the HR-only group (P = 0.030). Subgroup analysis showed that A-TACE was associated with significantly higher DFS and OS among patients with a tumor diameter >5 cm or with multinodular tumors.Conclusions:A-TACE may improve postoperative outcomes for MVI-HCC patients, especially those with tumor diameter >5 cm or multinodular tumors.
