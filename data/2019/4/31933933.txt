Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play essential roles in HCC progression and radiosensitivity. However, the effect of miR-106a on HCC progression and radiosensitivity as well as its mechanism remain largely unknown. The expressions of miR-106a and F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot, respectively. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed by trans-well assay. The radiosensitivity was investigated by colony formation and western blot. The interaction between miR-106a and FBXW7 was explored by luciferase activity and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) analyses. Then miR-106a expression was elevated in HCC tissues and cells and associated with tumor stage as well as overall survival. Knockdown of miR-106a impeded cell migration and invasion but contributed to irradiation-induced inhibition of survival and increase of phosphorylation of histone in Serine 139 (Î³-H2AX) protein in HCC cells. Moreover, FBXW7 was indicated as a target of miR-106a and negatively correlated with miR-106a. Besides, interference of FBXW7 reversed the regulatory effect of miR-106a abrogation on migration, invasion and radiosensitivity in HCC cells. The results showed down-regulation of miR-106a suppressed migration and invasion and increased radiosensitivity of HCC cells by targeting FBXW7, providing a novel avenue for HCC treatment.
