Aim:We previously reported that sorafenib induces Th1 [interferon-γ (IFNγ)-positive interleukin 4 (IL4)-negative] dominance which prevents tumor cells from escaping the host immune system in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). However, in that study we did not assess the influence of sorafenib on host immunity according to the etiology of LC. Therefore, this study was retrospectively performed to evaluate the impact of sorafenib therapy for aHCC on host immunity in patients stratified according to the etiology of LC: Patients and Methods: A total of 116 adult Japanese patients with LC and aHCC received sorafenib therapy at our hospital. Blood samples were collected before and after treatment for 4 weeks.Results:Twenty-two patients had hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related LC, 62 patients had hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related LC, 22 patients had alcoholic LC, and 10 patients had LC without these causative factors. In patients receiving sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg/day, patients in Child-Pugh class A, and patients with stage IVA aHCC, Th2 (IFNγ-negative/IL4-positive) cells decreased significantly after treatment, although there was no significant impact on the tumor response. In addition, Th2 cells decreased significantly in patients with HCV-related LC after treatment, while there were no significant changes in the other groups.Conclusion:Sorafenib might prevent tumor cells from escaping the host immune system in patients with aHCC and HCV-related LC, although it does not seem to do so in those with LC of other etiologies.
