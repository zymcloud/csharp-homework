Background:In spite of convincing results from internationally prominent liver centres, laparoscopic liver surgery is not widely used in Germany. A structured program to develop laparoscopic liver surgery was established in 2015 at the Department of Surgery, Charité Hospital, Berlin, in order to provide support for establishing this approach in German hospitals.Methods:We now report the results of our centre for 250 consecutive laparoscopic liver resections between 12/2013 and 1/2018. A retrospective analysis was performed with respect to indications, patient characteristics, complexity of the operations and postoperative results. The development of the program was analysed by comparing period 1 (1/2014 - 12/2015) and period 2 (1/2016 - 12/2017).Results:In comparison with period 1 (n = 16, 25% of patients), patients in period 2 (n = 75, 50% of patients) included a significantly greater percentage of patients with a high ASA score (3/4; p = 0.001). Hepatocellular carcinoma was the most frequent indication (n = 76, 30.4%), followed by colorectal liver metastases (n = 63, 25.2%). Malignant tumours increased over the years from 53.8% in period 1 to 75.7% in period 2 (p = 0.001). 72 major (≥ 3 segments) and 178 minor resections (Conclusion:Aside from appropriate expertise in conventional open liver surgery, minimally invasive surgery and intraoperative sonography, it is necessary to develop a structured program for the reliable implementation of laparoscopic liver surgery in German hospitals. Because of the convincing results, conventional open liver surgery will be largely replaced in Germany by laparoscopic techniques in the coming years.
