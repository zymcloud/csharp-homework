Purpose:To evaluate the effects of dose escalation by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in liver-directed concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C hepatocellular carcinoma (BCLC-C HCC).Materials and methods:During 2005-2016, 637 patients with BCLC-C HCC received RT with concurrent hepatic arterial 5-fluorouracil. Patients were divided into two groups according to the biologically effective doses for a tumor (α/β = 10 Gy): Results:The median follow-up for patients alive at the time of analysis was 36 months (range, 6-159 months). For ≥72 Gy and Conclusions:In liver-directed concurrent chemoradiotherapy, radiation dose escalation by IMRT increased LFFS and OS for locally advanced BCLC-C HCC. It also increased the conversion rate to curative resection, which was attributable to increased OS.
