Background:The miR-191-5p expression has been reported to increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its clinical value and exact role remain to be further clarified. Thus, a comprehensive analysis was performed in the current study to explore the underlying function of miR-191-5p in HCC.Methods:HCC-related expression data were collected to conduct a thorough analysis to determine the miR-191-5p expression and its clinical significance in HCC, including microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress database as well as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) data of 178 matched clinical samples. The underlying relationship between miR-191-5p and HCC was also explored on the basis of a series of bioinformatics analyses.Results:The overall pooled meta-analysis showed an overexpression of miR-191-5p in the HCC samples (SMD=0.400, 95% CI=0.139-0.663, P=0.003), consistent with the detected result of the clinical HCC samples through the qRT-PCR analysis. Higher miR-191-5p levels were correlated with advanced TNM stages (III and IV), higher pathological grades, and metastasis. Functionally, 64 potential target genes were acquired for further mechanism analysis. Two pathways (p75 neurotrophin receptor and liver kinase B1-mediated signaling pathways), which were likely modulated by miR-191-5p, were regarded to be linked to the deterioration of HCC. Early growth response 1 and UBE2D3 were identified as the most likely targets for miR-191-5p in HCC and were commonly implied in the top enriched pathways and protein-protein network.Conclusions:In summary, miR-191-5p may function as a tumor promoter miRNA of HCC, and the miR-191-5p inhibitor may contribute to the targeted HCC treatment in the future.
