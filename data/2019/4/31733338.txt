Hepatic inflammation is a key pathologic mediator in a wide array of acute and chronic liver diseases. Hepatitis is a crucial driver of liver tissue damage provoking the progression to severe fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, irrespective of the etiologic cause. Inflammatory liver diseases are collectively considered one of the most critical public health risks. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are superfamily of monooxygenases which possess the greater diversity of substrate structures amidst all other enzyme families. Members of omega-3 as well as omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid, respectively, can be metabolized by CYP isoforms leading to the production of biologically active lipid mediators called eicosanoids. CYP-derived eicosanoids have been shown to play significant roles in the pathophysiology and protection of multiple inflammatory liver diseases. In this review, we elucidate the intricate role of CYP-derived eicosanoids in inflammation in liver diseases paving the way for better therapeutic approaches.
