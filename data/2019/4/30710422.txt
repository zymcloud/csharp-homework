The study was aimed to screen out miRNAs with differential expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to explore the influence of the expressions of these miRNAs and their target gene on HCC cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis. MiRNAs with differential expression in HCC were screened out by microarray analysis. The common target gene of these miRNAs (miR-139-5p, miR-940 and miR-193a-5p) was screened out by analysing the target genes profile (acquired from Targetscan) of the three miRNAs. Expression levels of miRNAs and SPOCK1 were determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The target relationships were verified by dual luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA pull-down assay. Through 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide,thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and transwell assays and flow cytometry, HCC cell viability, invasion and apoptosis were determined. In vivo experiment was conducted in nude mice to investigate the influence of three miRNAs on tumour growth. Down-regulation of miR-139-5p, miR-940 and miR-193a-5p was found in HCC. Overexpression of these miRNAs suppressed HCC cell viability and invasion, promoted apoptosis and inhibited tumour growth. SPOCK1, the common target gene of miR-139-5p, miR-940 and miR-193a-5p, was overexpressed in HCC. SPOCK1 overexpression promoted proliferation and invasion, and restrained apoptosis of HCC cells. MiR-139-5p, miR-940 and miR-193a-5p inhibited HCC development through targeting SPOCK1.
