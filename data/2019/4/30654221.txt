Searching for new leads in the battle of cancer will never ends, we herein disclose the design and synthesis of new phthalazine derivatives and their in vitro and in vivo testing for their antiproliferative activity. Phthalazine was selected as a privilege moiety that is incorporated in a big number of anticancer drugs in clinical use or that are still under clinical or preclinical studies. We utilized the drug extension strategy to tailor the designed compounds to fit the EGFR hydrophobic sub pocket and cleft region. The designed phthalazine derivatives was synthesized by linking phthalazine moiety with 1,3,4-oxadiazole-thione and 1,2,4-triazole-thione. Alkylation and glycosylation of the new heterocyclic systems were successfully performed to be used in the drug extension. Coupling of some phthalazine derivatives with different amino acids was also performed to improve the drug selectivity. The synthesized compounds were tested for their antiproliferative activity against cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. The in vitro activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 cell line) ranged from 5.7 µg/mL to 43.4 µg/mL. Compounds 31a and 16 were the most active with an IC50 5.7 µg/mL and 7.09 µg/mL, respectively compared to the standard compound doxorubicin (4.0 µg/mL). In vivo, compounds 10 and 16 showed IC50 values 7.25 μg/mL and 7.5 μg/mL, respectively compared to the standard compound cisplatin (IC50 9.0 μg/mL). In silico, testing of the phthalazine derivatives showed that they are good inhibitors for EGFR. The docking studies substantiated compounds 4, 10, 16 and 31a as new lead compounds and identified Arg841 as a key residue in the cleft region for binding stronger inhibitors.
