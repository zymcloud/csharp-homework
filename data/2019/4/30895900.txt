Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are synthetic non-steroidal agents which have variable estrogen agonist and antagonist activities in different target tissues. Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen in the breast used for treatment and prevention of breast cancer, with estrogen agonist activity in the uterus. Raloxifene prevents and treats osteoporosis and prevents breast cancer, and can be safely combined with vaginal but not systemic estrogen. The tissue selective estrogen complex combines conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) with the SERM bazedoxifene (BZA). The five Selective Estrogen Menopause and Response to Therapy studies, with up to 2 years of data, demonstrated that CEE/BZA 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg improved vasomotor symptoms and vulvovaginal atrophy, prevented bone loss, and was neutral on breast tenderness, breast density, with breast cancer incidence similar to placebo. Protection against estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia and cancer was found, with similar amenorrhea rates to placebo. Ospemifene is approved to treat dyspareunia, with potential benefits on bone and the breast, while lasofoxifene is being developed to treat resistant estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in women. Estetrol is an estrogen synthesized exclusively during pregnancy by the human fetal liver and initially considered a weak estrogen, but it appears to have dual weak estrogenic/anti-estrogenic features.
