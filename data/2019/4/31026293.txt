Persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection relies on the establishment and maintenance of covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, a 3.2 kb episome that serves as a viral transcription template, in the nucleus of an infected hepatocyte. Although evidence suggests that cccDNA is the repair product of nucleocapsid associated relaxed circular (rc) DNA, the cellular DNA polymerases involving in repairing the discontinuity in both strands of rcDNA as well as the underlying mechanism remain to be fully understood. Taking a chemical genetics approach, we found that DNA polymerase alpha (Pol α) is essential for cccDNA intracellular amplification, a genome recycling pathway that maintains a stable cccDNA pool in infected hepatocytes. Specifically, inhibition of Pol α by small molecule inhibitors aphidicolin or CD437 as well as silencing of Pol α expression by siRNA led to suppression of cccDNA amplification in human hepatoma cells. CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in of a CD437-resistant mutation into Pol α genes completely abolished the effect of CD437 on cccDNA formation, indicating that CD437 directly targets Pol α to disrupt cccDNA biosynthesis. Mechanistically, Pol α is recruited to HBV rcDNA and required for the generation of minus strand covalently closed circular rcDNA, suggesting that Pol α is involved in the repair of the minus strand DNA nick in cccDNA synthesis. Our study thus reveals that the distinct host DNA polymerases are hijacked by HBV to support the biosynthesis of cccDNA from intracellular amplification pathway compared to that from de novo viral infection, which requires Pol κ and Pol λ.
