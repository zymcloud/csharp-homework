Background:Coagulation abnormalities in liver transplant patients are complex and may be related to the underlying liver disease. We evaluated the effects of disease etiology on whole-blood rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM; Pentapharm GmbH, Munich, Germany) profile and association with thrombotic complications following liver transplantation.Methods:Analysis of perioperative data from patients undergoing liver transplantation between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016. Patients were grouped based on the biology of their underlying liver disease: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), biliary etiology, and non-biliary etiology. The primary outcome was the EXTEM A10 value of the pre-incision ROTEM. Secondary outcomes included associations between EXTEM A10 value and incidence of postoperative thrombotic complications.Results:Three hundred fifty patients met the eligibility criteria: 60 had biliary etiologies, 203 had non-biliary etiologies, and 87 had HCC. EXTEM A10 values were significantly higher in patients with biliary etiologies than those with non-biliary etiologies (mean difference, 13.8; 95% CI: 10.1 to 17.5; P = .001) and those with HCC (mean difference, 10.4; 95% CI: 6.2 to 14.7; P = .001). Patients with non-biliary etiologies had slightly higher values than those with HCC (mean difference, -3.3; 95% CI: -6.6 to -0.1; P = .04). Higher values for biliary etiologies remained after adjusting for liver disease severity, platelet count, and fibrinogen level. There was no significant difference in EXTEM A10 values between patients who suffered thrombotic complications and those who did not (mean difference: 4.3, 95% CI: -1.3 to 9.9, P = .13).Conclusion:Patients with biliary diseases demonstrated higher EXTEM A10 values compared to those with non-biliary diseases or HCC. This was not fully explained by differences in disease severity, platelet count, or fibrinogen level. Pre-incision EXTEM A10 values do not predict incidence of postoperative thrombotic complications.
