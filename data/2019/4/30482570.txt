Background/purpose:This study aimed to compare the survival benefit in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients following liver transplantation or surgical resection utilizing Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database (2004-2013).Methods:Overall and cancer-specific mortality were evaluated in HCC patients who were treated by liver resection or transplantation. Patients newly-diagnosed with primary HCC were included.Results:Kaplan-Meier survival curves found that patients with liver transplantation had lower risk of overall mortality and cancer-free mortality than patients who received liver resection (P Conclusion:The findings indicated that transplantation has survival advantages compared with resection in treating patients with HCC, particularly in later stage disease.
