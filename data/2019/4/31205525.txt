Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Peptide V3 has shown anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effects on S180 and H22 xenografts in nude mice. However, the detailed mechanism of action of peptide V3 has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, the effects of peptide V3 on the growth of human HCC cells were examined both in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that peptide V3 inhibited the proliferation, viability, migration, and invasion of human HCC cells. However, no obvious effect was observed in HL-7702 cells. Peptide V3 increased the apoptosis and decreased the protein levels of H-RAS, phospho (p)-RAF, p-MEK, and p-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in human HCC cells. Peptide V3 suppressed the growth of human HCC xenografts by down-regulating angiogenesis and up-regulating apoptosis. In conclusion, peptide V3 could inhibit the growth of human HCC by inhibiting the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Novel peptides and modification strategies could be designed and applied for the treatment of different types of cancer.
