Background and aims:Direct antiviral agents (DAAs) have revolutionised the standard of care for the treatment of hepatitis even in patients with hemoglobinopathies. The aim of this study is to show how, thanks to DAAs, HCV infection has been substantially eradicated in one of the biggest Centres for the management of Thalassemia in Europe.Methods:Thalassemia major patients regularly transfused and iron chelated in Cagliari (Italy) who were HCV-RNA positive were evaluated for the potential prescription of antiviral therapy.Results:A total of 99 patients, 26 of whom had been diagnosed with cirrhosis, were treated with at least one dose of DAAs, which proved to be safe and well tolerated. Two of the patients died during the treatment after becoming HCV-RNA negative while another voluntarily interrupted the therapy. The final SVR in the patients who completed the treatment was 100%, while measuring 97% (96/99) in the Intention-to-Treat analysis. After DAAs, no new cases of hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported.Conclusions:The use of DAAs in patients suffering from beta-Thalassemia major with chronic hepatitis C or cirrhosis can be considered safe and effective. Close monitoring for hepatocellular carcinoma development is, in any case, recommended indefinitely post-SVR.
