The patient was a 73-year-old man. A liver tumor was found in the posterior segment(S6)during the follow-up period post the interferon treatment for hepatitis C in September 1999. An S6 sub-segmentectomy was performed. The tumor was diagnosed as a moderately differentiated carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)with pT2N0M0, pStage â…¡(UICC TNM 7th edition). The tumor recurred twice post-surgery. The recurrent tumors were treated with local therapies such as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE), percutaneous ethanol injection(PEI)and radiofrequency ablation(RFA). The third recurrence was found in the posterior segment(S7)in April 2009. RFA was unsuccessful because an appropriate puncture route could not be found. Then, a transdiaphragmatic RFA under thoracotomy was performed as an alternative treatment, which led to an optimal outcome. We report a case of HCC that could not be treated with percutaneous RFA but with a transdiaphragmatic RFA under thoracotomy.
