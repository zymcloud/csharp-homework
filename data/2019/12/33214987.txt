Purpose of review:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in patients with cirrhosis is associated with decreased mortality by enabling early tumor detection. However, the benefits of any cancer screening program must be considered in light of potential physical, financial, and psychological harms, as well as the risk of overdiagnosis. Herein, we summarize the potential harms of HCC surveillance.Recent findings:To date, two retrospective studies have addressed physical harms of HCC surveillance. Based on these data, 15% to 28% of patients undergoing HCC surveillance experience physical harm including additional cross-sectional imaging or liver biopsy. Although psychological and financial harms have been reported for other cancers, there are currently limited data specific to HCC. An ongoing multi-center prospective study assessing all four types of harms should provide data in near future.Summary:HCC screening may prevent death by diagnosing tumors at an early stage, but limited sensitivity and specificity of screening tests can result in unintended harms. There is a need for further quality data evaluating both the benefits and harms of HCC surveillance.
