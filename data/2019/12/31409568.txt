Purpose:To determine whether burn time per tumor volume (BPV) (min/mL), where burn time is the total time during which radiofrequency (RF) energy is being applied, is correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment outcomes using RF ablation and lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin (LTLD).Materials and methods:The HEAT study was a double-blind, randomized controlled phase III trial of RF ablation only versus RF ablation + LTLD in patients with HCCs 3-7 cm in diameter. Effect of BPV on progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) was analyzed.Results:BPV demonstrated statistically significant differences between study groups for OS (P = .038, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.85), but not for progression-free survival (P = .389, HR = 1.059). In a separate analysis, treatment groups were independently analyzed to determine the effect of BPV within each individual group. OS improved as BPV increased for patients receiving RF ablation + LTLD (P = .017, HR = 0.836, confidence interval [0.722, 0.968]). This same association was not observed in patients receiving RF ablation only (P = .57, HR = 0.99).Conclusions:BPV may be a useful metric for RF ablation + LTLD combination therapy for solitary HCC. The analysis suggested that the burn time for the tumor needs to be adjusted depending on the tumor volume. Because this is a post hoc study, the results are only suggestive and need to be confirmed with prospective studies.
