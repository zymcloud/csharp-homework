p62/IMP2 is an oncofetal protein that was first reported as a tumor-associated antigen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our previous studies, we demonstrated a high frequency of p62/IMP2 autoantibodies appearing in various types of cancer. Therefore, we hypothesize that p62/IMP2 plays an important role in the progression of HCC, although the mechanism remains to be explored. In this study, we evaluated the expression of p62/IMP2 protein both in human tissues and liver cancer cell lines by immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis and found that p62/IMP2 protein is overexpressed in human HCC tissue in comparison to normal human liver tissue. To explore the role that p62/IMP2 plays in HCC, p62/IMP2 was knocked out in two p62/IMP2-positive liver cancer cell lines (SNU449 and HepG2). Due to the low expression level of p62/IMP2 in SNU449, we overexpressed p62/IMP2 in this cell line. We subsequently demonstrated that high expression of p62/IMP2 in both cell lines can promote cell migration and invasion abilities in vitro by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We also used the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor, XAV 939, and a phosphoproteome assay to confirm our findings. Conclusion: Our results suggest that p62/IMP2 is an essential regulator of Wnt signaling pathways and plays an important role in HCC progression and metastasis.
