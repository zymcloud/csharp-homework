Purpose:The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using the FOLFOX regimen combined with transarterial embolization (TAE + HAIC) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Unresectable HCC patients treated with TAE + HAIC and conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), respectively, between January 2015 and October 2016 in China were retrospectively assessed. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary outcomes included the objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), and main complications. Propensity score matching (PSM) was estimated by multiple logistic regression using caliper matching (caliper 0.2). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify those factors shown to be associated with PFS.Results:A total of 113 patients were analyzed, with 41 and 72 receiving TAE + HAIC and TACE, respectively. After PSM, 35 pairs of patients were assessed. The median PFS was 7.93 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.44-11.42) for the TAE + HAIC group, which was higher compared with 2.60 months (95% CI, 0.93-4.27, P = 0.003) for TACE. The subgroup with Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage C obtained more PFS benefit from TAE + HAIC (P = 0.002). ORRs in the TAE + HAIC and TACE groups were 37.14% (13/35) and 20.00% (7/35, P = 0.112), respectively; DCRs were 88.57% (31/35) and 60.00% (21/35, P = 0.006), respectively. Abundant blood supply (hazard ratio [HR] =0.327, 95% CI 0.173-0.615, P < 0.001) and TAE + HAIC (HR = 0.332, 95% CI 0.177-0.621, P < 0.001) were associated with longer PFS in multivariate analysis.Conclusions:Compared with conventional TACE, TAE + HAIC provides more PFS benefits to patients with unresectable HCC, especially in those with BCLC stage C.
