Background:Tumor escape mechanisms mediated in the tumor microenvironment can significantly reduce the capacity of the anti-tumor function of the immune system. TIE2-expressing monocytes (TEMs), related angiopoietins, and tumor necrosis are considered to have a key role in this process. We aimed to investigate the abundance and clinical significance of these biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:In this retrospective study, 58 HCC patients received surgery with a curative intent. The abundance of TEMs, angiopoietin-1 and -2 were detected in tumor specimens of the HCC patients (n = 58), and together with the occurrence of histologic tumor necrosis, were associated with established clinicopathological characteristics and survival.Results:Patients with HCC characterized by necrosis and TEMs revealed reduced both overall survival and recurrence-free survival (all p Conclusions:Histologic tumor necrosis, TEMs, and related angiopoietins were associated with multiple HCC parameters and patient survival. The tumor necrosis-TEM-angiopoietin axis may offer a novel diagnostic modality to predict patient outcome after surgery for HCC.
