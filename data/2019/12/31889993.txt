Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of the serum γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT)-to-prealbumin ratio (GPR) and whether combining this ratio with other parameters can lead to an improved prognostic value for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with local ablation therapy.Methods:A total of 235 HCC patients who were treated with combined therapies were retrospectively analyzed. The demographic data and clinicopathological data were collected. A fibrinogen (Fib)-GPR score of 2 was assigned to patients with elevated Fib and GPR values, and a score of 1 or 0 was assigned to patients with one or neither of these two markers, respectively. In addition, an N-score of 2 was assigned to patients with low neutrophil and high GPR values, and a score of 1 or 0 was assigned to patients with one or neither of these two markers, respectively. The optimal cutoff values and prognostic roles of GPR and other markers were identified according to the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Youden's index.Results:Multiple tumors, high levels of α-fetoprotein (AFP) and Fib, as well as a high GPR, were found to be independent risk factors in recurrent patients, while multiple tumors, a low neutrophil count, and a high GPR were associated with reduced overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC who received combined therapies. Patients with a Fib-GPR score of 2 and N-GPR score of 2 had poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) and OS, respectively.Conclusions:Fib-GPR and N-GPR scores may be helpful in predicting both recurrence and the prognosis of HCC patients, thereby assisting in the process to make a true clinical decision and optimize therapeutic options.
