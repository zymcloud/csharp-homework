Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. It begins with the accumulation of fat in the liver (simple steatosis), which if untreated can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chrysin is a flavonoid present in bee propolis and many other plants. The objective of this study was to determine if chrysin can ameliorate NAFLD induced by feeding a high fructose diet (HFD) in rats. The rats were divided into five groups: normal control, HFD control, chrysin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg p.o. body weight). Biochemical estimations were carried out in the serum and liver of rats. The gene expressions of SREBP-1c and PPAR α were determined in the liver. The histopathology of the liver was also studied. Chrysin caused a significant decrease in the serum fasting glucose and improved the insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and liver enzymes. It caused a significant decrease in the liver weight and hepatic free fatty acids, triglyceride, and cholesterol content. Chrysin exerted antioxidant effects, reduced carbonyl content, advanced glycation end products, collagen, TNF-α, and IL-6 concentrations in the liver. Chrysin significantly reduced the hepatic gene expression of SREBP-1c and increased that of PPAR-α. The histopathology of liver of rats treated with chrysin showed significant decrease in the steatosis, ballooning, and lobular inflammation when compared to the HFD control group. Thus, chrysin demonstrated anti-steatotic, antiglycating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects and seems to be a promising molecule for the management of NAFLD.
