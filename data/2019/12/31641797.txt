Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are important stromal cells and pivotal mediators involved in the pathogenesis and immunosuppression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The liver has been demonstrated to be a site for accumulation of tumor-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We previously reported that HSCs induced an increase in the number of MDSCs in HCC. However, how MDSCs are recruited in HCC remains largely unclear. In the present study, we found that HSC-conditioned medium (HSC-CM) induced bone marrow-derived cell and splenocyte migration, especially MDSC migration. Using chemokine-neutralizing antibodies and chemokine receptor inhibitors, we found that HSCs promoted MDSC migration through the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. Subsequently, we used an orthotopic mouse liver tumor model to determine how HSCs mediated MDSC migration to HCC in vivo. The in vivo results indicated that pretreatment of MDSCs with a CXCR4 inhibitor or injection with SDF-1-knocked down HSCs inhibited MDSC migration to the spleen and liver of the tumor-bearing mice. Together, our findings indicate a central role for HSCs in MDSC migration mediated by the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, thus revealing a potentially effective approach for modulating the tumor microenvironment by targeting HSCs in HCC.
