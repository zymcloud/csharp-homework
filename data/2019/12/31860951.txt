Rationale:Despite vast improvements in technique, several complications still challenge surgeons and medical practitioners alike, including biliary and vascular complications, acute and chronic rejection, and disease recurrence.Patient concerns:A 59-year-old man was admitted to hospital on July, 2016. He had hepatitis B cirrhosis related recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma and underwent living donor liver transplantation in our hospital.Diagnosis:At the time of admission, the patient's spirit, diet, sleep, normal urine and stool, and weight did not change significantly. The test indicators are as follows: total bilirubin: 100.1 μmol/L, direct bilirubin: 65.0 μmol/L. Emergency CT in the hospital after admission showed that hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm formation after liver transplantation was observed.Interventions:This patient underwent minimal invasive endovascular treatment. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and reviewed. He was treated successfully by endovascular stent grafting and thrombolytic treatment.Outcomes:The blood concentration of tacrolimus (FK506) was 6.3 ng/mL total bilirubin 19.6 μmol/L before discharge. The changing of total bilirubin and direct bilirubin were investigated (Fig. 1). The patient recovered well and was discharged 2 weeks later. The patient is doing well and regularly followed up.Lessons:Coil embolization of aneurysmal sac or placement of a stent graft is a minimally invasive alternative to surgery and definitively excludes a bleeding hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. This technique can be considered as an effective treatment option for hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm instead of a difficult surgical repair.
