Desensitization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to paclitaxel chemotherapy is a major deterrent to successful treatment of the cancer. Abnormal activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR, pathway is a common outcome of chemotherapy for HCC. Therefore, we investigated whether BEZ235, a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor, could increase the sensitivity of HCC to paclitaxel. In vitro results showed that paclitaxel, combined with BEZ235, inhibited HCC cell proliferation and migration, arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, and promoted cell apoptosis by decreasing PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity. In vivo experiments confirmed that BEZ235 enhances the anti-tumor effect of paclitaxel by reducing PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity. Immunohistochemical staining showed that paclitaxel combined with BEZ235 reduced the numbers of Ki-67- and GPC3-positive HepG2 cells in tumor tissues. We conclude that BEZ235 enhanced the sensitivity of HCC to paclitaxel, and inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling might be a therapeutic strategy against paclitaxel-resistant HCC.
