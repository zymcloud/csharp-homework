Introduction:Central hepatectomy (CH) is technically challenging and seldom-used to treat centrally located tumors. However, CH is a parenchyma-sparing resection that may decrease the risk of postoperative liver failure. This retrospective study presents our technique of CH and assesses the outcomes.Methods:All CH performed in our department over two decades (1997-2017) were identified. Indications and short-term outcomes were compared between the two decades. Long-term outcomes were assessed.Results:Sixty-four patients underwent CH using a suprahilar approach for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC: n = 30), metastasis (n = 23), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCCA: n = 9) or other diseases (n = 2). CH represented 6% of 1004 major hepatectomies, (7.4% (n = 35) before 2007 vs 5.4% (n = 29) after 2007). The mean operating time was 219 Â± 56 min. A perioperative blood transfusion was required in 14 patients (22%). Intraoperative bile duct injuries occurred in 5 patients (8%), and they were repaired. One patient died postoperatively (1,5%). Ten patients (16%) experienced a major complication. Nine patients (14%) suffered from bile leakage, of which 6 healed spontaneously. Only one patient had low grade liver failure. The R0-resection rate was 69%. After 2007, there were no bile duct injuries (0/29 vs 5/35, p
