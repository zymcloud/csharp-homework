Background:Few studies have been performed to evaluate the value of the Glissonian approach (GA) for laparoscopic formal hemihepatectomy. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of extrahepatic GA with those of the conventional hilar dissection approach for laparoscopic formal right and left hepatectomies in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between January 2015 and October 2017, a total of 95 HCC patients who underwent pure laparoscopic formal hemihepatectomies, of whom 49 underwent the GA, were included in this study. After a 1:1 propensity score matching, 42 laparoscopic GA hepatectomies were compared to 42 conventional approach (CA) hepatectomies. We have analyzed perioperative and oncologic outcomes of the two different operative approaches for HCC treatments.Results:The GA did not increase the postoperative overall complication rates (P = 0.415) or the mean comprehensive complication index (P = 0.414) when compared with the CA. However, the operative time was significantly shorter (P = 0.006), and intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower (P Conclusions:Pure laparoscopic extrahepatic GA hemihepatectomy is safe and feasible, and it was associated with similar complication rates and equivalent 3-year survival outcomes compared to the conventional approach in selected patients with HCC.
