Objective:To assess the effect of the intraoperative application of the Aquamantys® system to treat the hepatic resection margin on local and overall recurrence of HCC.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 101 patients admitted from November 2016 to June 2018 who underwent hepatectomy using the Aquamantys® as hemostatic device, who were matched with 101 patients (control group) using conventional hemostatic devices through PSM. Univariate and multivariate analyses of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model.Results:There were no significant differences in baseline data and surgical procedures between the two groups. The Aquamantys® group showed less blood loss (P = 0.005) and a lower blood transfusion rate (P = 0.036), while the incidences of postoperative complications of the two groups showed no difference (P = 0.266). OS rates of the Aquamantys® group and the control group were 82.6% and 84.2%, respectively (P = 0. 446), and RFS rates were 65.5% and 58.2%, respectively (P = 0.153), with no significant differences. The Aquamantys® group and the control group had two cases and 11 cases of local recurrence, respectively, with LRFS rates of 98% and 87.9%, respectively, in the follow-up period, corresponding to a significant difference (P = 0.011). Multivariate analysis showed that microvascular invasion (MVI), tumor diameter > 5 cm, and the control group were independent risk factors for LRFS.Conclusion:Our results indicate that application of the Aquamantys® system in hepatectomy can reduce local recurrence, but it can neither reduce overall recurrence nor improve OS.
