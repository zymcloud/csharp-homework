Recent data indicate that peripheral, as well as hypothalamic pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the development of cancer cachexia. However, there are only a few studies simultaneously investigating the expression of inflammatory molecules in both the periphery and hypothalamic structures in animal models of cancer cachexia. Therefore, using the Yoshida ascites hepatoma rat's model of cancer cachexia we investigated the gene expression of inflammatory markers in the spleen along with the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei, two hypothalamic structures that are involved in regulating energy balance. In addition, we investigated the effect of intracerebroventricular administration of PS-1145 dihydrochloride (an Ikβ inhibitor) on the expression of selected inflammatory molecules in these hypothalamic nuclei and spleen. We observed significantly reduced food intake in tumor-bearing rats. Moreover, we found significantly decreased expression of IL-6 in the spleen as well as decreased NF-κB in the paraventricular nucleus of rats with Yoshida ascites hepatoma. Similarly, expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, NF-κB, and COX-2 in the arcuate nucleus was significantly reduced in tumor-bearing rats. Administration of PS-1145 dihydrochloride reduced only the gene expression of COX-2 in the hypothalamus. Based on our findings, we suggest that the growing Yoshida ascites hepatoma decreased food intake by mechanical compression of the gut and therefore this model is not suitable for investigation of the inflammation-related mechanisms of cancer cachexia development.
