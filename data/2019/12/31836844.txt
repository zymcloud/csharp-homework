Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. There are many factors in the etiology of HCC such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol, obesity, smoking and aflatoxin. Many types of cancer are assumed to be associated with ABO blood group and Rhesus factor (RH). In this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between tumor characteristics and overall survival (OS), ABO blood group and RH factor in patients with HCC. A total of 507 patients with chronic liver disease (252 patients with HCC and 255 patients without HCC) were included in the study. All demographic, clinic and laboratory (biochemical parameters and blood type) features were collected retrospectively. The mean age of the patients was 54.50 Â± 9.30. There was no significant difference in both ABO groups and RH factors between the two groups. We found that vascular invasion rate of the tumor was higher in the B blood group and multicentric localization of tumor was significantly higer in patients with positive RH but there was no difference between OS in ABO and RH blood groups. In addition, the tumor was less multicentric in the AB blood group. Blood groups and RH factor can be used to predict the prognosis in cirrhotic patients with HCC.
