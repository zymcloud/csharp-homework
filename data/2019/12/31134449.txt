A 68-year-old male was referred with dysphagia. Endoscopic findings showed circular stenosis with a protruding mass in the lower esophagus. Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma and there was no evidence of distant metastases. A subtotal esophagectomy was performed. The resected specimen revealed a mixed neuroendocrine carcinoma with adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma component was on the surface of the tumor and the neuroendocrine component invaded the deeper portion. Immunohistochemically, the neuroendocrine carcinoma component stained positive for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20, suggesting that the neuroendocrine carcinoma originated from the adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma component stained positive for MUC2, which suggests that the adenocarcinoma component originated from Barrett's epithelium. Taken together, the neuroendocrine carcinoma may have originated from Barrett's epithelium. A metastasis to the liver was found 2 months after the surgical resection. Chemotherapy was administered, but there was no response. Most esophageal neuroendocrine carcinomas are accompanied by adenocarcinoma or squamous cell components, suggesting that these carcinomas originate from pluripotent cells in squamous or Barrett's epithelium. Appropriate chemotherapy for these lesions should be considered based on the cell of origin.
