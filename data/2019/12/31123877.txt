Foreign-born African immigrants bear a large burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease in the U.S. However, HBV awareness and knowledge of HBV screening and vaccination among this population is limited. This study aimed to provide a better understanding of HBV burden in this vulnerable population and to identify risk factors for the implementation of more effective prevention and treatment programs. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 71 first-generation African Americans in New York City. Participants' sociodemographic characteristics, HBV screening and vaccination history, knowledge of HBV transmission, and other related issues were asked. The study sample included 46 men and 23 women, with an average age of 32.75. Of the sample, 87.50% participants migrated from sub-Saharan Africa and 79.10% had lived in the U.S. for 10 or fewer years. Almost half of participants never underwent HBV screening (44.29%) or HBV vaccination (49.23%). About two-thirds (60.87%) of participants never received any HBV screening or vaccination recommendation from doctors. Multivariable analysis results showed that having a college degree and being currently married were significantly associated with HBV screening, while having health insurance was significantly associated with HBV vaccination. Survey data further indicated that first-generation African immigrants had very limited knowledge of HBV transmission, suggesting that this population would benefit from greater awareness of HBV risk factors and modes of transmission. The influence of education, marriage and spousal support, and access to health insurance on HBV screening and vaccination should be noted and further examined in future public health interventions and research.
