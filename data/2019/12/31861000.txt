Rationale:Apatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. It has been shown that apatinib is effective and safe for treatment of multiple solid tumors, including gastric cancer, liver cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and breast cancer. However, there is currently no consensus as to using Apatinib for the treatment of pleural synovial sarcoma, due to the rarity of primary pleural synovial sarcoma and lack of clinical studies as a consequence.Patient concerns and diagnoses:We reported here in the case of a 26-year-old Chinese woman diagnosed with pleural synovial sarcoma. She has undergone 2 surgeries, multiple regimens of chemotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine in other hospitals. Then the patient was admitted to our hospital with the compliant of chest pain and dyspnea. The medical history and available data supported the diagnosis of recurrence of pleural synovial sarcoma.Interventions and outcomes:Due to the lack of efficacy of previous standard treatment, the patient was given apatinib and radiotherapy to relieve the symptoms. This patient achieved stable disease with apatinib at a dose of 500 mg/day. Her progression-free survival time was more than 7 months, and her overall survival was 8.5 months. Except for hand-foot syndrome, no grade 3 or 4 side effects were observed.Conclusions:Apatinib may thus be an option for treatment of advanced synovial sarcoma after failure of other treatments. However, further study is needed to determine the efficacy of apatinib in pleural synovial sarcoma.
