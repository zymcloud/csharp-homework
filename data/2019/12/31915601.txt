Background and Aims: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health problem globally. Here, we describe the baseline characteristics and treatment profiles of HBV-infected patients recruited to the China Registry of Hepatitis B. Methods: Inclusion criteria were patients with different stages of chronic HBV infection and complete key data. Exclusion criteria were patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The baseline clinical, laboratory and treatment profiles were analyzed. Results: Finally, 40,431 patients were included. The median age was 43 years, with 65.2% being men and 51.3% being positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The most common initial diagnosis was chronic hepatitis B (81.0%), followed by cirrhosis (9.3%), inactive carrier of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (6.7%), and immune tolerant phase of hepatitis B infection (3.0%). Among the 21,228 patients who were on treatment, 88.0%, 10.0% and 2.0% received nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), interferon or combination of NAs and interferon, respectively. The proportion of patients who received preferred NAs (entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) had increased from 13.5% in 2003 to 79.7% in 2016. Conclusions: We concluded that middle-aged men accounted for most of the patients with chronic hepatitis B in this cross-sectional study. About half of the patients were HBeAg-positive. NAs were the most commonly used therapy, and use of the preferred NAs had steadily increased in the past decade.
