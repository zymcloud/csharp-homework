Purpose:There is a growing evidence showing that there are geographic differences in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Little is known about the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma in the Arabian Peninsula. The present study examines the presentation and outcomes of HCC in a single institution.Methods:A retrospective chart review of patients presented with advanced-stage HCC to Kuwait Cancer Control Center (KCCC) between 2008 and 2018 was conducted. Data collected included patients demographics, HCC risk factors, performance status, Child-Pugh score, pick up of sorafenib, and survival.Results:About 111 cases were analyzed. The mean age of the cohort was 61.8 Â± 11.4 years and 94 patients (84.7%) were males. HCV and diabetes were the most common risk factors for HCC and presented in 60 patients (54.1%) and 45 patients (40.5%), respectively. About 78 (70.3%) patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1 at presentation. Only 29 (26.1%) patients presented with Child-Pugh class A, while 42 (40.4%) patients received sorafenib. The median overall survival was only 3 months.Conclusions:In our cohort, HCV and diabetes were the main risk factors for HCC. The majority of patients was not amenable to sorafenib treatment and carries a very poor prognosis.
