Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer with high mortality but limited therapeutic options. Epigenetic regulations including DNA methylation and histone modification control gene expressions and play a crucial role during tumorigenesis. G9a, also known as EHMT2 (euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2), is a histone methyltransferase predominantly responsible for dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9). G9a has been shown to play a key role in promoting tumor progression. Recent studies have identified that G9a is a critical mediator of HCC pathogenesis. UNC0646 is a G9a inhibitor that has shown potent in vitro efficacy. However, due to its water insolubility, the in vivo efficacy of UNC0646 is not satisfactory. In this study, nanodiamonds (NDs) were utilized as a drug delivery platform to improve in vivo delivery of this small-molecule inhibitor. Our results showed that ND-UNC0646 complexes could be rapidly synthesized by physical adsorption, meanwhile possessing favorable drug delivery properties and was able to improve the dispersibility of UNC0646 in water, therefore making it amenable for intravenous administration. The release profile of UNC0646 from ND-UNC0646 was demonstrated to be pH-responsive. Moreover, ND-UNC0646 maintained the biological functionality of UNC0646, with higher efficacy in reducing H3K9 methylation as well as enhanced invasion suppressive effects. Most importantly, increased in vivo efficacy was demonstrated using an orthotopic HCC mouse model, which paves the way of translating this small-molecule inhibitor toward HCC treatment. Our work demonstrates the potential of NDs in the clinical application for HCC treatment.
