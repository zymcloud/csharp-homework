Objective:To explore the value of three-dimensional visualization technology (3DVT) combined with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 154 patients with HCC admitted to the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University between January, 2016 and November, 2018. In 57 of the patients (3DVT group), preoperative CT and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were performed and 3D visualization and surgical planning was carried out before the operation; intraoperative ICG florescence imaging was performed for real-time detection of the tumor location and demarcation, intrahepatic satellite lesions and metastases. According to the intraoperative fluorescent signals and 3D visualization-based surgical planning, the final surgical plan was determined. In the other 97 patients (control group), conventional surgical assessment and surgical resection of the tumor was carried out. The preoperative imaging findings, intraoperative tumor detection, postoperative laboratory results, pathological reports, and follow-up data of the patients were analyzed.Results:In 3DVT group, 63 and 70 lesions were detected by preoperative CT and MRI, respectively; compared with CT examination, intraoperative ICG florescence imaging revealed additional 17 lesions, among which 10 were pathologically confirmed as HCC and 7 as cirrhosis nodules. The median volume of bleeding was 300 mL in 3DVT group, significantly less than that in the control group (400 mL; Z=2.291, P=0.022). In both groups, serious complications or perioperative death occurred in none of the patients. The incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lowed in 3DVT group than in the control group [21% (12/57) vs 48.4% (47/97); Ï‡2=11.406, P=0.001]. The overall disease-free survival rate at 2 years after the operation was significantly higher in 3DVT group than in the control group (74.9% vs 28.9%, P=0.022).Conclusions:3DVT combined with ICG fluorescence imaging allows precise preoperative diagnosis, surgical planning and implementation, intraoperative detection of small liver cancers and precise navigation for HCC treatment, thereby helping to reduce postoperative complications and improve the disease-free survival rate of the patients.
