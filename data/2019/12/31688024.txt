Objectives:Adherence to a healthy diet has been associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may have overlapping mechanisms with T2D, such as inflammation and insulin resistance. Thus, we examined the association between a previously developed T2D prevention dietary pattern and HCC risk.Methods:We followed 87,943 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 49,665 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study for up to 32 years. The dietary diabetes risk reduction score, which includes dietary glycemic index, cereal fiber, ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats, trans fat, sugar-sweetened beverages, nuts, coffee, and red and processed meats, was obtained using validated food frequency questionnaires and updated every 4 years. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate multivariable hazard ratios and confidence intervals (95% CIs).Results:During over 1.9 million person-years, a total of 160 incident HCC cases were identified. The dietary diabetes risk reduction score was associated with a lower risk of HCC (top vs bottom quartile; hazard ratio: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34-0.95; Ptrend = 0.03). All the individual food and beverage items were associated with the risk of HCC in the expected direction, although the association was weaker than the overall dietary pattern.Discussion:Greater adherence to the T2D prevention diet was associated with a lower risk of developing HCC among US men and women. Further studies are needed to confirm and extend our findings.
