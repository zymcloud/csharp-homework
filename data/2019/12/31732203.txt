Background:The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade has exhibited an equal excellence with the Child-Pugh (C-P) grade in predicting overall survival (OS) of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, available published results of the ALBI grade in predicting the prognosis of HCC are still limited. The goal of this study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data to comprehensively evaluate the ALBI grade in predicting OS of patients with HCC.Methods:Multiple databases were systematically searched for eligible studies. Studies analyzing the relationship between the ALBI grade and survival outcome were identified. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to assess the risk. All statistical analyses were conducted by R version 3.3.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Results:A total of 8 studies were enrolled in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates demonstrated a significant relationship between elevated ALBI grade and inferior OS in patients with HCC (grade 1 vs 2: HR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.52-1.92; grade 1 vs 3: HR = 3.81, 95% CI: 2.75-5.29.). In addition, the same tendency was observed when performing subgroup analysis, including treatment strategies (surgical resection, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, and sorafenib) and study regions (Japan, Europe, China, and the USA). Moreover, the ALBI grade was able to classify patients with C-P grade A into 2 distinct prognostic cohorts-ALBI grade 1 and ALBI grade 2-with distinguishing survival outcomes (surgical resection: grade 1 vs 2: HR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.55-2.06, P Conclusion:The ALBI grade has the potency of becoming an independent prognostic factor in patients with HCC. More well-designed studies should be performed to evaluate the ALBI grade as a complementary prognostic tool to current staging systems in routine clinical practice.
