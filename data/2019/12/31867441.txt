Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its advanced complication, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), have become leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. In this review, we discuss the role of metabolic, gut microbial, immune and endocrine mediators which promote the progression of NAFLD to HCC. In particular, this progression involves multiple hits resulting from lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, inhibition of hepatic autophagy and inflammation. Furthermore, dysbiosis in the gut associated with obesity also promotes HCC via induction of proinflammatory cytokines and Toll like receptor signalling as well as altered bile metabolism. Additionally, compromised T-cell function and impaired hepatic hormonal action promote the development of NASH-associated HCC. Lastly, we discuss the current challenges involved in the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD/NASH-associated HCC.
