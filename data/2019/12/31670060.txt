Background:Fatty liver diseases are the most common and major health concern arises from the modern lifestyle and alcohol (ethanol) abuse. The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) has been observed prominently in obese and diabetic individuals, while alcoholic liver disease is common in alcoholic persons. Fatty liver disease, such as steatohepatitis, leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) against high-fat diet (HFD) and ethanol (EtOH)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.Methods:Male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were fed HFD (58% calories from fat) and EtOH (3-15% in drinking water) for 12 weeks. 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day for the last four weeks. After 12 weeks, biochemical, ELISA, RT-PCR, and histological studies have been carried out.Results:Biochemical analyses revealed the involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver of HFD and EtOH-fed rats. 7,8-DHF treatment significantly reduced HFD and EtOH-induced oxidative stress as evidenced by the reduction of lipid peroxidation and augmentation of reduced glutathione level. Moreover, IL-1β level was found significantly reduced in 7,8-DHF treated EtOH, HFD and EtOH+HFD groups. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR results indicated down-regulation of Nrf-2 and HO-1 and up-regulation of NF-κB and iNOS mRNA expression level in the liver of HFD and EtOH-fed rats, which was ameliorated by 7,8-DHF treatment.Conclusion:The present study suggested that 7,8-DHF could be an effective pharmacological intervention in combating HFD and EtOH-induced hepatotoxicity.
