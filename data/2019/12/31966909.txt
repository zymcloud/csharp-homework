Background:Splenosis is defined as the process by which tissue from the spleen disseminates through the body and grows in an ectopic location following trauma or a splenectomy. Visceral sites of splenosis are rare.Case summary:We report a case of intrahepatic splenosis in a 57-year-old man with a history of trauma over 40 years ago who initially presented with chest pain. Findings initially mimicked malignancy but a diagnosis of intrahepatic splenosis was confirmed using computed tomography and scintigraphy with technetium-99m heat-denatured red blood cells (Tc-99 DRBC).Conclusion:Scintigraphy with Tc-99 DRBC is a reliable technique to diagnose splenosis and should be performed before using more invasive procedures are carried out. Splenosis should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis for a hepatic nodule in any patient with a history of abdominal trauma, previous splenectomy or atypical radiological features on imaging.
