Aim:Handgrip strength (HGS) is a marker of sarcopenia and has been used to stratify an individual's risk of death. We aimed to assess the prognostic significance of HGS in patients with liver cirrhosis.Methods:In this retrospective study, we collated data of 563 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital with cirrhosis (375 men). A dynamometer was used to measure HGS. Body composition (including skeletal muscle and adipose tissue volumes) was estimated using computed tomography. Predictors of mortality were identified using sex-stratified multivariate analyses.Results:After adjustments for age, cirrhosis etiology, Child-Pugh score, and other confounding variables, HGS, but not body composition, was independently associated with mortality in male patients (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-0.99; P Conclusions:Reduced HGS, rather than skeletal muscle and adipose tissue volumes, is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients of both sexes with liver cirrhosis. Measurement of HGS is a simple, cost-effective, and appropriate bedside assessment for the prediction of survival in patients with cirrhosis.
