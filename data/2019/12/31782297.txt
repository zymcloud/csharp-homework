Background:Previous studies have reported a close connection between the spleen and hepatic tumours. We investigated the prognostic value of postoperative splenic volume increase (PSVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy.Methods:This was a retrospective study of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatectomy between January 2007 and May 2013. We categorized patients into 2 groups according to the cut-off value of the receiver operating characteristic curve: group A (PSVI Results:There were 275 patients in group A and 196 patients in group B. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 98.9%, 74.9% and 63.6%, respectively, for patients in group A, and 97.4%, 65.3% and 49.8%, respectively, for patients in group B (p = 0.004). The corresponding disease-free survival rates were 69.5%, 48.0% and 40.3%, and 58.1%, 36.5%, and 29.8% (p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, PSVI was an independent predictor of overall (p = 0.01) and disease-free (p = 0.03) survival.Conclusion:Postoperative splenic volume increase correlates with poor prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy.
