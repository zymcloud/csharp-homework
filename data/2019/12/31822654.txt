Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been increasingly demonstrated to function as novel promising therapeutic RNA molecules for diverse human diseases, including cancer. Although the important role of circRNAs has been well documented in HCC, the complex mechanisms of circRNAs in HCC need to be elucidated. Here, a novel circRNA circ_0001955 was identified from three GSE datasets (GSE7852, GSE94508, and GSE97322) as a differentially expressed circRNA between HCC and normal samples. We revealed that circ_0001955, TRAF6 and MAPK11 levels were increased, while miR-516a-5p levels were decreased in HCC tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of circ_0001955 repressed HCC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, while overexpression of circ_0001955 exhibited the opposite effect. Circ_0001955 was identified as a sponge for miR-145-5p and miR-516a-5p, and TRAF6 and MAPK11 were demonstrated to be two target genes of miR-516a-5p. In conclusion, circ_0001955 facilitated HCC tumorigenesis by sponging miR-516a-5p to release TRAF6 and MAPK11 expression.
