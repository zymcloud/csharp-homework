Aim: this study was performed to investigate the association between selenium concentrations, dietary intake, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: we identified eligible studies in PubMed and EMBASE databases, in addition to the reference lists of original studies and review articles on this topic, up to 1 Feb 2019. A summary of standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochran Q and I2 statistics. Results: finally, a meta-analysis showed that dietary intake of selenium and tissue selenium concentration were not associated with HCC risk (dietary SMD = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.26 to 0.03; tissue SMD = -0.12, 95% CI: -0.56 to 0.33). However, samples from toenail, whole blood, and serum all showed an inverse association with HCC risk (toenail SMD = -0.53, 95% CI: -0.72 to -0.35; whole blood SMD = -2.21, 95% CI: -2.67 to -1.76; tissue SMD = -1.26, 95% CI: -1.71 to -0.81). Dose-response data from few studies showed that an extra increase in serum selenium was dramatically related with a lower risk of HCC (adjusted p-trend
