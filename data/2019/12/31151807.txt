Background:During the last decades, several risk factors for the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) have been investigated. However, the impact of two important drivers of oncogenesis, namely the immunosuppression and the treatment of acute cellular rejection (ACR) have been marginally addressed. This study aimed at investigating the impact of ACR treatment on the incidence of tumor recurrence in a large European HCC-LT population.Methods:Seven hundred and eighty-one adult patients transplanted between February 1, 1985 and June 30, 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. After propensity score match, 116 patients treated for ACR using steroid boluses were compared with 115 patients who did not present any ACR or a histologic but clinical irrelevant ACR.Results:Steroid boluses treated patients had a 18-fold higher overall incidence of HCC recurrence than those non-treated patients (16.4% vs. 0.9%; PConclusions:The decision to treat ACR as well as to reinforce immunosuppression load should be cautiously taken in view of the presented results. Prospective studies are needed to further elucidate the clinical impact of immunosuppression on HCC recurrence after transplantation.
