The ETFDH (electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase) gene mutations are reported to be a major cause of riboflavin-responsive multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD). However, the role of ETFDH in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of ETFDH in HCC. Immunohistochemical staining of the 207 HCC tissue microarray showed that expression of ETFDH was significantly decreased in HCC compared with the matching noncancerous hepatic tissues (P
