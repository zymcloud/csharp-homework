Introduction:Newly discovered thyroid nodules in deceased donors are investigated to rule out cancer that can be transmitted, but there are no established protocols. The aim of the study was to compare fine needle aspiration versus intraoperative frozen section in the donor management with limited time.Methods:Data were extracted only from the records of Italian second opinion consultation service in the years 2016 to 2017 and included donor details, pathology diagnoses, complications, transmission risk profile, and impact on transplantation.Results:Among 31 deceased donors with thyroid nodules, we documented 4 with a clinical history of cancer and 27 with a newly discovered nodule. The latter was evaluated by thyroidectomy with frozen section in 22 and fine needle aspiration in 5. Among all donors, 7 had papillary thyroid carcinoma with negligible transmission risk, whereas 8 with unacceptable risk. Two donors presented major bleeding after thyroidectomy, with organ discard in 1 case. Transplantation was delayed in 4 cases that were evaluated with frozen section.Discussion:There was no uniform approach for the investigation of thyroid nodules. Our results showed that fine needle aspiration was more accurate and useful than frozen section. Fine needle aspiration had minor economic impact and a far less rate of bleeding/hemodynamic complications, potentially delaying and compromising organ recovery. Our results suggested considering fine needle aspiration as a first step in the evaluation of thyroid nodules in donors.
