Aims:In the cell, both transcriptional and translational processes are tightly regulated. Cancer is a multifactorial disease characterized by aberrant protein expression. Since epigenetic control mechanisms are also frequently disrupted during carcinogenesis, they have been the center of attention in cancer research within the past decades. EEF1 complex members, which are required for the elongation process in eukaryotes, have recently been implicated in carcinogenesis. This study aims to investigate genetic alterations within EEF1A1, EEF1A2, EEF1B2, EEF1D, EEF1E1 and EEF1G genes and their potential effects on epigenetic regulation mechanisms.Materials and methods:In this study, we analyzed DNA sequencing and mRNA expression data available on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) across different cancer types to detect genetic alterations in EEF1 genes and investigated their potential impact on selected epigenetic modulators.Key findings:We found that EEF1 complex proteins were deregulated in several types of cancer. Lower EEF1A1, EEF1B2, EEF1D and EEF1G levels were correlated with poor survival in glioma, while lower EEF1B2, EEF1D and EEF1E1 levels were correlated with better survival in hepatocellular carcinoma. We detected genetic alterations within EEF1 genes in up to 35% of the patients and showed that these alterations resulted in down-regulation of histone modifying enzymes KMT2C, KMT2D, KMT2E, KAT6A and EP300.Significance:Here in this study, we showed that EEF1 deregulations might result in differential epigenomic landscapes, which affect the overall transcriptional profile, contributing to carcinogenesis. Identification of these molecular distinctions might be useful in developing targeted drug therapies and personalized medicine.
