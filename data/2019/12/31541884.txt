Objective:To investigate the effect of rosmarinic acid (RosA) on hepatocellular carcinoma cell in vivo and in vitro and to explore its possible mechanism of anti-hepatocarcinoma.Methods:The hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721 was treated with different concentrations of RosA (0, 20, 50, 100 Î¼mol/L) to detect cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and invasion.PI3K pathway-specific activator IGF-1 was used to explore whether the mechanism for RosA action relates to PI3K/AKT signal pathway.Nude mice inoculated with SMMC-7721 cells were treated with different doses of RosA (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) to detect the tumor formation of cancer cells in vivo.Results:RosA significantly inhibited the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells and induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. RosA might inhibit cell invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Rescue experiments showed that IGF-1 could reverse the inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway by RosA and the effect on proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, invasion and EMT by IGF-1 in SMMC-7721 cells;RosA could inhibit tumor formation of SMMC-7721 cells in vivo.Conclusion:RosA can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cell in vitro and inhibit tumour growth in vivo and the mechanism may relate to inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT signal pathway.
