Galactose-modified selenium nanoparticles (GA-SeNPs) loading with doxorubicin (DOX) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy was investigated in this paper. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were modified with galactose as tumor targeting moiety to fabricate tumor-targeted delivery carrier GA-SeNPs, then doxorubicin was loaded onto the surface of GA-SeNPs for improving antitumor efficacy of DOX in HCC therapy. Chemical structure characterization of GA-Se@DOX showed that DOX was successfully loaded to the surface of GA-SeNPs to prepare functionalized antitumor drug delivery system GA-Se@DOX. GA-Se@DOX exhibited effective cellular uptake in HepG2 cells and entered HepG2 cells mainly by clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. GA-Se@DOX showed significant activity to induce the apoptosis of HepG2 cells in vitro. The western blotting result indicated that GA-Se@DOX induced HepG2 cells apoptosis via activating caspase signaling and Bcl-2 family proteins. Moreover, active targeting delivery system GA-Se@DOX exhibited excellent antitumor efficacy in vivo in comparison with passive targeting delivery system Se@DOX. Histology analysis showed that GA-Se@DOX exhibited no obvious damage to major organs including heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney under the experimental condition. Taken together, GA-Se@DOX may be one novel promising nanoscale drug candidate for HCC therapy.
