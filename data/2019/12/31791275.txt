Background:Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is an extracellular matrix-degrading protease that is involved in the invasiveness and progression of cancer. There is good evidence that uPA expression is a clinically relevant biomarker in some solid tumors, but its role in hepatocellulcar carcinoma (HCC) is uncertain. We evaluated the prognostic value of serum uPA before surgery in HCC patients receiving curative resection.Methods:Serum uPA levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 282 HCC patients who received complete liver resections at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Overall survival (OS) curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional -hazards regression model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. The median follow-up time was 52 months.Results:Patients with higher pretreatment serum uPA (â‰¥1 ng/ml) had significantly shorter OS (p = 0.002). Patients with liver cirrhosis, hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia were significantly more likely to present with elevated uPA levels. Multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that high pretreatment serum uPA [hazard ratio (HR), 1.848, p = 0.006], vascular invasion (HR, 2.940, p Conclusions:We conclude that uPA is a clinically relevant biomarker in HCC patients receiving curative resection, with higher expression of uPA being associated with higher mortality. This also highlights the potential utility of uPA as a therapeutic target for improved treatment strategies.
