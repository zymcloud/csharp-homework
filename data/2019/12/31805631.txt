Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Molecular heterogeneity and absence of biomarkers for patient allocation to the best therapeutic option contribute to poor prognosis of advanced stages. Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression is associated with HCC development and progression and influences drug resistance. Therefore, miRNAs have been assayed as putative biomarkers and therapeutic targets. MiRNA-based therapeutic approaches demonstrated safety profiles and antitumor efficacy in HCC animal models; nevertheless, caution should be used when transferring preclinical findings to the clinics, due to possible molecular inconsistency between animal models and the heterogeneous pattern of the human disease. In this context, models with defined genetic and molecular backgrounds might help to identify novel therapeutic options for specific HCC subgroups. In this review, we describe rodent models of HCC, emphasizing their representativeness with the human pathology and their usefulness as preclinical tools for assessing miRNA-based therapeutic strategies.
