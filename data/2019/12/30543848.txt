Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the main causes of cancer-related death. This study aims to explore the role and underlying mechanism of H19 in HCC.Methods:qRT-PCR detected miR-15b-5p and H19 expression, as well as the mRNA level of EMT-associated genes. Western blotting detected protein level of EMT-associated genes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) examined CDC42 in HCC tissues. Dual luciferase reporter assay verified the regulatory mechanism among H19, miR-15b and CDC42. Colony formation, wound healing assay, transwell, flow cytometry measured proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis, respectively.Results:H19 and CDC42 were up-regulated while miR-15b was down-regulated in HCC cells and tissues. miR-15b interacted with H19 and CDC42 3'-UTR. H19 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased apoptosis, which was rescued by miR-15b inhibitor. H19 knockdown suppressed CDC42/PAK1 pathway and EMT progress.Conclusion:H19 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis of HCC cells via targeting miR-15b/CDC42/PAK1 axis.
