Purpose:This study tested the hypothesis that stress conditions that simulated percutaneous thermal ablation (PTA), transarterial embolization (TAE), or transarterial chemoembolization stimulated enrichment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cancer stem cells (hCSCs) and that hCSC inhibitors can suppress this effect.Materials and methods:Human HCC cell lines HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 were subjected to a 46.5°C heat bath for 10 minutes or to 1% hypoxia for 72 hours without fetal bovine serum and with or without doxorubicin. Cells were then treated with a β-catenin inhibitor (FH535 or XAV939), a PI3 kinase inhibitor (Ly294002), or niclosamide, a US Food and Drug Administration-approved antihelminthic drug that acts as a mitochondrial decoupler and mixed inhibitor. Surviving cells were analyzed for hCSC markers by flow cytometry, for stemness by colony-forming assay or sphere-forming assay, and for proliferative capacity by MTT assay (where MTT is 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide). Expression of proteins related to CSC renewal and proliferation were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunostaining.Results:Conditions that simulated PTA, TAE, and transarterial chemoembolization resulted in an enrichment of cells bearing hCSC markers (CD133, CD44, and EpCAM). Cells surviving heat stress exhibited higher colony- or sphere-forming capacity and a greater proliferative state. These effects could be suppressed by niclosamide and inhibitors of β-catenin and PI3 kinase.Conclusions:Stress conditions induced by locoregional therapies stimulated hCSC enrichment and proliferation, which could be suppressed by niclosamide and inhibitors of pathways important for hCSC renewal. Future studies will determine whether combining locoregional therapies with adjuvant hCSC inhibitors reduces HCC recurrence.
