A 37-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis and rectal carcinoma. He underwent total colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis(pT3N1M0, pStage â…¢a)followed by adjuvant therapy with S-1. Three months after primary surgery, CT and MRIrevealed liver metastases(S5, S6). Laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed. Two years after primary surgery, new liver metastases(S2, S8)were found and we performed open partial hepatectomy and administered mFOLFOX6. Three years and 5 months after primary surgery, right lung metastases(S6, S9) were detected and the patient underwent a thoracoscopic-assisted right lung wedge resection. Repeated resection of metastases might have contributed to the long-survival in our case.
