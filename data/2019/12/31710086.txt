We appreciate to receive commentary from Dr Guangtong Deng and Dr Liang Xiao to our article, "Nomograms based on inflammatory biomarkers for predicting tumor grade and micro-vascular invasion in stage I/II hepatocellular carcinoma". First, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and derived NLR (dNLR) are two different parameters. Some studies show that NLR is inconsistent with dNRL in prognostic value through multivariate Cox regression, therefore, it is reasonable that both NLR and dNLR entered into multivariate analysis simultaneously. Second, it is common that articles of predictive nomograms turned continuous variables into categorical variables. The reason is that the categorization of patient clinical variables is beneficial to doctors to make decisions based on the risk level of individual patients in clinical. At last, multicenter validation is quite difficult and we have listed the shortcomings in the limitations of our article. Further validation will need the joint efforts by other institutions.
