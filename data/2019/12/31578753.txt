Background and objectives:Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score was shown to correlate with liver function and tumor recurrence after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of ALBI grade in liver transplantation (LT) patients with HCC.Methods:Pre-LT available independent predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and microvascular tumor invasion (MVI) were determined in 123 patients with HCC.Results:Posttransplant HCC recurrence rates were 10.5%, 15.9%, and 68.2% in ALBI grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P Conclusion:Preoperative ALBI grade seems to be valuable for refinement of oncological risk stratification at LT for HCC.
