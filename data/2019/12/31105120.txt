The indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence method is reportedly useful for intraoperative visualization of hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver cancer. Herein, we report the use of an ICG fluorescence navigation system for laparoscopic hepatectomy. The patient was a 73-year-old man with a surgical history of two laparotomies for hepatocellular carcinoma resection. During follow-up at our hospital, abdominal computed tomography revealed recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the lateral area of the liver, after which the patient was hospitalized for surgery. His surgical history indicated that adhesions in the abdominal cavity were likely. We scheduled laparoscopic repeat hepatectomy (LRH) with an ICG fluorescence method in which ICG dye was injected intravenously 2 days before surgery. ICG fluorescence was easily detected intraoperatively. The advantages of the present approach are that it induces pneumoperitoneum and, with laparoscopic magnification, enables good visualization of the surgical field for LRH and clear intraoperative identification of the tumor, thus facilitating LRH. Laparoscopic partial resection of the liver (S3) was successfully performed; the operation time was 197 minutes and bleeding volume was 30 mL. Postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on postoperative day 10.
