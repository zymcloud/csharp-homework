Objectives:Frailty is prevalent in patients with cirrhosis and is hypothesized to result in part from sarcopenia, but the precise contribution of sarcopenia to frailty in this population is poorly understood.Methods:Included were patients with cirrhosis from 2011 to 2014 who had an ambulatory frailty assessment and abdominal computed tomography scan within 3 months. Logistic regression assessed the associations between frailty (=Liver Frailty Index ≥4.5), and sarcopenia (=skeletal muscle index of Results:Two hundred ninety-one participants were included: 33% were female. The median (interquartile range) Liver Frailty Index was 3.7 (3.3-4.2); 19% were frail. The median (interquartile range) skeletal muscle index was 49 cm/m (31-69); 36% had sarcopenia. Among the 54 frail participants, 48% had sarcopenia. In univariable logistic regression, sarcopenia was associated with a 1.86× increased odds of being frail (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-3.38). After adjusting for sex, etiology, hepatocellular carcinoma, MELDNa, ascites, encephalopathy, and hypertension, sarcopenia was associated with a 2.38× increased odds of being frail (95% CI, 1.17-4.85). After stratifying by sex and adjusting for MELDNa, sarcopenia among males was associated with a significantly increased odds of frailty (odds ratio 2.81, 95% CI, 1.19-6.67), whereas sarcopenia among females was not (odds ratio 1.38; 95% CI, 0.45-4.25).Discussion:In patients with cirrhosis, sarcopenia was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased odds of being frail. Two-thirds of frail men displayed sarcopenia compared with only one-quarter of frail women. Contributors to the frail phenotype may differ by sex and support the need for sex-specific strategies to reduce frailty in this population.
