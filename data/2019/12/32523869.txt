Purpose of review:In this review article we evaluate sex differences in the natural history of NAFLD and highlight distinct risk profiles of women with NAFLD, as well as unique treatment considerations and research gaps.Summary of findings:Reproductive factors, such as menopausal status should be considered when evaluating NAFLD risk in women, as well as additional reproductive risk factors such as age at menarche, presence of polycystic ovary syndrome, and gestational diabetes. Women do appear to have lower risk for hepatocellular carcinoma from NASH, as well as lower mortality from NASH cirrhosis than men, although among women, NASH is now the leading indication for liver transplant. Data on sex differences in biomarker development and clinical trials are lacking, and researchers should be encouraged to evaluate biomarker performance by sex, and specifically report clinical trial endpoints in women.
