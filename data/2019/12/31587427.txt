Background:Combination of anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) and antiviral nucleotide/nucleoside is the most common regimen for prophylaxis against hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence. However, what the optimal regimen is for HBIg administration remains subject to debate.Methods:Two hundred and thirty-two HBV patients who had liver transplantation were included in this study. According to the decline rate of HBIg, the patients were divided into quick (group Q, n = 95) and slow decline groups (group S, n = 137). Quick HBIg decline was defined as anti-HBs titer Results:After a mean (range) follow-up of 42.2 (24.1-76.8) months, the HBV recurrence rate was 12.1% for all 232 patients. The median (interquartile) HBIg titer was 96.2 (41.0-158.0) IU in group Q patients, compared to 418.0 (298.8-692.8) IU in group S patients at POM 1 (P Conclusion:Perioperative low-dose HBIg and antiviral nucleotide/nucleoside can effectively prevent HBV recurrence in patients with slow HBIg decline. For patients with quick HBIg decline, the idealized HBIg and antiviral agent regimen should be adjusted to establish an effective regimen as prophylaxis against HBV recurrence.
