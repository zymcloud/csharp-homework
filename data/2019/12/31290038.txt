This work combines a particle injection system with our proposed magnetic resonance navigation (MRN) sequence with the intention of validating MRN in a two-bifurcation phantom for endovascular treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A theoretical physical model used to calculate the most appropriate size of the magnetic drug-eluting bead (MDEB, 200 Î¼m) aggregates was proposed. The aggregates were injected into the phantom by a dedicated particle injector while a trigger signal was automatically sent to the MRI to start MRN which consists of interleaved tracking and steering sequences. When the main branch of the phantom was parallel to B0, the aggregate distribution ratio in the (left-left, left-right, right-left and right-right divisions was obtained with results of 8, 68, 24 and 0% respectively at baseline (no MRN) and increased to 84%, 100, 84 and 92% (p < 0.001, p = 0.004, p < 0.001, p < 0.001) after implementing our MRN protocol. When the main branch was perpendicular to B0, the right-left branch, having the smallest baseline distribution rate of 0%, reached 80% (p < 0.001) after applying MRN. Moreover, the success rate of MRN was always more than 92% at the 1st bifurcation in the experiments above.
