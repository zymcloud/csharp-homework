Background:Studies on intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging are carried out with different acquisition protocols.Purpose:To investigate the dependence of IVIM parameters on the B0 field strength when using a bi- or triexponential model.Study type:Prospective.Study population:20 healthy volunteers (age: 19-28 years).Field strength/sequence:Volunteers were examined at two field strengths (1.5 and 3T). Diffusion-weighted images of the abdomen were acquired at 24 b-values ranging from 0.2 to 500 s/mm2 .Assessment:ROIs were manually drawn in the liver. Data were fitted with a bi- and a triexponential IVIM model. The resulting parameters were compared between both field strengths.Statistical tests:One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to test the obtained IVIM parameters for a significant field strength dependency.Results:At b-values below 6 s/mm2 , the triexponential model provided better agreement with the data than the biexponential model. The average tissue diffusivity was D = 1.22/1.00 μm2 /msec at 1.5/3T. The average pseudodiffusion coefficients for the biexponential model were D* = 308/260 μm2 /msec at 1.5/3T; and for the triexponential model D 1 * = 81.3/65.9 μm2 /msec, D 2 * = 2453/2333 μm2 /msec at 1.5/3T. The average perfusion fractions for the biexponential model were f = 0.286/0.303 at 1.5/3T; and for the triexponential model f1 = 0.161/0.174 and f2 = 0.152/0.159 at 1.5/3T. A significant B0 dependence was only found for the biexponential pseudodiffusion coefficient (ANOVA/KW P = 0.037/0.0453) and tissue diffusivity (ANOVA/KW: P < 0.001).Data conclusion:Our experimental results suggest that triexponential pseudodiffusion coefficients and perfusion fractions obtained at different field strengths could be compared across different studies using different B0 . However, it is recommended to take the field strength into account when comparing tissue diffusivities or using the biexponential IVIM model. Considering published values for oxygenation-dependent transversal relaxation times of blood, it is unlikely that the two blood compartments of the triexponential model represent venous and arterial blood.Level of evidence:1 Technical Efficacy Stage: 2 J.
