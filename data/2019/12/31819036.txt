Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Hypoxia and excessive transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) have been identified as inducers and target for EMT in HCC. Here, we show hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and TGF-β form a feed-forward loop to induce EMT in HCC cells. Further mechanistic study indicates under both hypoxia and TGF-β stimulation, Smad and PI3K-AKT pathways are activated. We show sanguinarine, a natural benzophenanthridine alkaloid, impairs the proliferation of nine kinds of HCC cell lines and the colony formation of HCC cells. In hypoxic and TGF-β cell models, sanguinarine inhibits HIF-1α signaling and the expression of EMT markers, translocation of Snail and activation of both Smad and PI3K-AKT pathways. Sanguinarine could also inhibit TGF-β-induced cell migration in HCC cells. In vivo studies reveal that the administration of sanguinarine inhibits tumor growth and HIF-1α signaling, inhibits the expression changes of EMT markers as well as Smad and PI3K-AKT pathway proteins. Our findings suggest that sanguinarine is a promising candidate targeting HIF-1α/TGF-β signaling to improve the treatment for HCC patients.
