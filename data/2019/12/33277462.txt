Dysregulation of dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) expression has been reported in a variety of human cancers. We previously reported that DKK1 was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of DKK1 in HCC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance and biological functions of DKK1 in HCC. The expression of DKK1 was examined in cirrhotic and HCC tissues by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). DKK1 was silenced or overexpressed in HCC cell lines, and in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. Immunohistochemistry revealed that DKK1 was weakly expressed in cirrhotic tissues (8/22, 36.4%) but upregulated in HCC tissues (48/53, 90.6%, cohort 1). Significant upregulation of DKK1 was observed in 57.6% (19/33, cohort 2) of HCC tissues by qRT-PCR, and the expression of DKK1 was associated with tumor size (P = 0.024) and tumor number (P = 0.019). Genetic depletion of DKK1 impaired the proliferation, colony-forming ability, invasion, and tumor formation of HCC cells (HepG2 and HUH-7). Conversely, forced expression of DKK1 increased the proliferation, colony-forming ability, and invasion of HepG2 and HUH-7 cells in vitro and enhanced tumor formation in vivo. Subsequent investigation revealed that the DKK1-mediated proliferation and tumorigenicity of HepG2 and HUH-7 cells is dependent on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These findings indicate that DKK1 plays an oncogenic role in HCC by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
