Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is a physiologic protein tetramer that is crucial for a developing fetus to survive in utero. Maternal hemoglobin has a relatively lower affinity for oxygen, and thus allows for an efficient transfer of oxygen from maternal to fetal blood. In addition to fulfilling a critical physiologic role, HbF is also known to alleviate symptoms of sickle-cell disease (SCD). The concentration of HbF depends on several factors. HbF is elevated in inherited conditions, such as hereditary persistence of HbF, hereditary spherocytosis, and thalassemia. The level of HbF is also increased in acquired states, such as pregnancy, aplastic anemia, thyrotoxicosis, hepatoma, myeloproliferative disorders, or hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome. It has been identified that some genetic loci have significant influence on HbF levels. The XmnI polymorphism, the HMIP locus, and the BCL11A gene are responsible for 45% of variations in HbF levels. Although SCD has been well described in the subpopulations of Africa, it is less common in the subpopulations of India. We describe a case of SCD, in which a patient with high HbF level presented at a very late age (27 years old). We presume the patient's inherently elevated HbF levels were able to compensate for the hypoxic episodes associated with SCD. The onset of symptoms was delayed as a result of elevated HbF levels.
