Background:Increasing evidence indicates that Six2 contributes to tumorigenesis in various tumor including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to determine the role of Six2 in HCC and to elucidate the association of Six2 with clinical pathological characteristics.Methods:The expressions of Six2 in HCC tumor, para-tumor tissue and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) were detected by tissue microarray technique, immunohistochemistry, real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Chi-square and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to analyze the correlation between Six2 expression and prognosis of HCC patients. Lentivirus mediated Six2 knockdown, spheroid formation assay, proliferation assay and subcutaneous tumor implantation were performed to determine the function of Six2.Results:In 274 HCC samples, Six2 was strongly expressed. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high expression of Six2 was correlated with a shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, Six2 expression was associated with sex, alpha-fetoprotein, tumor size and portal vein invasion. Six2 was highly expressed in PVTT. Six2 knockdown inhibited HCC cell lines proliferation, migration, and self-renewal in vitro and in vivo. In addition, low-expression of Six2 weakened TGF-β induced Smad4 activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HCC cell lines.Conclusions:Elevated Six2 expression in HCC tumor patients was associated with negative prognosis. Upregulated Six2 promoted tumor growth and facilitated HCC metastasis via TGF-β/Smad signal pathway.
