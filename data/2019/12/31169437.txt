Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of systemic inflammation markers [neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI)] and hepatic inflammation markers [aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and further to develop a novel prognostic score model. Methods: A total of 401 cases with HBV-associated HCC who underwent hepatectomy as initial therapy were included in the analysis. Kaplan-Meier was performed to construct survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to detect the optimal cut-off value of markers. The prognostic score model was constructed using significant inflammation markers in the Cox model. Each factor was given a score of 1 and patients were stratified according to the scores. Results: In the Cox model, α-fetoprotein (AFP), ALT, tumour differentiation, maximum size of tumours, TNM stage, PNI and γ-GT/ALT were independently prognostic factors. We established a preoperative inflammation-based prognostic scoring model combining PNI and γ-GT/ALT. The novel preoperative inflammation-based prognostic score was superior (area under the curve [AUC], 0.659) to 7th tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (AUC, 0.600) despite no statistical significance (p = .1036). Conclusion: PNI and γ-GT/ALT are independent predictors for prognosis. The novel prognostic score model based on systemic and hepatic inflammation markers is suitable for the prognosis evaluation in patients with HBV-associated HCC.
