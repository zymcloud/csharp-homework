Orbital metastasis from breast cancer is a rare condition. Here, we describe 2 cases of orbital metastasis from breast cancer. The first patient was a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. She underwent surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. One year after surgery, she had multiple bone metastases and then multiple liver metastases developed. During chemotherapy for metastatic disease, she complained ofheadaches and visual disturbances. Findings ofa MRI scan suggested a metastatic tumor in the left orbit. A total of 30 Gy of radiation therapy was administered, but she died a month after the orbital metastasis was discovered. The second patient was a 42-year-old woman, who had advanced breast cancer with bone metastasis. Diplopia developed 8 months after initiation of chemotherapy. Meningeal dissemination was suspected because ophthalmological examination revealed swelling ofbilateral optic discs. She lost her sight within a month. She died 2 months after the diagnosis oforbital metastasis. There was no evidence ofcentral nervous system metastasis in either case. Loss ofvision severely impairs patients' quality oflif e. It is important to know that there is rarely such a rapid progression ofdisease, especially in young patients with triple-negative disease.
