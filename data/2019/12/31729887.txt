Aim: To elucidate the integrative combinational gene regulatory network landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) molecular carcinogenesis from diverse background. Materials & methods: Modified gene regulatory network analysis was used to prioritize differentially regulated genes and links. Integrative comparisons using bioinformatics methods were applied to identify potential critical molecules and pathways in HCC with different backgrounds. Results: E2F1 with its surrounding regulatory links were identified to play different key roles in the HCC risk factor dysregulation mechanisms. Hsa-mir-19a was identified as showed different effects in the three HCC differential regulation networks, and showed vital regulatory role in HBV-related HCC. Conclusion: We describe in detail the regulatory networks involved in HCC with different backgrounds. E2F1 may serve as a universal target for HCC treatment.
