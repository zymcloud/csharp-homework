The prognostic value and molecular mechanism of microRNA-100-5p (miR-100-5p) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unclear. To explore the prognostic value and the mechanism of miR-100-5p in HCC, the present study analyzed the results of 18 previous studies and bioinformatic datasets. The clinical significance of miR-100-5p and its targets in HCC were investigated using The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Omnibus, as well as relevant literature. In total, 12 online tools were used to predict the target genes of miR-100-5p. Bioinformatics analysis and Spearman correlation analysis were performed, and genomic alterations of the hub genes were evaluated. A meta-analysis with 1,258 samples revealed that miR-100-5p was significantly downregulated in HCC [standard mean difference (SMD), -0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.14 to -0.74; I2, 35.2%]. Lower miR-100-5p expression was associated with poorer clinical characteristics and a poorer prognosis for patients with HCC. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis revealed that the 'regulation of transcription', 'chromatin remodeling complex', 'transcription regulator activity', 'pathways in cancer' and 'heparan sulfate biosynthesis' were the most enriched terms. Furthermore, expression of histone deacetylase (HDAC)2, HDAC3, SHC-transforming protein 1 (SHC1), Ras-related protein Rac1 (RAC1) and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CBL (CBL) was negatively correlated with miR-100-5p expression. Among these, upregulated HDAC2 [hazard ratio (HR), 1.910; 95% CI, 1.309-2.787; P=0.0007], HDAC3 (HR, 1.474; 95% CI, 1.012-2.146; P=0.0435), SHC1 (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.043-2.215; P=0.0281) and RAC1 (HR, 1.817; 95% CI, 1.248-2.645; P=0.0022) were associated with shorter survival. Alterations in HDAC2, SHC1, RAC1 and IGF1R were linked with a poorer outcome for HCC, and alternative splicing of SHC and RAC1 were significantly decreased and increased in HCC, respectively. In summary, the downregulation of miR-100-5p may be involved in the progression and prognosis of HCC. The upregulation of HDAC2, HDAC3, SHC1 and RAC1 may indicate a poorer survival rate for patients with HCC. Thus, miR-100-5p and these 4 potential target genes may provide novel therapeutic targets and prognostic predictors for patients with HCC.
