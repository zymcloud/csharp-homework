Liver metastases (LM) remain a major cause of cancer-associated death and a clinical challenge. Here we explore a sexual dimorphism observed in the regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of LM, wherein the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells in colon and lung carcinoma LM is TNFR2-dependent in female, but not in male mice. In ovariectomized mice, a marked reduction is observed in colorectal, lung and pancreatic carcinoma LM that is reversible by estradiol reconstitution. This is associated with reduced liver MDSC accumulation, increased interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) and granzyme B production in CD8+ T cells and reduced TNFR2, IDO2, TDO and Serpin B9 expression levels. Treatment with tamoxifen increases liver cytotoxic T cell accumulation and reduces colon cancer LM. The results identify estrogen as a regulator of a pro-metastatic immune microenvironment in the liver and a potential target in the management of liver metastatic disease.
