Background:The association between metabolic syndrome (MS), both in terms of its components and as a whole, and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in subjects with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains unclear, especially in mainland China.Methods:We prospectively included 6,564 individuals with HBV infection from an initial cohort of 105,397 civil servants. The multivariate-adjusted HR and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models to explore the potential connection between HCC risk and MS. Cumulative incidences were plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:After a 45,668.0 person-year follow-up (76.0 ± 30.8 months) of 6,564 subjects who were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen, 89 incident HCC cases were identified. MS as a whole was independently associated with a 2-fold increased HCC risk (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.41-3.60) after adjusting for age (in 1-year increments), gender, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, liver cirrhosis, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (≥40 U/L). Subjects with three or more factors and those with one or two factors had adjusted increased HCC risks of 2.12-fold (95% CI, 1.16-3.89) and 1.28-fold (95% CI, 0.74-2.22), respectively, in comparison with those without any metabolic factors. Central obesity and type 2 diabetes were associated with significantly increased HCC risk, whereas this association was not observed in obese subjects (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2; 95% CI, 0.73-3.44).Conclusions:MS as a whole, central obesity, and type 2 diabetes were independently associated with increased HCC risk in a population with HBV infection in mainland China.Impact:MS may be a risk factor for HCC.
