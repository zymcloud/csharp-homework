Liver cirrhosis progresses through multiple clinical stages which culminate in either death or liver transplantation. Availability of organs, timely listing and prompt receipt of donor-livers pose difficulties in improving transplant-listed and transplant outcomes. In this regard, regenerative therapies, particularly with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), has become a lucrative option for improving transplant-free survival. However, the literature is confusing with regards to patient selection and real outcomes. In this exhaustive review, we describe the basics of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis through novel insights from a therapeutic point of view, discuss preclinical studies on GCSF in advanced liver disease to improve on clinical utility, shed light on the pertinent literature of GCSF in advanced cirrhosis, and provide astute inputs on growth factor therapy in decompensated cirrhosis.
