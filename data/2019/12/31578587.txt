Toll‑like receptor 2 (TLR2), is an important pattern recognition receptor which serves a role in chronic inflammation of the liver. However, the role of TLR2 in the progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of the activation of the TLR2 signaling pathway on biological functions, such as proliferation and apoptosis. TLR2 expression in HCC tissues was assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry and western blotting. B76/Huh7 cells were transfected with overexpression plasmids, and cell proliferation was detected using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and the secreted cytokines in the supernatant of transfected cells were measured by ELISA. The findings revealed that TLR2 expression was increased in the peritumoral groups compared with inner‑tumoral groups. Activation of the TLR2 signaling pathway through overexpression of pathway molecules inhibited the growth of B76/Huh7 cells and the secretion of interleukin‑6 and tumor necrosis factor‑α were reduced. Inhibition of the TLR2 signaling pathway resulted in a significant increase in the downstream signaling cascade, thus potentially increasing hepatocarcinogenesis and tumor progression. Activation of the TLR2 signaling pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in patients with HCC and downstream secreted cytokines are required for the functional biological effect. Therefore, modulation of the TLR2 signaling pathway may provide important insight into designing effective therapeutic regimens for treating patients with HCC.
