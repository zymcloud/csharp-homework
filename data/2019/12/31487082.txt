Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) demonstrated high efficacy and safety even in the post-liver transplant (LT) setting and in HIV-infected patients, but data are very limited in the early post-LT period with the most recently available DAA. Two HIV/HCV-coinfected LT recipients (both grafts from HIV/HCV-negative donors) experienced early HCV recurrence with severe hepatitis and were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks. Unfortunately, both patients failed: one (genotype 4d) showed virological breakthrough at week 3 with resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) for both NS5A and NS5B, while the other (genotype 1a) experienced virological relapse without RAS. Both progressed to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis and were successfully retreated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 16 weeks achieving sustained virological response. The higher prevalence of RAS in experienced genotype 4 patients and the long time to viral suppression observed in subjects with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis should be taken into account, considering longer treatment duration to increase the chances of achieving sustained virological response.
