Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence. The recent introduction of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) has resulted in SVR rates of nearly 100% in treated patients. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the outcomes in patients who underwent antiviral therapy and patients without antiviral therapy.Methods:This retrospective study included 220 patients with primary HCV-related HCC who underwent hepatectomy. An SVR was defined as a serum HCV-RNA titer below the detection sensitivity limit at 6 months after the termination of antiviral therapy. Postoperative antiviral therapy was introduced after confirming that there was no early recurrence.Results:Eighty-eight patients received antiviral therapy. Among these, 58 patients (66%) obtained an SVR. With the exception of one patient, all patients who received DAAs obtained an SVR. The overall survival rate of the pre-operative SVR group was significantly better than that of the preoperative untreated group (P = 0.045). Moreover, there was no recurrence at 3 years after surgery in the pre-operative SVR group. The achievement of an SVR was an independent predictor of overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.94, P = 0.011] and recurrence (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.94, P = 0.024).Conclusions:Obtaining an SVR either before or after surgery was associated with the suppression of HCC recurrence after hepatectomy in patients with primary HCV-related HCC.
