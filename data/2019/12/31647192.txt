Aim:To explore the effects of protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B''Alpha (PPP2R3A) on the proliferation and migration of liver cancer cells.Methods:Expression of PPP2R3A in tumor tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients was detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. In two liver cancer cell lines (HepG2 and HuH7), PPP2R3A expression was silenced and then overexpression with PPP2R3A lentiviral vectors, and the effects of PPP2R3A knockdown or overexpression on the proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion of HCC cells were determined in vitro. In a xenograft cancer model in nude mice, the in vivo effects of PPP2R3A knockdown on tumor growth and cancer cell proliferation were evaluated.Results:PPP2R3A expression was found in tumor foci in six of eight HCC samples, at a level higher than that in the adjacent para-tumor tissues. PPP2R3A expression was observed primarily in the cytoplasm of the cancer cells. Knockdown of PPP2R3A resulted in significant inhibition of hepatoma cell proliferation (P Conclusion:PPP2R3A may play a role in liver cancer via the regulation of tumor cell proliferation and invasion.
