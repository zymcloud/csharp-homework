The complexity of TP73 expression and its functionality, as well as the role of TP73 in tumorigenesis, unlike its cousin TP53, which is an established tumor suppressor, have remained elusive to date. In this study, we isolated two stem cell lines (HepCY & HepCO) from normal young and old human liver tissues. We determined TP73 expression in HepCY and HepCO, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cell lines (HepG2, SNU398, SNU449 and SNU475), gastrointestinal cancer (GI) cell lines (Caco2 and HCT116) and normal skin fibroblasts cell line (HS27). Immunohistochemical analyses of TP73 expression was also performed in non-cancerous and adjacent cancerous liver tissues of HCC patients. The results show that TP73 expression is exclusive to the cancer cell lines and not the adjacent normal liver tissues. Moreover, methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing studies revealed that TP73 promoter is activated only in cancer cell lines by DNA methylation. Furthermore, ChIP assay results demonstrated that a chromosomal networking protein (CTCF) and tumor protein p53 (TP53) bind to TP73 promoter and regulate TP73 expression. Our observations demonstrate that a positive correlation in tumorigenesis exists between TP73 expression and DNA methylation in promoter regions of TP73. These findings may prove significant for the development of future diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
