Aim:To evaluate the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, including liver stiffness measured by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and the presence of hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointense nodule without arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), for predicting late recurrence (>1 year) after surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 124 consecutive patients who had undergone surgery for HCC and preoperative MRI. After excluding patients with early recurrence within 1 year after surgery, 89 patients were analysed. Preoperative MRI images were reviewed by a radiologist to record imaging findings, including (1) liver stiffness by MRE, (2) size of the HCCs, (3) number of HCCs, and (4) presence of HBP hypointense nodule without APHE. Pathological findings included tumour grade, vascular/biliary/capsule invasion, and fibrosis stage of the liver. Considering imaging/pathological findings and patients' characteristics as dependent variables, Cox proportional hazards model analysis was performed to identify independent factors associated with late recurrence after surgery.Results:The median follow-up period was 37.3 months. During follow-up, 29 patients (32.5%) developed late recurrence after surgery. In multivariate analysis, underlying liver disease (viral hepatitis) and presence of HBP hypointense nodules without APHE (p=0.010 and 0.033, respectively) were independently associated with disease-free survival (DFS). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with HBP hypointense nodules without APHE had a significantly lower DFS rate than those without the nodule (39.2% versus 74.1% at 3 years after surgery, p=0.008).Conclusion:The presence of HBP hypointense nodules without APHE was an indicator of late recurrence after surgery for HCC.
