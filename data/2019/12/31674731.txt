Background:Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to play important roles in tumorigenesis of various malignant tumors. However, the clinical significance of aberrant lncRNA expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still elusive.Methods:Firstly, a differentially expressed lncRNA CTC-297N7.9 in HCC was detected by analyzing the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Secondly, the expression level of CTC-297N7.9 was examined in four HCC cell lines and 60 pairs of HCC tissues by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay at our center. Thirdly, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of CTC-297N7.9 for HCC. Correlation and survival analysis of HCC patients from the TCGA and our center were also carried out to assess the predictive value of CTC-297N7.9. Finally, survival prognostic models were established combining lncRNA expression and other clinical parameters.Results:The expression of CTC-297N7.9 was downregulated in HCC cell lines and HCC tissues. ROC curve revealed its significant diagnostic value in HCC. CTC-297N7.9 expression correlated with serum alpha-fetal protein (AFP), tumor stage, and tumor differentiation. Survival analysis indicated that overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) are all positively associated with CTC-297N7.9 expression, especially in patients without viral hepatitis or cirrhosis. Cox regression analysis showed that CTC-297N7.9 expression level is an independent prognostic factor for both OS and DFS in HCC patients. Based on the model, CTC-297N7.9 was observed to be negatively correlated to risk score, indicating its role as a protective factor for HCC.Conclusion:Our study demonstrated that the low expression of CTC-297N7.9 is associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients, suggesting its possible role as a potential prognostic marker for HCC.
