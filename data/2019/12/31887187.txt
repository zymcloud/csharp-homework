Progression of chronic HBV to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease (ESLD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more rapid in HIV positive individuals than those with HBV alone; however, the distribution of HBV seromarkers in HIV infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not well described. To address this problem, we assessed the distribution of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) among HIV infected adults on ART in Eastern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2017 to February 2018. Socio-demographic, behavioral and health related factors, and clinical data were collected using questionnaire and checklist. Plasma samples were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs seromarkers using ELISA. Data were double entered into EpiData 3.1, cleaned, exported to and analyzed using STATA 13. Descriptive and logistic regression analysis were conducted and statistical significance was decided at p≤0.05. A total of 901 participants were included and the prevalence of HBsAg was found to be 11.7% [95%CI (10, 14)]. Among the co-infected, 47.6% were also positive for anti-HBc, of which 58% were on an ART containing tenofovir (TDF). Among those screened for the three seromarkers, 38.1% were negative for all and 21% were positive only for anti-HBc (IAHBc). Being single, history of genital discharge and taking ART with TDF combination were significantly associated with HBV co-infection (p≤0.05). There is high burden HBV co-infection among individuals on ART. The unmet need of HBV screening prior to ART initiation leaves many co-infected individuals without appropriate management including therapy, close monitoring or vaccination when indicated, impacting disease prevention.
