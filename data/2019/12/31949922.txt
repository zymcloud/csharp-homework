Background:Elevated plasma fibrinogen has been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. The aim of present study was to investigate the prognostic value of preoperative plasma fibrinogen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:Data were collected retrospectively from 302 HCC patients who received hepatectomy. The association between fibrinogen and clinicopathological characteristics was evaluated. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). And accordingly, the nomograms were constructed.Results:Elevated plasma fibrinogen (>4 g/L) was correlated with larger tumor diameter, the presence of vascular invasion, lower MELD score, higher NLR, advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage and poor-moderate pathological differentiation. On multivariate analysis, the elevated plasma fibrinogen was found independently associated with poor DFS (HR =1.575, P=0.024) and OS (HR =2.051, P=0.025). And the nomograms including fibrinogen were constructed to predict DFS and OS for HCC patients. Both DFS and OS in patients with plasma fibrinogen >4 g/L were significantly lower than those with fibrinogen â‰¤4 g/L (1-, 3-, 5-year DFS: 34.2%, 19.5% and 0.0% vs. 60.4%, 34.2% and 30.2%; 1-, 3-, 5-year OS: 83.4%, 62.7% and 48.8% vs. 95.4%, 84.3% and 75.8%, both P<0.001). Besides, subgroup analyses also showed the prognostic values of fibrinogen in HCC patients with/without cirrhosis or high AFP levels, and in those with single tumor and BCLC 0-A stage.Conclusions:Preoperative elevated plasma fibrinogen was an independent prognostic factor associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients receiving liver resection.
