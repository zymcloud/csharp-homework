Purpose:To investigate the capacity of Superb Microvascular Imaging (SMI) to detect microvascular details and to explore the different SMI features in various focal liver lesions (FLLs) and the correlation between SMI and microvessel density (MVD).Method:Eighty-three liver lesions were enrolled in our study, including 35 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and 48 non-HCCs. All patients underwent color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and SMI examination and were categorized into subgroups according to Adler semiquantitative grading (grade 0-3) or the microvascular morphologic patterns (pattern a-f). The correlation between SMI blood flow signal percentage and MVD was assessed.Results:Compared with CDFI, SMI detected more high-level blood flow signals (grade 2-3) and more hypervascular supply patterns (pattern e-f) in HCCs (p Conclusion:SMI was superior to CDFI in detecting microvascular blood flow signals. More hypervascular supply patterns were depicted in HCC than in non-HCC, suggesting a promising diagnostic value for SMI in the differentiation between HCC and non-HCC. Meanwhile, we were the first to demonstrate that SMI blood flow signal percentage (VI) was correlated with MVD in malignant lesions.
