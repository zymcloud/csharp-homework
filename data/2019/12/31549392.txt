Background:Hong Kong Liver Cancer staging (HKLCS) system lacks external validation.Aims and methods:We conducted a study to validate the prognostic and clinical utility of HKLCS system in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of heterogeneous etiologies treated with hepatic resection with curative intent at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.Results:A total of 144 patients underwent resection for HCC. Our patient cohort was comparable to the original developmental cohort in median age and gender distribution but differed in etiology, liver function status, and tumor venous invasion. On Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis for overall and disease-free survival, we could achieve statistically significant separation of curves in both Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging (BCLCS) and HKLCS staging systems (P Conclusion:The HKLCS system offered higher interstage discrimination power in the patients with HCC treated with resection and may be equally applicable to nonalcoholic steatosis-related chronic liver disease and noncirrhotic patient population.
