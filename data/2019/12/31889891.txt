Background/aims:The dysregulation of circABCB10 may play an critical role in tumor progression. However, its function in liver cancer (HCC) is still unclear. Therefore, this experimental design is based on circABCB10 to explore the pathogenesis of HCC.Methods:The expression of circABCB10 and miR-670-3p in HCC tissues was detected by RT-qPCR. CCK-8, Brdu incorporation, colony formation and transwell assays were used to determine the effect of circABCB10 on HCC cell proliferation and migration. Target gene prediction and screening, luciferase reporter assays were used to validate downstream target genes of circABCB10 and miR-670-3p. HMG20A expression was detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The tumor changes in mice were detected by in nude mice.Results:CircABCB10 was significantly increased in HCC tissues and cell lines, and high CircABCB10 expression was directly associated with low survival in HCC patients. Silencing of circABCB10 inhibited proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, circABCB10 acted as a sponge of miR-670-3p to upregulate HMG20A expression. In addition, overexpression of miR-670-3p or knockdown of HMG20A reversed the carcinogenic effects of circABCB10 in HCC. There was a negative correlation between the expression of circABCB10 and miR-670-3p, and a positive correlation between the expression of circABCB10 and HMG20A in HCC tissues.Conclusion:circABCB10 promoted HCC progression by modulating the miR-670-3p/HMG20A axis, and circABCB10 may be a potential therapeutic target for HCC.Trail registration JL1H384739, registered at Sep 09, 2014.
