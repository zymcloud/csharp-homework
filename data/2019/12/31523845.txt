Non-SMC condensing I complex subunit H (NCAPH) is a member of the Barr protein family and part of the condensin I complex. The upregulation of NCAPH is associated with poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer. However, the relationship between NCAPH and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore NCAPH expression in HCC tissues and to investigate NCAPH functions in HCC cells. In this study, we found that high expression of NCAPH in HCC indicated worse prognosis via bioinformatics analysis. Consistently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays in 20 pairs of HCC specimens and the immunohistochemical analysis of 100 HCC tissues showed the upregulation of NCAPH. We established stable NCAPH-overexpressing and NCAPH knockdown cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays and colony formation assay were performed to analyze cell proliferation. Migration and invasion were analyzed by Transwell assays. Subcutaneous xenograft models were used to explore the role of NCAPH in tumor formation in vivo. Our results showed that NCAPH promoted tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our findings indicate that NCAPH could serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for patients with HCC.
