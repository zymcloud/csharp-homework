Background:Repeat hepatectomy is a feasible treatment modality for intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy of hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the survival benefit remains ill-defined. The objective of the current study was to define long-term, oncologic outcomes after repeat hepatectomy among patients with early and late recurrence.Methods:Patients undergoing curative-intent repeat hepatectomy for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma were identified using a multi-intuitional database. Early and late recurrence was defined by setting 1 year after initial hepatectomy as the cutoff value. Patient clinical characteristics, overall survival, and disease-free survival were compared among patients with early and late recurrence before and after propensity score matching.Results:Among all the patients, 81 had early recurrence and 129 had late recurrence from which 74 matched pairs were included in the propensity score matching analytic cohort. Before propensity score matching, 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival after resection of an early recurrence were 41.7% and 17.9%, respectively, which were worse compared with patients who had resection of a late recurrence (57.0% and 39.4%, both P Conclusion:Repeat hepatectomy for early recurrence was associated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival compared with late recurrence. These data may help inform patients and selection of patients being considered for repeat hepatectomy of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.
