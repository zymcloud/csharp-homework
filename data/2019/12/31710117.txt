The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vaccinia virus expressing IL-37 (VV-IL-37) on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its possible underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we constructed a cancer-targeted vaccinia virus carrying the IL-37 gene knocked in the region of the viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Human HCC cell lines were assayed in vitro for cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Serum level, relative mRNA level and protein level of IL-37 in HCC cell lines SMMC7721 and Bel7402 were tested by ELISA assay, qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The levels of IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α in HCC tumor tissues were also analyzed by ELISA. STAT3 and p-STAT3 expression in tumor tissues were determined by western blot. Our results showed that VV-IL-37 efficiently infected and inhibited HCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion via decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation. In vivo, VV-IL-37 expressed IL-37 at a high level in the transplanted tumor, reduced STAT3 activity, and eventually inhibited tumor growth. In conclusion, we demonstrate that VV-IL-37 promotes antitumor immune responses in HCC.
