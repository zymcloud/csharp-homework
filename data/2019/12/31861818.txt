Liver fibrosis is a regenerative process that occurs after injury. It is characterized by the deposition of connective tissue by specialized fibroblasts and concomitant proliferative responses. Chronic damage that stimulates fibrogenic processes in the long-term may result in the deposition of excess matrix tissue and impairment of liver functions. End-stage fibrosis is referred to as cirrhosis and predisposes strongly to the loss of liver functions (decompensation) and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver fibrosis is a pathology common to a number of different chronic liver diseases, including alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis. The predominant cell type responsible for fibrogenesis is hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In response to inflammatory stimuli or hepatocyte death, HSCs undergo trans-differentiation to myofibroblast-like cells. Recent evidence shows that metabolic alterations in HSCs are important for the trans-differentiation process and thus offer new possibilities for therapeutic interventions. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge of the metabolic changes that occur during HSC activation with a particular focus on the retinol and lipid metabolism, the central carbon metabolism, and associated redox or stress-related signaling pathways.
