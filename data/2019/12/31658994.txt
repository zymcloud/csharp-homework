Ipilimumab is effective for patients with melanoma, but not for those with less immunogenic tumors. We report a phase II trial of ipilimumab with concurrent or sequential stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to metastatic lesions in the liver or lung (NCT02239900). Ipilimumab (every 3 weeks for 4 doses) was given with radiotherapy begun during the first dose (concurrent) or 1 week after the second dose (sequential) and delivered as 50 Gy in 4 fractions or 60 Gy in 10 fractions to metastatic liver or lung lesions. In total, 106 patients received â‰¥1 cycle of ipilimumab with radiation. Median follow-up was 10.5 months. Median progression-free survival time was 2.9 months (95% confidence interval, 2.45-3.40), and median overall survival time was not reached. Rates of clinical benefit of nonirradiated tumor volume were 26% overall, 28% for sequential versus 20% for concurrent therapy (P = 0.250), and 31% for lung versus 14% for liver metastases (P = 0.061). The sequential lung group had the highest rate of clinical benefit at 42%. There were no differences in treatment-related adverse events between groups. Exploratory analysis of nontargeted lesions revealed that lesions receiving low-dose radiation were more likely to respond than those that received no radiation (31% vs. 5%, P = 0.0091). This phase II trial of ipilimumab with stereotactic radiotherapy describes satisfactory outcomes and low toxicities, lending support to further investigation of combined-modality therapy for metastatic cancers.
