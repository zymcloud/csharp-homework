Background:Currently, hepatectomy remains the first-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, surgery for patients with huge (>10 cm) HCCs is controversial. This retrospective study aimed to explore long-term survival after hepatectomy for patients with huge HCC.Methods:The records of 188 patients with pathologically confirmed HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy between 2007 and 2017 were reviewed; patients were divided into three groups according to tumor size: huge (>10 cm; n = 84), large (5-10 cm; n = 51) and small (Results:The median follow-up period was 20 months. Although the prognosis of small HCC was better than that of huge and large HCC, OS and DFS were not significantly different between huge and large HCC (P = 0.099 and P = 0.831, respectively). A family history of HCC, poor Child-Pugh class, vascular invasion, diolame, pathologically positive margins, and operative time â‰¥240 min were identified as independent risk factors for OS and DFS in a multivariate model. Tumor size (>10 cm) had significant effect on OS, and postoperative antiviral therapy and postoperative complications also had significant effects on DFS.Conclusions:Huge HCC is not a contraindication of hepatectomy. Although most of these patients experienced recurrence after surgery, OS and DFS were not significantly different from those of patients with large HCC after resection.
