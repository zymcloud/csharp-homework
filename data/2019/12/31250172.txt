Aim:The purpose of this study was to determine the relative diagnostic benefit of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (CEMDCT) for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Two investigators searched multiple databases from inception to January 8, 2019, for studies comparing Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI with CEMDCT in adults suspected of HCC. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data.Results:Eight studies were included enrolling 498 patients. MRI showed significantly higher sensitivity than CT (0.85 vs. 0.68). There was no significant difference in the specificity of MRI and CT (0.94 vs. 0.93). The negative likelihood ratio and positive likelihood ratio of MRI and CT were not significantly different (0.16 vs. 0.15 and 14.7 vs. 11.2, respectively). The summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) of MRI was higher than that of CT at 0.96 vs. 0.91. In the subgroup analysis with a lesion diameter below 2 cm, the sensitivity of MRI was significantly higher than that of CT (0.79 vs. 0.46).Conclusion:Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI showed higher sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy than CEMDCT especially for hepatocellular carcinoma lesions smaller than 2 cm.Key points:• Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI can detect small lesions of hepatocellular carcinoma. • Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI showed higher sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy than CEMDCT in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. • Eight prospective studies showed that Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI provides greater diagnostic confidence.
