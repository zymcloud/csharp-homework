RNA‑Sequencing and methylation data for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The aberrantly expressed methylation‑driven genes in HCC and normal tissues were identified using the Limma package and the MethylMix algorithm. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and ConsensusPathDB were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and pathway analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to construct a prognostic risk model of HCC. Survival curve and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the clinical utility of the risk model. A total of 238 methylation‑driven genes were successfully identified from cancer and normal tissues. GO enrichment analysis indicated that these genes functioned in the extracellular space, interfering with lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and regulating adaptive immune responses. In total, 14 relevant pathways were identified. The following prognostic risk model was generated: Risk score=CALML3 (degree of methylation) x (‑4.860) + CCNI2 x (2.071) + TNFRSF12A x (‑3.369) + IFITM1 x (1.203) + ENPP7P13 x (‑1.366) + DDT x (2.139) + RASAL2‑AS1 x (‑1.384) + ANKRD22 x (‑3.215). The median risk score (0.970) derived from this model was set as cutoff value for assigning patients to high‑ or low‑risk group. The 5‑year survival rate was 35.8% [95% confidence interval (CI)=27.1‑47.4%] in the high‑risk group and 61.7% (95% CI=51.4‑74.2%) in the low‑risk group (P
