Background:Regorafenib prolonged overall survival (OS) versus placebo in patients with treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in phase III trials. We conducted an observational study of regorafenib for patients with mCRC in real-world clinical practice.Methods:The international, prospective, CORRELATE study recruited patients with mCRC previously treated with approved therapies, for whom the decision to treat with regorafenib was made by the treating physician according to the local health authority approved label. The primary objective was safety, assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03).Results:A total of 1037 patients were treated. The median age was 65 years (range: 24-93); 87% of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, 56% of patients had KRAS, 7% had NRAS and 4% had BRAF mutations. The initial regorafenib dose was 160 mg/day in 57% of patients. The most common grade III or IV drug-related TEAEs were fatigue (9%), hand-foot skin reaction (7%) and hypertension (6%). Drug-related grade V (fatal) TEAEs occurred in 1% of patients. Dose reductions for drug-related TEAEs occurred in 24% of patients. Median OS was 7.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.2-8.3), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (95% CI: 2.8-3.0).Conclusions:In this real-world, observational study of patients with mCRC, the regorafenib toxicity profile was similar to that reported in phase III trials. The starting dose for almost half of patients was less than the approved 160-mg dose, and the median OS and PFS were in the range observed in phase III trials.Trial registration:NCT02042144.
