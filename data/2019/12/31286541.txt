Background and objectives:Limited data have been used to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of percutaneous laser ablation (PLA) (a modality that has been proven to be a safe method for tumors in high-risk locations) for hepatic tumors in the space between the portal vein and inferior vena cava (IVC). The goal of this study was to investigate the characteristics and therapeutic effectiveness of ultrasound-guided PLA of hepatic tumors in the portacaval space.Study design/materials and methods:Ten patients, who had hepatic tumors in the portacaval space (defined as tumors located in the space formed by the hepatic portal vein and IVC less than 5 mm from the margins of both vessels), receiving ultrasound-guided PLA between January 2016 and June 2017 were analyzed. Tumors in the type I portacaval space were enclosed on three sides of major vessels, and tumors in the type II portacaval space were enclosed on two sides of major vessels. The technical success, treatment response, complete tumor ablation (CTA), local tumor progression (LTP), and distant tumor recurrence (DTR) were assessed and recorded at the follow-up.Results:The mean tumor diameter was 1.8 ± 0.4 cm. Technical success and initial CTA were achieved in all 10 patients without major complications. The 6-month and 12-month LTP rates were 0% and 10%, respectively. The DTR rate was 20% at both the 6- and 12-month follow-ups.Conclusions:The preliminary results showed that ultrasound-guided PLA was feasible and safe for tumors in the portacaval space, and further studies on larger populations with a longer follow-up are needed to delineate the use of PLA and evaluate its therapeutic efficacy.
