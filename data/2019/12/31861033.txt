To generate a nomogram to predict posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF), we attempted to elucidate salient risk factors in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).We performed a retrospective review of 665 patients with HCC who received hepatectomy in 2 academic institutions in China. Independent risk factors for PHLF were identified from putative demographic, intrinsic, biochemical, surgery-related, and volumetric data. A predictive nomogram was formulated based on relevant risk factors, and we compared this with existing models.We identified clinical signs of portal hypertension (P = .023), serum total bilirubin (P = .001), serum creatinine (P = .039), and intraoperative hemorrhage (P = .015) as being important risk factors in predicting PHLF. The nomogram had a C-index of 0.906 for the externally validated data. The nomogram displayed better predictive value than 2 of the other most cited models (C-indices of 0.641 and 0.616, respectively) in the current cohort. Additionally, we were able to patients into low- (
