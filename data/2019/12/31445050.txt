Background:The lung is the most common site of extrahepatic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors for pulmonary metastasectomy of HCC.Methods:One hundred three patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for HCC between January 2005 and December 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Patient demographic data and characteristics of the primary tumors and pulmonary metastasis were investigated to identify factors significantly correlated with prognosis.Results:Of 103 patients, 75 (72.8%) had 1 site pulmonary metastasis, 22 (21.4%) had 2, and 6 (5.8%) had 3 or more. Liver recurrence at the time of pulmonary metastasectomy was noted in 34 patients. The estimated 5-year overall survival rate was 38.5% after pulmonary metastasectomy. Univariate prognostic analysis showed that liver recurrence at the time of pulmonary metastasectomy, extent of resection, laterality of pulmonary metastasis, tumor location, number of metastatic sites, and metastatic tumor size were significantly associated with favorable overall survival after pulmonary metastasectomy. Multivariate analysis revealed that liver recurrence at the time of pulmonary metastasectomy and the number of metastatic sites were independent prognostic factors. Subgroup analysis with a combination of these 2 independent prognostic factors revealed 5-year overall survival rates for patients with 0, 1, and 2 risk factors of 58.5%, 23.8%, and 0.0%, respectively.Conclusions:Pulmonary metastasectomy is a safe and effective treatment for well-selected patients with pulmonary metastasis of HCC. Liver recurrence at the time of pulmonary metastasectomy and the number of metastatic sites were identified as independent prognostic factors. The number of risk factors significantly influenced patient survival.
