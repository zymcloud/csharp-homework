Recently, prediction of lncRNA-disease associations has attracted more and more attentions. Various computational models have been proposed; however, there is still room to improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a kernel fusion method with different types of similarities for the lncRNAs and diseases. The expression similarity and cosine similarity are used for lncRNAs, and the semantic similarity and cosine similarity are used for the diseases. To eliminate the noise effect, a neighbor constraint is enforced to refine all the similarity matrices before fusion. Experimental results show that the proposed similarity kernel fusion (SKF)-LDA method has the superiority performance in terms of AUC values and other measurements. In the schemes of LOOCV and 5-fold CV, AUC values of SKF-LDA achieve 0.9049 and 0.8743Â±0.0050 respectively. In addition, the conducted case studies of three diseases (hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer) show that SKF-LDA can predict related lncRNAs accurately.
