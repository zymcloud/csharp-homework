The lncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) is a 1.4 kb long transcript which has been firstly recognized in human bladder cancer cell line. Subsequent studies revealed its over-expression in a wide array of human cancer cell lines and patients' samples. In addition to conferring malignant phenotype to cells, it enhances resistance to conventional anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, transcript levels of this lncRNA have been regarded as diagnostic markers in several cancer types including gastric, bladder and liver cancers. The underlying mechanism of its participation in carcinogenesis has been identified in some cancer types. Sponging tumor suppressor miRNAs, interacting with cancer-promoting signaling pathways and enhancing cell cycle progression are among these mechanisms. Although few studies have shown anti-carcinogenic properties for this lncRNA, the bulk of evidence supports its oncogenic roles. In the current study, we have reviewed the current literature on the role of UCA1 in the carcinogenic process based on the results of in vitro studies, investigations in animal models and assessment of UCA1 expression in clinical samples.
