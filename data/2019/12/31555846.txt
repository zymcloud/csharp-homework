Purpose:To assess guideline compliance and quality of hepatocellular carcinoma, (HCC) diagnostic imaging within community hospitals (CH) and their Tertiary referral center (TRC) in a moderately high incidence region.Methods:Initial diagnostic workup CT/MRI scans of 251 patients (122 CH, 112 TRC, 17 Non-TRC academic) with HCC over a 15-month period were assessed for Liver reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) guideline compliance. 269 scans (182 CT, 87 MRI) were qualitatively evaluated by 2 independent blinded radiologists for arterial timing, overall image quality, noise and sharpness, with quantification of interobserver variability. The contrast enhancement ratio (CER) for the largest HCC on each scan was calculated using pre- and post-contrast images.Results:103/104 (99%) of TRC and 44/78 (56%) of CH CTs adhered to LI-RADS imaging guidelines (P Conclusions:Community hospital HCC diagnostic scans significantly lag in critical quality parameters of tumor enhancement, arterial phase timing, perceived image quality, and LI-RADS CT technique compliance compared to a TRC.
