In this study, three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels were used for human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells culture systems in vitro and establishment of an in vivo xenografted tumor model. Based on our previous work on the biotin-conjugated pullulan acetate nanoparticles (Bio-PA NPs) as anticancer drug carriers, we further studied the anti-tumor effect of the NPs in two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell culture system. When embedded in 3D hydrogels, HepG2 cells formed tumor spheroids and the cytoplasmic actin microfilamentrates were rearranged over a period of 7 days. In vitro cytotoxicity results indicated that HepG2 cells in 3D hydrogels were more resistant to Bio-PA NPs treatments compared to the 2D system. The tumor formation rate of in vivo xenografted tumor model using 3D culture systems method was 98.2%, which was significantly higher than that using of 2D cultured cells (76.4%). Then we injected the 3D HepG2 cells systems in the right anterior axillary of female Balb/c nude mice, and evaluate the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of Bio-PA NPs. In summary, these results suggested that HepG2 cells in 3D hydrogel system has shown the potential to provide an in vitro and in vivo model and for the evaluation of Bio-PA NPs.
