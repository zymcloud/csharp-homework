Background:Equitable deceased donor liver allocation and distribution has remained a heated topic in transplant medicine. Despite the establishment of numerous policies, mixed reports regarding organ allocation persist.Methods:Patient data was obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing liver transplant database between January 2016 and September 2017. A total of 20,190 patients were included in the analysis. Of this number, 8790 transplanted patients had a median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 25 (17-33), after a wait time of 129 (32-273) days. Patients were grouped into low MELD and high MELD regions using a score 25 as the cutoff.Results:Significant differences were noted between low and high MELD regions in ethnicity (white 77.4% vs 60.4%, Hispanic 8.1% vs 24.5%; P Conclusions:These results highlight some of the existing disparities in the recently updated allocation and distribution policy of deceased donor livers. Our findings are consistent with previous work and support the liver distribution policy revision.
