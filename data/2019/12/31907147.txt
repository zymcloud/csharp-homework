Objective:To investigate the regulatory role of Musashi-1 (MSI1) in the proliferation and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.Methods:We examined the expression of MSI1 in HCC and paired adjacent tissues from 24 patients using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. A MSI1-expressing vector was constructed and stably transfected into HepG2 cells, and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that targeted MSI1 mRNA were ligated into the vector and stably transfected in Huh7 cells. The effects of MSI1 overexpression and silencing on the proliferation, viability and cell cycle of HepG2 cells were investigated using flow cytometry or MTT assay. The expressions of PCNA, cyclin D1, APC and β-catenin in the HCC cells were detected with Western blotting.Results:MSI1 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues as compared with that in the adjacent tissues. Overexpression of MSI1 in HepG2 cells resulted in significantly enhanced cell growth (P < 0.01) and significantly reduced G0/G1 phase cells from (58.42±3.18)% to (40.67±1.22)% and increased S phase cells from (28.51± 1.93)% to (40.06±1.92)% (P < 0.01), causing also increases in the expressions of PCNA and Cyclin D1. Knockdown of MSI1 in Huh7 cells obviously inhibited the cell growth and caused cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase (P < 0.01) with reduced protein expressions of PCNA and cyclin D1. Overexpression of MSI1 in HepG2 cells also down-regulated the expression of APC and up-regulated the expression of β-catenin protein, while MSI1 knockdown caused reverse changes in Huh7 cells.Conclusions:MSI1 promotes the progression of HCC through positive modulation of cell growth and cell cycle via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
