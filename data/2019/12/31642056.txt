Background:Hepatitis C (HCV) is the primary etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the US multidisciplinary disease management teams (DMT) that optimize oncologic care. The impact of DMT for HCC in safety-net hospitals is unknown.Methods:Patients diagnosed with HCC from 2009 to 2016 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) were included. The primary aim was to evaluate referrals to care, receipt of therapy, and overall survival (OS) after DMT formation. Screening patterns of HCV patients for HCC were also examined.Results:Of 204 HCC patients, median age was 58 years, with 81% male, 83% black. 46% presented with stage 4 disease, 53% had treatment with median OS 9.8 months. DMT formation was associated with increased referrals to surgery (49% vs 30%; P = .02), liver-directed therapy (58% vs 31%; P = .001), and radiation (13% vs 3%; P = .019). Patients were also more likely to get treatment (59% vs 41%; P = .026), with improved median OS (30.7 vs 4.9 months; P Conclusion:Implementation of a DMT at GMH is associated with increased HCC patients referred for/receiving treatment, as well as improved survival. Few patients with HCV at risk for HCC are screened, despite DMT. Future efforts should aim to establish screening programs for HCV patients at risk for HCC.
