Long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important in the occurrence and development of various cancers. They have been considered to participate in many processes of diseases. In this study, we aimed at investigating expression level and clinical significance of lncRNA X91348 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of X91348 in tissue and serum samples from patients with HCC and from healthy people was detected through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). X91348 expression was decreased in patients with HCC compared with healthy controls no matter in tissue or serum samples. The relationship between X91348 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics was analysed. The result demonstrated that tumour size, HBsAg and Child-Pugh were vital influencing factors for X91348 expression, which revealed X91348 may be involved in the progress of HCC. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate overall survival of patients with different expressions of X91348. Finally, prognostic value of X91348 in HCC was assessed via cox regression analysis. X91348 was proved to be closely related to the prognosis of HCC. Taken together, the down-regulation of X91348 could be an independent diagnostic and prognostic indicator for HCC.
