Dimethoxycurcumin (DiMC), a synthetic analog of curcumin, was shown to have antiproliferative activity in human tumor cell lines. Therefore, we investigated its cytotoxic, antiproliferative, genotoxic, and apoptotic effect and correlated these evaluations with the expression of transcripts and proteins in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2/C3A). Treatment with DiMC resulted in increased CYP2E1, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 transcripts levels and was cytotoxic (≥10 μM). DiMC caused mitotic arrest by inducing monopolar spindle formation and was genotoxic increasing expression of the CDKN1A, GADD45A and PARP1 gene, key effectors in the cell cycle arrest and DNA repair pathways, respectively. This genotoxicity was caused by generation of reactive oxygen species and reduction of antioxidant proteins levels. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in important proteins involved in DNA repair. In addition to the observed apoptotic morphology and the presence of annexin labeling, we observed increased expression of BAK1 and CASP7 genes and caspase 3/7 protein activity, showing that these effects caused apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway in HepG2/C3A cells. Our results indicate that DiMC modulates important molecular targets leading to cell death even in metabolic competent cells models has considerable potential in anticancer therapy.
