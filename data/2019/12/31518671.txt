The study focused on protective potential of phytochemicals applicable in prevention and health protection is of great importance. Various structures of these compounds and a wide range of their biological activities have inspired organic chemists to sythesize their effective analogues in order to further increase their efficacy. The aims of our study were (i) to synthesize phenylethanoid glycopyranosides: salidroside (SALI - tyrosol β-d-glucopyranoside), tyrosol β-d-galactopyranoside (TYBGAL), tyrosol α-d-galactopyranoside (TYAGAL), tyrosol α-d-mannopyranoside (TYAMAN), hydroxytyrosol α-d-mannopyranoside (HOTAMA), homosyringyl β-d-glucopyranoside (HSYGLU), hydroxytyrosol β-d-xylopyranoside (HOTXYL) and hydroxysalidroside (HOSALI); (ii) to determine their antioxidant capacities (cell-free approaches); (iii) to evaluate their cytotoxicity (MTT test), protectivity against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; comet assay) and effect on the intracellular glutathione level (iGSH; flow cytometry) in experimental system utilizing human hepatoma HepG2 cells. HOSALI, HOTAMA, HOTXYL and HSYGLU manifested the highest antioxidant capacity in cell-free assays and they were most active in protection of HepG2 cells against H2O2. On the other hand, pre-treatment of HepG2 cells with SALI had protective effects even though SALI displayed almost no activity in cell-free assays. Differences in the efficacy of the analogues revealed that structures of their molecules in terms of aglycone combined with sugar moiety affect their activities.
