Background and aims:Many studies have investigated the association between the level of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and clinical features and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the results remain controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to summarize all available data and estimate the relationship.Methods:A comprehensive literature review was carried out using Medline, Embase and Web of Science database through December 2018 to identify relevant studies. The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were utilized for evaluating continuous outcomes and survival analysis, respectively. All statistical analyses were performed by STATA 14.0 software.Results:A total of 13 studies with 1002 HCC patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the proportion of MDSCs in HCC patients was higher than that in healthy controls (SMD = 4.49, 95% CI = 2.53-6.46, PConclusion:The results of this systematic review suggest that elevated MDSCs level appears to be associated with an increased risk for disease progression and poor prognosis for HCC.
