Background:The single-port laparoscopic technique has been widely applied in abdominal surgery. We introduce a single-port laparoscopic hepatectomy for liver tumor in a single center.Materials and methods:This study included 37 patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic liver resection for liver tumor in the segments II, III, IV, and V between October 2017 and November 2018. Their perioperative course and operative techniques were retrospectively evaluated.Results:All patients underwent single-port laparoscopic hepatectomy for liver tumor. None of the cases was converted to open surgery. The median procedure duration was 100 minutes (39 to 240 min), and the median blood loss volume was 50 mL (30 to 300 mL). No postoperative complications >3 grades were observed during the perioperative period. The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (3 to 7 d).Conclusions:Single-port laparoscopic hepatectomy is a safe, feasible, and minimal incision, especially for tumors in the left lobe.
