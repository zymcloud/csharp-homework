Primary liver cancer (PLC) is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related death. The high mortality rates arise from late diagnosis and the limited accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The liver is a major regulator, orchestrating the clearance of toxins, balancing glucose, lipid and amino acid uptake, managing whole-body metabolism and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Tumour onset and progression is frequently accompanied by rearrangements of metabolic pathways, leading to dysregulation of metabolism. The limitation of current therapies targeting PLCs, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, points towards the importance of deciphering this metabolic complexity. In this Review, we discuss the role of metabolic liver disruptions and the implications of these processes in PLCs, emphasizing their clinical relevance and value in early diagnosis and prognosis and as putative therapeutic targets. We also describe system biology approaches able to reconstruct the metabolic complexity of liver diseases. We also discuss whether metabolic rearrangements are a cause or consequence of PLCs, emphasizing the opportunity to clinically exploit the rewired metabolism. In line with this idea, we discuss circulating metabolites as promising biomarkers for PLCs.
