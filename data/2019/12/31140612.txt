Previous studies have revealed that miR-186 is involved in the pathogenesis of many malignancies. However, the role of miR-186 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) carcinogenesis and its detailed mechanism are poorly understood. This study was to investigate the function of miR-186 in modulating HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion. We found that miR-186 was decreased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Loss-of-function experiments showed that reduction of miR-186 dramatically enhanced tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Besides, miR-186 also participated in the modulation of the cell cycle. In addition, luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analysis showed that MCRS1 was a novel target of miR-186 in HCC cells. Notably, upregulation of miR-186 suppressed the nuclear β-catenin accumulation and blocked the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC cells. Forced MCRS1 expression abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-186 on cell growth, metastasis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC cells. Our findings may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of HCC and miR-186/ MCRS1 might function as new therapeutic targets for HCC.
