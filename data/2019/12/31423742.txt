Syzygium cumini (Myrtaceae) is commonly called as Jamun or Jambolan. It has antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antioxidant activities. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent and deadliest cancers worldwide. We investigated the cytotoxic potentials of S. cumini methanolic seed kernel extract against human hepatoma HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were treated with 10, 20, and 40 μg/mL of seed kernel extract for 24 hours and cytotoxic analysis was performed by MTT assay. S. cumini induced apoptosis related morphological changes in HepG2 cells were analyzed by annexin V and propidium iodide double staining. Nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation were analyzed by Hoechst nuclear staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was investigated by 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) staining. Protein expressions of hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α (HFN-1α) was performed using western blotting. S. cumini treatments caused a significant and a concentration-dependent increase in the cytotoxicity of HepG2 cells. S. cumini treatments increased the percentage of cells in an early and late apoptosis stage. This treatment also caused chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Further, S. cumini treatments decreased MMP and also caused a significant downregulation of HFN-1α protein expression. The present study demonstrated that S. cumini seed extract induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells through decrease in MMP and downregulation of HFN-1α.
