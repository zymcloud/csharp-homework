Objective:To qualitatively and quantitatively compare the contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one-stop shop of abdominal imaging with Gadobutrol and Gd-DTPA at equimolar doses of gadolinium.Materials and methods:This was a prospective designed, multiple center, intraindividual comparison study. All volunteers underwent Gadobutrol- and Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRA and MRI in one-stop shop. Qualitative analysis for large vessels and small vessels was performed by a three-point scale, while for minute small vessels, by a five-point scale. Quantitative analysis was performed for large vessels by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Visceral organ enhancements on the equilibrium phase were also analyzed. Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank tests were used to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative results.Results:40 volunteers were enrolled. Qualitative analyses results for large vessels, small vessels, and minute small vessels of Gadobutrol and Gd-DTPA were 20.98 ± 2.11, 6.03 ± 1.03, and 3.41 ± 1.18 and 20.01 ± 2.18, 5.28 ± 1.67, and 2.61 ± 1.40, respectively. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed Gadobutrol-enhanced MRA was superior to that of Gd-DTPA significantly for small vessels (p=0.028) and minute small vessels (p=0.007). For quantitative analysis of large vessels, no statistic difference was found. Gadobutrol-enhanced MRI had higher CNR of the liver (p=0.003), spleen (p=0.001), and pancreas (p=0.001) and higher SNR of spleen (p=0.009) than those of Gd-DTPA statistically.Conclusion:Our study proved Gadobutrol was superior to Gd-DTPA in qualitative analysis of CE-MRA and quantitative analysis of visceral organ enhancement on CE-MRI in abdomen of healthy volunteers. Gadobutrol may be more suitable for abdominal one-stop examination for CE-MRA and CE-MRI.
