Background and aim:The NIACE score provides prognostic values for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in European studies. We aim to evaluate the prognostic value of the NIACE score in Asian patients.Methods:Patients with HCC were retrospectively enrolled from a tertiary medical center in Taiwan during 2009-2014, and their clinical information were collected. The NIACE score was calculated according to the Nodular numbers, tumor Infiltration, Alpha-fetoprotein level, Child-Pugh score, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score. The prognostic values of NIACE score for overall survival according to individual treatment and the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging were analyzed.Results:A total of 468 patients were included with a median follow-up of 30 months. A greater NIACE score correlated with lower median survival and higher BCLC staging. Regardless of treatment modalities, NIACE scores (0, 1-1.5, 2.5-3, and 4-7) significantly predicted survival between groups (log-rank P Conclusions:The NIACE score helps refine differential prognosis among BCLC A, B, and C subgroups of Asian patients with HCC, especially in those receiving transarterial chemoembolization.
