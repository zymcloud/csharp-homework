A 67-year-old woman with a history of esophageal cancer(poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, pStageâ…¡) was diagnosed with 2 liver tumors by regular checkup CT 10 years after her operation. We also observed elevated levels of tumor marker CEA. The tumors were suspected to be metastatic although no primary lesion was identified. We performed partial hepatectomy for diagnostic therapy. The pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma suggestive of metastatic tumors but the primary lesion remained unknown. Tumor marker levels were elevated 2 months after the operation and we detected a pancreatic tumor, multiple liver tumors, peritoneal dissemination, and para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Therefore, our clinical diagnosis was multiple metastases with primary pancreatic cancer and chemotherapy was performed. We conducted a thorough review of the diagnostic images and repeated the pathological analysis. Immunobiological staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A, CD56, and Ki-67. We eventually diagnosed the liver tumors as metastasis from the pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma(Grade 3).
