Background:Portal hypertension (PH), which is closely associated with the severity of liver cirrhosis, has been suggested as a contraindication of liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to explore the role of a potential player, histologic severity of liver cirrhosis, in affecting surgical outcomes of the patients with both HCC and PH.Methods:A total of 374 HCC patients with PH underwent resection for HCC were retrospectively reviewed. By using the Laennec staging system, the patients were divided into two groups: the mild-moderate cirrhosis (MMC) group and the severe cirrhosis (SC) group. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted at a 1:1 ratio between the two groups, and 89 patients were matched for each group. Short-term and long-term outcomes were compared between two groups before and after PSM.Results:The overall morbidity and 30-days mortality were significantly higher in the SC group than the MCC group (52.9% vs. 30.1%, P Conclusions:Histologic severity of liver cirrhosis determines the surgical outcomes of patients with both HCC and PH, and PH is not an absolute contraindication of liver resection.
