Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the fastest-growing indication for the liver transplant and a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients listed for liver transplantation in the USA. Post-transplant nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are frequent complications of liver transplantation. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis poses a significant challenge in both pre- and post-transplant period due to its association with metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. While optimal therapy is not yet available in the post-liver transplant setting, lifestyle interventions continue to remain as the mainstay of therapy for post-transplant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Early recognition with protocol biopsies and noninvasive modalities, along with modification of known risk factors, are the most effective methods to curtail the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the absence of FDA-approved pharmacologic therapy.
