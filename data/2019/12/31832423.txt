Background:Gallbladder squamous cell carcinoma (GBSCC) is a rare subtype of malignancy and accounts for only 2%-3% of gallbladder malignancies. Due to its rapid development, most patients with GBSCC initially present with an advanced stage of the disease and hence a poor prognosis. The clinicopathological and biological features of SCC remain to be fully elucidated, owing to its uncommon occurrence. The majority of currently available data only described individual case reports or series analyses of trivial cases.Case summary:A 64-year-old man was admitted for progressively poor abdominal distension and pain. Liver computed tomography (CT) showed infiltration of gallbladder carcinoma into the adjacent liver, and enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The patient underwent radical cholecystectomy. Part of the mass was grey and soft, and the neoplastic section showed a purulent-necrotic lesion. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed a moderately differentiated SCC. Immunohistochemical studies showed strong staining of the tumor for AE1/3 and CK5/6. Staining for CK19, CK7, and CAM5.2 was positive in the cytoplasm. Systemic chemotherapy was not administered because of the patient's poor physical condition. After five months, CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed multiple metastases in the liver and abdominal cavity.Conclusion:Squamous components of GBSCC may explain the complex biological behavior, and CD109 may be involved in the pathogenesis.
