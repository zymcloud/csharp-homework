Objective:While circulating nucleosome levels are high in obese mouse models, it is unknown where these nucleosomes originate from and whether they are a marker of cardio-metabolic health in humans. Here, we aimed to determine whether an association exists between circulating nucleosomes and the risk of developing obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and/or a dysfunctional cardiovascular performance.Methods:We randomly selected 120 participants of the Kardiovize Brno 2030 study across three BMI strata: BMI 18-25, 25-30, and > 30. We assessed the association between circulating nucleosome levels and the risk of obesity, MetS, and poor cardiovascular health. We then cultured human neutrophils, adipocytes, and hepatoma cells to study nucleosome origins in a fat-rich environment.Results:Circulating nucleosome levels positively correlated with BMI (R = 0.602, p < 0.05), fatty liver index (R = 0.622, p < 0.05), left ventricular mass (R = 0.457, p < 0.05), and associated with MetS (p < 0.001) and poor cardiovascular health (p < 0.001). Incubating neutrophils with 1-10 Î¼M free fatty acids triggered nucleosome production without concomitant cell death. Nucleosomes were not produced during pre-adipocyte differentiation or upon incubation of hepatic cells with palmitic acid.Conclusions:Neutrophils are a bona fide source of circulating nucleosomes in an obesogenic environment and in overweight/obese patients. High nucleosome levels are associated with MetS and cardiovascular performance, and might represent novel candidate biomarkers for cardio-metabolic health.
