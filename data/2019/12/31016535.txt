Apoptosis and autophagy are distinct cellular processes that can be highly interconnected. The cross talk between the two processes is indispensable in determining the overall cell fate. Although the apoptosis-promoting effect of caspases has been demonstrated, the roles of autophagy-related proteins and even autophagy itself in regulating apoptosis remain poorly understood. In our present study, we found that downregulation of ubiquitin E3 ligase ASB3 led to enhanced mitochondrial apoptosis as well as autophagy, which synergistically promoted cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We observed the activation of caspase-8 and decrease of autophagy protein Beclin1 in apoptotic cells that were depleted of ASB3. Beclin1 was mainly cleaved by activated caspase-8 and active Beclin1 initiated mitochondrial apoptosis via locating its C-terminal fragment to mitochondria. In addition, knocking down of Beclin1 markedly blocked the apoptosis, indicating its essential role in the process. Notably, our study indicated that enhanced autophagy level might be involved in the activation of caspase-8 and promote the apoptosis. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ASB3 can regulate mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by controlling caspase-8 mediated cleavage of Beclin1 in HCC. Therefore, ASB3 may potentially serve as a novel target for HCC therapy, especially when combined with autophagy agonist.
