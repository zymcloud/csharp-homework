Background:Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients remains a challenge, especially in China. We sought to create an online calculator of serum biomarkers to detect HCC among patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:Participants with HBV-HCC, CHB, HBV-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC), benign hepatic tumors, and healthy controls (HCs) were recruited at 11 Chinese hospitals. Potential serum HCC biomarkers, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), α-fetoprotein (AFP), lens culinaris agglutinin A-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3) and α-l-fucosidase (AFU) were evaluated in the pilot cohort. The calculator was built in the training cohort via logistic regression model and validated in the validation cohort.Results:In the pilot study, PIVKA-II and AFP showed better diagnostic sensitivity and specificity compared with AFP-L3 and AFU and were chosen for further study. A combination of PIVKA-II and AFP demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy in differentiating patients with HBV-HCC from patients with CHB or HBV-LC than AFP or PIVKA-II alone [area under the curve (AUC), 0.922 (95% CI, 0.908-0.935), sensitivity 88.3% and specificity 85.1% for the training cohort; 0.902 (95% CI, 0.875-0.929), 87.8%, and 81.0%, respectively, for the validation cohort]. The nomogram including AFP, PIVKA-II, age, and sex performed well in predicting HBV-HCC with good calibration and discrimination [AUC, 0.941 (95% CI, 0.929-0.952)] and was validated in the validation cohort [AUC, 0.931 (95% CI, 0.909-0.953)].Conclusions:Our results demonstrated that a web-based calculator including age, sex, AFP, and PIVKA-II accurately predicted the presence of HCC in patients with CHB.Clinicaltrialsgov identifier:NCT03047603.
