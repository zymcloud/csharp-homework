Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. Newer research has established that liver fibrosis is a dynamic process and that early cirrhosis may be reversible. Only one in three people with cirrhosis knows they have it. Most patients with cirrhosis remain asymptomatic until the onset of decompensation. When clinical signs, symptoms, or abnormal liver function tests are discovered, further evaluation should be pursued promptly. The most common causes of cirrhosis are viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Initial workup includes viral hepatitis serologies, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and abdominal ultrasonography as well as complete blood count, liver function tests, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, if not already ordered. Additional testing is based on demographics and risk factors. Common serum and ultrasound-based screening tests to assess fibrosis include the aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index score, Fibrosis 4 score, FibroTest/FibroSure, nonalcoholic fatty liver fibrosis score, standard ultrasonography, and transient elastography. Generally, noninvasive tests are most useful in identifying patients with no to minimal fibrosis or advanced fibrosis. Chronic liver disease management includes directed counseling, laboratory testing, and ultrasound monitoring. Treatment goals are preventing cirrhosis, decompensation, and death. Varices are monitored with endoscopy and often require prophylaxis with nonselective beta blockers. Ascites treatment includes diuresis, salt restriction, and antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, when indicated. Hepatic encephalopathy is managed with lifestyle and nutritional modifications and, as needed, with lactulose and rifaximin. Hepatocellular carcinoma screening includes ultrasound screening every six months for patients with cirrhosis.
