Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was accompanied by high incidence of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Apoptosis is a vital biological process playing a critical role in cancer. Besides, toll like receptors were reported to regulator the innate immune response against cancer development. Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) derived from marine bacteria were reported to have a potential biological importance. This work aimed to elucidate the antitumor effects of newly isolated EPSs against HepG2 cells. Moreover, their effects on some apoptotic markers and TLRs were followed. Isolated EPSs were tested for their cytotoxic effects in a previous study and the most promising; MSA1, E4, MGA2, SGA3, and NRC7 EPSs were subjected to molecular analysis to investigate their pro-apoptotic effects, in addition to their effects on TLR2 and TLR-9 using quantitative real time RT-PCR. And the most cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic EPS; MSA1 were subjected to antibody array analysis to investigate a panel of 43 apoptotic proteins. All isolated EPSs produced a positive role in regulating the apoptotic gene and increasing the TLRs expression in different manners. However, the most promising EPS was MSA1. It showed pro-apoptotic effects on gene and protein levels, besides its up-regulation of TLRs.
