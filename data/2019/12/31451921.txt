Background:The role of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for lesions located in posterosuperior (PS) segments remains a matter of development to be further assessed. This systematic review aims to compare the short-term and oncological outcomes between laparoscopic and open liver resection (OLR) in PS lesions.Methods:EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched from date of inception to June 2019. This meta-analysis was performed using the STATA 12.0 statistical software. Standardized mean differences (SMDs), odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for continuous variables, dichotomous variables and long-term variables, respectively, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:A total of 788 patients from eight studies were identified for the final analysis, with 371 patients in the LLR group and 417 in the OLR group. Although the operation time (SMD 0.22; 95% CI 0.08-0.36; P = 0.003) was longer whereas overall complication rate (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.36-0.70; P Conclusion:LLR is technically feasible and safe without compromising long-term oncological outcomes for selected patients with lesions in the PS segments of the liver.
