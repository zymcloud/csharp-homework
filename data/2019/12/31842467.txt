The interaction of leptin with its hepatic longest receptor (OBRb) promotes the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), protecting the liver from lipid accumulation. However, leptin signalling is disrupted in hepatic steatosis, causing leptin resistance. One promising strategy to combat this problem is the use of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols. Since resveratrol (RSV) is a modulator of lipid homeostasis in the liver, we investigated whether treatment with different doses of RSV restores appropriate leptin action and fat accumulation in palmitate-induced steatotic human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Both RSV metabolism and the expression of molecules implicated in leptin signalling were analysed. RSV at a 10 Î¼M concentration was entirely metabolized to resveratrol-3-sulfate after 24 and counteracted leptin resistance by increasing the protein levels of OBRb. In addition, RSV downregulated the expression of lipogenic genes including fatty acid synthase (Fas) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (Scd1) without any significant change in Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) enzymatic activity. These results demonstrate that RSV restored leptin sensitivity in a cellular model of hepatic steatosis in a SIRT1-independent manner.
