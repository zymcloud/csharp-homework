Purpose:Tumor necrosis factor-α has been suggested to play a crucial role in the development andprogression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous reports have indicated that rs361525 and rs1800629 might be risk factors for various cancers. Increasing studies have been conducted on the association of these two SNPs with HCC risk but the results remain inconclusive.Methods:In order to detect association between TNF- α and HCC, a meta-analysis was performed. Five studies with 541 cases and 795 controls were used for rs361525, while six studies including 925 cases and 1307 controls were collected for investigating rs1800629. The grouping of countries from data were obtained was done by Principal Coordinate Analysis plot (PCA). Moreover, association between geographical area and grouping of genotypes was determined by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA).Results:Our meta-analysis showed that rs361525 and rs1800629 were not significantly associated with the risk of HCC. CCA analysis illustrated that there was not any correlation between genotype distribution and geographical distance for rs1800629 but there was significant correlation between genotype distribution and geographical features for rs361525. PCA analysis for both SNPs showed India and Korea were placed near each other and also China and Brazil were in same part of PCA plot.Conclusion:To sum up, this meta-analysis suggests that the rs361525 and rs1800629 are not associated with HCC development while geographical distance effect on rs361525 genetic inheritance but not effect on rs1800629. However, it is necessary to conduct further studies with larger sample. Moreover, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions should also be considered.
