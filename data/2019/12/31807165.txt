Spontaneous rupture is one of the complications of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with a high mortality rate. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been widely used in patients with ruptured liver tumors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the benefits and safety of conventional TACE and the disease prognosis following TACE and surgery with regard to the progression of spontaneously ruptured HCC. The clinical data of 70 patients diagnosed with spontaneous rupture of HCC were retrospectively reviewed. The majority of adverse reactions that occurred following treatment were Grade 2 or below. Grade 3/4 events occurred in 20 patients (14.3%), which included gastrointestinal hemorrhage, cardiac failure, pulmonary embolism, shock and recurrent tumor rupture. All of these patients recovered and were discharged following symptomatic and supportive treatment, with the exception of two cases of severe hemorrhagic shock and hepatic failure prior to TACE treatment. These patients did not survive during the period of hospitalization. Multivariate analysis identified that a maximum tumor size >10 cm and a high serum total bilirubin level >30 Âµmol/l were independent factors for determining overall patient survival rate. Additionally, the overall survival rates at 1, 6 and 12 months were 92.3, 53.8 and 46.2% in the TACE group and 100, 87.1 and 54.8% in the surgery group, respectively. The overall survival rates at 1 and 6 months following TACE were lower than those of the surgery group (P0.05). Patients in the TACE group had a shorter hospital admission compared with those in the resection group (median 7 vs. 13 days; P
