Objective: To compare the application value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 112 patients with primary HCC were enrolled for the treatment of RFA and they were randomly equally divided into the CEUS group and CECT group. The gender, age, and number and maximum diameter of tumors between the two groups were compared. The median duration of follow-up was 27.0 months and the clinical outcomes were compared. Results: The average examination time period before ablation, of guiding needle insertion and of ablation in the CEUS group were significantly shorter than those in the CECT group (p < 0.05). The complete ablation rate of the CEUS group was significantly higher than that of the CECT group (86.36% vs. 73.17%, Ï‡2 = 4.618, p = 0.032). There was no comparative difference in the incidence of complications (including fever, infection, pain, and liver injury) between the two groups (p > 0.05). The relapse rate of the CEUS group was lower and the survival rate was higher than that in the CECT group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Compared with the CECT, the RFA for treatment of HCC guided by the CEUS shorten the time of examination and treatment. The immediate postoperative assessment can improve the overall complete ablation rate, reduce the relapse rate, and increase the survival rate, which provides insights for the clinical application.
