Accumulating studies have implicated that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a vital role in lung cancer. However, little is known of the role of lncRNA highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) in the pathogenesis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In this study, we investigated the modifying effects and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA HULC in LSCC. Significantly decreased level of lncRNA HULC was observed in LSCC samples compared with adjacent tissues. Besides, the expression of lncRNA HULC was negatively associated with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) in LSCC. Moreover, lncRNA HULC could promote the proliferation of LSCC cells by downregulating the expression PTPRO dependent on the phosphorylation and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). The present study firstly shows strong evidence supporting a critical role of lncRNA HULC in promoting LSCC by regulating PTPRO/NF-κB signaling pathway, which provides new promising biomarkers for LSCC.
