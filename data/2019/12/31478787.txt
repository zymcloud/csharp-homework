To assess the potential role of serum serotonin level in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis. A case-control study that involved 100 Egyptian adults. Subjects were divided into 4 groups: Group I: 21 patients with late-stage HCC on top of liver cirrhosis, Group II: 28 patients with early-stage HCC on top of liver cirrhosis, Group III: 26 patients with cirrhosis with no evidence of HCC, and Group IV: 25 healthy age- and sex-matched subjects were as a control group. Serum serotonin level was determined in all recruited subjects using high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescent detection method. Alpha-fetoprotein had a statistically significant elevation in group I with a median of 1300 ng/L (195-2544 ng/L) compared to groups II and III (P ≤ 0.01). Regarding serum serotonin level, it had a statistically significant elevation in group II with a median of 275 ng/μL (204.7-400 ng/μL) compared to groups I, III, and IV with median of 33 ng/μL (30-50 ng/μL), 50 ng/μL (30-60 ng/μL), and 102 (85-150 ng/μL), respectively (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that serum serotonin at cutoff value of 108 ng/μL had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92.3% in discriminating early-stage HCC from cirrhosis. Serum serotonin level is a rapid, sensitive, noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for the detection of early-stage HCC.
