A 65-year-old man visited our hospital for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)and underwent extended posterior sectionectomy. Eight months after the hepatic resection, follow-up computed tomography(CT)revealed a solitary, recurrent tumor in S4 of the liver, and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation were performed for the intrahepatic recurrence. After 12 postoperative months, follow-up CT demonstrated pulmonary metastases in S5 of the right lung and S10 of the left lung. Since there were no other metastases, the 2 metastatic lesions were resected using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery(VATS). The resected tumors were histologically diagnosed as pulmonary metastases of HCC. Three years after the pulmonary resection, 3 additional pulmonary metastases were detected on CT in S3 and S10 of the right lung and S4 of the left lung. No other metastases were found. Bilateral VATSmetastasectomy was performed for the metastases. The tumors were diagnosed as pulmonary metastases of HCC on histological examination. One year and 8 months after the surgery, he was alive in a good condition, with no recurrences. The present case suggested that some patients with pulmonary metastasis of HCC can have long-term survival with surgical resection of the metastasis. Therefore, while systemic chemotherapy is generally considered the standard treatment for extrahepatic metastasis of HCC, surgical resection might be an option.
