Flavonoids are natural compounds that show various biological effects, such as the anti-cancer effect. Chrysin is a flavonoid compound found in honey and propolis. Studies have shown that chrysin has anti-cancer activity due to induction of apoptosis signaling. In the present study, we examined the cytotoxic effect of chrysin against liver mitochondria obtained from the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rat model. Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) was used for induction of HCC. Mitochondria were isolated from liver hepatocytes using differential centrifugation. Then, hepatocytes and mitochondria markers related to apoptosis signaling were investigated. Our finding indicated an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, collapse in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), swelling in mitochondria, and cytochrome c release (about 1.6 fold) after exposure of mitochondria obtained from the HCC rats group with chrysin (10, 20, and 40 ÂµM) compared to the normal rats group. Furthermore, Chrysin was able to increase caspase-3 activity in the HCC rats group (about 2.4 fold) compared to the normal rats group. According to the results, we proposed that chrysin could be considered as a promising complementary therapeutic candidate for the treatment of HCC, but it requires a further in vivo and clinical studies.
