A 71-year-old man underwent right hemi-hepatectomyfor a hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)measuring 18 cm in diameter. The pathological diagnosis was poorlydifferentiated HCC. Ten months after the surgery, computed tomographyrevealed a nodule 12mm in diameter in the right lung as well as 2 nodules measuring 19 and 11mm in diameter in the retroperitoneum at the cranial aspect of the left kidney. Four months later, the nodule in the right lung had enlarged to 44 mm, while the 2 nodules in the retroperitoneum had enlarged to 68mm and 34 mm. These nodules were resected and histopathologicallydiagnosed as metastasis from HCC. Twenty-one months after liver resection, computed tomographyrevealed nodules 16 and 25mm in diameter in the retroperitoneum around the urinarybladder and jejunum, respectively. One month later, intussusception resulted from the jejunal tumor. Laparoscopic surgerywas performed for both tumors, which were diagnosed as metastases from HCC. Twenty-five months after liver resection, metastasis from the HCC appeared in the left adrenal grand, at the site of the jejunal anastomosis, and in the fattytissue around the right scapula. Twenty-nine months after liver resection, the patient died of respiratoryfailure from multiple metastases in the left lung.
