Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play multifaceted roles in modulating gene expression under both physiological and pathological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNAs has been increasingly linked with many human diseases, including a plethora of cancers. Mounting evidence indicates that lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and can regulate HCC progression, as well as metastasis. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on the expanding roles of lncRNAs in modulating various functions of HCC, and elaborate on how can lncRNAs impact HCC metastasis and progression via interacting with chromatin, RNA, and proteins at the epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels. This mini-review also highlights the current advances regarding the signaling pathways of lncRNAs in HCC metastasis and sheds light on the possible application of lncRNAs for the prevention and treatment of HCC.
