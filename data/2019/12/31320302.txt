Background:Recent data suggest a potential activity and a good tolerability of capecitabine in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aims:To evaluate capecitabine activity and safety in a wide cohort of advanced HCC patients.Methods:Retrospective analysis of 143 capecitabine-treated patients (January 2010 to December 2017) in three centers of the Veneto Oncology Network.Results:Capecitabine was administered in second and third line, but also in first line instead of sorafenib in Child-Pugh B patients (70%), compromised clinical conditions (14%) or contraindications to antiangiogenetics (16%). Median overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) were 6.9 and 2.8 months, respectively. There were no differences in OS and TTP between the 32 patients treated with non-metronomic scheme (2000 mg/day for 14 days) and the 111 patients treated with metronomic scheme (1000 mg/day) after correction for prognostic factors at baseline with a propensity score analysis. Capecitabine was more active in patients intolerant to sorafenib than in those progressing during treatment (p = 0.024). At least one adverse event (mainly hematological) was experienced by 73% of patients but discontinuation was necessary only in 11 (8%).Conclusions:Capecitabine can be considered an active and safe option in advanced HCC, especially for patients unfit for other treatments.
