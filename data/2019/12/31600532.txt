Hepatitis B virus infection is a major cause of liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The viral regulatory protein HBx is essential for viral replication and has been involved in the development of HCC. Recently, we characterized a subset of HCCs that replicate HBV. Our aim was to characterize HBx encoded by the full-length HBV DNA (cccDNA) in HCC and non-HCC liver. HBx genes were amplified and sequenced from eight paired HCC and non-HCC tissues in which HBV cccDNA and pgRNA were both present. Sequence analyses identified twelve amino acid positions mutated between HCC and non-HCC liver, and detected in at least three cases. We next assessed the impact of these mutations on HBx function by testing their transcriptional activity. We examined their ability to rescue the transcription of HBV virus deficient for HBx in differentiated HepaRG cells and to induce Smc5/6 degradation, which is mandatory for viral replication. We assessed their capacity to activate a CREB-dependent reporter. Finally we analyzed their growth suppressive activity using colony formation assays. Our results showed that most HBx variants isolated from HCC retain their ability to support HBV cccDNA transcription and to degrade Smc5/6. Strikingly, HCC specific HBx variants are impaired in their antiproliferative activity, which may be detrimental for tumor growth. In conclusion, in contrast to previous observations that tumor HBx variants lack transcriptional activity, we showed here that HBx variants have retained their ability to counteract Smc5/6 and thus to activate cccDNA transcription although they tend to lose antiproliferative activity.
