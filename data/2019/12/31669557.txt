Bmi-1 is a gene related to malignant transformation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The liver cancer cells developed the ability to tolerate CDDP treatment with the elevation of Bmi-1. Bmi-1 is also an oncogene promoting malignance of tumor and an anti-cancer target in many studies. Herein, a biocompatible nanocarrier was designed in the study to deliver a chemotherapeutical agent CDDP and Bmi-1 siRNA to kill cancer cells and silence drug resistance related gene simultaneously. Calciumphosphate (CaP) was applied to coat both nanoplatin cores and siRNA as a shell for the purpose of delivering cargos to the cytosol of the tumor cells. Nanoplatin and siRNA co-loaded CaP nanoparticles (NPSC) enhanced cell uptake of CDDP and showed elevated drug accumulation in tumor. NPSC achieved considerable anti-cancer efficacy and counter-regulated drug tolerance, therefore, warranted a further investigation as a novel therapeutic nanosystem to improve cancer therapy.
