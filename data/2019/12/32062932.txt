There have been 6-10 million reported patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide, and the United Nations (UN) called for a "90% reduction by 2030" strategy. Since the wide practice of HBV vaccination, the numbers of HBV cases have been reduced by 85% and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma has also decreased by 50%. As formulated by the UN in 2015, the sustainable development agenda for the eradication of hepatitis B included the success rate of preventing mother-to-child viral transmission by 95%, together with the reduction of new hepatitis B infections by 90% in 2030. In order to achieve the agenda, we proposed a strategy to achieve the "three 96%" goals derived from the Shanghai experience. In brief, hepatitis B vaccine should cover for 96% newborns within 24 h, and the vaccination boosting rate should reach 96% for both one and six months after birth. If cutting off the mother-to-child viral transmission strategy can be successfully achieved, the future of hepatitis B prevention will be promising, and the task of eliminating hepatitis B and controlling hepatocellular carcinoma can be completed ahead of 2030, time proposed by the UN.
