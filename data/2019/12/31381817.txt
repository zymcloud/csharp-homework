What is known and objective:Regorafenib is a novel multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for use in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours and hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a case of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss caused by regorafenib.Case summary:A 48-year-old woman was diagnosed with colon cancer that had metastasized to the liver, ureter and left ovary. She was initially treated with oral regorafenib at the lowest recommended dosage of 80 mg/d for 2 weeks, at which point the dose was increased to 120 mg/d. On the second day after the regorafenib dosage increase (ie, 15 days after starting regorafenib), she suddenly developed a bilateral hearing loss. Regorafenib was discontinued immediately, and the patient was treated with a course of intravenous steroids. Five weeks later, her bilateral hearing had subjective partial improvement.What is new and conclusion:This is the first report of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss induced by regorafenib.
