Background:This study aimed to evaluate the role of Dickopff 1 (DKK1) serum levels as a marker for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to compare it with alphafetoprotein (AFP) after non-surgical intervention (microwave ablation, radiofrequency ablation) in HCC.Patients and methods:This prospective study was conducted in Al-Mahalla hepatology teaching hospital from June 2015 to June 2017. One hundred and twenty patients were included. They were classified into four groups: Group A: 40 patients with chronic liver disease; Group B: 40 patients with HCC which were divided into 2 main sub groups, group Ba which included HCC patients who were not eligible for ablative therapy and group Bb which included HCC patients who were eligible for ablative therapy; Group C: 20 healthy control subjects matched for age and sex; Group D: 20 HCC patients with negative AFP, DKK1 was done for them.Results:There was a highly significant difference (p Conclusion:Serum Dkk-1 has higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in early diagnosis of HCC than AFP.
