Atezolizumab (Tecentriq®), a humanized, anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody, in combination with bevacizumab, carboplatin and paclitaxel (ABCP) or with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (ACnP) has been approved as first-line treatment for metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, based on results from the randomized IMpower150 and IMpower130 studies in chemotherapy-naïve patients with nonsquamous metastatic NSCLC. In IMpower150, ABCP prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) relative to BCP, regardless of EGFR or ALK status, liver metastases at baseline or PD-L1 expression levels. In IMpower130, ACnP prolonged PFS and OS relative to CnP in patients without EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations. ABCP and ACnP had manageable tolerability profiles, which were consistent with the profile of the individual components of the regimen. Immune-related adverse events with ABCP and ACnP were largely mild or moderate in severity, and most were reversible with interruption of atezolizumab and initiation of appropriate treatment. Current evidence indicates that ABCP and ACnP are valuable emerging first-line treatment options for metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.
