Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by bad prognosis and is the second most common reason for cancer-linked mortality. Treatment with sorafenib (SRF) alone increases patient survival by only a few months. A causal link has been determined between angiotensin II (Ang-II) and HCC. However, the mechanisms underlying the tumorigenic effects of Ang-II remain to be elucidated. N-Nitrosodiethylamine was utilized to examine the effects of telmisartan (TEL) (15 mg/kg), SRF (30 mg/kg), and a combination of these two agents on HCC mice. Downregulation of NF-кBP65 mRNA expression and inhibition of the phosphorylation-induced activation of both ERK1/2 and NF-кB P65 were implicated in the anti-tumor effects of TEL and SRF. Consequent regression of malignant changes and improvements in liver function associated with reduced levels of AFP, TNF-α, and TGF-β1 were also confirmed. Anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, and anti-angiogenic effects of treatment were indicated by reduced hepatic cyclin D1 mRNA expression, reduced MMP-2 levels, and reduced VEGF levels, respectively. TEL, but not SRF, demonstrated agonistic activity for PPARγ receptors, as evidenced by increased PPARγ DNA binding activity, upregulation of CD36, and HO-1 mRNA expression followed by increased liver antioxidant capacity. Both TEL and SRF inhibited TAK1 phosphorylation-induced activation, indicating that TAK1 might act as a central mediator in the interaction between ERK1/2 and NF-кB. TEL, by modulating the ERK1/2, TAK1, and NF-кB signaling axis in the context of PPARγ agonistic activity, exerted anti-tumor effects and increased tumor sensitivity to SRF. Therefore, TEL is an encouraging agent for further clinical trials regarding the management of HCC.
