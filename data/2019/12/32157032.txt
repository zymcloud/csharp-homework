We reported a case of a 30s woman who underwent Hartmann's surgery for sigmoid cancer. Her pathological stage was Stage â…£(pT4b, N1b, M1b[liver and lung]). Postoperatively, 10 courses of systemic chemotherapy with FOLFOX plus cetuximab( Cmab)or bevacizumab(Bmab)were administered. After the chemotherapy, partial liver dissection and radiofrequency ablation(RFA)for multiple liver metastasis were performed. After 2 years of systemic chemotherapy with FOLFIRI plus ramucirumab(RAM), no liver or lung metastasis was observed; however, left supraclavicular lymph node and para-aortic lymph node metastases existed and gradually increased. For the purpose of local control, the para-aortic lymph node metastasis was treated with cervical dissection and carbon ion radiotherapy. Therefore, carbon ion radiotherapy was a useful treatment for local control.
