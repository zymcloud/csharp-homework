Discovering the utmost effective and targeted chemotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma is still a significant challenge. In the present study, diethylnitrosamine was used as a liver carcinogen and boldine a compound of boldo. We anticipated the hypothesis that boldine endow antiproliferative and promote apoptosis on hepatocarcinoma rats. We analyzed that boldine alters the tumor biomarkers and liver markers enzyme levels. Also, we determined boldine modulate the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant activities, as well as messenger RNA and protein expressions of Bcl2, Bax, and cleaved caspase 3 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. It was also manifested by histopathology studies in liver tissues of HCC rats. Our finding suggested that boldine has antioxidant activity, and moreover, also contributes apoptotic nature by upregulating the protein expression of Bax, and cleaved caspase 3. Our data accomplishes that boldine a candidate drug has dynamic therapeutic activity and suitable for the treatment of HCC.
