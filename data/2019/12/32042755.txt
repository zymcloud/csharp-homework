Background:The activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) promotes tumor progression. In this study, we aimed to assess whether RAS inhibitors (RASIs) could improve the outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with primary hypertension after curative liver resection.Methods:Data on 387 consecutive patients with primary hypertension who underwent curative liver resection for HCC were reviewed. The study population was divided into two groups based on the type of anti-hypertensive medications: the RASI group (patients using RASIs) and the non-RASI group (patients using other anti-hypertensive drugs but not RASIs). Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests and cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze time to recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS).Results:There were 144 (37.2%) patients in RASI group and 243 (62.8%) in non-RASI group. The preoperative clinicopathological features were comparable between the two groups. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated HCC patients with RASIs had a longer TTR and OS than the patients with non-RASIs (both Pvs. 7.8%, P<0.042).Conclusions:Targeting the RAS was associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, decreased rate of extrahepatic metastases and prolonged survival of HCC patients with primary hypertension after curative liver resection.
