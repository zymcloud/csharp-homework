Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biliary tract cancers (BTC) display a poor prognosis with 5-year overall survival rates around 15%, all stages taken together. These primary liver malignancies are often diagnosed at advanced stages where therapeutic options are limited. Recently, immune therapy has opened new opportunities in oncology. Based on their high programmed death-ligand 1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, HCC and BTC are theoretically good candidates for immune checkpoint blockade. However, clinical activity of single agent immunotherapy appears limited to a subset of patients, which is still ill-defined, and combinations are under investigation. In this review, we provide an overview of (i) the biological rationale for immunotherapies in HCC and BTC, (ii) the current state of their clinical development, and (iii) the predictive value of immune signatures for both clinical outcome and response to these therapies.
