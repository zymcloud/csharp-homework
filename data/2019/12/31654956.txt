Background and objectives:To assess the impact of academic setting and hospital on overall survival in patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The 2004-2015 NCDB was queried for HCC. First line treatment was stratified as liver transplant, surgical resection, interventional oncology (IO) and chemotherapy. Hospital volume was stratified as high (ranking among top 10% in case numbers) and low volume. Overall survival was assessed via multivariable Cox regressions.Results:63,877 patients treated at 1261 hospital systems were included (transplant n = 10,596, surgical resection n = 11,132, IO n = 12,286, chemotherapy n = 29,863; academic centers n = 226, non-academic n = 1035). Younger African American patients with private insurance, high income and education were more likely treated at academic centers. US geographical discrepancies were evident, with highest academic center treatment rates in New England states (83.6%) and lowest in South Atlantic states (48.6%). Overall survival was superior for academic versus non-academic centers (HR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.87-0.91, p Conclusions:HCC treatment in academic centers shows distinct patterns according to patient demographics and US geography. Longest patient survival is observed in high-volume academic centers.
