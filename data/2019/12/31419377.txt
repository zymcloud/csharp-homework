Background & aims:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most critical factor underlying liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. IL-1β and IL-18, generated by activation of the inflammasome/caspase-1 signaling pathway, play important roles in the control and clearance of HBV. However, the specific relationship between the inflammasome response and IFN-α resistance or viral persistence is yet to be established.Methods:Blood samples of patients and supernatant fractions of HBV cell lines were collected for analysis and the effects on inflammasome activation and IL-1β production evaluated via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence.Results:IL-1β and IL-18 levels produced in sera of IFN-α non-responders were significantly lower than those of responders and normal donors. Additionally, expression of IL-1β and inflammasome components was decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of non-responders, compared with those of responders. In vitro experiments on HepG2, HepG2.2.15 and HepAD38 cell lines showed that HBV induces a significant decrease in IL-1β production through inhibiting activation of the NF-κB signaling and inflammasome/caspase-1 pathways. And hepatitis B virus polymerase (HBV-Pol) appeared crucial for these inhibitory effects of HBV.Conclusion:IL-1β production is suppressed in HBV carriers and IFN-α non-responders. HBV induces a significant decrease in IL-1β production through inhibiting the NF-κB signaling and inflammasome pathways, for which HBV-Pol is a crucial requirement. Trial approval number: 20 173 402.
