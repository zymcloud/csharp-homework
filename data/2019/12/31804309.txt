Background:This study systematically reviews the data for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) alone or combined TACE and cryoablation therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma, aiming to provide clinical choice references for treatment of cancer.Methods:Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched to include relevant studies published in English and Chinese between Jan 1, 2000, to July 31, 2017. The analysis was conducted in RevMan 5.3 based on random effects models.Results:Nineteen trials (n = 1427) were included. Combined TACE and cryoablation therapy had higher survival rate (1-year survival [RR 1.37; 95%-CI 1.26,1.49], 2-year survival [RR 1.50; 95%-CI 1.25,1.79], 3-year survival [RR 1.67; 95%-CI 1.16,2.40]), complete necrosis [RR 2.53; 95%-CI 2.07,3.10] and tumor control [RR 1.57; 95%-CI 1.40,1.75], which is more favorable for long-term efficacy of non-surgical hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor recurrence of control group was above combination therapy [RR 0.27; 95%-CI 0.17, 0.43]. Compared with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, effect of combination therapy occurred mainly in the survival, complete necrosis, tumor control, and recurrence. Taking combination therapy was generally more effective than taking TACE only.Conclusion:Compared with TACE only used to treat cancer, combination therapy had the best effect profile in general, and it had better survival in HCC when taking an integrated approach. The prognosis of treatments based on combination therapy is modulated by cryoablation.
