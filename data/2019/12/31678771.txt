Background:Hepatic arterial embolisation therapy (HAET) is a treatment of liver metastases of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI-NETs). HAET increases circulating vascular endothelial growth factor levels. Everolimus is a treatment in NETs that may have antiangiogenic activity.Methods:This phase II study was conducted in patients with predominant and progressive liver metastases from GI-NETs. Everolimus was initiated 7-30 days after HAET. The hypothesis was that everolimus after HAET would increase hepatic progression-free survival (hPFS) rate at 24 months from 35% to 50%.Results:Among the 74 patients included, 88% had small-bowel primary tumour, 43% had grade I and 57% grade II tumour, and 51% had extrahepatic metastases. Patients underwent one (n = 19), two (n = 54), or three (n = 1) HAET procedures. hPFS at 24 months was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.5-43.7); 40 (54%) patients had objective response. Median (95% CI) hPFS, PFS, and overall survival were 19 (14-23), 17 (13-22), and 51 (33-60) months. The most common grade III-IV toxicities (>5%) in patients receiving both HAET and everolimus (n = 67) were elevated liver enzymes (55%), fatigue (18%), diarrhoea (16%), anaemia (12%), hypertriglyceridaemia (7%) and mucositis (6%).Conclusions:The primary end-point was not reached. This sequence allows high liver response with HAET, and everolimus controls the extrahepatic disease.Trial registration:NCT01678664 (clinicaltrials.gov).
