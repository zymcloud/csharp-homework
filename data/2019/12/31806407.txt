Background and study aims:MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small single stranded RNAs, function in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and incorporated in pathogenesis of HCV related chronic liver disease. This study was designed to evaluate the significance of serum miR-21, miR-223, and miR-885-5p as biomarkers in various clinicopathological stages of HCV related chronic liver disease.Patients and methods:Serum miR-21, miR-223, and miR-885-5p were quantified by quantitative RT PCR in 60 patients with HCV-related liver disease (presumably genotype 4), in addition to 25 healthy controls. HCV patients were classified into: chronic non-cirrhotic HCV (n = 15), HCV related liver cirrhosis (n = 15), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 30).Results:Serum levels of miR-885-5p in cirrhotic patients ± HCC (n = 45) were significantly higher than the non-cirrhotic patients (n = 15); p = 0.007 and healthy control; p = 0.001. However, no such significance was detected between HCC and non-HCC HCV patients; p = 0.12. Serum miRNA-885-5p was able to discriminate cirrhosis ± HCC from healthy controls using ROC analysis; AUC 0.85, 87% sensitivity and 80% specificity. On the other hand, HCC patients had significantly higher serum miR-2 1evels than non-HCC patients (non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic groups, n = 30); p = 0.048 and the control group; p = 0.002. ROC could differentiate HCC from control group; AUC 0.89, 80% sensitivity, 80% specificity. Both serum bilirubin and albumin showed significant weak correlation with miRNA-885-5p (r = 0.42, p = 0.001) and (r = -0.27, p = 0.04), respectively but no such correlation was observed with serum miRNA-21. In contrast, miRNA-223 showed no significant difference across the studied groups.Conclusion:Along the spectrum of HCV-related chronic liver disease, miR-885-5p could be a potential marker for advanced liver damage while miR-21 could be a helpful diagnostic marker for HCC.
