Purpose:Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common condition in cirrhotic patients and mostly attributed to portal hypertension. The objective of our study was to examine the association of PVT with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients.Methods:A retrospective study was performed to identify cirrhotic patients with thrombosis of the portal system. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and analyzed.Results:Thirty-nine patients were identified. Twenty-four out of 39 patients with PVT did not develop HCC (group A) after follow-up time of 38.5 months from the diagnosis of PVT. Eight patients (20.5%) were diagnosed with HCC within two weeks following diagnosis of PVT (group B). Seven patients (17.9%) were diagnosed with tumor thrombus (group C) at time of PVT diagnosis. The average age was 53.5, 66.5, and 69 years for groups A, B, and C respectively. Most patients (75 and 87.5% for groups B and C respectively) diagnosed with PVT and HCC were males. The most common cause of cirrhosis in groups B and C was chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) in 62.5% and 50% respectively. The most common clinical presentation of PVT in group A was abdominal pain in 55.5% compared to new/worsening ascites in 43% and 37.5% for groups B and C respectively. The platelet count in groups B and C was higher as compared to that in group A (126 and 125 vs. 107 thousand, P = NS).Conclusion:In 38.4% of cases, new diagnosis of PVT was associated with concomitant diagnosis of HCC. Identifiable risk factors were chronic HBV infection and higher platelet count.
