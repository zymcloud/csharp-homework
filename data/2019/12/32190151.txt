Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common and prevalent cancer type among liver cancers. In this study, expression of miR-490-3p and aurora kinase A gene (AURKA) was investigated in HCC. Additionally, we explored the microRNA (miR)-490-3p/AURKA relationship as well as the influence on HCC cell proliferation and migration.Material and methods:The dual luciferase reporter assay serves to verify the target relationship between miR-490-3p and AURKA. miR-490-3p mimics, AURKA siRNA and AURKA cDNA, were transfected into HCC cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were chosen for examining the relative expression of miR-490-3p and AURKA in HCC tissues, adjacent tissues, HCC cells and normal cells. The study detected the proliferation of HCC cells with the application of MTT assay and colony formation assay. Transwell assay was applied for the observation of migration, and wound healing assay for invasion.Results:The experiment results showed that miR-490-3p expression was down-regulated and AURKA expression was up-regulated in HCC cells and tissues. AURKA was the target gene of miR-490-3p and overexpression of miR-490-3p could inhibit the expression of AURKA in HCC cells. miR-490-3p overexpression could inhibit HCC cell migration and invasion, while AURKA promoted HCC cell migration. All experiment results indicated that miR-490-3p was low-expressed while AURKA was over-expressed in HCC cells and tissues compared to normal liver cells and tissues.Conclusions:miR-490-3p could down-regulate the expression of AURKA, thus suppressing the proliferation and migration of HCC cells.
