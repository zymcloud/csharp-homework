Background and aims:Emerging studies indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a role as prognostic markers in many cancers, including liver cancer. Here, we focused on the lncRNA lung cancer-associated transcript 1 (LUCAT1) for liver cancer prognosis.Methods:RNA-seq and phenotype data were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Chisquare tests were used to evaluate the correlations between LUCAT1 expression and clinical features. Survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were used to compare different LUCAT1 expression groups (optimal cutoff value determined by ROC). The log-rank test was used to calculate the p-value of the Kaplan-Meier curves. A ROC curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed to explore the potential mechanism.Results:Data mining of the TCGA -Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) RNA-seq data of 371 patients showed the overexpression of LUCAT1 in cancerous tissue. High LUCAT1 expression was associated with age (p=0.007), histologic grade (p=0.009), T classification (p=0.022), and survival status (p=0.002). High LUCAT1 patients had a poorer overall survival and relapse-free survival than low LUCAT1 patients. Multivariate analysis identified LUCAT1 as an independent risk factor for poor survival. The ROC curve indicated modest diagnostic performance. GSEA revealed the related signaling pathways, and the ceRNA network uncovered the underlying mechanism.Conclusion:High LUCAT1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for liver cancer.
