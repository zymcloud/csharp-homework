Background:Cytotoxic and immunosuppressive therapies for cancer treatment may allow hepatitis reactivation. Hepatitis due to viral hepatitis reactivation is detected in 14%-25% of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive cancer patients undergoing anticancer treatments. Drug toxicity may be confused with hepatitis reactivation, which may cause a delay in diagnosis.Case report:A 60-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma was treated with sunitinib. Sixteen months after sunitinib inception, liver enzymes were elevated and viral hepatitis reactivation was detected as hepatitis delta virus infection in the HBsAg-positive patient.Conclusion:Cancer patients should be screened for viral hepatitis prior to immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy.
