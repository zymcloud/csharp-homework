OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether, compared with traditional criteria, the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST) improves prediction of local tumor control and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS. Fifty-one HCC lesions (mean size, 3.1 cm) treated with SBRT in 41 patients (mean age, 67 years) were retrospectively included. Each patient underwent CT or MRI before SBRT and at least once after SBRT. Best overall response was categorized using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), iRECIST, World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria. Lesions were then classified as local tumor control (i.e., stable disease, partial response, or complete response) or local treatment failure (i.e., progressive disease) by each tumor response criteria. Proportions of local tumor control were compared using the McNemar exact test. The 1-year overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS. The median follow-up after SBRT was 21.0 months. The local tumor control rate was 94.1% (48/51) by iRECIST, 88.2% (45/51) by RECIST 1.1, 72.5% (37/51) by WHO criteria, 80.4% (41/51) by mRECIST, and 72.5% (37/51) by EASL criteria. The local tumor control rate was significantly higher according to iRECIST compared with WHO (p = 0.0010) and EASL (p = 0.0225) criteria. The 1-year survival rate for patients with local tumor control according to iRECIST (86.4%) was higher (although not statistically significant) compared with the 1-year survival rate for patients with local tumor control according to the other response criteria. CONCLUSION. iRECIST may provide more robust interpretation of HCC response after SBRT, yielding improved prediction of local tumor control and 1-year survival rates compared with traditional criteria.
