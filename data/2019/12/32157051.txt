The patient was a 63-year-old man with a chief complaint. Upper endoscopic examination revealed a semicircular type 2 lesion, sized 24-28 cm, on the incisor teeth and a 3 cm sized elevated lesion directly above the EGJ. When biopsy was performed, squamous cell carcinoma(SCC)was detected. In this case, lymph node metastasis and multiple liver metastases were observed, and diagnosis at the first examination was cT3N2M1(HEP), Stage â…£. After 7 months of chemotherapy, he underwent right thoracic esophageal subtotal resection, 3-field lymph node dissection, posterior mediastinal gastric tube reconstruction, and partial hepatectomy. Despite receiving postoperative chemotherapy, he showed recurrence in the liver(S8). Four additional courses of chemotherapy were administered and partial hepatectomy(S8)was performed, without the appearance of new lesions. He was considered to be cured 1 year and 6months after starting the treatment and was followed- up without chemotherapy. However, 4 months later, chemotherapy was resumed when right adrenal and abdominal wall metastases and liver recurrence(S3)were found. After that, the regimen was modified, and he continued treatment. More than 4 years have passed since the start of treatment, but the treatment has been continued without a decline in ADL.
