A man in his 50s was referred to our hospital with a liver tumor detected by ultrasonography during a medical checkup. Enhanced CT scan and MRI showed hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)in S8 of the liver. Laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed. The histopathological findings showed well differentiated HCC. Two years later, his serum PIVKA-Ⅱ levels were slightly elevated. A new lesion was detected by US, CT, and MRI at S5 of the liver. A second laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed. The histopathological findings showed moderately differentiated HCC. After 1 year, MRI detected 2 new HCCs(S4, S8). The tumor at S8 had invaded the right branch of the portal vein. There was no indication for right hepatectomy because of liver dysfunction. Lipiodol-TACE followed by DEB-TACE was not effective on the tumor. The HCC at S8 had enlarged and formed a portal vein tumor thrombus. PIVKA- / Ⅱ levels increased to 3,596 mAU/mL. The patient was adminis- tered Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy(45 Gy/15 Fr)and his PIVKA-Ⅱ levels decreased to the normal range. He has been followed-up without recurrences for 2 years and 9 months.
