A-67-year old man was diagnosed with gastric cancer and a liver tumor. Extended left hemihepatectomy combined with caudate lobectomy and distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection were performed. Histological examination revealed synaptophysin and CD56positive tumor cells with a solid and rosette structure, which was diagnosed as endocrine carcinoma (EC). Additionally, a tubular adenocarcinoma was present in the stomach. The liver tumor presented as EC with tumor thrombus in the left portal vein. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with gastric EC(pT3[SS], pN0, P0, CY0, M1[HEP], Stage â…£, R0). He received 6courses of the adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin(CDDP)plus irinotecan(CPT-11), and has been alive without recurrence for 21 months post-operation. Gastric EC is a rare subtype of gastric cancer. The resection of liver metastasis of gastric EC may improve patients' prognosis and QOL. CDDP-based chemotherapy is recommended, due to the regimen for small cell lung cancer.
