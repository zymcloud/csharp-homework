Resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic natural product with a well-known polypharmacological profile that places it among the multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs). Given its protective action against a wide number of chronic diseases, in this review, we introduce a general overview about the cardioprotective and antioxidant effects, the antidiabetic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of this polyphenol. In the second part of the manuscript, we focused our attention on the anticancer activity of Resveratrol, given the alteration of many different signaling pathways, leading to suppression of tumor cell proliferation in numerous cancer types. Among the several anticancer targets involved in the mechanism of action of Resveratrol, here we introduce experimental and molecular modeling studies performed against the SGK1 protein as a novel anticancer target of Resveratrol. SGK1 inhibitors have been demonstrated to inhibit cell growth of different cancer cells. We demonstrated that resveratrol inhibits SGK1 in vitro and in intact cells, affecting proliferation and survival of HUH7 human hepatoma cells. Our findings demonstrate that resveratrol may function as a SGK1 inhibitor, suggesting possible applications in sodium retention and cancer.
