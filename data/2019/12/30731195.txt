Hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppression with nucleot(s)ide analogue therapy reduces the risk of hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with advanced liver disease.1 In the present era of potent antiviral therapies, the prognostic significance of the serum HBV DNA level as a biological gradient has substantially diminished; the majority of treated patients achieve virologic suppression.2,3 After control of viremia, a higher baseline fibrosis level is a useful predictor for disease progression.4 Few "prospective" studies on the effects of antiviral agents, especially in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with advanced liver disease, have been reported.
