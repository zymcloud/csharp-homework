Background:Microvascular invasion (MVI) is a major determinant of survival outcome for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant Sorafenib (PA-Sorafenib) in HCC patients with MVI after R0 liver resection (LR).Methods:The data of patients who underwent R0 LR for HCC with histologically confirmed MVI at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The survival outcomes for patients who underwent PA-Sorafenib were compared with those who underwent R0 LR alone. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed.Results:728 HCC patients had MVI in the resected specimens after R0 resection, with 581 who underwent LR alone and 147 patients who received in additional adjuvant sorafenib. PSM matched 113 patients in each of these two groups. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) were significantly better for patients in the PA-sorafenib group (for OS: before PSM, P = 0.003; after PSM, P = 0.007), (for RFS: before PSM, P = 0.029; after PSM, P = 0.001), respectively. Similar results were obtained in patients with BCLC 0-A, BCLC B and Child-Pugh A stages of disease.Conclusions:PA-Sorafenib was associated with significantly better survival outcomes than LR alone for HCC patients with MVI.
