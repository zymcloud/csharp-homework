Objective:To assess survival and identify predictors of survival more than 30-days after discharge in a cohort of consecutive patients diagnosed with pneumococcal pneumonia.Methods:Observational study including all consecutive immunocompetent adult patients surviving more than 30-days after hospitalization. The bacteriological diagnosis was based on the results of urinary antigen testing and/or blood culture. Life expectancy was calculated for each patient considering their sex, age and date of discharge.Results:We included 1114 patients that survived more than 30- days after discharge. Of them, 431 (38.6%) died during follow-up (median follow-up of 6.7 years). Age, history of cancer, liver disease, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, atrial arrhythmia and coronary disease, red cell distribution width (RDW) > 15%, positive blood culture, hematocrit < 30% and living in a nursing home were independent risk factors for reduced long-term survival after hospital discharge. Cumulative 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 93.9%, 85.3% and 76%, respectively. Among non-survivors, 361 (83.8%) died earlier than expected given their life expectancy.Conclusions:Survival after hospital discharge is mainly associated with age and comorbidities. The findings of bacteremia and elevated RDW on admission could help identify patients at high risk of long-term mortality.
