Background:Lenvatinib, a newly developed oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has amazing potential in the multidisciplinary treatment of advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Thrombocytopenia is a serious adverse event that causes drug dose reduction or withdrawal. Partial splenic embolization is currently being used as a non-surgical treatment for thrombocytopenia caused by various pharmacotherapies.Case report:Partial splenic embolization was performed for three patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving lenvatinib therapy with/without transarterial chemoembolization. Partial splenic embolization was advantageous for various situations, including the induction of lenvatinib for patients with thrombocytopenia, application of lenvatinib after multiple transarterial chemoembolization using cisplatin and radiotherapy, and re-administration of lenvatinib after lenvatinib therapy-induced thrombocytopenia. In all cases, lenvatinib therapy was completed without need for cessation due to thrombocytopenia.Conclusion:We strongly recommend the new concept of combining partial splenic embolization and lenvatinib therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
