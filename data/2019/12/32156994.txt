An 81-year-old man was referred to our department because of rapid progression of a cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail. Abdominal CT revealed a heterogeneously enhancing tumor, measuring 70mm in diameter, in the pancreatic tail, encompassing a low-density area with calcification and directly invading the spleen. We diagnosed the patient with malignant transformation of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm and performed distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, partial transverse colectomy, and partial resection of the diaphragm. Histopathological examination revealed anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas of the spindle cell type, and R0 resection was achieved. Anastomotic leakage of the transverse colon occurred on postoperative day 4, and ileostomy was performed. Multiple liver metastases were observed on postoperative day 27, and the patient was orally administered with S-1. Although he was discharged on postoperative day 50, he died of cancer on postoperative day 61. Anaplastic carcinoma of the pancreas has a poor prognosis, and an early multidisciplinary treatment should be performed.
