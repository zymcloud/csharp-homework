Chronic hepatic injury caused by hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infection, high fat diet and alcohol intake has increased to be the critical promoter of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These high risk factors set into motion a vicious cycle of hepatocyte death, inflammation and fibrosis that finally results in cirrhosis and HCC after several decades. However, the treatment options for HCC are very limited. Therefore, early treatment of liver injury may reduce the incidence and probability of HCC or delay the progression of HCC. Substantial ongoing research has focused on nontoxic biological macromolecules, mainly polysaccharides, which possess prominent efficacies on hepatoprotective activity. Based on these encouraging observations, a great deal of effort has been devoted to discovering novel polysaccharides for the development of effective therapeutics for hepatic injury. This review focuses on the protective effects of polysaccharides on liver injury, including hepatitis virus infection, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease and other hepatic injuries, and describes the underlying mechanisms.
