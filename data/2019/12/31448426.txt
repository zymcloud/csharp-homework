Our aim was to evaluate the association of genetic polymorphisms of immunoregulatory molecules with susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The polymorphisms in CTLA-4 (-318 T/C, CT60 G/A), TNF (-238 G/A, -308 G/A) and IL10 (-592 C/A, -819 C/T) were genotyped by PCR and DNA sequencing. The functional relevance of the polymorphisms was examined by ELISAs, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation assay and cytotoxic assay. The CTLA-4 -318 TC/TT, CTLA-4 CT60 GG, IL10 -592 CA and -819 CT/TT variants, CTLA-4 -318 T and IL 10 -819 T alleles were positively associated with HCC risk (P
