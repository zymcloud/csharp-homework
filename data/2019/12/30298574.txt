Four dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma were treated by transcatheter arterial embolisation. In all dogs, the tumour-supplying arteries were selectively embolised with gelatine sponge particles. Post-embolisation tumour volumes decreased relative to pre-embolisation volumes in all dogs. No adverse reactions were observed in three dogs after treatment but one dog showed pancreatitis. These results suggest that transcatheter arterial embolisation is a feasible treatment for dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma.
