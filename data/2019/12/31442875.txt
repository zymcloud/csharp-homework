Background:The objective of the present study was to elaborate a flexible 915 MHz microwave antenna (F915 MMA) and to evaluate the safety and feasibility in laparoscopic hepatecyomy (LH).Methods:The F915 MMA was redesigned based on the experiences in clinical practice. Ten porcine LHs were divided into a 'flexible' group and a control group, with 5 porcine LHs in each group. The F915 MMA was used in the flexible group. The data for 48 patients who underwent LH were analyzed; 12 patients underwent F915 MMA-assisted LH and were regarded as the flexible group, and the others were considered as controls.Results:The F915 MMA bends freely and rotates flexibly. In the porcine LH in vivo, the flexible group had less intraoperative blood loss (54.00 ± 27.02 ml vs 230.00 ± 83.67 ml, P = 0.002), and the mean duration of hepatic parenchyma transection in the flexible group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (17.3 ± 7.8min vs 37.9 ± 6.4min). Among th patients, compared to the control group, the flexible group had less intraoperative blood loss (154.17 ± 68.95 ml vs 284.86 ± 294.68 ml, P = 0.018), less frequency and duration of the first porta hepatic occlusion (1.50 ± 0.52times vs 2.35 ± 1.14times, P = 0.021 and 22.50 ± 7.83min vs 35.95 ± 17.23min, P = 0.017, respectively) and lower accumulative complications (33.3% vs 80.5%, P = 0.008).Conclusions:Laparoscopic F915 MMA is an innovative device that can assist LH in a safe, feasible and flexible manner.
