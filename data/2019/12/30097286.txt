The type 3 cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 play a crucial, well synchronized physiological role in wound healing and repairing tissue damage due to infections or injury at barrier surfaces. These cytokines act on epithelial cells to induce secretion of early immune mediators, recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of injury, and to trigger tissue repair mechanisms. However, if the damage persists or if these cytokines are dysregulated, then they contribute to a number of inflammatory pathologies, autoimmune conditions and cancer. The liver is a multifunctional organ that plays an essential role in metabolism, detoxification, and immune surveillance. It is also exposed to a variety of pathogens, toxins and injuries. Over the past decade, IL-17 and IL-22 have been implicated in various aspects of liver inflammation. IL-17 is upregulated in chronic liver injury and associated with liver disease progression. In contrast, IL-22 was shown to be hepatoprotective during acute liver injury but exhibited inflammatory effects in other models. Furthermore, IL-22 and IL-17 are both associated with poor prognosis in liver cancer. Finally, the regulatory mechanisms governing the physiological versus the pathological role of these two cytokines during acute and chronic liver injury remain poorly understood. In this review, we will summarize the current state of knowledge about IL-17 and IL-22 in wound healing during acute and chronic liver injury, their contribution to pathogenesis, their regulation, and their role in the transition from advanced liver disease to liver cancer.
