Primary renal neuroendocrine carcinomas (RNC) are extremely rare urological neoplasms, with fewer than 100 cases reported in the literature. There are no established protocols concerning diagnosis and treatment, and there is no definitive data on prognosis. Here, we report the findings of a 54-year-old woman who presented with intermittent back pain due to a large mass, which was initially suspected to be a renal cell or upper tract urothelial carcinoma. The patient underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy and lymph node dissection without complications. Pathology revealed an RNC with local metastases to para-aortic lymph nodes without evidence of another primary origin. Subsequent surveillance showed no evidence of disease until 48-month follow-up imaging revealed a liver lesion suspicious for possible metastatic cancer. This report represents the second documented usage of robot-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy for RNC and the longest follow-up in the literature. We review the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with RNC.
