The recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are a major concern in current research. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is the leading cause underlying the high mobility and invasiveness of tumor cells. Myricetin is a natural flavonol with various pharmacological activities. The effects of myricetin on the migration and invasion of HCC MHCC97H cells were evaluated in the present study. Wound healing, Transwell migration and invasion assays were used to examine cell migration and invasion. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used to examine the expression of epithelial (E)-cadherin, neural (N)-cadherin and vimentin. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of myricetin on the migration and invasion of HCC MHCC97H cells. It was indicated that myricetin decreased the viability of MHCC97H cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner, and inhibited MHCC97H cells migration and invasion. As the concentration of myricetin increased, filopodia and lamellipodia in cells weakened and cells were arranged more closely. RT-qPCR and western blotting revealed that myricetin upregulated E-cadherin expression and downregulated N-cadherin. Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrate that myricetin may inhibit the migration and invasion of HCC MHCC97H cells by inhibiting the EMT process.
