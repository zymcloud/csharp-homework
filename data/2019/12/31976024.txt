Background:Hepatectomy remains one of the most effective treatments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it can lead to serious complications. Irisin, a key regulator of energy metabolism, is secreted into the circulation by shedding of the extracellular portion of the fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5). We have shown that irisin administration alleviates liver ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. However, the role of preoperative irisin levels in HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy remained unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine how irisin expression changes in HCC and to explore the relationship between preoperative serum irisin levels and complications after hepatectomy.Methods:FNDC5/irisin expression data in HCC were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. A total of 219 participants, including 102 healthy controls and 117 HCC patients, were recruited in this study. All HCC patients underwent hepatectomy at the First Affiliated Hospital of the Xi'an Jiaotong University. Preoperative serum irisin levels were measured by ELISA. Postoperative complications were assessed using the comprehensive complication index (CCI) score. The Pearson rank correlation coefficient was computed to assess the correlation between preoperative serum irisin levels and postoperative CCI scores.Results:In TCGA dataset, FNDC5/irisin expression was downregulated in HCC tissues (P < 0.001). Similarly, serum irisin levels were decreased in HCC patients (P < 0.001). Low preoperative serum irisin levels were significantly correlated with high CCI scores after hepatectomy.Conclusions:Irisin may be a novel serum biomarker in the diagnosis of HCC and a predictor of complications after hepatectomy.
