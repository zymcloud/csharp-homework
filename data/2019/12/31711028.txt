Background:Hepatitis B and C viruses are known to be carcinogenic and have been associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing worldwide, and early diagnosis is vital in order to achieve good oncological outcomes.Objectives:To investigate the association between chronic hepatitis B and C infection, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Study design:We performed a retrospective case control study with 774 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients undergoing treatment, and 1518 cancer-free controls undergoing hernia surgery. Hepatitis B and C serologies were tested prior to treatment, and cases and controls were age- and sex-matched before analysing rates of infection.Results:HNSCC patients were more likely than controls to have evidence of chronic hepatitis B (OR = 2.76; CI 95 %, 1.64-4.64) and hepatitis C (OR = 2.59; 95 % CI, 1.46-4.60) infection. No substantial association was found between hepatitis B and C infection and other known risk factors for head and neck cancer.Conclusions:These findings suggest a positive association between both hepatitis B and hepatitis C chronic infection, and HNSCC. More work is needed to establish a causal role, however an awareness of the possibility of increased risk of HNSCC may lead to earlier diagnosis and better outcomes in patients with hepatitis B and C.
