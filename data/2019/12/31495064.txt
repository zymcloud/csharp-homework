Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most pervasive cancers with low prognosis, high frequency of recurrence, and metastasis. Studies conducted have focused on extricating novel strategies for successful treatment. Kojic acid and its derivatives are already proven to have depigmenting, anti-inflammatory, and anti-neoplastic properties. In the present study, kojic acid and its 10 distinct derivatives were tested on HEPG2 cell line for their possible anti-cancer effect and seven of them were observed to be cytotoxic. Compound 6 was chosen to proceed as the IC50 dosage for HEPG2 cells was lower in comparison with the other derivatives and kojic acid itself. Further experiments pointed out that intrinsic apoptotic pathway was triggered with the exposure of the cells to IC50 concentration of the derivative as the treatment led to escalation of intracellular ROS, induction of TP53 gene, and activation of caspase 3/7. Pro-apoptotic Jnk and Bax genes were not triggered suggesting that the apoptotic pathway advance through an alternative route. Complementary experiments are in need; howbeit, the current findings suggest that the derivative offers a novel promising approach against hepatocellular carcinoma as it is not detrimental to healthy cells within the concentrations applied, and it does not induce drug resistance.
