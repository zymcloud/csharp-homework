The present study aimed to investigate the expression of elongation of very long-chain fatty acids family member 6 (ELOVL6) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and to determine its role in the development of HCC. A total of 377 HCC specimens were collected for tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry analyses. The ELOVL6 IHC score for HCC tissues was 0.97±0.71, which was significantly lower than that of the matched adjacent normal tissues (1.32±0.68; P
