Aim:To investigate the predictive value of albumin (ALB) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing curative resection. We sought to establish a new scoring model for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients undergoing curative resection.Patients and methods:A retrospective analysis was performed in 303 HCC patients who underwent curative resection. Preoperative risk factors for survival were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses. On the basis of significant factors, a prognostic scoring model was established. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between different groups.Results:Multivariate Cox regression showed that preoperative decreased ALB levels and elevated GGT levels were significantly associated with poor OS and RFS. Multivariate analysis showed that ALB level, GGT level, portal vein tumor thrombus, and tumor number were independent prognostic factors for both OS and RFS. Thereafter, we established a preoperative prognostic scoring model combining the four risk factors. The results revealed that higher risk scores might mean worse OS and RFS.Conclusion:Preoperative ALB and GGT levels are potentially useful biomarkers for predicting the prognostic outcomes in HCC patients undergoing curative resection. Our new prognostic scoring model qualifies as a novel prognostic predictor for HCC patients after curative resection.
