Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become one of the major diseases that are threatening human health in the 21st century. Currently there are many approaches to treat liver cancer, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Among various methods of treating liver cancer, natural medicine treatment has achieved promising results because of their superiorities of high efficiency and availability, as well as low side effects. Alkaloids, as a class of natural ingredients derived from traditional Chinese medicines, have previously been shown to exert prominent anti-hepatocarcinogenic effects, through various mechanisms including inhibition of proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis, changing cell morphology, promoting apoptosis and autophagy, triggering cell cycle arrest, regulating various cancer-related genes as well as pathways and so on. As a consequence, alkaloids suppress the development and progression of liver cancer. In this study, the mechanisms of representative alkaloids against hepatocarcinoma in each class are described systematically according to the structure classification, which mainly divides alkaloids into piperidine alkaloids, isoquinoline alkaloids, indole alkaloids, terpenoids alkaloids, steroidal alkaloids and other alkaloids. Besides using them alone, synergistic effects created together with other chemotherapy drugs and some special preparation methods also have been demonstrated. In this review, we have summarized the potential roles of several common alkaloids in the prevention and treatment of HCC, by revising the preclinical studies, highlighting the potential applications of alkaloids when they function as a therapeutic choice for HCC treatment, and integrating them into clinical practices.
