Aim:The positive energy balance and insulin resistance caused by weight gain, physical inactivity, poor dietary quality are linked to a decreased breast cancer (BC)-specific survival. The aim of the present study was to assess whether or not hepatosteatosis, which reflect underlying insulin resistance, has a predictive value on recurrence in patients with nonmetastatic BC.Material method:All diagnosed nonmetastatic BC patients between 2005 and 2016 were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients' medical characteristics included for analysis were age, menopausal status, presence of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and tumor features. Liver parenchyma was evaluated by ultrasonography, and then patients divided into 2 groups according to final follow-up findings; group 1: without hepatosteatosis or presence of grade 1 steatosis; group 2: presence of grades 2 and 3 hepatosteatosis. Survival distributions were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups with the log-rank statistic.Results:Four hundred twenty-four patients included in this study. The median follow-up period of all patients was 6.7 years (range, 0.6-13 years). The mean age was 48.2 Â± 0.5 years. Of total, 154 (36.3%) patients experienced recurrence. In total, 171 (40.6%) patients had grades 2 and 3 hepatosteatosis, and the remaining had no, or grade 1 hepatosteatosis during last follow-up or at recurrence. The clinicopathologic characteristics of the participants were well balanced between the 2 groups. Younger age (odds ratio [OR]: 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-3.8, P = 0.005), and higher tumor stage (OR: 7.52; 95% CI: 1.2-48.5, P = 0.035 for stage Ia vs stage IIIC) were associated with recurrence of BC during the entire follow-up in multivariate analysis. Hepatosteatosis predicted late recurrence after 5 years in nonmetastatic BC after adjusted for age, diabetes, tumor stage, grade, and luminal type (OR: 2.45; 95% CI: 1.1-5.6, P = 0.034) and the hazard ratio was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.18-0.88, P = 0.023 adjusted value) for relapse-free survival after 5 years.Conclusion:Higher degree of hepatosteatosis may predict recurrence after 5 years in BC survivors.
