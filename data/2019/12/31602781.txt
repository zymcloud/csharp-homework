In the United States, Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) incidence has tripled over the past two decades. The disease has disproportionately affected minority and disadvantaged populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of SATB2 gene in HCC cells derived from African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA) and assess its oncogenic potential by measuring cell viability, spheroid formation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem cell markers and pluripotency maintaining factors in cancer stem cells (CSCs). We compared the expression of SATB2 in human primary hepatocytes, HCC cells derived from AA and CA, and HCC CSCs. Hepatocellular carcinoma cells derived from AA expressed the higher level of SATB2 than those from CA. By comparison, normal human hepatocytes did not express SATB2. Higher expression of SATB2 in HCC cells from AA was associated with greater growth rate, cell viability, colony formation and EMT characteristics than those from CA. Knockout of SATB2 in CSCs by Crispr/Cas9 technique significantly inhibited the expression of SATB2 gene, stem cell markers (CD24, CD44 and CD133), pluripotency maintaining factors (c-Myc, KLF4, SOX2 and OCT4), and EMT compared with non-targeting control group. The expression of SATB2 was negatively correlated with miR34a. SATB2 rescued the miR-34a-mediated inhibition of CSC's viability. These data suggest that SATB2 is an oncogenic factor, and its higher expression may explain the disparity in HCC outcomes among AA.
