Virotherapy on the basis of oncolytic vaccinia virus (VACV) strains is a promising approach for cancer therapy. Recently, we showed that the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h68 has a therapeutic potential in treating human prostate and hepatocellular carcinomas in xenografted mice. In this study, we describe the use of dynamic boolean modeling for tumor growth prediction of vaccinia virus-injected human tumors. Antigen profiling data of vaccinia virus GLV-1h68-injected human xenografted mice were obtained, analyzed and used to calculate differences in the tumor growth signaling network by tumor type and gender. Our model combines networks for apoptosis, MAPK, p53, WNT, Hedgehog, the T-killer cell mediated cell death, Interferon and Interleukin signaling networks. The in silico findings conform very well with in vivo findings of tumor growth. Similar to a previously published analysis of vaccinia virus-injected canine tumors, we were able to confirm the suitability of our boolean modeling for prediction of human tumor growth after virus infection in the current study as well. In summary, these findings indicate that our boolean models could be a useful tool for testing of the efficacy of VACV-mediated cancer therapy already before its use in human patients.
