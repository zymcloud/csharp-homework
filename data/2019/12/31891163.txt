Background:Pyridines have been reported to possess various pharmacological activities.Results:Sodium 3-oxo-3-(2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)prop-1-en-1-olate (2) and sodium 3-oxo-3-(3-oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromen-2-yl)prop-1-en-1-olate (7) were prepared and reacted with 2-cyano-N'-(1-aryl(heteryl)ethylidene)acetohydrazides 3a-d to produce 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carbonitrile derivatives 5a-d and 9a-d, respectively, in good yields. Also, 3a-d reacted with sodium (2-oxocyclopentylidene)methanolate (11a) or sodium (2-oxocyclohexylidene) methanolate (11b) to yield 2-oxo-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]pyridine-3-carbonitriles 13a-d and 2-oxo-hexahydroquinoline-3-carbonitriles 13e-h, respectively. The mechanisms that account for the formation of the products are discussed. Additionally, the structures of all the newly synthesized products are confirmed, based on elemental analysis and spectral data. Several of the newly synthesized compounds are evaluated for their antitumor activity against HEPG2 and their structure activity relationship (SAR) was studied.Conclusions:The results revealed that the pyridine derivatives 5c and 5d (IC50 = 1.46, 7.08 ÂµM, respectively) have promising antitumor activity against liver carcinoma cell line (HEPG2), compared to the reference drug, doxorubicin.
