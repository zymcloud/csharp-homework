CD81 serves as an immune modulator, playing its role in tumor growth and metastasis of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CD81 serves as a coreceptor of viral entry and is found to be enriched in exosomes. HCV E2 protein when associated with CD81 may be responsible for B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, as extrahepatic manifestation. Studies predict that HCV association with exosomes, leads to the establishment of persistent infection, through immune evasion. Herein, we confirm the association of HCV particles with CD81+ exosomes. Breifly, exosomes were enriched from peripheral blood of chronic HCV patients who have developed HCC. Sideways, exosomes were also enriched from peripheral blood of healthy individuals, who exhibited normal liver function test profile and had no known infection. Isolation of subpopulation of CD81+ exosomes was performed through immunocapture, followed by detection using FACS. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the physical association of a fraction of exosome with HCV. CD81+ exosomes from chronic HCV patients with HCC were more granulated and larger when compared with those enriched from a healthy individual and HCV RNA was also detected in enriched fractions of CD81+ exosomes from HCV-positive HCC patients only, through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We concluded that CD81+ exosomes carry HCV particles and the association plays a pivotal role in establishing persistent infection, through immune evasion, thus leading to HCC progression. Exosomal CD81 and its interacting proteins might, therefore, serve as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCV progression mediated by active HCV infection.
