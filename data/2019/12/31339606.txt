Aim:Postoperative ascites is one of the most common complications after hepatic resection and is related to liver fibrosis. Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) is a reliable and non-invasive marker for assessing liver fibrosis. This study aimed to evaluate whether preoperative M2BPGi level can predict postoperative refractory ascites in patients with curative hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The present study retrospectively evaluated 59 patients between January 2016 and June 2018. We assessed the relationship between preoperative M2BPGi levels, expressed as the cut-off index, and postoperative ascites.Results:The median M2BPGi level was 1.36 (range 0.34-11.56). Postoperative ascites occurred in seven patients (11.9%). Among them, refractory ascites, defined as diuretic-resistant ascites, occurred in four patients (6.8%). Uni- and multivariate analysis showed that preoperative M2BPGi level was the only independent risk factor of postoperative ascites (odds ratio 3.28, P = 0.033). The cut-off values of M2BPGi for postoperative ascites and refractory ascites were 2.41 and 3.10, respectively. Remarkably, there were no patients with postoperative ascites and refractory ascites when the preoperative M2BPGi levels were less than each cut-off value.Conclusion:Our results suggest that M2BPGi level is a reliable and non-invasive surrogate marker for predicting postoperative ascites before curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma.
