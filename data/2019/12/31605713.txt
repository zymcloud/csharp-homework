Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwideand haslimited treatment options. In view of this, zafirlukast (ZAF) was administered orally to DEN-induced HCC rats to evaluate its antineoplastic properties. ELISA, qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to determine the molecular mechanism associated with ZAF therapy for HCC. We found that HCC developed as a result of lower expression of caspases 3 and 9, but their levels returned to normal when the expression of eNOS, BAX, BAD, and Cyt C was decreased and when the expression of iNOS, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-2 was increased. Again, ZAF (80 mg/kg dose) treatment normalized the expression of caspase-mediated apoptotic factors, i.e. BAX and Bcl-2 proteins, as established through Western blot analysis. Later, 1H NMR-based serum metabolomics study revealed that levels of perturbed metabolites in DEN-induced rat serum returned to normal after ZAF administration. Altogether, the antineoplastic potential of ZAF was found to be comparable, and to some degree better, than the marketed chemotherapeutic 5-flurouracil, which may be beneficial for anti-HCC treatment from a future drug design perspective.
