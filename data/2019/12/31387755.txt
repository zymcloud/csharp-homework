Indications for liver transplantation have expanded over the past few decades owing to improved outcomes and better understanding of underlying pathologies. In particular, there has been a growing interest in the field of transplant oncology in recent years that has led to considerable developments which have pushed the boundaries of malignant indications for liver transplantation beyond hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this article, we review and summarise the published evidence for liver transplantation in non-HCC primary and metastatic liver malignancies and highlight ongoing clinical trials that address unresolved questions therein. We also examine the current technical, immunological and oncological challenges that face liver transplantation in this growing field and explore potential approaches to overcome these barriers.
