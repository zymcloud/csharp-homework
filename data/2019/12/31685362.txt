Health-related quality of life has become an important aspect in oncologic decision making. Recent data suggest that Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measurements can play an important prognostic role in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Locoregional therapies (LRTs) such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and radioembolization (TARE) are important parts of HCC management. Results demonstrated that radiofrequency ablation treatment results in improving HRQoL compared to surgery for up to 3 years after treatment. Between TARE and transarterial chemoembolization, TARE provides the most benefit in terms of HRQoL. This systematic review investigated contemporary data surrounding HRQoL in patients undergoing LRTs and its impact on clinical decision making.
