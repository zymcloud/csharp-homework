Although surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) with 6 monthly imaging is recommended for patients with cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, international studies report poor adherence and there is paucity of data on its effect on patient outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to review cases of HCC secondary to HCV to determine the impact of adherence with HCC surveillance on survival. A total of 520 patients with confirmed HCC secondary to chronic HCV from 31 January 2001 to 31 May 2018 were identified from a prospective national HCC database. Computerized clinical records, general practitioner referral letters and secondary care clinic letters were subsequently retrospectively analysed for methods of HCC detection. HCC was detected through routine surveillance in only 224 patients (44%). HCC was detected either incidentally or following the onset of symptoms in nonadherent (12%), suboptimal surveyed (3%), undiagnosed cirrhotic (12%) or recently diagnosed HCV patients (21%) or were never offered surveillance (2%). Routine surveillance improved overall survival, OR 0.41 (95% CI [0.32, 0.53], P
