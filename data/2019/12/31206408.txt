Aim:Sarcopenia is associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the general population. However, in cirrhotic patients, as the development of sarcopenia is closely related to declined liver function, which also impairs HRQOL, whether sarcopenia deteriorates HRQOL independently from declined liver function remains unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of sarcopenia on HRQOL impairment in cirrhotic patients.Patients and methods:A total of 88 cirrhotic patients [median age, 69 years; range: 31-79 years; 49 male (55.7%), 45 with hepatocellular carcinoma (51.1%)] were analyzed. We measured HRQOL using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey version 2 questionnaire and identified factors contributing to scores lower than 50 in physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary, and role-social component summary (RCS) scores.Results:Twenty-four (27.2%) patients had sarcopenia. PCS and RCS scores were significantly lower in patients with sarcopenia compared with those without sarcopenia. Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) classification B or C showed significantly lower scores in PCS and RCS than those with CP classification A. On multivariate analysis, the presence of sarcopenia was the only factor associated with low PCS scores [odds ratio (OR): 11.6; P = 0.031]. Female sex (OR: 3.34; P = 0.034), CP classification B or C (OR: 3.19; P = 0.037), and presence of sarcopenia (OR: 4.64; P = 0.016) were identified as independent factors for low RCS scores.Conclusion:Sarcopenia independently impairs physical and role-social HRQOL in cirrhotic patients.
