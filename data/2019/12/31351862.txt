Background:The prognosis of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is poor. We assessed the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the anti-programmed cell death 1 fusion protein AMP-224 in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide and stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) treatment in patients with mCRC refractory to standard chemotherapy.Patients and methods:Fifteen patients were enrolled. Six received SBRT 8 Gy on day 0 (dose level 1), whereas 9 received 8 Gy on days -2 to day 0. All received cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 intravenously (I.V.) on day 0. On day 1, both groups received AMP-224 10 mg/kg I.V., repeated every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses. Primary end points were feasibility and safety.Results:Ten (67%) patients completed 6 doses of AMP-224; 5 patients (33%) discontinued treatment because of disease progression. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed; 9 patients (60%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, all Grade 1 or 2. No objective response was noted; 3 patients (20%) had stable disease. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.8 months) and 6.0 months (95% CI, 2.8-9.6 months), respectively. M2 macrophage polarization was present in the pretreatment tumor biopsy samples, but not post-treatment samples.Conclusion:AMP-224 in combination with SBRT and low-dose cyclophosphamide was well tolerated, however, no significant clinical benefit was observed in patients with mCRC.
