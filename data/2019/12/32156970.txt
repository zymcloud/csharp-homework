The treatment for peritoneal dissemination of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)remains to be established. Therefore, peritoneal recurrence ofHCC has a poor prognosis. Here, we report a case ofperitoneal recurrence ofHCC after a liver resection. The patient underwent surgery for peritoneal recurrence 5 times already and had taken sorafenib for 3 years. No recurrence occurred for 55 months during the last follow-up. Therefore, multidisciplinary treatment for peritoneal recurrence of HCC, including surgical resection, may improve prognosis.
