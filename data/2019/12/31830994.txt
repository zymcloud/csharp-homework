Background:Associations between polymorphisms in vitamin D receptor (VDR)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/interleukin-18 (IL-18)/mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were already explored by many studies, yet the results of these studies were inconsistent. The aim of this meta-analysis was to better clarify associations between polymorphisms in VDR/VEGF/IL-18/MBL and HCC by combing the results of all relevant studies.Methods:Eligible publications were searched from PubMed, Embase, WOS, and CNKI. We used Review Manager to combine the results of individual studies.Results:Thirty studies were included in this study. Combined results revealed that VDR rs7975232, VDR rs2228570, VEGF rs699947, VEGF rs3025039, IL-18 rs1946518, and MBL rs7096206 polymorphisms were all significantly associated with HCC in the overall pooled population. We also obtained similar significant associations for VDR rs7975232, VDR rs2228570, IL-18 rs1946518, and MBL rs7096206 polymorphisms in Asians.Conclusions:Collectively, this meta-analysis proved that VDR rs7975232, VDR rs2228570, VEGF rs699947, VEGF rs3025039, IL-18 rs1946518, and MBL rs7096206 polymorphisms may confer susceptibility to HCC in certain populations.
