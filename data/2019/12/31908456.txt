Background:It is important to explore effective treatment for liver cancer. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a novel technique to treat liver cancer, but its clinical application is obstructed by limited depth of visible light penetration into tissue. The near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer is a potential solution to the limitations of PDT for deep tumor tissue treatment.Purpose:We aimed to investigate 808 nm NIR light-excited UCNPs@mSiO2-Ce6-GPC3 nanocomposites for PDT in liver cancer.Methods:In our study, 808 nm NIR light-excited upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were simultaneously loaded with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and the antibody glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The multitasking UCNPs@mSiO2-Ce6-GPC3 nanoparticles under 808 nm laser irradiation with enhanced depth of penetration would enable the effective targeting of PDT.Results:We found that the UCNPs@mSiO2-Ce6-GPC3 nanoparticles had good biocompatibility, low toxicity, excellent cell imaging in HepG2 cancer cells and high anti-tumor effect in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion:We believe that the utilization of 808 nm NIR excited UCNPs@mSiO2-Ce6-GPC3 nanoparticles for PDT is a safe and potential therapeutic option for liver cancer.
