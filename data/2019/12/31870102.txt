Background:Nicotine acts as major alkaloid of all tobacco products including smokeless tobacco (SLT) forms. The mode of SLT consumption is in the form of chewing under the cheek or lip and induced biochemical alterations in the plasma, saliva, and urine.Materials and methods:The smokeless tobacco products like Raja or blue bull tobacco brands are widely consumed by human male volunteers under the age of 18-30 years for the period of 3 years consisting of 30g per day. The concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in samples of plasma, saliva, and urine are quantified by the method of HPLC. The remaining variables of plasma are evaluated by auto analyzer and spectrophotometric methods.Results:The analysis of results presented that significant increase in the levels of nicotine and cotinine in plasma, saliva, and urine of chewing tobacco users. The lipid profile (Cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C), liver marker enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, and ALP), kidney markers (Creatinine, urea, and uric acid), glucose, and the remaining variables are present within normal range observed in SLT users. The lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO) (NO2 and NO3), protein carbonyls (PCO), and peroxynitrites (ONOO-) are reported to be higher levels in the plasma of experimental subjects in comparison with normal controls. The various brands of tobacco varieties (Raja, madhu chhap, hans chhap, miraj, badshah, blue bull, and swagat gold tobacco) are presented.Conclusion:The chewing tobacco users exhibited greater amounts of nicotine and cotinine are at risk of cardiovascular due to nicotine has cardiovascular effects, and oral cancer disease complications in the future for chronic consumption of smokeless tobacco products due to the presence of carcinogens of tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines.
