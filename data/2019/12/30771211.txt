Background:In predicting the risk for posthepatectomy complications, hepatectomy is traditionally classified into minor or major resection based on the number of resected segments. Recently, a new hepatectomy complexity classification was proposed. This study aimed to compare the value of the traditional and that of the new classification in perioperative outcomes prediction.Methods:Demographics, perioperative laboratory tests, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, and follow-up data of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent liver resection were retrospectively analyzed.Results:A total of 302 patients were included in our study. Multivariable analysis of intraoperative variables showed that the complexity classification could independently predict the occurrence of blood loss > 800 mL, operation time > 4 h, intraoperative transfusion, and the use of Pringle's maneuver (all p Conclusions:Complexity classification could be used to assess the difficulty of surgery and was independently associated with postoperative complications. The traditional classification did not reflect operation complexity and was associated only with PHLF.
