Purpose:To examine the volume and variation in opioid prescribing practices among oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMSs) serving Medicare beneficiaries from 2013 to 2017 and identify the practice-level features that correlate with the opioid prescription volume.Materials and methods:The present cross-sectional study included Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data from 2013 to 2017. Providers were included if they were labelled as OMSs. The primary outcome variable was the opioid claim volume. The predictor variables included provider and beneficiary gender, beneficiary age, and beneficiary hierarchical condition category (HCC). The secondary outcome variables included mean opioid prescriptions per beneficiary and opioid days' supply per claim. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were computed at an Î± level of 0.05.Results:The 5-year analysis cohort included 2071 distinct providers; 605,593 total opioid prescription claims were recorded for 516,217 Medicare beneficiaries, with an average supply of 3.54 days of opioids per patient. From 2013 to 2017, a significant increase had occurred in the number of mean opioid claims per provider (P Conclusions:Although the total number of opioids prescribed by OMSs has increased over time, the prescribing practices have, on the aggregate, become more responsible. The extreme cases of opioid prescribing and variations in state-level opioid claim volumes warrant additional investigation.
