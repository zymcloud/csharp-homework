Purpose:Spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (srHCC) is known to be a life-threatening complication with poor prognosis. Although there are various treatment modalities, there is no definite treatment guideline. The purpose of this study was to review the surgical outcome and prognosis of srHCC treated with intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and distilled water peritoneal lavage (DWPL).Methods:From March 2012 to October 2018, 9 patients with srHCC who underwent emergent surgery were reviewed. After hematoma removal, intraoperative RFA and DWPL were applied to all patients. Hepatectomy was performed if necessary. Patients with multiple tumors, distant metastasis, and vascular tumor involvement in radiologic imaging were excluded.Results:Six of 9 patients with diameters less than 7 cm were able to obtain hemostasis using RFA alone (RFA group). However, 3 patients with a tumor size of more than 10 cm underwent liver resection because they could not obtain hemostasis with RFA (hepatectomy only group). The RFA group had shorter operation time (148.3 ± 31.7 minutes vs. 251.7 ± 20.2 minutes, P < 0.05) and less red blood cell transfusion (5.8 ± 2.5 packs vs. 24.0 ± 11.5 packs, P < 0.05) than the hepatectomy only group. There was no peritoneal metastasis at long-term follow-up in the RFA group. Five-year recurrence-free survival rate was 0% in both groups. However, 5-year overall survival rate was better in the RFA group (83.3% vs. 0%, P < 0.05).Conclusion:Intraoperative RFA and DWPL are easy to perform and theoretically the best methods for managing relatively small srHCC.
