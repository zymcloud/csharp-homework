Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a complex chronic disease resulting from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The phenotype and pathophysiology of NAFLD is heterogeneous. NAFLD is a continuum of histological lesions of the liver from steatosis, Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH), NASH with fibrosis, cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathophysiology encompasses a dysfunction in fatty tissue (sub-cutaneous and visceral) associated with insulin-resistance and metabolic inflammation. NAFLD is a "multi-systemic" disease. Reciprocal and aggravating interactions exist between NAFLD, cardiovascular anomalies and diabetes. The understanding of the mechanisms responsible for NAFLD allows the identification of potential novel therapeutic targets.
