An 86-year-old man visited our hospital complaining of upper abdominal pain. Enhanced computed tomography showed a 37Ã—23mm tumor with subcapsular hematoma in S3. Hepatitis B and C virus markers were negative, and serum tumor markers were elevated. The patient was diagnosed with ruptured non-viral hepatocellular carcinoma with subcapsular hematoma. Because his condition and vital signs remained stable after conservative management of the liver tumor and hematoma, elective hepatectomy was performed. The postoperative course was good, and he was discharged 12 days postoperatively without any complications. We experienced a relatively rare case of ruptured non-viral hepatocellular carcinoma with subcapsular hematoma. We describe this case with reference to the literature.
