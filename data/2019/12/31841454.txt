BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of long noncoding (lnc) RNA FOXD2-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma development. MATERIAL AND METHODS Collecting the 3 pairs of adjacent and hepatocellular carcinoma tissue and analysis by gene chip. Evaluating the FOXD2-AS1 expression by in situ hybridization assay. Evaluating the FOXD2-AS1 to Bel-7402 biological activity in vitro study by Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, Transwell and wound healing assay and correlation between miR-185 by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The relative proteins expressions were evaluated by western blot assay. RESULTS FOXD2-AS1 was significantly upregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. FOXD2-AS1 knockdown suppressed Bel-7401 cell biological activities (proliferation, invasion, and migration) with miR-185 overexpression and AKT depressing in cell expression. CONCLUSIONS LncRNA FOXD2-AS1 promoted hepatocellular carcinoma development by regulation miR-185/AKT axis.
