Tolloid-like 1 gene (TLL1) variant rs17047200 has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japanese hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients with sustained virological response (SVR) to interferon or direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based regimens. We investigated whether this holds true also in Caucasian cirrhotic patients cured by DAAs. Consecutive Caucasian HCV cirrhotics receiving DAA between December 2014 and December 2016 in a single centre were enrolled. Cirrhosis was defined histologically (METAVIR F4) or by liver stiffness measurement (LSM > 11.9 kPa). TLL1 rs17047200 was analysed by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. 452 patients were enrolled: median age 63 (28-87) years, 58% males, 47% HCV-1b, LSM 19.1 (12.0-75.0) kPa and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score 4.9 (0.3-46.0). 96% patients achieved an SVR. TLL1 genotype was AA in 329 (73%) and AT/TT in 123 (27%) (MAF = 0.14, HWE P > 0.05). Patients' clinical features were similar across TLL1 genotypes. After 33 (3-47) months from DAA start, 31 patients developed HCC, with a 3-year estimated cumulative probability being 7.5% (95% CI: 5%-10%). The cumulative incidence of HCC was 9% in TLL1 AA vs 7% in AT/TT patients (P = 0.55). Male sex (HR: 3.78, 95% CI: 1.4-10.1, P = 0.008), diabetes (HR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.68-7.27, P = 0.001) and FIB-4 (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03-1.14, P = 0.001) were baseline-independent predictors of HCC. The incidence of HCC was not influenced by TLL1 genotypes even when considering an additional group of 348 noncirrhotic patients, being 2% in AA vs 1% AT/TT patients (P = 0.58). In a large cohort of Caucasian HCV cirrhotics treated with DAA, TLL1 variants do not predict HCC development.
