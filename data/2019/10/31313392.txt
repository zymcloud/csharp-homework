The mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis remains poorly understood. Tropomodulin 3 (TMOD3) is a member of the pointed end capping protein family that contributes to invasion and metastasis in several types of malignancies. It has been found to be crucial for the membranous skeleton and embryonic development, although, its role in HCC progression remains largely unclear. We observed increased levels of Tmod3 in HCCs, especially in extrahepatic metastasis. High Tmod3 expression correlated with aggressive carcinoma and poor patient with HCC survival. Loss-of-function studies conducted by us determined Tmod3 as an oncogene that promoted HCC growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, Tmod3 increases transcription of matrix metalloproteinase-2, -7, and -9 which required PI3K-AKT. Interaction between Tmod3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that supports the activation of EGFR phosphorylation, is essential for signaling activation of PI3K-AKT viral oncogene homolog. These findings reveal that Tmod3 enhances aggressive behavior of HCC both in vitro and in vivo by interacting with EFGR and by activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.
