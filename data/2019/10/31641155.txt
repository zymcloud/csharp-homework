Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing plays an increasingly important role in precision medicine for cancer. However, circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) is highly diluted by cfDNA from non-cancer cells, complicating ctDNA detection and analysis. To identify low-frequency variants, we developed a program, eVIDENCE, which is a workflow for filtering candidate variants detected by using the ThruPLEX tag-seq (Takara Bio), a commercially-available molecular barcoding kit. We analyzed 27 cfDNA samples from hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Sequencing libraries were constructed and hybridized to our custom panel targeting about 80 genes. An initial variant calling identified 36,500 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 9,300 insertions and deletions (indels) across the 27 samples, but the number was much greater than expected when compared with previous cancer genome studies. eVIDENCE was applied to the candidate variants and finally 70 SNVs and 7 indels remained. Of the 77 variants, 49 (63.6%) showed VAF of
