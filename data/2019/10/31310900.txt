Although several lines of evidence existed suggesting that Mortalin was linked with survival in malignant tumors; it has been barely described regarding the prognostic involvement of its expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, to understand the prognostic meaning of Mortalin expression, Immunohistochemistry was undertaken to observe the immunohistochemical characteristics of Mortalin on HCC tissue microarray consisting of 90 cases of HCC and its paired normal control dots, followed by detailed statistical analysis with the accompanying clinicopathological variables available, including gender, age, tumor size, differentiation, cirrhosis, vascular invasion, clinical stage, T classification and intrahepatic metastases. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted to analyze the prognostic difference for patients with high and low expression of Mortalin. It was exhibited that Mortalin was over-expressed in HCC tissues relative to paired normal control and elevated Mortalin significantly correlated with vascular invasion, clinical stage and intrahepatic metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that Mortalin was remarkably associated with overall survival and disease-free survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that expression of Mortalin was an independent prognostic factor in HCC. Collectively, the data we provided here support the prognostic prediction value of Mortalin in HCC.
