Objectives:Pancreatic steatosis or fatty pancreas refers to the fat accumulation in the pancreas, which can lead to inflammation and fibrosis, Î²-cell dysfunction, fibrosis, and, possibly, pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to study the prevalence of fatty pancreas and its risk factors in patients referred to an endosonography center.Methods:During 18 months, 228 patients who were referred to our endosonography center for various reasons were evaluated for fatty pancreas. Fatty pancreas was defined as hyperechoic pancreas echotexture compared with spleen echotexture. Demographic characteristics, past medical history, and laboratory measurements were compared between groups with and without fatty pancreas to determine the risk factors for fatty pancreas.Results:The prevalence of fatty pancreas was 25.9%. Patients with fatty pancreas had a significantly higher mean level of uric acid (P = 0.04), frequency of ischemic heart disease (P = 0.03), hyperlipidemia (P = 0.04), frequency of fatty liver (P < 0.001), and aortic intima thickness (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, substance abuse, and use of oral contraceptives in the 2 groups.Conclusions:Fatty pancreas is a common disorder. There are meaningful relationships between coronary artery disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver, and atherosclerosis with fatty pancreas.
