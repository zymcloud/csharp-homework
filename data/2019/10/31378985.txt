Background:Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionised the oncological landscape in the last few years. Possible applications include the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Unfortunately, new immune-related adverse effects have been associated with the use of these agents and the liver is one of the organs most frequently involved.Aims:To provide a general overview of the potential impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors on the liver METHODS: We reviewed the literature and abstracts/presentations on immune checkpoint inhibitors at most relevant hepatology meetings over the last 5 years.Results:The role of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been investigated both for the treatment of viral hepatitis and primary liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic hepatitis B show the greatest potential for treatment with these drugs in the near future. However, immune-related adverse events involving the liver are a growing concern related to their widespread use.Conclusions:Immune checkpoint inhibitors represent an exciting new class of drugs with currently limited application in malignant and non-malignant liver disease. Caution must be exercised on the emergence of potentially severe immune adverse reactions.
