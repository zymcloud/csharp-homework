Many studies have suggested that mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) might be functionally associated with tumor genesis and development. Although the heterogeneity of tumors is well known, most studies were based on the analysis of a single tumor sample. The extent of mtDNA diversity in the same tumor is unclear, as is whether the diversity is influenced by selection pressure. Here, we analyzed the whole exon data from 1 nontumor sample and 23 tumor samples from different locations of one single tumor tissue from a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient. Among 18 heteroplasmic sites identified in the tumor, only 2 heteroplasmies were shared among all tumor samples. By investigating the correlations between the occurrence and frequency of heteroplasmy (Het) and sampling locations (Coordinate), relative mitochondrial copy numbers, and single-nucleotide variants in the nuclear genome, we found that the Coordinate was significantly correlated with Het, suggesting no strong purifying selection or positive selection acted on the mtDNA in HCC. By further investigating the allele frequency and proportion of nonsynonymous mutations in the tumor mtDNA, we found that mtDNA in HCC did not undergo extra selection compared with mtDNA in the adjacent nontumor tissue, and they both likely evolved under neutral selection.
