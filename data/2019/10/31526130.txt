Introduction: The conventional management of most patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) is platinum-based chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy. Erdafitinib is an option in post-platinum patients with activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-3 and -2. Salvage therapy with taxanes or vinflunine has demonstrated minimal efficacy. Enfortumab Vedotin (EV), a monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting nectin-4 is under investigation in patients with advanced UC. Areas covered: This review describes the epidemiology and unmet needs of patients with metastatic UC and is focused specifically on heavily treated patients. We explore the rationale for targeting nectin 4 and the clinical development of EV; efficacy and safety data from the completed phase I and II studies are examined. Ongoing trials to definitively assess clinical outcomes in comparison to current therapy and trials exploring EV in combination are also highlighted. Expert opinion: There is an unmet need for new therapies in most patients with advanced UC and who progress after platinum and immunotherapy. EV has shown promising efficacy and safety in this population in phase 1 and 2 trials including those with poor prognostic factors such as liver metastases. Ongoing trials exploring this agent in combination will continue to advance the treatment of UC.
