With the recent decline in cost of high-throughput next-generation sequencing, detailed characterization of biliary tract and primary liver tumors continues to evolve. Recent studies have elucidated molecular signatures that reflect distinct pathways of carcinogenesis reflective of viral, parasitic, and toxin-related etiologic factors. With greater elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of disease, novel targets that may be potential clinically actionable continue to be identified.
