In this study, we mined out hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) driver genes from MEDLINE literatures by bioinformatics methods of pathway crosstalk and protein interaction network. Furthermore, the relationship between driver genes and their clinicopathological characteristics, as well as classification effectiveness was verified in the public databases. We identified 560 human genes reported to be associated with HCC in 1074 published articles. Functional analysis revealed that biological processes and biochemical pathways relating to tumor pathogenesis, cancer disease, tumor cell molecule, and hepatic disease were enriched in these genes. Pathway crosstalk analysis indicated that significant pathways could be divided into three modules: cancer disease, virus infection, and tumor signaling pathway. The HCC-related protein-protein interaction network comprised 10,212 nodes, and 56,400 edges were mined out to identify 18 modules corresponding to 14 driver genes. We verified that these 14 driver genes have high classification effectiveness to distinguish cancer samples from normal samples and the classification effectiveness was better than that of randomly selected genes. Present study provided pathway crosstalk and protein interaction network for understanding potential tumorigenesis genes underlying HCC. The 14 driver genes identified from this study are of great translational value in HCC diagnosis and treatment, as well as in clinical study on the pathogenesis of HCC.
