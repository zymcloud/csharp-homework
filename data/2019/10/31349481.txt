Combination of both internal- and external-stimuli responsive strategies in nanoplatforms can maximize therapeutic outcomes by overcoming drug efflux-mediated resistance and prolonging sustained release of therapeutic payloads in controlled and sequential manner. Here, we show a light/redox dual-stimuli responsive β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-gated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) that can effectively load and seal the chemotherapeutics, doxorubicin (DOX), inside MSN with a dual-capped system. The primary gatekeeper was achieved by capping β-CD via a disulfide linkage. An azobenzene/galactose-grafted polymer (GAP) was introduced to functionalize the MSN surface through host-guest interaction. GAP not only served as a secondary non-covalent polymer-gatekeeper to further prevent molecules from leaking out, but also presented targeting ligand for engagement of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. The controlled and stimuli release of DOX could be realized via dissociation of azobenzene moieties from β-CD cage upon UV-irradiation, followed by liberation with the endogenous glutathione. The in vitro studies verified the redox-sensitive DOX release behavior, and the UV irradiation could accelerate this process to trigger DOX burst from MSN-ss-CD/GAP. Notably, the DOX@MSN-ss-CD/GAP could more efficiently deliver DOX into HepG2 cells and demonstrate enhanced cytotoxicity as compared with HeLa and COS7 cells. The smart MSN-ss-CD/GAP delivery system holds the potential for universal therapeutic uses in both biomedical research and clinical settings.
