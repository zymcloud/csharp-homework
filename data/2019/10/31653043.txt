Oleocanthal and ligstroside aglycone are olive oil-derived polyphenols. The former interferes with tumor growth with minor or no cytotoxicity on non-tumorigenic primary cell lines. The information about the bioactivity of ligstroside aglycone are scanty, with the exception of a known antioxidant power. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor with high mortality rates. Systemic chemotherapy is only marginally effective and is frequently complicated by toxicity. Previous observations have shown that hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines become more sensitive to taxol when it is combined with Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα). The present work aimed to assess the effects of a polyphenolic extract containing both oleocanthal and ligstroside aglycone on proliferation and/or death in three liver cancer cell lines (HepG2, Huh7 and Hep3B). The possibility to enhance such effect by the addition of TNFα was also investigated. Both cell proliferation and death were enhanced by the exposure to the polyphenolic extract. Such effect was associated with induction of autophagy and could be potentiated by TNFα. The presence of ligstroside aglycone in the extract lowered the oleocanthal concentration required for cytotoxicity. These results show for the first time that the effects of a polyphenol extract can be potentiated by TNFα and that modulation of autophagy likely account for these effects.
