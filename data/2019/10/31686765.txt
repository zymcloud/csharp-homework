Background:Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are extremely effective in eradicating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in chronically infected patients. However, the protective role of the sustained virologic response (SVR) achieved by second- and third-generation DAAs against the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mortality is less well established.Aim:To examine the occurrence of HCC or death from any cause in a retrospective-prospective study of patients treated with DAAs.Methods:Patients were enrolled from a tertiary academic hospital center for liver disease management that collects subject data mainly from northeastern Italy. The study was conducted in 380 patients (age: 60 Â± 13 years, 224 males, 32% with cirrhosis) treated with DAAs with or without SVR (95/5%), with a median follow up of 58 wk (interquartile range: 38-117). The baseline anthropometric features, HCV viral load, severity of liver disease, presence of extra-hepatic complications, coinfection with HIV and/or HBV, alcohol consumption, previous interferon use, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and renal function were considered to be confounders.Results:The incidence rate of HCC in patients with and without SVR was 1.3 and 59 per 100 person-years, respectively (incidence rate ratio: 44, 95%CI: 15-136, P < 0.001). Considering the combined endpoint of HCC or death from any cause, the hazard ratio (HR) for the SVR patients was 0.070 (95%CI: 0.025-0.194, P < 0.001). Other independent predictors of HCC or death were low HCV viremia (HR: 0.808, P = 0.030), low platelet count (HR: 0.910, P = 0.041), and presence of mixed cryoglobulinemia (HR: 3.460, P = 0.044). Considering SVR in a multi-state model, the independent predictors of SVR achievement were absence of cirrhosis (HR: 0.521, P < 0.001) and high platelet count (HR: 1.019, P = 0.026). Mixed cryoglobulinemia predicted the combined endpoint in patients with and without SVR (HR: 5.982, P = 0.028 and HR: 5.633, P = 0.047, respectively).Conclusion:DAA treatment is effective in inducing SVR and protecting against HCC or death. A residual risk of HCC persists in patients with advanced liver disease or with complications, such as mixed cryoglobulinemia or renal failure.
