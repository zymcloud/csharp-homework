In the past decades, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been receiving increased attention due to rising morbidity and mortality in both developing and developed countries. Koumine, one of the significant alkaloidal constituents of Gelsemium elegans Benth., has been regarded as a promising anti-inflammation, anxiolytic, and analgesic agent, as well as an anti-tumor agent. In the present study, we attempted to provide a novel mechanism by which koumine suppresses HCC cell proliferation. We demonstrated that koumine might suppress the proliferation of HCC cells and promote apoptosis in HCC cells dose-dependently. Under koumine treatment, the mitochondria membrane potential was significantly decreased while reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was increased in HCC cells; in the meantime, the phosphorylation of ERK, p38, p65, and IκBα could all be inhibited by koumine treatment dose-dependently. More importantly, the effects of koumine upon mitochondria membrane potential, ROS production, and the phosphorylation of ERK, p38, p65, and IκBα could be significantly reversed by ROS inhibitor, indicating that koumine affects HCC cell fate and ERK/p38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling activity through producing excess ROS. In conclusion, koumine could inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells and promote apoptosis in HCC cells; NF-κB and ERK/p38 MAPK pathways could contribute to koumine functions in a ROS-dependent manner.
