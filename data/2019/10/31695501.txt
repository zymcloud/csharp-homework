Purpose:Circular RNA (circRNA) hsa_circ_0008450 has been shown to be up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the functional role of hsa_circ_0008450 and its molecular mechanism are still unknown.Patients and methods:We used qRT-PCR and Western blot to examine the expression levels of hsa_circ_0008450, microRNA-214-3p (miR-214-3p), and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) protein. CCK8 assay and wound healing assay were used to detect cell viability and cell migration capability. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Luciferase reporter assay was used to explore the interaction among hsa_circ_0008450, miR-214-3p, and EZH2.Results:hsa_circ_0008450 was significantly increased in HCC tissues and cells. Furthermore, knockdown of hsa_circ_0008450 in HCC cells inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Mechanically, hsa_circ_0008450 promoted the expression of EZH2 protein through sponging miR-214-3p. Knockdown of circ_0008450 suppressed tumorigenesis of HCC cells in vivo.Conclusion:Knockdown of hsa_circ_0008450 inhibits HCC progression by regulating miR-214-3p/EZH2 axis. This study suggests that hsa_circ_0008450 may serve as a novel target for the treatment of HCC.
