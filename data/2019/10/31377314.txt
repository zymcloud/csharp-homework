Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of widespread and diverse endogenous RNAs, have been identified as critical regulators of various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the specific roles of circRNAs in HCC are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel circRNA, circ-IGF1R, in HCC tumour tissues and cell lines. Circ-IGF1R levels were found to be significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with levels in paired peritumoural tissues. The high expression levels of circ-IGF1R in HCC were associated with tumour size. Moreover, knocking down circ-IGF1R with siRNA significantly attenuated cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro. Further investigation revealed that PI3K/AKT signalling pathway activation was involved in the oncogenic functions of circ-IGF1R in HCC. Our study suggests that circ-IGF1R may be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of HCC.
