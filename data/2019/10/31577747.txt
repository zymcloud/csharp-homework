Rationale:Bacteremia caused by polymicrobial infections are rare but dangerous. We report a case of hepatic abscess combined with polymicrobial bacteremia in a 49-year-old male patient after surgery and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Patient concerns:The patient was admitted to hospital with metastatic liver cancer for periodic chemotherapy and developed a high fever and tenderness to the liver following surgery and TACE.Diagnosis:Hepatic abscess combined with polymicrobial bacteremia.Interventions:The clinician formulated a therapy in accordance with the drug susceptibility test and the empirical drug use for anaerobic bacteria. A comprehensive treatment plan was adopted, on the basis of the combination of nitrazole and imipenem as anti-infection drugs as well as continuous abscess drainage.Outcomes:After comprehensive therapy, the patient was ultimately discharged without any residual symptoms.Lessons:Bloodstream infection caused by multiple bacteria increases the difficulty of anti-infection treatments, leading to poor treatment outcome and high mortality. Therefore, a fast and accurate diagnosis of polymicrobial bacteremia is key for initiation of an effective antimicrobial treatment. Additionally, pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics are advisable when patients have a history of abdominal surgery and are immune-compromised.
