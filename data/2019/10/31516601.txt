Our previous study reported the effectiveness of the product of tumor number and size (NxS factor) as a predictor of the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following hepatectomy. The aim of the present study was to validate the prognostic value of scoring systems based on the NxS factor for HCC. The records of 940 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC at Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine and Osaka International Cancer Institute were analyzed. The discriminatory abilities of the mathematical integrated model for tumor staging (MITS) score, which combines the NxS factor with liver function, and known prognostic systems, including the Japan Integrated Staging system, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program and the Tokyo system, were compared. Firstly, the present study demonstrated that a higher NxS factor was associated with decreased disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC (P
