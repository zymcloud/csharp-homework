Diosgenin and diosgenyl saponins as the major bioactive compounds isolated from dietary fenugreek seeds, yam roots, etc. possessed strong antitumor effects. To understand their detailed antitumor mechanisms, a fluorophore-appended derivative of diosgenin [Glc/CNHphth-diosgenin (GND)] was synthesized, starting from diosgenin and glucosamine hydrochloride in overall yields of 7-12% over 7-10 steps. Co-localization of GND with organelle-specific stains, transmission electron microscopy, and relative protein analyses demonstrated that GND crossed the plasma membrane through organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 and distributed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosome, and mitochondria. In this process, GND induced ER swelling, mitochondrial damage, and autophagosome and upregulating IRE-1α to induce autophagy and apoptosis. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor chloroquine delayed the appearance of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and inhibited cleaved caspase 8, which indicated that GND induced autophagy to activate caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. These observations suggested that diosgenyl saponin was a potent anticancer agent that elicited ER stress and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways in liver cancer.
