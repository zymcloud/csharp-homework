Golgi phosphoprotein 73 (GP73), encoded by GOLM1, is a highly expressed factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and has been regarded for several years as a remarkable serum biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC. Recently, it was found that upregulation of GP73 promotes cancer metastasis, but the mechanism is complex, and it is even unclear how the gene is transactivated in HCC cells. In this study, it was discovered that c-Myc transactivated GP73 in a mildly hypoxic microenvironment and that the activation of c-Myc upregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7). Moreover, it is shown that GP73 interacted with intracellular MMP-7 in the region of the cytoplasmic domain and facilitated the trafficking and secretion of MMP-7, resulting in cell metastasis. This study indicates that GP73 is transactivated by c-Myc and serves as a transporter in the trafficking of intracellular MMP-7 in HCC cells. These findings suggest that GP73 is a potential target for combating metastatic HCC.
