Background:Aspartate transaminase-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) are two non-invasive indexes to predict liver fibrosis in liver disease. This study was to use APRI and FIB-4 to detect chronic virus hepatitis in community screenings.Methods:From 2004 to 2013, a series of community-based health screenings for residents aged 40 and older were held in Tainan city. APRI and FIB-4 of each participant were calculated and their association further analyzed with hepatitis status.Results:We enrolled 180359 participants including 18726 (10.4%) hepatitis B virus (HBV), 13428 (7.4%) hepatitis C virus (HCV), 1337 (0.7%) HBV plus HCV and 146868 (81.5%) Non-HBV Non-HCV. The prevalence of chronic HCV increased with the elevation of APRI cut-offs or FIB-4 cut-offs (13.9%, 28.1%, 38.8%, 45.2%, to 49.9% in APRIâ‰¥0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9,1.1, pConclusions:Community screenings derived APRI or FIB-4 can identify patient subsets with increased of underlying HCV infection and risk of incident HCC.
