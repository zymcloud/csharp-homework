Ectopic hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare entity. Most cases are asymptomatic and are occasionally found during autopsy or laparoscopy. They may sometimes cause relevant clinical problems such as abdominal pain or intra-abdominal bleeding. In this clinical case report, we review the literature in order to decipher the case of a 68-year-old female with an ectopic hepatocellular carcinoma that arose from the peritoneum. The patient was diagnosed after being studied due to a mild asymptomatic hypertransaminasemia.
