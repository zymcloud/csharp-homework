Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is very common globally prevalent cancer. Due to its poor clinical prognosis, increasing the diagnostic rate of HCC is urgently needed. Herein, we validate discovered metabolomic biomarkers to distinguish Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) negative (AFP-) and positive (AFP+) individuals. Methods: We recruited 130 HCC subjects (independent case-control, randomized clinical cohorts) to our study. We separated the subjects randomly into two panels: (1) 58 individuals for the discovery panel; and (2) 72 individuals for the validation panel. For each panel, gender and age-matched hepatitis B group (HBG) and healthy group were included as controls. Plasma samples were collected for metabolic profiling by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics assays. We applied both non-targeted metabolomics analyses and targeted metabolomics analyses. Significantly changed metabolites (SCMs) were identified. The power of SCMs to discriminate HCC and HBG or healthy group was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results: Ten SCMs were selected form the discovery panel, and further verified in the validation panel. ROC analyses indicated that 1 SCMs (LysoPC (24:0)) could discriminate HCC from HBG (AUC = 0.765). Further, 8 SCMs including (LysoPC (17:0), LysoPC (20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), LysoPC (22:0), LysoPC (24:0), PE (P-16:0/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), SM (d18:1/22:1(13Z)), Creatinine, and L-Isoleucine) displayed a heightened ability to discriminate between HCC and healthy controls (AUC were more than 0.800). Most of these SCMs were important in lipid metabolism. Conclusions: LysoPC (24:0) could distinguished HCC from HBG, and 8 SCMs distinguished HCC from healthy controls. LysoPC and other metabolites have the potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers for HBV related AFP- and AFP+ HCC.
