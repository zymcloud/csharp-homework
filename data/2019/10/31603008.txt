Introduction: The randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III CELESTIAL trial demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement in overall survival with cabozantinib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with sorafenib. Most frequently reported adverse events included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, hypertension, increased aspartate aminotransferase, fatigue, and diarrhea. Areas covered: In this review we analyze and discuss preclinical and clinical data of cabozantinib. We summarize efficacy and safety results of phase II and III trials of cabozantinib in the treatment of patients with advanced HCC and we present ongoing trials of cabozantinib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Expert opinion: Cabozantinib is a new second-line and the only third-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC, nevertheless some data are still missing to better inform clinical decisions on how to treat specific patient populations. Next trials designs will have to incorporate heavy efforts in terms of translational research to maximize the benefits of such treatments.
