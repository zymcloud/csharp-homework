Background:Liver transplantation (LT) for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following liver resection (LR) has been considered a promising strategy for improving patient's outcome. The study aimed to analyse patients from primary LR to LT for HCC and to provide additional information for decision-making in therapeutic strategies for patients with HCC.Methods:Among 776 LTs, a retrospective analysis of patients who had undergone LT for recurrent HCC after primary LR between May 2005 and 2017 February was performed.Results:During the follow-up period, the overall recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 84.8%, 68.2% and 68.2%, and disease-specific overall-survival rates were 95.7%, 74.4% and 66.7% at 1, 3 and 5 years after LT, respectively. Beyond University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) transplantation criteria (p = 0.018, hazard ratio (HR) = 12.70), maximum tumor size ≥ 5 cm at LR (p = 0.012, HR = 7.90) and period between post-LR HCC recurrence and LT ≥ 1 year (p = 0.030, HR = 7.57) were prognostic factors of HCC recurrence after LT. Moreover, HCC recurrence after LT was the solely independent risk factor affecting overall survival of patients.Conclusion:Large tumor size at LR should be taken into cautious tending to HCC recurrence even after salvage LT. Importantly, LT should be considered as soon as possible preferably within 1 year whenever post-LR recurrent HCC meets transplantation criteria.
