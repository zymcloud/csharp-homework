Introduction:Accessory liver lobe (ALL) is a rare congenital anomaly. ALL combined with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is even rarer. Most ALLs with HCC are often located in the right liver, and are not supplied by the left hepatic artery.Patient concerns:A 77-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of the level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) continually increased for 1 month. He had no history of chronic hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis of the liver.Diagnoses:Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 3.0 × 3.0 × 1.0 cm ovaloid-shaped solid mass in the left subphrenic area with isodensity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass with a heterogeneous signal on T1- and T2-weighted images. On contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, the mass showed a pattern of early enhancement and washout. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed the mass was fed by the branch of left liver artery.Interventions:The mass was treated by transatheter arterial embolization (TAE) followed by surgical resection. Histopathologically showed HCC, consistent with a moderately differentiated.Outcomes:Follow-up of 3 months after surgery, the level of AFP returned to normal gradually.Conclusions:In this report, we describe a rare case of ALL with HCC, located in the left subphrenic area, especially which was supplied by the branch of left hepatic artery has rarely been described. The clinical presentation, radiological features are described in the literature.
