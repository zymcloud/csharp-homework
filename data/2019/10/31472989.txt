Based on our previous research, a series of targeting hepatocellular carcinoma complexes, [R-Glycyrrhetinic acid-CH2C2H-[Co2(CO)6] (R = H, 1; R = NSAIDs-COOH, 2-4; R = Aromatic acid, 5-7; R = Amino acid, 8-10), were synthesized. The test showed they are slow CO releasers. Using HeLa, A549, HT-29, SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells as models, their activities against tumor cell proliferation were firstly evaluated. The resulting data show all the complexes displayed a good anti-proliferation activity against the HepG2 and SMMC-7721 liver cancer cells, and their IC50 values were in the range of 10.07-66.06 µM; compared with cis-platin (DDP), their activities were comparable or even better under the same condition. Among them, complexes 3, 4, 6 and 9 exhibited higher anti-proliferation activities against HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines than the other cell lines. To confirm further these complexes have selectivity to the liver cells, the uptakes of complexes 3, 4, 6 and 9 by HepG2, HT-29, A549 and SMMC7721 cell lines were studied. The results show the cell uptake rates of the complexes by HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells were much greater than by other cells under the same condition. In following tests, the tested complexes displayed higher activities in inhibiting NF-kB, COX-2 and iNOS; and they induced HepG2 cells apoptosis by mitochondrial pathway, which assessed by staining with different fluorescent reagent DAPI, PI, Mito-Tracker Green and DCFH-DA. Meanwhile, the tested complexes up-regulated the expression levels of caspase-3 and Bax, down-regulated the Bcl-2 expression. In addition, they had no effect on zebrafish embryo survival, embryo hatching, embryonic movement, zebrafish malformation and zebrafish movement at below 0.5 µM. This suggests the complexes are potential candidates to be used in clinic for liver cancers.
