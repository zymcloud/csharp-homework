Aim:To evaluate whether elastic (stiffness) characteristics of tumours were associated with treatment responses and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE).Materials and methods:A retrospective cohort study of 59 HCC patients with unresectable HCC who underwent TACE was undertaken. Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging (ARFI) was used to measure tissue stiffness of the index tumours and non-tumoural liver before TACE treatment. The correlation between the parameters of tumour stiffness and treatment response to TACE was assessed using mRECIST criteria as well as according to patient survival.Results:Tumour stiffness and its stiffness difference between tumour and non-tumoural liver were significantly associated with tumour response to TACE (p=0.019 and 0.010, respectively). Patients with tumour stiffness of Conclusion:Tumour stiffness characteristics might be an added predictive marker of treatment response to TACE in patients with HCC.
