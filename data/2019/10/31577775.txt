Background:This study aimed to perform a network meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effect and safety of various modalities in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Typically, the modalities of interest were comprised of sorafenib, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), sorafenib combined with TACE, TACE combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and sorafenib combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC).Methods:Potentially eligible studies were systemically retrieved from the electronic databases (including PubMed and Cochrane Library) up to September 2018. The overall survival (OS) associated with the 5 modalities of interest enrolled in this study was compared by means of network meta-analysis. Meanwhile, major adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated.Results:The current network meta-analysis enrolled 7 published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and the pooled results indicated that the TACE-TCM regimen displayed the highest efficacy in treating advanced HCC, followed by HAIC-sorafenib. By contrast, the TACE alone and sorafenib alone regimens had the least efficacy. Relative to other regimens of interest, the TACE-TCM regimen was associated with less incidence of treatment-associated AEs.Conclusion:The TACE-TCM regimen was associated with higher treatment responses in advanced HCC patients than those of the other regimens of interest.
