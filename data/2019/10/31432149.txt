Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of tumor‑related mortalities worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs have been reported to be associated with tumor initiation, progression and prognosis. The present study aimed to explore the association between long noncoding RNA LINC00668 and its co‑expression correlated protein‑coding genes (PCGs) in HCC. Data of 370 HCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were used for analysis. LINC00668 and its top 10 PCGs were selected to determine their diagnostic and prognostic value. Molecular mechanisms were explored to identify metabolic processes that LINC00668 and its PCGs are involved in. Prognosis‑related clinical factors and PCGs were used to construct a nomogram for predicting prognosis in HCC. A Connectivity Map was constructed to identify candidate target drugs for HCC. The top 10 PCGs identified were: Pyrimidineregic receptor P2Y4 (P2RY4), signal peptidase complex subunit 2 (SPCS2), family with sequence similarity 86 member C1 (FAM86C1), tudor domain containing 5 (TDRD5), ferritin light chain (FTL), stratifin (SFN), nucleolar complex associated 2 homolog (NOC2L), peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), cancer/testis antigen 2 CTAG2 and leucine zipper and CTNNBIP1 domain containing (LZIC). FAM86C1, CTAG2 and SFN had significant diagnostic value for HCC (total area under the curve ≥0.7, P≤0.05); LINC00668, FAM86C1, TDRD5, FTL and SFN were of significant prognostic value for HCC (all P≤0.05). Investigation into the molecular mechanism indicated that LINC00668 affects cell division, cell cycle, mitotic nuclear division, and drug metabolism cytochrome P450 (all P≤0.05). The Connectivity Map identified seven candidate target drugs for the treatment of HCC, which were: Indolylheptylamine, mimosine, disopyramide, lidocaine, NU‑1025, bumetanide, and DQNLAOWBTJPFKL‑PKZXCIMASA‑N (all P≤0.05). Our findings indicated that LINC00668 may function as an oncogene and its overexpression indicates poor prognosis of HCC. FAM86C1, CTAG2 and SFN are of diagnostic significance, while FAM86C1, TDRD5, FTL and SFN are of prognostic significance for HCC.
