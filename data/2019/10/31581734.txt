Hypericum stellatum, a species endemic to China, is used to treat hepatitis by several ethnic groups in Guizhou Province. This research was inspired by the traditional medicinal usage of H. stellatum, and aims to explore the phytochemistry and bioactivity of H. stellatum to explain why local people in Guizhou widely apply H. stellatum for liver protection. In this study, two new prenylated xanthones, hypxanthones A (8) and B (9), together with seven known compounds, were isolated from the aerial parts of the plant. Spectroscopic data as well as experimental and calculated ECD spectra were used to establish the structures of these compounds. Six xanthones isolated in this study, together with four xanthones previously isolated from H. stellatum, were evaluated for their growth-inhibitory activities against five human liver carcinoma cell lines to analyze the bioactivity and structure-activity relationship of xanthones from H. stellatum. Isojacareubin (6) showed significant cytotoxicity against five human liver carcinoma cell lines, with an IC50 value ranging from 1.41 to 11.83 μM, which was stronger than the positive control cisplatin (IC50 = 4.47-20.62 μM). Hypxanthone B (9) showed moderate cytotoxicity to three of the five cell lines. Finally, structure-activity analysis revealed that the prenyl and pyrano substituent groups of these xanthones contributed to their cytotoxicity.
