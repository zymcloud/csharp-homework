Objective:To study the clinical effect of ultrasound-guided microwave ablation on primary hepatic carcinoma.Method:The subjects comprised 94 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma who were admitted to our hospital between August 2014 and November 2016. They were divided into two groups in accordance with a random-number table. The control (n = 47) and study (n = 47) groups received conventional surgical excision and ultrasound-guided microwave ablation, respectively. The operation duration, clinical effect, complication occurrence rates, and hepatic functions of the two groups were compared.Results:The control group exhibited longer duration of operation and length of stay but significantly lower quantities of intraoperative bleeding and blood transfusion (P 0.05).Conclusion:Ultrasound-guided microwave ablation treatment offers the advantages of minor injury and low complication occurrence rates. Moreover, it is associated with faster postoperative recovery and improved hepatic function. Thus, it is worthy as a clinical option and must be promoted and applied.
