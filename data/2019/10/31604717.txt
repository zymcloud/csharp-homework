Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a terminal, yet preventable, outcome of untreated infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is endemic in many areas of Latin America and the Caribbean, including Haiti. Haitians have the highest incidence of liver cancer among Caribbean immigrants. Unfortunately, many of these patients are not screened, despite current guidelines. As HBV is treatable, screening of high-risk populations is crucial to early intervention and prevention of poor outcomes. We highlight the case of a young Haitian male immigrant who presented with unintentional weight loss and epigastric pain and found to have HCC associated with HBV. Despite chemotherapy, the patient died 15 months after diagnosis. Increased awareness of HBV among patients from high-incidence countries may result in early recognition of this disease and reduced morbidity and mortality from devastating complications.
