Background:No studies have investigated whether narrow margin is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence outside transplantability criteria. The objective was to assess on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis whether hepatectomy with narrow margin affects the outcomes in patients enrolled in the salvage liver transplantation (LT) strategy.Methods:From 2007 to 2016, patients enrolled in the salvage LT strategy were divided into 2 groups: narrow (Results:A total of 81 patients were studied: 43 patients with narrow margin and 38 with wide margin. The recurrence rates, pattern and delay of recurrence, transplantability following recurrence, and ITT-OS were similar between the two groups. These results were maintained when comparing patients with R1 resection to those with R0 resection.Conclusion:On an ITT basis, hepatectomy with narrow margin or R1 resection did not impair the transplantability of recurrence and survival of patients enrolled in the salvage LT strategy. Narrow margin and even R1 resection following hepatectomy in the setting of salvage LT strategy should not be the basis for altering the strategy.
