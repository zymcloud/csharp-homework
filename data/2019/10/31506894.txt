Background:Increased expertise with minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS) could cause an unjustified extension of indications to resect liver benign disease (BD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the operative risk of MILS for BD and if implementation and diffusion of MILS have widened indications for BD resection.Methods:A prospective study including centers with > 6 MILS for BD, enrolled in the I Go MILS registry from January 2015 to October 2016. Cysts fenestrations were excluded.Results:Eight hundred eighteen MILS were performed in 15 centers. One hundred seventy-three of these (21.1%) were for BD: conversion rate was 6.9%, postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were 0 and 13.9%. During the same period, 3713 liver resections (open + MILS) were performed and 407 (11.0%) were for BD. A time-trend analysis showed that the total number of MILS and the number of MILS for malignant disease significantly increased, but this increasing trend was not documented for the number of MILS for BD, which remained stable during the study period of time. This trend was confirmed for the overall rate of resected BD (open + MILS) that remained stable.Discussion:BD represents a valid indication for MILS. For BD, 21.1% of MILS was performed, rate significantly lower than that previously reported in Italy. Although an evident growth of the use of MILS was observed during the time period analysis in Italy, this trend did not correspond to an increased number of MILS for BD, and the overall rate of resected BD was comparable to that reported in previous large open series.
