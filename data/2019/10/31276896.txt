Nineteen organoselenides were synthesized and tested for their intrinsic cytotoxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines and their corresponding selective cytotoxicity (SI) was estimated using normal lung fibroblast (WI-38) cells. Most of the organic selenides exhibited good anticancer activity, and this was more pronounced in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, the naphthoquinone- (5), thiazol- (12), and the azo-based (13) organic selenides demonstrated promising SI (up to 76). Furthermore, the amine 4c, naphthoquinone 5, and azo-based 13 and 15 organic selenides were able to down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and up-regulate the expression levels of IL-2, IL-6 and CD40 in HepG2 cells compared to untreated cells. Moreover, most of the synthesized candidates manifested good free radical-scavenging and GPx-like activities comparable to vitamin C and ebselen. The obtained results suggested that some of the presented organoselenium candidates have promising anti-HepG2 and antioxidant activities.
