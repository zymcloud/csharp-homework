Extrahepatic metastasis confers unfavorable patient prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, reliable markers allowing prediction of extrahepatic metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis are still lacking. This study was to identify gene-level copy number aberrations (CNAs) related to extrahepatic metastasis-free survival of HCC patients, and further examine the associations between CNAs and gene expression. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and expression array were used to analyze gene CNAs and expression levels, respectively. The associations between CNAs of a panel of 20 genes and extrahepatic metastasis-free survival were analyzed in 66 patients with follow-up period of 1.6-90.5 months. The gene expression levels between HCCs with and without gene CNA were compared in 109 patients with HCC. We observed that gains at MDM4 and BCL2L1, and losses at APC and FBXW7 were independent prognostic markers for extrahepatic metastasis-free survival of HCC patients. Integration analysis of aCGH and expression data showed that MDM4 and BCL2L1 were significantly upregulated in HCCs with gene gain, while APC and FBXW7 were significantly downregulated in HCCs with gene loss. We concluded that gene gains at MDM4 and BCL2L1, and losses at APC and FBXW7, with concordant expression changes, were associated with extrahepatic metastasis-free survival of HCC patients and have potential to act as novel prognostic markers.
