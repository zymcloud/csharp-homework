Several species of the Annonaceae plants have been used as complementary medicine for cancer-associated illnesses in some ethnic groups of northern Thailand. This study investigated the cytotoxic and cytostatic activity of methanolic extracts derived from the stems of these plants, including Uvaria longipes (Craib) L.L.Zhou, Y.C.F.Su & R.M.K.Saunders, Artabotrys burmanicus A.DC, Marsypopetalum modestum (Pierre) B.Xue & R.M.K.Saunders, and Dasymaschalon sp. Cell death induction of seven human cancer cell lines and cell cycle analyses were assessed by Annexin V and/or propidium iodide (PI) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. Treatment of cancer cell lines with the extract of four Annonaceae plants resulted in various cytotoxic activities depending on cell type. The extract of U. longipes exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity capable of inducing cell death of several cancer cell lines, particularly against hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B). This extract was capable of inducing cell cycle arrest at the SubG1 phase. Phytochemical screening of all the extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids, sterols, tannins, anthraquinone glycoside, coumarin, and flavonoids. Determination of active compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography standards revealed bullatacin and asiminecin in all the extracts. The extract of Annonaceae stem or its compounds may provide an opportunity for the development of new therapies against cancer.
