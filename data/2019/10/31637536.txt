Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological cancers; owning to its late detection and chemoresistance, understanding the pathogenesis of this malignant tumor is much critical. Previous studies have reported that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 39 (USP39) is generally overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer and so forth. Furthermore, USP39 is proved to be associated with the proliferation of malignant tumors. However, the function and mechanism of USP39 in ovarian cancer have not been elucidated. In the present study, we observed that USP39 was frequently overexpressed in human ovarian cancer and was highly correlated with TNM stage. Suppression of USP39 markedly inhibited the growth and migration of ovarian cancer cell lines HO-8910 and SKOV3 and induced cell cycle G2/M arrest. Moreover, knockdown of USP39 inhibited ovarian tumor growth in a xenograft model. In addition, our findings indicated that cell cycle arrest induced by USP39 knockdown might be involved in p53/p21 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we found that the depletion of USP39 inhibited the migration of ovarian cancer cells via blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Taken together, these results suggest that USP39 may play vital roles in the genesis and progression and may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and therapeutic target of ovarian cancer.
