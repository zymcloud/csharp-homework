Background:Limited data exist on the burden and features of non-cirrhotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States.Aim:To evaluate characteristics, aetiologies, trends and outcomes of non-cirrhotic HCC from 2000 to 2014 at five large US centres METHODS: Patient, tumour and liver disease aetiology data were collected. The presence of underlying cirrhosis was assessed based on published criteria.Results:Of 5144 eligible patients with HCC, 11.7% had no underlying cirrhosis. Non-cirrhotic patients were older (64.1 vs 61.2 years), more frequently females (33.9% vs 20.8%) and less frequently black (8.3% vs 12.4%) (P Conclusions:Nearly 12% of HCCs occurred in patients without underlying cirrhosis. NAFLD was the most common liver disease in these patients. During the study, the frequency of non-cirrhotic HCC decreased, whereas that of cirrhotic HCC increased. Although non-cirrhotic patients presented with more advanced HCC, their survival was better.
