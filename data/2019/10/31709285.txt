Hepatoma is one of the most common malignant tumor, and most patients have very poor prognosis. Early prediction and intervention of the hepatoma recurrence/metastasis are the most effective way to improve the patients' clinical outcomes. Here, we used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) based quantitative phospho-proteomics approach to identify biomarkers associated with hepatoma recurrence/metastasis in hepatoma cell lines with increasing metastasis ability. In total, 75 phosphorylated peptides corresponding to 60 phosphoproteins were significantly dysregulated. Bioinformatics analysis (GO, KEGG and IPA) allowed these data to be organized into distinct categories. These data represent the first in-depth proteomics analysis of a serial hepatoma cell lines with increasing invasion and metastasis potential. The data are related to (Xing et al., 2019).
