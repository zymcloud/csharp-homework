Although photothermal therapy (PTT) is preclinically applied in solid tumor treatment, incomplete tumor removal of PTT and heat endurance of tumor cells induces significant tumor relapse after treatment, therefore lowering the therapeutic efficiency of PTT. Herein, a programmable therapeutic strategy that integrates photothermal therapeutic agents (PTAs), DNAzymes, and artificial engineered natural killer (A-NK) cells for immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is designed. The novel PTAs, termed as Mn-CONASHs, with 2D structure are synthesized by the coordination of tetrahydroxyanthraquinone and Mn2+ ions. By further adsorbing polyetherimide/DNAzymes on the surface, the DNAzymes@Mn-CONASHs exhibit excellent light-to-heat conversion ability, tumor microenvironment enhanced T1 -MRI guiding ability, and antiheat endurance ability. Furthermore, the artificial engineered NK cells with HCC specific targeting TLS11a-aptamer decoration are constructed for specifically eliminating any possible residual tumor cells after PTT, to systematically enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PTT and avoid tumor relapse. Taken together, the potential of A-NK cells combined with antiheat endurance as a powerful strategy for immuno-enhancing photothermal therapy efficiency of solid tumors is highlighted, and the current strategy might provide promising prospects for cancer therapy.
