Cell freeze-drying can be divided into the freezing and drying processes. Mechanical damage caused by ice crystals and damage from solute during freezing shall not be ignored and lyoprotectants are commonly used to reduce those damages on cells. In order to study the mechanism of lyoprotectants to protect cells and determine an optimal lyoprotectant formula, the thermophysical properties and percentage of unfrozen water of different lyoprotectants in freezing were investigated with differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The survival rate indicated by trypan blue exclusion test and cell-attachment rate after 24 h using different lyoprotectants to freeze hepatoma Hep-G 2 cells were measured after cell cryopreservation. The results show that 40% (W/V) PVP + 10% (V/V) glycerol + 15% (V/V) fetal bovine serum + 20% (W/V) trehalose formula of lyoprotectant demonstrate the best effect in protecting cells during freezing, for cell-attachment rate after 24 h is 44.56% Â± 2.73%. In conclusion, the formula of lyoprotectant mentioned above can effectively protect cells.
