Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease globally. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have proven effective in curing HCV. However, the current standard of care (SOC) in Botswana remains PEGylated interferon-α (IFN-α) with ribavirin. Several mutations have been reported to confer resistance to interferon-based treatments. Therefore, there is a need to determine HCV genotypes in Botswana, as these data will guide new treatment guidelines and understanding of HCV epidemiology in Botswana.Methods:This was a retrospective cross-sectional pilot study utilizing plasma obtained from 55 participants from Princess Marina Hospital in Gaborone, Botswana. The partial core region of HCV was amplified, and genotypes were determined using phylogenetic analysis.Results:Four genotype 5a and two genotype 4v sequences were identified. Two significant mutations - K10Q and R70Q - were observed in genotype 5a sequences and have been associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while R70Q confers resistance to interferon-based treatments.Conclusion:Genotypes 5a and 4v are circulating in Botswana. The presence of mutations in genotype 5 suggests that some patients may not respond to IFN-based regimens. The information obtained in this study, in addition to the World health organization (WHO) recommendations, can be utilized by policy makers to implement DAAs as the new SOC for HCV treatment in Botswana.
