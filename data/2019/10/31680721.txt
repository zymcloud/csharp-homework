Thermal ablation is widely regarded as definitive therapy for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, but its efficacy decreases in tumors greater than 3 cm. Extensive clinical studies have supported improved outcomes provided through combining transarterial embolic therapy with ablation in the treatment of larger tumors. This article will provide a survey of the science and data for combination therapy in both thermal and nonthermal ablation modalities, as well as describe emerging applications.
