Purpose:To identify quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI perfusion parameters indicating tumor response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:This prospective pilot study was approved by our institutional review board; written and informed consent was obtained for each participant. Patients underwent DCE-MRI examinations before and after TACE. A variable flip-angle unenhanced 3D mDixon sequence was performed for T1 mapping. A dynamic 4D mDixon sequence was performed after contrast injection for assessing dynamic signal enhancement. Nonparametric analysis was conducted on the time-intensity curves. Parametric analysis was performed on the time-concentration curves using a dual-input single-compartment model. Treatment response according to Liver Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2018 was used as the reference standard. The comparisons within groups (before vs. after treatment) and between groups (nonviable vs. equivocal or viable tumor) were performed using nonparametric bootstrap taking into account the clustering effect of lesions in patients.Results:Twenty-eight patients with 52 HCCs (size: 10-104 mm) were evaluated. For nonviable tumors (n = 27), time to peak increased from 62.5 ± 18.2 s before to 83.3 ± 12.8 s after treatment (P-1 after treatment (P= 0.01).Conclusion:This prospective pilot DCE-MRI study showed that time to peak significantly changed after TACE treatment for both groups (nonviable tumors and equivocal or viable tumors). In our cohort, several perfusion parameters may provide an objective marker for differentiation of treatment response after TACE in HCC patients.
