As a kind of malignant tumor, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has attracted increasing attention from researchers. As a member of the circular RNA (circRNA) family, circ_0008450 has been investigated in hepatocellular carcinoma but not in NPC. This study aims to reveal the special biologic role and mechanism of circ_0008450 in NPC. qRT-PCR analysis was conducted to test the level of circ_0008450 in different tissues and cells. Loss/Gain of function assay was utilized to detect the influence of silenced/overexpressed circ_0008450 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of NPC cells. The mechanism of circ_0008450 was assessed by performing qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter experiments. The results showed that circ_0008450 was elevated in NPC tissues and cells. Silenced circ_0008450 could inhibit cell proliferation, and metastatic properties and increased the number of apoptotic cells. Ectopically expressed circ_0008450 strengthened the abovementioned malignant biological behaviors. Mechanistically, circ_0008450 reduced miR-577-mediated repression of CXCL9, resulting in facilitating the oncogenic functions of NPC. In conclusion, circ_0008450 acts as an oncogene in NPC cells through regulating miR-577/CXCL9 signaling. Our findings might provide a new therapeutic target for treating NPC.
