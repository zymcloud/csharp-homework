Background:Emerging data suggest the crucial regulatory roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the pathophysiology role of circZFR in HCC remains largely unknown.Aims:This study aims to disclose the functions of circZFR in HCC progression and its potential molecular mechanism.Methods:circZFR and miR-511 were identified by qRT-PCR. Colony formation assay, wound-healing assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry assay were performed to determine the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were utilized to evaluate the expression level of AKT1, GSK3β, β-catenin and cascades of proliferation-related proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to evaluate the interactions among circZFR, miR-511 and AKT1.Results:The expression of circZFR was enhanced and the expression of miR-511 was down-regulated in HCC tissues and cells. Functionally, circZFR silencing or miR-511 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis of HCC cells. Mechanistically, circZFR acted as a miR-511 sponge to up-regulate its target gene AKT1, which activated cascades of proliferation-related proteins (c-Myc, cyclin D1, Survivin and Bcl-2). Furthermore, depletion of circZFR inhibited tumorigenesis and decreased the expression level of AKT1 in xenograft models.Conclusion:circZFR promotes HCC progression by directly down-regulating miR-511 to activate AKT1 signaling, suggesting that circZFR is a potential target in HCC treatment. Targeting circZFR may provide therapeutic benefits for HCC.
