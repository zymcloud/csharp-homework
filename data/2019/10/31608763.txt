Objective: This review aims to highlight the clinicopathological characteristics and differential diagnosis of central hepatic regenerative nodules (CHRNs) in patients with Alagille syndrome. Methods: A review of the literature for cases of CHRNs and their differential diagnoses in patients with Alagille syndrome was performed and the main findings were collated. Results: Large, regenerative hepatic nodules are seen in approximately 30% of patients with Alagille syndrome. They are thought to be a functional adaptation to vascular changes rather than a neoplastic process. The nodules are typically centrally located, and normal hepatic vasculature coursing through the lesions are noted radiologically. Microscopically, they are characterized by well-circumscribed hepatic lesions with preserved architecture, lesser degrees of fibrosis and relative preservation of interlobular bile ducts compared to the background cirrhotic liver. Conclusion: Regenerative nodules are common in Alagille's syndrome, and should be distinguished from hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas for appropriate management and prognostication.
