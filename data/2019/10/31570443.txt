Background/aim:Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cannot be treated using traditional therapies. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) may provide a new treatment for HCC. In this study, the therapeutic efficacy and radiobiological effects of boric acid (BA)-mediated BNCT in a VX2 multifocal liver tumor-bearing rabbit model are investigated.Materials and methods:Rabbits were irradiated with neutrons at the Tsing Hua Open Pool Reactor 35 min following an intravenous injection of BA (50 mg 10B/kg BW). The tumor size following BNCT treatment was determined by ultrasonography. The radiobiological effects were identified by histopathological examination.Results:A total of 92.85% of the tumors became undetectable in the rabbits after two fractions of BNCT treatment. The tumor cells were selectively eliminated and the tumor vasculature was collapsed and destroyed after two fractions of BA-mediated BNCT, and no injury to the hepatocytes or blood vessels was observed in the adjacent normal liver regions.Conclusion:Liver tumors can be cured by BA-mediated BNCT in the rabbit model of a VX2 multifocal liver tumor. BA-mediated BNCT may be a breakthrough therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
