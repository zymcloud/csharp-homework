Objective: To investigate whether type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the occurrence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and to compare the effects of different nature of diabetes duration on the risk of different anti-diabetic drugs. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. (1) 325 cases with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis complicated with primary hepatocellular carcinoma were selected as the study group and 601 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis as the control group. The relationship between diabetes mellitus and the risk of primary liver cancer was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. (2) Selected the study group and control group combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and used multivariate logistic regression analysis to study the relationship between diabetes-related factors and the risk of primary liver cancer. Results: The incidence of diabetes was 14.2% in the study group and 6.0% in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant between the two groups (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that type 2 diabetes was one of the independent risk factors for primary hepatocellular carcinoma, which had increased the risk of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.982, 95% CI: 1.224-3.210). Patients with diabetes > 10 years (adjusted ratio: AOR value 6.011, 95% CI: 1.659-21.777) were at significantly higher risk for primary hepatocellular carcinoma than that of patients with diabetes < 10 years. Metformin (adjusted odds ratio: AOR 0.188, 95% CI: 0.052-0.688) had reduced the risk, while insulin (adjusted odds ratio: AOR 6.682, 95% CI: 1.899-23.510) had increased the risk. Conclusion: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the independent risk factors for primary HCC, which can increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B cirrhosis in relation to the duration of diabetes mellitus. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is higher in patients with duration of diabetes > 10 years and metformin reduces the risk.
