Objective: To investigate the curative effect of local application of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) combined with 4-1BB monoclonal antibody in hepatoma-bearing mice, and to evaluate the effect of 4-1BB monoclonal antibody on CpG-ODN immunotherapy. Methods: H22 single cell suspension was injected subcutaneously into the axilla and four limbs of the BALB/c male mice to establish a tumor-bearing mice model. After 7 days, 30 mice with corresponding tumor-bearing volume were screened and randomly divided into model control group, CpG group and CpG+4-1BB group, and the drug was injected into the tumors of left lower extremity. The same batch of normal mice was selected as normal control group. Survival of mice was recorded. Tumor-bearing volume and organ index were calculated. Serum levels of interleukin (IL) - 12 and interferon (IFN) gamma and spleen CD8(+)T lymphocyte ratio were measured. The measurement data were analyzed by analysis of variance. The survival rate of each group of mice was analyzed by log-rank test. Results: Mice in the model control group with tumor-bearing volume had a sustained growth before the execution. CpG group and the CpG+4-1BB group [(976.08 ± 29.55) mm(3), (47.25 ± 0.93) mm(3))] tumor-bearing volume was decreased than model group [(1 336.52 ± 39.40) mm3] (F = 5 329.273, P < 0.05). CpG+4-1BB group distant tumor-bearing volume [(611.83 ± 113.02) mm3] was decreased than model group and CpG group [(1 406.62 ± 51.09) mm(3), (1 380.01 ± 51.44) mm3] (F = 247.160, P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the CpG group and the model group (P > 0.05). Serum IL-12 concentration (23.90 ± 2.33 pg/ml), IFN-γ concentration (103.02 ± 6.10 pg/ml) and spleen CD8(+)T cell ratio (4.54 ± 0.62%) in the model group were lower than those in the normal group (P < 0.05). Serum IL-12 concentration in CpG group and CpG+4-1BB group (29.21 ± 2.23 pg/ml, 37.04 ± 1.49 pg/ml), IFN-γ concentration (116.12 ± 4.08 pg/ml, 138.65 ± 1.72 pg/ml), CD8(+)T cell ratio (6.65 ± 0.64%, 12.73 ± 0.88%) were higher than the model group, while CpG+4-1BB group was higher than the CpG group (P < 0.05). The survival rate of CpG+4-1BB group was higher than that of model group and CpG group (χ(2) = 25.544, P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between CpG group and model group (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in organ index between the four groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: 4-1BB monoclonal antibody combined with CpG-ODN therapy can shrink hepatoma-bearing capacity, inhibit the growth of distant tumors and significantly prolong the survival time of mice.
