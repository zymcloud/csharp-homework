Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related mortality in the world, with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) representing the most common primary subtype. Two-thirds of HCC patients have advanced disease when diagnosed, and for these patients, treatment strategies remain limited. In addition, there is a high incidence of tumor recurrence after surgical resection with the current treatment regimens. The development of novel and more effective agents is required. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) constitute a family of 21 different protein kinases involved in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance, and are evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials as chemotherapeutics. To summarize and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting CDKs in HCC, recent published articles identified from PubMed were comprehensively reviewed. The key words included hepatocellular carcinoma, cyclin-dependent kinases, and CDK inhibitors. This review focuses on the emerging evidence from studies describing the genetic and functional aspects of CDKs in HCC. We also present an overview of CDK inhibitors that have shown efficacy in laboratory studies of HCC. Although many of the studies assessing CDK-targeting therapies in HCC are at the preclinical stage, there is significant evidence that CDK inhibitors used alone or in combination with established chemotherapy drugs could have significant applications in HCC.
