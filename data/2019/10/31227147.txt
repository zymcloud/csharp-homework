Chitosan samples from two mushroom species (Boletus bovinus, Laccaria laccata) were obtained and characterized by viscosimetry, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), elemental analyses (EA), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses. Properties of the fungal chitosan samples were compared to commercial low-molecular weight chitosan, crustacean chitosan (Cervimunida johni) and chitosan obtained from an insect (Hilobius abietis). Additionally, the cytotoxic properties of chitosan in vitro on cancerous hepatoma and non-cancerous ovary cells cultivated on films with different chitosan concentrations was evaluated. As a conclusion, this study clearly revealed that low-molecular weight chitosan films and solutions with high degree of deacetylation can act cytotoxically on both tumor MH-22A and normal CHO cells in vitro. Consequently, this work may be useful for further investigations of natural anticancer products in medical areas.
