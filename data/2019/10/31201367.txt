A previous study revealed that therapeutic miR-26a delivery suppresses tumorigenesis in a murine liver cancer model, whereas we found that forced miR-26a expression increased hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell migration and invasion, which prompted us to characterize the causes and mechanisms underlying enhanced invasion due to ectopic miR-26a expression. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that miR-26a promoted migration and invasion of BEL-7402 and HepG2 cells in vitro and positively modulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-10 expression. In addition, exogenous miR-26a expression significantly enhanced the metastatic ability of HepG2 cells in vivo. miR-26a negatively regulated in vitro proliferation of HCC cells, and miR-26a overexpression suppressed HepG2 cell tumor growth in nude mice. Further studies revealed that miR-26a inhibited cell growth by repressing the methyltransferase EZH2 and promoted cell migration and invasion by inhibiting the phosphatase PTEN. Furthermore, PTEN expression negatively correlated with miR-26a expression in HCC specimens from patients with and without metastasis. Thus, our findings suggest for the first time that miR-26a promotes invasion/metastasis by inhibiting PTEN and inhibits cell proliferation by repressing EZH2 in HCC. More importantly, our data also suggest caution if miR-26a is used as a target for cancer therapy in the future.
