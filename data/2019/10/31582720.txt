We investigated the mechanism underlying the effect of a combination treatment of 125I radioactive seed implantation and lobaplatin (LBP) in hepatocellular carcinoma. The effects of administration of HCC cells and subcutaneous tumor model of mice with different doses of 125I or a sensitizing concentration of LBP alone, or in combination, on cellular apoptosis and proliferation were analyzed and it was confirmed that LBP promotes 125I-induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of HCC. Furthermore, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification labeling analyses suggested that 125I promoted the apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of HCC cells by upregulating the expression of PERK-eIF2Î±-ATF4-CHOP pathway, a well-known apoptosis-related pathway. Moreover, LBP was found to boost the 125I-induced upregulation of this pathway and increase the apoptosis. Our data indicate that LBP promotes the apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of 125I and provide a firm foundation for better clinical application of this combination therapy.
