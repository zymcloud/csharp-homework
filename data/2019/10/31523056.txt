Background:The Copper Metabolism MURR1 (COMM) domain family has been reported to play important roles in tumorigenesis. As a prototype for the COMMD family, the expression pattern and biological function of COMMD6 in human tumours remain unknown.Methods:COMMD6 expression in BALB/c mice and human tissues was examined using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to evaluate the prognosis of COMMD6 in tumours. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and transcriptional regulation network were constructed based on differentially expressed mRNAs, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs from the cancer genome atlas database. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were used to explore the bioinformatics implication.Results:COMMD6 expression was widely observed in BALB/c mice and human tissues, which predicted prognosis of cancer patients. Furthermore, we shed light on the underlying tumour promoting role and mechanism of COMMD6 by constructing a TEX41-miR-340-COMMD6 ceRNA network in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and miR-218-CDX1-COMMD6 transcriptional network in cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, COMMD6 may modulate the ubiquitination and degradation of NF-ÎºB subunits and regulate ribonucleoprotein and spliceosome complex biogenesis in tumours.Conclusions:This study may help to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of COMMD6 in human tumours, providing a potential biomarker for tumour prevention and therapy.
