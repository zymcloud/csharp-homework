Surgical management of primary liver and biliary tract tumors has evolved over the past several decades, resulting in improved outcomes in these malignancies with historically poor prognoses. Expansion of patient selection criteria, progress in neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies, development of techniques to increase future liver remnant, and the select utilization of liver transplantation have all contributed to increasing the patient pool for surgical intervention. Ongoing and future studies need to focus on improving multimodality treatment regimens and further refining the selection criteria for transplantation in order to optimize utilization of limited organ resources.
