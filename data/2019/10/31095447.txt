The present research was major in investigating the regulation association among hsa_circ_0101432 (has_circ_RPPH1), miR-1258, miR-622 and MAPK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we explored the mechanism underlying pathogenesis of HCC. Microarray analysis was employed to detect hsa_circ_0101432 expression in HCC. Hsa_circ_0101432 was verified as a circRNA by testing divergent primers and RNase R. And qRT-PCR was performed to determine the expression of hsa_circ_0101432, miR-1258, miR-622 and MAPK1 mRNA. Furthermore, miRanda predicted that mRNAs targeted miR-1258 and miR-622. CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry as well as transwell assay were performed to detect cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis and invasive ability, respectively. Xenograft in nude mice was applied to observe tumor growth in vivo. Up-regulated hsa_circ_0101432 and down-regulated miR-1258 and miR-622 were detected in HCC while Hsa_circ_0101432 enhanced expression of MAPK1 mRNA by targeting miR-1258 and miR-622. Knocking down hsa_circ_0101432 or overexpressing miR-1258 and miR-622 inhibited proliferation and invasive ability of HCC cell and promoted cell apoptosis. Hsa_circ_0101432 was confirmed to promote tumor growth via inhibiting miR-1258 and miR-622 expression and promoting MAPK1 mRNA expression by in vivo experiment. Hsa_circ_0101432 inhibited HCC cell apoptosis, promoted cell proliferation, invasive ability and HCC tumor growth by targeting miR-1258 and miR-622 and upregulating MAPK1 mRNA expression.
