In a comatose patient with acute subdural haematoma, the polytrauma spiral indicated pulmonary metastasising renal carcinoma, which limited therapeutic possibilities. Whole-body positron-emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) was performed with fluorodesoxyglucose. Renal carcinoma with pulmonary, nodal and parotidal metastases was proved. A cerebral metastasis could not be excluded because of perifocal hypermetabolism. There were few therapeutic possibilities. PET/CT is possible and sensible in the unconscious patient to differentiate the results of polytrauma-CT.
