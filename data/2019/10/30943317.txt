The gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a digestive neoplasm of mesenchymal lineage. The treatment strategy for receptor tyrosine kinase-mutated GISTs is well defined. Wild-type GISTs (WT-GISTs) respond unsatisfactorily to specific kinase inhibitors. Moreover, evidence shows that repeat surgery has limited benefit. We report the case of a young female patient who was diagnosed with liver metastatic WT-GIST, after initial radical resection and adjuvant therapy with molecular targeted drugs. Due to the disease progression, a two-stage surgery was performed, with the removal of extrahepatic lesions followed by a total hepatectomy. The patient is disease-free after 4 years from liver transplantation (LT), performed under everolimus-based immunosuppression. The treatment of WT-GISTs remains a significant challenge due to the frequent resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Liver transplantation might represent an effective treatment option for such disease.
