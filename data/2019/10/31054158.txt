Aims:SMAD4 (DPC4) is a tumour suppressor gene that is dysregulated in various tumour types, particularly pancreaticobiliary and gastrointestinal carcinomas. Corresponding loss of protein expression has been reported in approximately 50% of pancreatic and 25% of colonic adenocarcinomas. In the evaluation of carcinoma of unknown primary site, immunohistochemical loss of SMAD4 expression is often used to suggest pancreaticobiliary origin, but there are limited data on the spectrum of SMAD4 expression in carcinomas of other sites. This study evaluates the frequency of SMAD4 loss in a large cohort of carcinomas from diverse anatomical sites.Methods and results:Immunohistochemistry for SMAD4 was performed on tissue microarrays or whole tissue sections of 1210 carcinomas from various organs: gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas/biliary tract, lung, breast, thyroid, kidney, ovary and uterus. Expression was considered lost when there was complete absence of staining in tumour cell nuclei, in the presence of intact staining in non-neoplastic cells. SMAD4 loss was seen in 58% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 27% of appendiceal adenocarcinomas, 19% of colorectal adenocarcinomas, 16% of cholangiocarcinomas, 10% of lung adenocarcinomas and Conclusion:In addition to pancreaticobiliary, appendiceal and colonic tumours, SMAD4 loss is also seen in a small subset of other carcinomas, specifically breast, lung, oesophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas, all of which are typically CK7-positive, similar to pancreaticobiliary carcinoma. Awareness of SMAD4 loss in these other carcinoma types is helpful in the evaluation of carcinomas of unknown or uncertain primary site.
