Purpose:To describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Methods:MRI examinations of 21 patients with HCC and NASH were analyzed by two observers. There were 18 men and 3 women with a mean age of 67.9 ± 10.2 (SD) years (range: 36-85 years). Images were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with respect to imaging presentation.Results:HCC presented as a single tumor in 13/21 patients (62%), with a mean longest diameter of 26.9 ± 20.2 (SD) mm (range: 12-88 mm); 17/30 HCC (57%) had a largest diameter Conclusions:Our results show that 57% of HCC in NASH can present as a lesion smaller than 20 mm and 40% do not display wash-out. These results suggest that classical imaging criteria developed for noninvasive diagnosis of HCC should be applied with caution to HCC in patients with NASH.
