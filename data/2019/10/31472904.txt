Biliary tract and primary liver tumors can be divided into intrahepatic and extrahepatic sites. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are the most common primary liver malignancies, making up 75% and 15% of cases, respectively. In the United States, there has been an increase in incidence of HCC and cholangiocarcinoma over the last 2 decades, and it is probable that the incidence of both will continue to climb. Gallbladder cancer, however, is the most frequent biliary tract cancer, comprising 80% to 90% of biliary tract cancers worldwide. Underlying epidemiology and cause are discussed.
