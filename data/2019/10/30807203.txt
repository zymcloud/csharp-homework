Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Tumor response rate of liver cancer patients towards systemic chemotherapy is low and chemoresistance can easily develop. Identifying novel molecules that can repress drug resistance and metastasis of liver cancer will facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study is to determine the roles of NUAK1 and miR-204 in the drug resistance and metastasis of liver cancer and to reveal their relationship. We found that NUAK1 was increased in the tumor of primary liver cancer. Knockdown of NUAK1 significantly inhibited cell growth and migration. Moreover, NUAK1 was the direct downstream target of miR-204, and there was clinical relevance between miR-204 down-regulation and NUAK1 up-regulation in liver cancer. Furthermore, we found that miR-204 increased drug sensitivity by down-regulating NUAK1 expression. Based on these results, we identified miR-204 as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting NUAK1 expression in liver cancer, indicating both miR-204 and NUAK1 may act as promising targets for liver cancer therapy.
