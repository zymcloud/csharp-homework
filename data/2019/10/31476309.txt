Aims:In the tumor microenvironment, dysregulated immune cells could promote tumor progression, invasion and metastasis, by establishing a symbiotic relationship with cancer cells. A pivotal role is played by monocyte recruitment and induction of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which provide immunosuppression and tumorigenesis. The effect of nemorosone, an antiproliferative phytocomponent present in Cuban Propolis, on TAM-induced tumor progression remains to be elucidated. Here we investigated the symbiotic relationship between monocytic leukemia THP-1 and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, and the role of nemorosone in preventing TAM-induced tumor growth.Main methods:Macrophage differentiation induced by HepG2-conditioned medium was assessed by flow cytometry, analysis of secreted molecules and cytokine expression. The effect of nemorosone and/or conditioned THP-1-medium on HepG2 proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, colony formation, cells cycle and migration assays.Key findings:HepG2 cells induced THP-1 recruitment and differentiation to macrophages. When compared with control THP-1 cells, differentiated THP-1 showed a significant increase of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression (P Significance:HepG2-conditioned medium is a suitable model for THP-1 modulation and differentiation. Moreover, nemorosone significantly inhibits the proliferation of HepG2 cells, both in presence and absence of the soluble factors secreted by TAMs. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of this natural compound in the HCC-TAM relationship.
