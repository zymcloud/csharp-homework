OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively assess perfusion reductions occurring in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using 2D perfusion angiography and to evaluate the relationships between various 2D perfusion angiography parameter changes and short-term tumor response. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. This prospective study included 172 patients (144 men and 28 women; mean [± SD] age, 65.4 ± 10.2 years) who underwent TACE for HCC between November 2015 and November 2017. Two-dimensional perfusion angiography was performed before and after TACE. Pre- and postprocedural CT images were also reviewed. Index lesions were defined as all discrete lesions 1.5 cm or larger. The tumor response was assessed using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Periprocedural 2D perfusion angiography parameters, including the arrival time, time to peak, wash-in rate, width, AUC, and mean transit time, were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Correlations between 2D perfusion angiography parameter changes and objective tumor response were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS. A total of 187 lesions meeting the inclusion criteria were identified in 172 patients. All analyzed 2D perfusion angiography parameters were significantly different after versus before TACE (p < 0.001). A significant relationship between periprocedural change in AUC and short-term tumor response was found (odds ratio, 1.535; 95% CI, 1.314-1.793; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. Two-dimensional perfusion angiography could objectively quantify perfusion reductions and predict short-term tumor response to TACE in patients with HCC.
