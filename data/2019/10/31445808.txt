Development, course of disease and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are strongly influenced by the immune system. Immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) have been shown to negatively impact disease progression and survival. To further understand the mechanisms of Treg attraction to HCC lesions, this study provides an analysis of Treg attracting chemokines in human HCC tissues. We analysed the expression of the Treg attracting chemokines CCL1 and CCL22 as well as the infiltration of FoxP3+ Treg and CD8+ T cells in paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 62 HCC patients. Expression of both chemokines was detected in 47 of 62 tissue slides. Chemokine expression was generally higher in tumour stroma and peritumoural liver tissue than in the tumour tissue itself. CD8+ T cells and FoxP3+ Treg were found at high levels in many tumour tissues. Intratumoural infiltration of Treg positively correlated with CCL22 levels in peritumoural liver tissue. In contrast, no correlation of Treg numbers and expression of CCL1 was detected. In summary, we describe here that the chemokines CCL1 and CCL22 are expressed in HCC tissues and, to a higher extent, in the stroma and peritumoural liver tissue. CCL22 may contribute to Treg recruitment and immunosuppression, whereas the role of CCL1 remains to be defined. It will be interesting to investigate the potential of these chemokines as drug targets for cancer therapy.
