Background/aim:Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known as an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, surgical outcomes in patients with DM and HCC have not been evaluated in detail.Patients and methods:We retrospectively studied 177 patients with type 2 DM who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC. Surgical outcomes after curative hepatectomy and prognostic factors were evaluated among 75 patients with DM and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related HCC and 102 patients with DM and viral or alcoholic hepatitis (VAH)-related HCC.Results:The 5-year survival rate and 5-year recurrence-free survival rate were significantly higher in the DM and/or NASH-related HCC group (87% and 51%) than in the DM and VAH-related HCC group (68%: p=0.0001 and 26%: p=0.0002). Multivariate analysis showed DM and/or NASH-related HCC to be significant independent prognostic factors for overall survival and recurrence-free survival.Conclusion:Patients with DM and/or NASH-related HCC showed more favorable surgical outcomes after hepatectomy in patients with DM and HCC.
