Background:This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal vein invasion (PVI).Methods:HCC patients with PVI treated with radiotherapy from 2007 to 2016 were analysed. CFRT was administered at a median dose of 51.5 Gy (interquartile range, 45-54 Gy) with 1.8-3 Gy per fraction. SABR was administered at a median dose of 45 Gy (interquartile range, 40-48 Gy) with 6-12.5 Gy per fraction. Treatment efficacy, toxicity, and associated predictors were assessed.Results:Among the 104 evaluable patients (45 in the SABR group and 59 in the CFRT group), the overall response rate (ORR, complete and partial response) was significantly higher in the SABR group than the CFRT group (62.2% vs. 33.8%, p = 0.003). The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate (34.9% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.012) and in-field progression-free survival (IFPS) rate (69.6% vs. 32.2%, p = 0.007) were also significantly higher in the SABR vs. CFRT group. All 3 rates remained higher in the SABR group after propensity score matching. Multivariable analysis identified SABR and a biologically effective dose ≥65 Gy as favourable predicators of OS. There was no difference between treatment groups in the incidence of radiation-induced liver disease or increase of Child-Pugh score ≥ 2 within 3 months of radiotherapy.Conclusions:SABR was superior to CFRT in terms of ORR, OS, and IFPS. We suggest that SABR should be the preferred technique for HCC patients with PVI.
