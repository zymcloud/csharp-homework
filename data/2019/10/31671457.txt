Purpose:The aim was to assess the value of intra-procedural CT/MR-ultrasound (CT/MR-US) fusion imaging in the management of thermal ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. From May 2010 to October 2016, 543 HCC nodules in 440 patients (387 men and 53 women; age range: 25-84 years) that met the Milan Criteria were treated by percutaneous thermal ablation using intra-procedural CT/MR-US fusion imaging. The HCC nodules were divided into subgroups and compared (â‰¤ 3 cm and > 3 cm, or high-risk and low-risk location, or inconspicuous and conspicuous, respectively). Technique efficacy and major complication were calculated. Cumulative local tumor progression (LTP), tumor-free and overall survival rates were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:CT/MR-US fusion imaging was successfully registered in 419 patients with 502 nodules. The technique efficacy rate of thermal ablation was 99.4 %. The major complication rate was 1.9 %. The cumulative LTP rates were 3.2 %, 5.6 % and 7.2 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. There were no significant differences for the comparisons of cumulative LTP rates between different subgroups (P = 0.541, 0.314, 0.329). The cumulative tumor-free survival rates were 74.8 %, 54.0 % and 37.5 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The cumulative overall survival rates were 97.8 %, 87.1 % and 81.7 % at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.Conclusion:Intra-procedural CT/MR-ultrasound fusion imaging is a useful technique for percutaneous liver thermal ablation. It could help to achieve satisfying survival outcomes for HCC patients who meet the Milan Criteria.
