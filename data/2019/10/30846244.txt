Background:Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a challenging surgical intervention that remains the cornerstone in the treatment of localized periâ€‘ampullary pathologies. The concept of treatment standardization has been well-established in many high-volume centers in the world. Here, we present our experience in pancreaticoduodenectomy from 1994 to 2015.Methods:We performed a retrospective review of the medical charts of patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy at our institution. Data was entered to SPSS statistical software and analyzed. The Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests were used to report statistical differences between groups.Results:Of the 370 patients who underwent pacreaticoduodenectomy, 300 were analyzed. The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year survival rates were 85%, 35%, 15%, and 7%, respectively with a 30-day mortality rate of 5.0% (15 patients). The median age of the patients was 61 (13-84) years, with 193 (64.3%) males and 107 (35.7%) females. The median operative time was 300 (130-570) min. The median postoperative length of hospital stay was 12 (5-76) days. Thirty-two patients required re-laparotomies; 10 for pancreatic leak, 7 for biliary leak and 15 for control of bleeding. Seventy-five (25.0%) patients developed pancreatic fistulae. Delayed gastric emptying was present in 31 (10.3%) patients. A significant improvement in surgical outcome was observed in cases done after 2008 which indicates the important role of specialized team in surgical management.Conclusions:The number of patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy has been increasing annually over the past twenty-two years in our institution with results comparable to published series from high-volume centers. Through standardization of surgical techniques and perioperative management carried out by a specialist team, our results continue to improve despite the increasing complexity of cases referred to our unit.
