Endoscopic and percutaneous therapies have been shown to prolong life and reduce morbidity for patients with unresectable advanced stages of primary hepatobiliary malignancies. This article reviews pertinent studies published within the last 5 years that involve locoregional techniques to manage hepatocellular carcinoma, perihilar and distal cholangiocarcinoma. A major emphasis is placed on photodynamic therapy, radiofrequency ablation, irreversible electroporation, and microwave ablation. Technical advances, combinational therapies, and postintervention outcomes are discussed. Despite widespread application, high-quality evidence does not show superiority of any particular locoregional technique for treating advanced hepatobiliary cancers.
