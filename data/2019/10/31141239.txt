Real-world data evaluating the effectiveness of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment have been reported from different regions. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical outcomes of daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) ± ribavirin (RBV) in a prospective multicentre cohort study including patients from Argentina and Brazil who received DCV/SOF ± RBV for 12 or 24 weeks from 2015 to 2018. Multivariable logistic regression models were carried out to identify factors associated with failure to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) as a primary end point, and to death, decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver transplantation (LT) as a composite secondary end point. From a total of 1517 patients treated with DCV/SOF, 906 completed 12 weeks post-treatment evaluation and were included in the analysis. Overall SVR12 rate was 96.1% (95% CI: 94.6%-97.2%), and 95% (95% CI: 92.8%-96.6%) in patients with cirrhosis. LT recipients and presence of cirrhosis were independently associated with failure to achieve SVR. During post-SVR12 follow-up, cumulative incidence of the secondary end point was 2.4% (95% CI: 1.5%-3.6%); two patients died from nonliver-related causes and two from HCC, five underwent LT, 12 developed HCC and 17 patients developed hepatic decompensation. Independent variables associated with these composite secondary end points were prior to HCV treatment and presence of cirrhosis. In conclusion, although the high pangenotypic effectiveness of DCV/SOF ± RBV was confirmed in our real-life cohort, patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis showed higher risk of non-SVR and complication appearance during treatment or after achieving SVR.
