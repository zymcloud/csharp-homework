Background:Repeat liver resection (RLR) for recurrent HCC (rHCC) is a widely accepted treatment modality. However, early recurrence rate is high, frequently resulting in futile resection. We performed this study to evaluate preoperative factors, including the value of inflammatory indices, in predicting early (Methods:This is a retrospective study of 80 patients where 90 operative cases of RLR and 84 cases of early recurrence (Results:There were 31 (34.4%) early recurrences with a 5-year OS of 38.9%. Elevated platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) >103.6 was a significant independent preoperative predictor of both early recurrence, relative risk (RR) 4.284 (P = 0.001) and OS, RR 2.139 (P = 0.027), while alphafetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 200 was a significant independent preoperative predictor of early recurrence only, RR 11.655 (P = 0.030). Patients were followed-up at a median of 14.3 months with 54.8% developing intrahepatic recurrences and 19.4% developing extrahepatic recurrences.Conclusion:Both, elevated PLR and AFP ≥ 200 were independent predictors of early (
