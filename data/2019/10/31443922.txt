NADPH oxidase (NOX) is a key source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study aimed to verify NOX2 and NOX4 expression levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 134 matched pairs of HCC cells and non-tumour hepatocytes from 134 patients were examined by immunohistochemical staining, and the association of NOX2 and NOX4 expression with clinicopathological parameters was analysed. Western blotting in four HCC cell lines and reverse transcription digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) in 20 pairs of HCC and non-tumour tissue samples were also performed to detect NOX4. Cytoplasmic NOX2 and nuclear NOX4 expression levels were shown by immunohistochemistry to be higher in HCC cells than in non-tumour hepatocytes (p
