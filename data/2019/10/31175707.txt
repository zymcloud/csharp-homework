Background and aims:It is paramount to identify predictors of treatment failure with direct antiviral agents in 'field-practice' patients, including people who inject drugs (PWID). Data on the efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) in a field-practice scenario are scant. The multicentre MISTRAL study enrolled 1177 patients, including PWID, to assess real-life efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB and to identify the predictive factors for this treatment.Methods:This was a prospective, longitudinal study. The outcome variable was the rate of sustained virological response (SVR) at week 12.Results:A total of 123 patients (10%) were infected from hepatitis C virus (HCV) 3. METAVIR fibrosis score was F4 in 104 subjects (9%); 118 patients (10%) were PWID. Overall, 1163/1177 (99%) patients achieved SVR. The baseline clinical factors discriminating between treatment success and treatment failure were age at treatment (P = 0.031) and creatinine level (P = 0.034). SVR rates were not influenced by gender, substance abuse, previous treatment, treatment duration, fibrosis or chronic kidney disease stage. Compared with non-substance users, the 118 PWID exhibited a significantly different genotype pattern distribution (Ï‡2 < 0.001). A total of 40/118 (33.9%) of substance users were HCV3 compared to 83/1056 (7.9%) non-substance users. Only 6 patients (0.5%) reported a serious adverse event.Conclusions:The MISTRAL study provides evidence of GLE/PIB efficacy in a field-practice scenario in a highly epidemic HCV area in southern Italy; it unveiled significant differences in genotype distribution among the most underserved and difficult-to-treat patient subgroups including PWID.
