Background and objective:Breast cancer stem cells are considered to be a major cause of disease recurrence in breast cancer as they appear to be chemoresistant. Fascin-1 and MAP17 are stem cell markers whose excessive expression in tumors is associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression patterns of fascin-1 and MAP17 in breast cancer and to assess their clinical significance.Methods:Expression of fascin-1 and MAP17 was assessed via immunohistochemistry in surgical specimens of a cohort comprised of 127 patients with resectable breast cancer. Results were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survival data. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the primary outcome of the present study.Results:Fascin-1 and MAP17 expression were strongly associated with the presence of triple-negative cancers (p < 0.0001). Tumors displaying high expression of fascin-1 presented correlations with high tumor grade (p = 0.002) and high expression of Ki-67 (p = 0.004). PFS of patients exhibiting high expression of fascin-1 and MAP17 in cancer cells in the first 5 years after surgery was significantly worse than in patients with low expression of the two markers (47.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 33-51 vs. 80.5%, 95% CI 47-56; p = 0.012) and independent of other clinicopathological characteristics (hazard ratio 0.171, 95% CI 0.034-0.869; p = 0.033).Conclusion:Combined expression of fascin-1 and MAP17 in breast cancer cells is associated with a significantly worse 5-year PFS, therefore recognizing a group of patients with high risk for early disease recurrence.
