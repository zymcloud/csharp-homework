Objective:To preoperatively predict the microvascular invasion (MVI) risk in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using nomogram.Methods:A retrospective cohort of 513 patients with HCC hospitalized at Xiangya Hospital between January 2014 and December 2018 was included in the study. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors for MVI. Based on the independent risk factors, nomogram was established to preoperatively predict the MVI risk in HCC. The accuracy of nomogram was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA).Results:Tumor size (OR=1.17, 95% CI: 1.11-1.23, pConclusion:Nomogram was established for preoperative prediction of the MVI risk in HCC patients, and better therapeutic choice will be made if it was applied in clinical practice.
