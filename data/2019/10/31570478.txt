Background/aim:After primary resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the impact of patient's characteristics at the initial hepatectomy, on long-term remnant liver function has not been reported. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with the deterioration of remnant liver function among patients who developed recurrent HCC.Patients and methods:A total of 51 patients with intrahepatic recurrence after initial hepatic resection for HCC were included. We retrospectively investigated the relation between patient characteristics and the degree of deterioration of remnant liver function upon recurrence.Results:In univariate analysis, significant predictors of deterioration of remnant liver function consisted of preoperative gastro-esophageal varices (p=0.0101), preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (p=0.0230) and hepatectomy beyond Makuuchi's criteria (p=0.0101). In multivariate analysis, the only significant independent predictor of deterioration of remnant liver function was hepatectomy beyond Makuuchi's criteria (p=0.0498).Conclusion:Hepatectomy beyond Makuuchi's criteria at the initial hepatectomy may predict deterioration of remnant liver function upon recurrence of HCC.
