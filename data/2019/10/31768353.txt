Background:Sorafenib has been established as the standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) since 2007 on the basis of two landmark trials (SHARP and Asia-Pacific). Ten years have passed since then and, despite much research in the field, still no validated real-life prognostic markers are available for HCC patients treated with this drug. Therefore, going through 10 years of research into sorafenib of several Italian Cancer Centers, we conducted a field-practice study aimed at identifying baseline clinical factors that could be significantly associated with overall survival (OS).Method:Univariate/multivariate analyses were conducted to retrospectively identify the impact of baseline characteristics on the OS of 398 advanced HCC patients treated with sorafenib.Results:Based on univariate analysis, Î±-fetoprotein (AFP), albumin, AST, bilirubin, Child-Pugh, ECOG, systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, and portal vein thrombosis were significantly associated with shorter OS. Following adjustment for clinical covariates positive in univariate analysis, the multivariate analysis including AFP, age, etiology, albumin, aspartate transaminase (AST), bilirubin, Child-Pugh, LDH, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, ECOG, ALBI grade, portal vein thrombosis, SII, and BCLC stage identified increase in LDH, age >70 years, no viral etiologies, ECOG >0, albumin 40 as prognostic factors for poorer OS based on the 5% significance level.Conclusion:Our study highlights that baseline hepatic function, patient-centered variables, and etiology have prognostic value. These findings might have implications in terms of therapeutic decision-making and patient counseling.
