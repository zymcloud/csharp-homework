Liver cancer is a devastating cancer that ranges from relatively rare (around 2% of all cancers in the United States) to commonplace (up to 50% of cancers in underdeveloped countries). Depending upon the stage of pathogenesis, prognosis, or functional liver tissue present, transplantation or partial hepatectomy may be the only available treatment option. However, due to the rise in metabolic syndrome and the increasing demand for livers, patients often wait months or years for available organs. Due to this shortage, doctors must have other treatment options available. One promising area of cancer research lies in understanding the role of regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as oncogenic drivers and potential targets for prospective therapies. While the role of these ncRNAs was not initially clear, many of them have since been recognized to function as important players in the regulation of gene expression, epigenetic modification, and signal transduction in both normal and cancer cell cycles. Dysregulation of these different ncRNA subtypes has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of many major cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma. This review summarizes current findings on the roles noncoding RNAs play in the progression of liver cancer and the various animal models used in current research to elucidate those data.
