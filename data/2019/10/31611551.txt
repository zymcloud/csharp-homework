Molecular targeted agents, such as sorafenib, remain the only choice of an antitumor drug for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Notch signaling pathway plays central roles in regulating the cellular injury/stress response, anti-apoptosis, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition process in HCC cells, and is a promising target for enhancing the sensitivity of HCC cells to antitumor agents. The ADAM metalloprotease domain-17 (ADAM-17) mediates the cleavage and activation of Notch protein. In the present study, microRNA-3163 (miR-3163), which binds to the 3'-untranslated region of ADAM-17, was screened using online methods. miRDB and pre-miR-3163 sequences were prepared into lentivirus particles to infect HCC cells. miR-3163 targeted ADAM-17 and inhibited the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. Infection of HCC cells with miR-3163 enhanced their sensitivity to molecular targeted agents, such as sorafenib. Therefore, miR-3163 may contribute to the development of more effective strategies for the treatment of advanced HCC.
