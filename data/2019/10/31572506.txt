Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to participate in the development and progression of a number of different types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A recent report has indicated that lncRNA MAFG-antisense 1 (AS1) promotes colorectal cancer. However, the role of MAFG-AS1 in other types of cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of lncRNA MAFG-AS1 in HCC. Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR results, it was determined that lncRNA MAFG-AS1 expression was increased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Following knockdown of lncRNA MAFG-AS1, a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and Transwell assay demonstrated that the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cell lines were significantly inhibited. It was additionally demonstrated that there was a negative regulatory association between lncRNA MAFG-AS1 and miR-6852. Inhibition of miR-6852 increased proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cell lines. LncRNA MAFG-AS1 promoted HCC development by dampening miR-6852 function and may thus be a novel target for treating patients with HCC.
