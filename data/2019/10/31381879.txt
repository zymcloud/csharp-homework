Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is a malignant tumor with high mortality due to lack of early diagnostic methods and effective treatments, and the molecular mechanisms are intricate and remain unclear. In the present study, the role of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) in tumor advancement of HCC was investigated. We examined expression level of MARCO in HCC samples, corresponding adjacent nontumor tissues and six hepatoma cell lines by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical information of HCC patients was also analyzed. The role of MARCO involved in HCC progression via multiple functional experiments in vitro and in vivo was investigated. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to further explore biological functions of MARCO. We found MARCO was suggestively down-regulated in HCC and associated with favorable prognosis, and MARCO upregulation oppressed tumor cell migration and invasion. Besides, overexpression of MARCO not only promoted apoptosis of hepatoma cells but also suppressed proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis suggested that MARCO may be related to the P53 signaling pathway, and this prediction was confirmed in this study as well. In sum, our study indicated that MARCO was involved in HCC progression and it can be defined as a novel probable biomarker as well as treatment target for HCC.
