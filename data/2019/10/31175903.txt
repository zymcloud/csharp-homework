Purpose:This study compared the local control and overall survival (OS) between stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in medium-sized (3-8 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods and materials:From January 2008 to October 2017, 188 patients with medium-sized HCC underwent either TACE (n = 142) or SBRT (n = 46). We adjusted for imbalances in treatment assignment using propensity score matching. Infield control (IFC) and OS were analyzed retrospectively.Results:The median follow-up time was 17.1 months for all patients and 26.6 months for surviving patients. The 3-year IFC was 63.0% for the TACE group and 73.3% for the SBRT group. Multivariable analysis identified the independent predictors for IFC as treatment modality (SBRT vs TACE), sex (female vs male), and recurrence status (recurrence vs new diagnosis). The 3-year OS was 22.9% for the TACE group and 47.4% for the SBRT group. Multivariable analysis identified the independent predictors of OS as number of tumors, treatment modality (SBRT vs TACE), albumin-bilirubin grade, tumor volume, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status, and recurrence status. Propensity score matching analysis revealed that the SBRT group had better IFC (3-year IFC of 77.5% vs 55.6%; P = .007) and OS (3-year OS of 55.0% vs 13.0%; P Conclusions:SBRT has better IFC and OS rates than TACE in patients with medium-sized HCC, particularly for recurrent cases, which warrants prospective randomized controlled trials of TACE and SBRT.
