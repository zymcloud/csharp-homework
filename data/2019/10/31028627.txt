Background:The epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by a dynamical temporal trend of well-established and emerging risk factors.Methods:We evaluated the temporal trend of aetiological factors of HCC over the last two decades in Italy. HCC cases were recruited from two previously published national studies in 1996 and in 2008 and HCC cases were also enlisted from two national surveys in 2001 and in 2014 enrolling consecutive subjects with chronic liver disease (CLD) referring to more than 80 liver units scattered all over the country for a 6-month period.Results:Out of the 9997 subjects with CLD recruited in 2001 and the 2408 recruited in 2014, 3.3% and 5.7% (P Conclusion:In conclusion, with decreasing viral aetiology, an overall decrease in the incidence of HCC might be expected in the future. The proportion of metabolic diseases is conversely increasing being considered as an aetiology. The growing prevalence of metabolic disorders in the general population may further increase this trend in the years to come.
