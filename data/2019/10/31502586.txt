Introduction:Everolimus after liver transplant (LT) has been used to minimize the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), optimize renal function, and prevent recurre nce of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objectives:We aimed to analyze a single‑center experience with switching from CNIs to everolimus in immunossupressive treatment of LT recipients.Patients and methods:A total of 108 LT recipients (men, 65.7%; mean [SD] age, 53.2 [11.1] years) were prospectively enrolled into the study. In all patients, everolimus and CNIs were introduced (target trough levels of 3 to 6 ng/ml and 3 to 5 ng/ml, respectively). After 3 months, CNIs were discontinued in patients who tolerated everolimus well, while everolimus dosage was increased (blood trough levels, 6-12 ng/ml).Results:Everolimus monotherapy was introduced in 32 patients (29.6%), while a combination therapy with everolimus and CNIs was continued in 76 patients (70.4%). However, during a mean follow‑up of 27 months (range, 4-50 months), everolimus was withdrawn in 25 patients (33%) due to side effects. In the everolimus‑monotherapy group, all patients continued the therapy (P Conclusions:This study showed that switching from CNIs to everolimus after LT allowed a safe weaning of CNIs and an improvement in creatinine levels. In patients on everolimus monotherapy, we observed dyslipidemia as a dose‑dependent side effect of the drug as well as a lower risk of HCC recurrence.
