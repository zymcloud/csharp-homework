Background and aims:The liver function reserve in Child-Pugh (C-P) grade A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients varies widely, and the value of platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI) grade in predicting posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) grade B/C and overall survival (OS) remains unknown.Methods:From Dec 2004 to Dec 2013, 2038 C-P grade A HCC patients after resection were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to clarify the risk factors for PHLF grade B/C and OS.Results:The PALBI grade had higher area under the curve values than albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) and C-P grade in predicting PHLF grade B/C (0.693, 0.683, 0.529 in the entire cohort; 0.677, 0.646, 0.516 in patients who underwent major resection). PALBI grade differentiated C-P grade A patients into three groups with distinct prognoses (P Conclusions:PALBI grade offers a simple, objective and discriminatory method for risk stratification of PHLF grade B/C and OS in C-P grade A HCC patients following resection.
