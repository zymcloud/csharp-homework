Background:This prospective study measured body composition based on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in relation to preoperative and postoperative nutritional support and status in patients undergoing liver surgery.Methods:Thirty-seven patients with impaired liver function (indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min >15%) undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma or colorectal liver metastasis were enrolled. The control group (n = 10) received no nutritional supplementation. The late-evening snack (LES, n = 26) group received a 210-kcal snack comprising a carbohydrate with branched-chain amino acids for 2 weeks before surgery through to 12 weeks after surgery. BIA of body composition, including body cell mass and skeletal muscle volume, was performed.Results:Although there was no sarcopenia based on the consensus report of the Asian Working Group 2 weeks before surgery, the skeletal muscle volumes in the control and LES groups were at the lower limit of the normal range. Body cell mass and skeletal muscle volume were significantly lower in the control group than in the LES group at 4 (p = 0.03) and 12 (p = 0.02) weeks after surgery.Conclusion:Late-evening carbohydrate and branched-chain amino acid snack supplementation may improve nutritional status in patients with impaired liver function undergoing hepatectomy.
