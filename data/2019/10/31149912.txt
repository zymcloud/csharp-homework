Background:Clinical worsening after achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) needs to be clarified and explained. Persistence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen interacts with the host proteins to interfere with signaling pathways and increases the susceptibility to hepatic carcinogenesis.Objective:This study aimed to investigate the risk factors that increase the progression of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in a subgroup of HCV patients who achieved a SVR.Patients and methods:Eighty-nine HCV patients with hepatic decompensation were selected 8.2 ± 1.8 months after achieving SVR24. HCV core antigen and HCV RNA were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Matched control (n = 100) and training (n = 200) groups were recruited.Results:Eighty-five patients showed a progression of Child-Turcotte-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease scores, with positive RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (357.4 ± 42.1 IU/million cell) and positive hepatitis C virus core antigen (n = 73); four patients were excluded. Susceptibility to decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma after direct-acting antiviral drugs increased with age [odds ratio (OD) = 1.87], and was associated with male sex (OD = 1.65), diabetes (OD = 3.68), thrombocytopenia (OD = 2.44), pretreatment Alfa-fetoprotein (OD = 3.41), and occult HCV (OD = 4.1).Conclusion:Clinical deterioration after SVR could be explained by occult HCV mainly in older male patients with diabetes and thrombocytopenia.
