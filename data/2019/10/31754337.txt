Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a commonly used treatment modality in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The ability to identify patients who will respond to TACE represents an important clinical need, and tumor gene expression patterns may be associated with TACE response. We investigated whether tumor transcriptome is associated with TACE response in patients with HCC. We analyzed transcriptome data of treatment-na√Øve tumor tissues from a Chinese cohort of 191 HCC patients, including 105 patients who underwent TACE following resection with curative intent. We then developed a gene signature, TACE Navigator, which was associated with improved survival in patients that received either adjuvant or post-relapse TACE. To validate our findings, we applied our signature in a blinded manner to three independent cohorts comprising an additional 130 patients with diverse ethnic backgrounds enrolled in three different hospitals who received either adjuvant TACE or palliative TACE. TACE Navigator stratified patients into Responders and Non-Responders which was associated with improved survival following TACE in our test cohort (Responders: 67 months vs Non-Responders: 39.5 months, p
