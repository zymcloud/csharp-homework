Background:Heat shock protein 60 has been reported to have a high diagnostic value for digestive system cancers. We sought to systematically evaluate the diagnostic value of HSP60 in patients with gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Relevant literature was adopted from the online databases. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were pooled using random effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to express the overall test performance. Statistical analysis was performed by STATA 14.0 and Meta-DiSc 1.4 software.Results:We merged 12 studies in a meta-analysis, including 1 GC, 5 CRC, and 6 HCC. Overall, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR to predict GC/CRC/HCC patients were 70%, 71%, and 8.49, respectively, corresponding to an AUC of 0.81. In subgroup analysis, the 82% specificity prompted a more advanced diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing CRC than HCC.Conclusions:HSP60 was an advanced biomarker for digestive system cancers and its abnormal expression might have implications for early diagnosis in screening of GC/CRC/HCC.
