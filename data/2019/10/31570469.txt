Large tumor size and arterioportal shunt are poor prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. Lenvatinib is a novel and potent multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed in Japan. A 66-year-old woman with hepatocellular carcinoma and untreated hepatitis C was referred to our hospital. She was judged as unresectable and was treated with four sessions of transarterial chemoembolization; however, the therapeutic effect was unsatisfactory because of major arterioportal shunt. Lenvatinib was sequentially administered for 4 months. Thereafter, we observed tumor shrinkage, complete disappearance of arterioportal shunt, and obvious improvement in liver function. A curative conversion hepatectomy was successfully accomplished. The extremely high levels of tumor markers almost normalized; the pretreatment levels were 1,008,021 ng/ml for alpha-fetoprotein. At 1 year after the primary treatment, the patient has not experienced recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient with initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with arterioportal shunt who underwent conversion hepatectomy after multidisciplinary treatment, including lenvatinib.
