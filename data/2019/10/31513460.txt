Liver transplantation is an effective intervention for end-stage liver disease, fulminant hepatic failure, and early hepatocellular carcinoma. Yet, there is marked patient-to-patient variation in liver transplantation outcomes. This calls for novel diagnostics to enable rational deployment of donor livers. Metabolomics is a postgenomic high-throughput systems biology approach to diagnostic innovation in clinical medicine. We report here an original systematic review of the metabolomic studies that have identified putative biomarkers in the context of liver transplantation. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria that involved sampling of blood (n = 4), dialysate fluid (n = 4), bile (n = 5), and liver tissue (n = 5). Metabolites of amino acid and nitrogen metabolism, anaerobic glycolysis, lipid breakdown products, and bile acid metabolism were significantly different in transplanted livers with and without graft dysfunction. However, criteria for defining the graft dysfunction varied across studies. This systematic review demonstrates that metabolomics can be deployed in identification of metabolic indicators of graft dysfunction with a view to implicated molecular mechanisms. We conclude the article with a horizon scanning of metabolomics technology in liver transplantation and its future prospects and challenges in research and clinical practice.
