Primary liver tumors are most commonly hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Although surgical resection offers a chance for cure, these tumors generally present at a late, inoperable stage, necessitating an understanding of noncurative and palliative treatment options. These options include ablative therapies, including radiofrequency ablation; intra-arterial therapies, including transcatheter chemoembolization; biliary decompression; radiotherapy; systemic therapies, including traditional chemotherapeutic agents; and molecular therapies, such as sorafenib. Selection of nonoperative treatment depends on patient and tumor factors as well as institutional resources and expertise.
