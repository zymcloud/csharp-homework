Abnormal methylation of secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) has been observed in various human cancer types. The loss of SFRP gene expression induces the activation of the Wnt pathway and is a vital mechanism for tumorigenesis and development. The aim of the present systematic review was to assess the association between SFRP methylation and cancer risk. A meta-analysis was systematically conducted to assess the clinicopathological significance of SFRP methylation in cancer risk. The Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web of Science databases were comprehensively searched, and 83 publications with a total of 21,612 samples were selected for the meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the degree of associations between SFRP promoter methylation and cancer risk. Subgroup analysis, meta regression and sensitivity analysis were used to identify the potential sources of heterogeneity. SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4 and SFRP5 hypermethylation was significantly associated with cancer risk, with ORs of 8.48 (95% CI, 6.26-11.49), 8.21 (95% CI, 6.20-10.88), 11.41 (95% CI, 6.42-20.30) and 6.34 (95% CI, 3.86-10.42), respectively. SFRP2 methylation was significantly associated with differentiation in colorectal cancer (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.02-4.56). The results of the present study demonstrated that SFRP methylation may contribute to carcinogenesis, especially in certain cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer.
