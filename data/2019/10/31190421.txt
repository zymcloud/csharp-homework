Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent form of cancer. Various long non coding RNA (lncRNAs) and micro RNA have been confirmed to have a role in the progression of HCC. Our aim was to investigate for the first time the expression profile of serum level of LNC NEAT (nuclear enrich abundant transcript) and MiR-129-5p in HCC patients and their relations with patient's clinical and biochemical investigations rather than previous studies on tissue cell lines. Our study includes 72 subjects divided into 36 as control subjects and 36 patients with HCC. Complete physical and laboratory investigations were done on all subjects. RNAs were extracted from sera of all subjects. RNAs were reversed transcribed into cDNAs using Qiagen, Valenica, CA. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using Rotor gene Q System (Qiagen). Relative NEAT1 expression level was significantly increased in serum of HCC patients 4.7 (1.31-6.82) (p
