Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a classic angiogenic inhibitor, has been reported to function as a tumor suppression protein and to downregulate in many types of solid tumors. However, the expression level of PEDF and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are contradictory. The present study investigates the expression and different activities of secreted and intracellular PEDF during HCC development, as well as the underlying mechanism of PEDF on HCC lipid disorders. We found that PEDF had no association with patients' prognosis, although PEDF was highly expressed and inhibited angiogenesis in HCC tumor tissues. The animal experiments indicated that full-length PEDF exhibited equalizing effects on tumor growth activation and tumor angiogenesis inhibition in the late stage of HCC progression. Importantly, the pro-tumor activity was mediated by the intracellular PEDF, which causes accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs) in vivo and in vitro. Based on the correlation analysis of PEDF and lipid metabolic indexes in human HCC tissues, we demonstrated that the intracellular PEDF led to the accumulation of FFA and eventually promoted HCC cell growth by inhibiting the activation of AMPK via ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, which causes increased de novo fatty acid synthesis and decreased FFA oxidation. Our findings revealed why elevated PEDF did not improve the patients' prognosis as the offsetting intracellular and extracellular activities. This study will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the diverse role of PEDF in HCC and provide a new selective strategy by supplement of extracellular PEDF and downregulation of intracellular PEDF for the prevention and treatment of liver cancer.
