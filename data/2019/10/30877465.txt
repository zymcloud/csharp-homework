Purpose:To prospectively evaluate the potential role of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and conventional radiologic features for preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained for this study. A cohort comprising 115 patients with 135 newly diagnosed HCCs between January 2016 and April 2017 were evaluated. Two radiologists independently reviewed the radiologic features and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and pseudodiffusion component fraction (f) were also measured. Interobserver agreement was checked and univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used for screening the risk factors. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance.Results:Features significantly related to MVI of HCC at univariate analysis were reduced ADC (odds ratio, 0.341; 95% CI, 0.211-0.552; p Conclusion:IVIM model-derived D value is superior to ADC measured with mono-exponential model for evaluating the MVI of HCC. Among MR imaging features, tumor margin, enhancement pattern, tumor capsule, and peritumoral enhancement were not predictive for MVI.Key points:• Diffusion MRI is useful for non-invasively evaluating the microvascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma. • IVIM model is advantageous over mono-exponential model for assessing the microvascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma. • Decreased D value was the independent risk factor for predicting MVI of HCC.
