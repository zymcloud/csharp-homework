Objective:To evaluate whether patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)- and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic liver disease were diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer (PC) at an early stage during abdominal imaging surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:We retrospectively examined 447 patients with PC diagnosed at Ehime University Hospital and affiliated centers (2011-2013). Data were collected regarding HBV and HCV status, likelihood of PC diagnosis, and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage. Intergroup comparisons were performed using the Ï‡2 test.Results:The UICC stage distribution in the HCC surveillance group (n=16) was stage 0 (n=2, 12.5%), stage IA (n=3, 18.8%), stage IB (n=2, 12.5%), stage IIA (n=2, 12.5%), stage IIB (n=2, 12.5%), stage III (n=1, 6.3%), and stage IV (n=4, 25%). The UICC stage distribution in the nonsurveillance group (n=431) was stage 0 (n=4, 0.9%), stage IA (n=28, 6.5%), stage IB (n=27, 6.3%), stage IIA (n=86, 20.0%), stage IIB (n=48, 11.1%), stage III (n=56, 13.0%), and stage IV (n=182, 42.2%). The HCC surveillance group had significantly more patients with stage 0 disease than with stages IA through IV (P=.02). Similar results were observed when including stages IA (P=.007) and IB (P=.004) as early stages but not stage IIA (P=.10). A dilated pancreatic duct led to a PC diagnosis in all 6 patients with stage 0 disease.Conclusion:Patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver disease had an early PC diagnosis during HCC surveillance. Careful evaluation of the pancreas is warranted during HCC surveillance.
