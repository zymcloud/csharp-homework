Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the University of California, San Francisco down-staging (UCSF-DS) criteria (one lesion > 5 cm and ≤ 8 cm; two to three lesions each ≤ 5 cm; or four to five lesions each ≤ 3 cm with total tumor diameter ≤ 8 cm) who achieved successful down-staging (DS) to Milan criteria had similar outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) compared with HCC initially meeting the Milan criteria. Nevertheless, little is known about the outcome of DS in patients with initial tumor burden exceeding the UCSF-DS criteria, defined as "all-comers" (AC). We compared the intention-to-treat (ITT) outcomes of DS in 74 patients in the AC group and 133 patients in the UCSF-DS group. Successful DS to Milan was observed in 64.8% of the AC group versus 84.2% of the UCSF-DS group (P
