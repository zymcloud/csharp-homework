Purpose:Liver metastases are associated with poor outcomes in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Nevertheless, the vasculature in the liver microenvironment may be conducive to the use of antiangiogenesis inhibitors to potentially improve outcomes. Limited real-world clinical and economic data are currently available for this patient subpopulation.Methods:Two retrospective cohort analyses were conducted using data from an electronic health record (n = 14,209) and a claims database (n = 9,017). Patients with aNSCLC with and without liver metastases were identified in each database. Patients with baseline liver metastases in the electronic health record database were further categorized into two subgroups-those who had or had not received bevacizumab-containing regimens. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to adjust for baseline characteristics to evaluate the effect of treatment of bevacizumab.Results:Liver metastases were associated with significantly poorer survival (median overall survival, 6.3 months v 10.1 months) and higher costs and health care resource utilization-total per-patient-per-month costs of $27,589 versus $19,607. Cost differences were primarily driven by inpatient costs, including a two-fold increase in hospitalizations and a 1.7-fold higher mean length of stay. Treatment with bevacizumab was associated with improved survival. Whereas overall survival improved in patients with and without baseline liver metastases who received bevacizumab, the relative survival benefit was greater in patients with liver metastases (hazard ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.81] v hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.86]).Conclusion:Patients with aNSCLC with liver metastases have poorer survival and a higher cost and health care resource utilization burden. Bevacizumab was associated with a survival benefit in patients with aNSCLC with liver metastases.
