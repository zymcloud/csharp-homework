Cancer is one of the common causes of death with a high degree of mortality, worldwide. In many types of cancers, if not all, sex-biased disparities have been observed. In these cancers, an individual's sex has been shown to be one of the crucial factors underlying the incidence and mortality of cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that differentially expressed genes and proteins may contribute to sex-biased differences in male and female cancers. Therefore, identification of these molecular differences is important for early diagnosis of cancer, prediction of cancer prognosis, and determination of response to specific therapies. In the present review, we summarize the differentially expressed genes and proteins in several cancers including bladder, colorectal, liver, lung, and non-small cell lung cancers as well as renal clear cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The sex-biased molecular differences were identified via proteomics, genomics, and big data analysis. The identified molecules represent potential candidates as sex-specific cancer biomarkers. Our study provides molecular insights into the impact of sex on cancers, suggesting strategies for sex-biased therapy against certain types of cancers.
