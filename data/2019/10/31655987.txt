Five cytological types of hepatocellular carcinoma-29 (G-29) grown in the muscle tissue of the thigh of experimental animals were identified by transmission electron microscopy; 89% of these were poorly differentiated type I-III cells. Lithium in a concentration of 20 mM produced a damaging effect on poorly differentiated G-29 cells: the number of cells with zones of intracellular component destruction and volume density of these zones increased, while volume density of cisterns of endoplasmic reticulum decreased. These results suggest that lithium carbonate can cause destructive changes in the heterogeneous population of G-29 cells during in vivo tumor development.
