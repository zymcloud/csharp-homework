Purpose:To asses angiographic and computed tomographic success criteria during and after transcatheter arterial drug-eluting bead chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Methods:In this retrospective single-center study, 50 patients with unresectable HCC having undergone DEB-TACE from January 2010 to July 2015 were assessed. The angiographic endpoint was classified by Subjective Angiographic Chemoembolization Endpoint (SACE) scale. Relative tumor density in arterial (DArt) and portal venous phase (DPV) computed tomography post- versus pre-DEB-TACE were calculated, respectively. Tumor response according to modified Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) was assessed. Univariate Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were carried out.Results:SACE scores I, II, III, and IV were found in 1 (2%), 20 (40%), 15 (30%), and 14 (28%) patients, respectively. Median OS and PFS were 14.2 and 5.5 months, respectively. Death rates at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years were 24%, 38%, and 52%, respectively. SACE score during DEB-TACE significantly correlated with local and overall mRECIST results (local: p PV (p = 0.005, r = - 0.40). In univariate analysis, progressive disease (PD) according to mRECIST and increase of DArt and DPV were associated with significantly shorter PFS. Modified RECIST independently predicted OS (hazard ratio for complete remission vs. PD = 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.68, p = 0.014).Conclusions:A direct impact of SACE on PFS or OS could not be shown. However, SACE significantly correlated with local and overall mRECIST tumor response that again significantly predicted OS. We therefore postulate an indirect impact of SACE on OS. Consequently, complete embolization should be attempted.
