Background:Liver cancer is a major health problem facing mankind. Currently, the focus of research is to improve the treatment of liver cancer using a variety of treatment options such as providing chemotherapy drugs through nanocarriers.Purpose:The aim of this study was to prepare a curcumin-loaded (PLGA/TPGS) NPs delivery system by the emulsification-solvent evaporation method in order to achieve synergistic antitumor activity against liver cancer.Methods:Curcumin-loaded (PLGA/TPGS) NPs were prepared by the emulsification and solvent evaporation method. The physical and chemical characteristics of NPs such as size, morphology, and release profiles were discussed. In vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to evaluate its anti-tumor activity in target cells.Results:Curcumin-loaded (PLGA/TPGS) NPs could be successfully internalized by HepG2 cells and play a synergistic role in inhibiting the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. They exhibited high target organ accumulation, superior antitumor efficiency, and lower toxicity in vivo.Conclusion:The present study indicates that the curcumin-loaded (PLGA/TPGS) NPs provide a promising platform for the treatment of liver cancer.
