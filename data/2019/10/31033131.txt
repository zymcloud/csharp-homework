Background & aims:Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic signals associated with the risk of persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the majority of the associated variants may only be markers of functional variants and the underlying biological mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that the functional variants with modulating transcription factor (TF) binding affinity in genome-wide association studies-identified loci may influence the risk of persistent HBV infection in Chinese people.Methods:A systematic bioinformatics approach was implemented to prioritize potential functional variants that may influence TF binding. A two-stage case-control study, including 1595 HBV-persistent carriers and 1590 subjects with HBV natural clearance, was conducted to examine the associations between candidate variants and susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. Biological assays were carried out to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the associated genetic variants.Results:Twelve candidate variants were identified, and rs2523454 G > A increased the risk of persistent HBV infection (dominant model: ORcombined = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.19-1.58, P = 1.610 Ã— 10-5 ). Functional assays indicated that the rs2523454 A allele significantly decreased transcriptional activity compared to the G allele by influencing TF-binding affinity. In addition, expression quantitative trait loci analyses revealed that the A allele was associated with the reduced expression of MICA (P < 0.01).Conclusions:Our findings suggest that the germline G > A variation at rs2523454 may influence TF-DNA interaction, downregulate the expression of MICA and play an important role in the development of persistent HBV infection in the Chinese population.
