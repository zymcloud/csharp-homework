Searching for new sources of safe nutraceuticals antitumor drugs is an important issue. Consequentially, this study designed to assess the antitumor activity of Pulicaria undulata extract in vitro in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line. Aerial parts of P. undulata plants were collected, used for phytochemical analysis, and assessed for anticancer activity. The antitumor activity was evaluated through studying the cell viability and apoptotic pathway. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry phytochemical analysis revealed that P. undulata is a promising new source of several known antioxidant and antitumor compounds which could participate in drug development and exploration of alternative strategies to the harmful synthetic antitumor drugs. P. undulata stifled HepG2 cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, P. undulata tempted substantial apoptosis in HepG2 cells and enhanced the expression of miR-34a. However, the mRNA expression level of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 was markedly decreased by P. undulata treatment. Moreover, P. undulata increased the protein expression of proapoptotic p53 and caspase 3/9 with reducing B-cell lymphoma-2 protein expression level. Thus, P. undulata induced apoptosis in the HepG2 cells by overexpression of miR-34a which regulates p53/B-cell lymphoma-2/caspases signaling pathway. These findings were well appreciated with morphological studies of cells treated with P. undulata. In conclusion, P. undulata could be a probable candidate agent for the initiation of cell apoptosis in HepG2 and thereby can serve as promising therapeutic agent for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma which should attract further studies.
