T-2 toxin is a major pollutant in crops and feedstuffs. Due to its high toxicity in a variety of organisms, T-2 toxin is of great concern as a threat to humans and to animal breeding. Overexpression of CYP1A1 may contribute to carcinogenesis, and CYP1A1 may be a promising target for the prevention and treatment of human malignancies. Therefore, it is essential to understand the regulatory mechanism by which T-2 toxin induces CYP1A1 expression in human cells. In this study, we confirmed that T-2 toxin (100 ng/mL) induced the expression of CYP1A1 in HepG2 cells through NRF1 and Sp1 bound to the promoter instead of through the well-recognized Aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AhR). In cells treated with T-2 toxin, Sp1, but not NRF1, was significantly upregulated. However, T-2 toxin apparently promoted the interaction between NRF1 and Sp1 proteins, as revealed by IP analysis. Furthermore, in T-2 toxin-treated HepG2 cells, nuclear translocation of NRF1 was enhanced, while knockdown of Sp1 ablated NRF1 nuclear enrichment. Our results revealed that the upregulation of CYP1A1 by T-2 toxin in HepG2 cells depended on enhanced interaction between Sp1 and NRF1. This finding suggests the tumorigenic features of T-2 toxin might be related to the CYP1A1, which provides new insights to understand the toxicological effect of T-2 toxin.
