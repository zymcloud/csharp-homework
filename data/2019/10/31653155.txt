Cancer is recognized as one of the most prevalent contributors to mortality in several nations and it remains one of the common health issues globally. In particular, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a public health problem along with the increase of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. Based on this fact, our study goaled to synthesize newly hybrid drugs containing heterocyclic rings incorporated to steroid moiety and to examine the potential antitumor activity of the newly designed heterosteroid derivatives against HCC induced in animal model. Several heterocyclic steroids were synthesized 2-7 and confirmed via the analytical and spectral data (IR, 1H NMR13C NMR and Mass spectroscopy). Compounds 3, 4, and 5 were chosen to be investigated as anticancer agents in HCC rat model by means of validated biomarkers (alfa -fetoprotein, endoglin, lipocali-2 and heat shock protein-70). Following administration of compounds 3, 4 or 5, availability of the active tumor marker molecules was significantly dropped and a substantial decrease of the angiogenic and inflammatory mediators was also evident. These findings were supported by the histological examination of liver tissue. Taken together, this study indicates the potential anticancer activity of the newly synthesized heterosteroid derivatives against HCC in vivo. The antitumor activity of these compounds was likely attributable to modulating some signal transduction pathways involved in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and inflammation.
