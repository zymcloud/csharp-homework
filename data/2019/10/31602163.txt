Background:Tumor recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) remains a serious threat for long-term survival of the recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), since very few factors or measures have shown impact on overcoming HCC recurrence after OLT. Postoperative infection suppresses tumor recurrence and improves patient survival in lung cancer and malignant glioma probably via stimulating the immune system. Post-transplant infection (PTI), a common complication, is deemed to be harmful for the liver transplant recipients from a short-term perspective. Nevertheless, whether PTI inhibits HCC recurrence after OLT and prolongs the long-term survival of HCC patients needs to be clarified.Aim:To investigate the potential influence of PTI on the survival and tumor recurrence of patients with HCC after OLT.Methods:A total of 238 patients with HCC who underwent OLT between August 2002 and July 2016 at our center were retrospectively included and accordingly subdivided into a PTI group (53 patients) and a non-PTI group (185 patients). Univariate analyses, including the differences of overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and post-recurrence survival (PRS), between the PTI and non-PTI subgroups as well as survival curve analysis were performed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences were compared using the log rank test. The variables with a P-value < 0.1 in univariate analyses were included in the multivariate survival analysis by using a Cox proportional-hazards model.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS and RFS rates of the whole cohort were 86.6%, 69.0%, and 63.6%, and 75.7%, 60.0%, and 57.3%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates for the PTI patient group (96.0%, 89.3%, and 74.0%) were significantly higher than those for the non-PTI group (84.0%, 63.4%, and 60.2%) (P = 0.033). The absence of PTI was an independent risk factor for dismal OS (relative risk [RR] = 2.584, 95%CI: 1.226-5.449) and unfavorable RFS (RR = 2.683, 95%CI: 1.335-5.390). Subgroup analyses revealed that PTI remarkably improved OS (P = 0.003) and RFS (P = 0.003) rates of HCC patients with vascular invasion (IV), but did not impact on OS (P = 0.404) and RFS (P = 0.304) of patients without VI. Among the patients who suffered post-transplant tumor recurrence, patients with PTI showed significantly better OS (P = 0.026) and PRS (P = 0.042) rates than those without PTI.Conclusion:PTI improves OS and RFS of the transplant HCC patients at a high risk for post-transplant death and tumor recurrence, which is attributed to suppressive effect of PTI on HCC recurrence.
