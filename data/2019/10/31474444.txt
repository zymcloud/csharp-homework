Background:Survival of patients with breast cancer liver metastasis is very poor. This study aimed to analyze the survival outcome of hepatectomy for this patient population.Methods:From January 1995 to December 2014, 2522 patients with liver cancer received hepatectomy at our hospital. Twenty-one of them, all female, received the operation for breast cancer liver metastasis. Performance was compared with patients with colorectal liver metastasis treated with hepatectomy after propensity score analysis in a ratio of 1:3.Results:Twenty-one patients received hepatectomy for breast cancer. After propensity score matching, 63 patients who had hepatectomy for colorectal cancer were selected for comparison. There was no significant difference in immediate or short-term outcomes between the two groups of patients in terms of operative time, blood loss and surgical morbidities. All patients with breast cancer had R0 resection. No hospital death occurred. After hepatectomy, the 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 100.0%, 58.9% and 58.9% respectively in patients with breast cancer. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 95.0%, 57.2% and 39.7% respectively in patients with colorectal cancer (P = 0.572). On multivariate analysis, triple negative status was the only independent poor prognostic factor in breast cancer liver metastasis (OR = 6.411; 95% CI: 1.351-30.435; P = 0.019).Conclusions:Hepatectomy is a safe and effective way of treating breast cancer liver metastasis at experienced centers where multidisciplinary adjuvant treatments are available. It can be considered more frequently as part of the multidisciplinary care for this patient population.
