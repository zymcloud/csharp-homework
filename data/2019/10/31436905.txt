Background:To investigate the impact of insurance status on outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients diagnosed with HCC in the cancer registry from 2005 to 2016 were retrospectively stratified by insurance group. Overall survival was assessed via Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models including potential confounders in multivariable analyses.Results:Seven hundred and sixty-nine patients met inclusion criteria (median age 63 years, 78.8% male, 65.9% Caucasian). 44.5% had private insurance (n = 342), 29.1% had Medicare (n = 224), and 26.4% had Medicaid (n = 203). At diagnosis, Medicaid patients had higher rates of Child-Pugh B (32.0%) and C disease (23.6%) vs Medicare (28.6% and 9.8%) and private insurance (26.9% and 6.7%, P Conclusion:Medicaid was associated with advanced liver disease at HCC diagnosis; however, insurance status is not an independent predictor of HCC survival.
