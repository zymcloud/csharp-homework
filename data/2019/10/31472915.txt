Locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are associated with a grim prognosis. The development of highly effective systemic therapies for these tumors has been challenging; however, numerous locoregional treatment alternatives have emerged, including transarterial hepatic embolization (TAE), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE), hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAI), radioembolization, and stereotactic body radiation therapy. Although there is potential for long-term disease control for these therapies, the evidence to guide adequate patient selection and choose among different treatment alternatives is still limited. This review focuses on the rationale and data supporting TAE, TACE, DEB-TACE, and HAI in hepatobiliary cancers.
