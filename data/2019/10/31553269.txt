Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a highly pathogenic virus and causes rapid disease progression from fulminant hepatitis to development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). HDV is endemic in Pakistan; however, there are no available data on HDV prevalence among the high-risk group of HBV-infected pregnant women. A total of 1,394 pregnant women, visiting different public-sector hospitals in Lahore, were enrolled in this study. Their demographic data and blood samples were collected from May 2016 to July 2017. Samples were screened for both HBsAg and anti-HDV. Anti-HDV positive samples were tested for HDV RNA, and samples positive for HDV RNA were further sequenced to determine the HDV genotype. Of the 1,394 samples, HBsAg was positive in 63 (4.5%). Of these 63 HBsAg-positive samples, 13 (20.63%) were positive for anti-HDV. Of the 13 HBsAg/anti-HDV positive samples, HDV RNA was detected in 4 (30.8%) samples and all 4 carried HDV genotype 1. The age of enrolled women varied from 20 to 40 years, with most of the women living in urban areas, having education more than secondary school level, belonging to middle class, and being housewives. Majority of the tested women were of age from 25 to 30 years (39.2%); however, the prevalence of HBV was higher in age group 31-35 years (10.7%, confidence interval [CI]: 4.73-16.67); however, anti-HDV prevalence was 1.9% (CI: -0.7 to 4.7). This study is the first report on HDV prevalence among pregnant women in Pakistan. Our study showed a high predominance of HDV (20.63%) in HBV-infected pregnant women and the prevalence of HDV genotype 1 infection. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the HDV/HBV coinfection among pregnant women and circulating HDV genotypes in the country.
