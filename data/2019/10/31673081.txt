Current serum hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarkers are insufficient for early diagnosis. We aimed to clarify whether serum MFG-E8 can serve as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of HCC.

We also quantified serum MFG-E8 levels in patients with chronic hepatitis (CH), liver cirrhosis (LC), as well as in healthy volunteers (HVs). Serum MFG-E8 levels were significantly lower in HCC patients than in HVs regardless of the etiology of liver disease (3.6 ± 0.1 vs 5.8 ± 0.2 ng/mL, p
