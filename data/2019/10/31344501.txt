Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant tumor. Surgery is the main treatment, but HCC patients have a potential risk of tumor recurrence. Besides, many limitations arise during the application of single first-line antitumor drugs. Here, we selected Pluronic F-127 and sodium alginate (SA) to prepare a thermosensitive gel (Gel). The optimal synergistic ratio of PTX and DOX on the SMMC-7721 cells was 1: 2 (w/w), calculated by the Chou-Talalay analysis. Then, PTX and DOX coloaded liposomes (PD-LPs) with such drugs ratios presented enhanced anticancer ability in vitro. Upon local injection, the PD-LPs Gel formed a nanoparticles reservoir at tumor via sol-gel transformation, while exhibiting a long-term effective anti-tumor ability in vivo. The relative tumor volume after the PD-LPs Gel treatment was reduced over 62%. Effective mitochondria related apoptosis induction was observed. Therefore, the local delivery of PD-LPs Gel can be a promising alternative method for the HCC therapy.
