Oxidative stress occurs as a result of imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant genes in cells, causing damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. Accumulating damage of cellular components can trigger various diseases, including metabolic syndrome and cancer. Over the past few years, the physiological significance of microRNAs (miRNA) in cancer has been a focus of comprehensive research. In view of the extensive level of miRNA interference in biological processes, the roles of miRNAs in oxidative stress and their relevance in physiological processes have recently become a subject of interest. In-depth research is underway to specifically address the direct or indirect relationships of oxidative stress-induced miRNAs in liver cancer and the potential involvement of the thyroid hormone in these processes. While studies on thyroid hormone in liver cancer are abundantly documented, no conclusive information on the potential relationships among thyroid hormone, specific miRNAs, and oxidative stress in liver cancer is available. In this review, we discuss the effects of thyroid hormone on oxidative stress-related miRNAs that potentially have a positive or negative impact on liver cancer. Additionally, supporting evidence from clinical and animal experiments is provided.
