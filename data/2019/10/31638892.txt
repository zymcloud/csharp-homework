Background:To investigate the von Willebrand factor to ADAMTS13 ratio as a potential biomarker for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis.Methods:Serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein, des-Î³-carboxy prothrombin, Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-fetoprotein-L3%), vascular endothelial growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, as well as the plasma levels of von Willebrand factor antigen (von Willebrand factor: Ag) and ADAMTS13 activity (ADAMTS13:AC), were evaluated in 41 cirrhotic patients with HCC undergoing radiofrequency ablation and in 20 cirrhotic patients without HCC. The diagnostic accuracy of each biomarker was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Results:The von Willebrand factor: Ag and von Willebrand factor: Ag/ADAMTS13:AC ratios were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients with HCC than in those without HCC (p Conclusions:The von Willebrand factor: Ag/ADAMTS13:AC ratio can potentially serve as a novel biomarker for early diagnosis of HCC in cirrhotic patients.
