Aim:Evaluating clinical and technical factors affecting thermal ablation of B-Mode/CEUS inconspicuous HCC nodules, relying only on fusion imaging (FI) performed under conscious sedation and using previously acquired CT or MR.Materials and methods:Among 367 HCC nodules treated in the study period, data of 37 B-mode/CEUS undetectable HCC nodules treated with FI-guided ablation were extracted from our prospectively collected institutional database. Analyzed variables included patients' sex, age, cirrhosis etiology, Child-Pugh status, size of the lesion, liver segment, subcapsular or central liver site, type of imaging used for fusion (MR/CT), and the presence of surrounding anatomical landmarks (SAL) Results:The primary efficacy was 59.4% (22/37 nodules); nine lesions (24.3%) were partially ablated (PA), six lesions (16.7%) were mistargeted (MA). Eight nodules were retreated with a CA obtained in all cases (100% CA, secondary efficacy in 30/37-81.1%). LTP was observed in 2/30 cases (6.7%). Two minor complications were registered (Clavien-Dindo, Grade1, CIRSE Classification Grade 2). SAL were related to a better ablation outcome (37.5% vs 84.6% p = 0.01). No differences were observed between CA group and PA-MA group in terms of lesion size (15.4 mm vs 14.9 mm p = 0.63), liver segment (p = 0.58), subcapsular or central liver site (8/22 36% vs 4/15 26.7% p = 0.84), and imaging (MR vs CT, p = 0.72).Conclusion:Even in the presence of potentially critical conditions (completely B-Mode/CEUS inconspicuous nodules, spontaneous breathing, and previously acquired CT or MRI), FI-only guidance is safe and allows having good primary, secondary efficacy and LTP rates. The outcome of the procedure is heavily affected by the presence of SAL.
