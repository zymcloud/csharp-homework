Background:Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2) is a novel target and molecule in the negative regulation of immune homeostasis. The present study aimed to investigate the dynamic expression of TIPE2 mRNA during the progression of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.Methods:A total of 193 patients with chronic HBV infection were retrospectively recruited into this cross-sectional study, including 97 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 55 with liver cirrhosis and 41 with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TIPE2 mRNA was determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Results:The expression of TIPE2 levels in patients with HCC was significantly decreased compared with expression in patients with liver cirrhosis, CHB and healthy controls (P Conclusions:TIPE2 mRNA was associated with various stages of chronic HBV infection, ranging from CHB to liver cirrhosis and HCC. Furthermore, TIPE2 mRNA with an optional cutoff value of 0.78 might serve as a promising biomarker to discriminate HBV-associated HCC from CHB and LC patients.
