Development of a huge intrahepatic biloma after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a rare complication. We report a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had been treated by RFA and was complicated by a huge biloma. The biloma was cured by percutaneous catheter drainage and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. A plastic stent was placed from the duodenal ampulla to the common bile duct to lower the pressure. The catheter and the stent were removed within 1 month after the biloma had disappeared. There was no recurrence of the biloma and HCC lesions with a follow-up time of 2 years. The present case is one of the best reported outcomes after development of a huge biloma.
