Eradication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) with interferon-free therapies (DAAs) has modified the course of the disease, as the rate of patients with compensated cirrhosis who achieve a sustained virological response exceeds 95%. However, the impact on development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently in dispute. This argument could be divided into different key points: the impact of DAA on rate of HCC recurrence, the temporal link between starting DAAs and HCC recurrence, and finally, the aggressive pattern of HCC. Therefore, the aim of this review is to analyse the available results in this population of patients from a clinical perspective where the risks and benefits of HCV eradication with DAA therapies are evaluated in patients with complete response of HCC.
