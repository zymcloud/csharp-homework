Background:The aim of this study was to establish a new scoring system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that can be used to predict the postoperative prognosis of HCC patients.Methods:A total of 359 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were included in this study. All eligible patients were randomly allocated to derivation cohort or validation cohort samples. We assigned one point each for preoperative factors identified in the derivation cohort, and the sum of the scores was used to classify the patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The scoring system established using the derivation cohort was fitted to the validation cohort.Results:The prognosis of the high-risk group was significantly poorer than that of the low-risk group in both the derivation and validation samples (p = 0.04, p Conclusion:Our new scoring system can predict the treatment outcome of patients undergoing curative hepatectomy for HCC and could help determine the optimal extent of resection.
