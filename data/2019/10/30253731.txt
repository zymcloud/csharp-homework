Hepatitis C viral infection is recognized worldwide as a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal of hepatitis C viral antiviral therapy is the permanent eradication of hepatitis C viral RNA, commonly referred to as a sustained virologic response - defined as "undetectable" RNA at 12 weeks following the completion of therapy. Hepatitis C viral treatment has dramatically advanced with the FDA approval of several new agents known as direct-acting antivirals. These drugs target specific nonstructural proteins of the virus, which disrupt viral replication, and therefore halt infection. However, recently, there has been a concern for increased risk of recurrence of treated hepatocellular carcinoma or denovo occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after treatment with direct-acting antivirals. We are now reporting three cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma that developed after sustained virologic response following hepatitis C viral treatment with direct-acting antivirals.
Direct acting antivirals; hepatocellular carcinoma; intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; sustained viral response.
