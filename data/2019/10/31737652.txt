Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with high mortality. The abnormal expression of genes is significantly related to the occurrence of HCC. The aim of this study was to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of HCC and to provide bioinformatics basis for the occurrence, prevention and treatment of HCC. The DEGs of HCC and normal tissues in GSE102079, GSE121248, GSE84402 and GSE60502 were obtained using R language. The GO function analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were carried out using the DAVID database. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database. Hub genes were screened using Cytoscape software and verified using the GEPIA, UALCAN, and Oncomine database. We used HPA database to exhibit the differences in protein level of hub genes and used LinkedOmics to reveal the relationship between candidate genes and tumor clinical features. Finally, we obtained transcription factor (TF) of hub genes using NetworkAnalyst online tool. A total of 591 overlapping up-regulated genes were identified. These genes were related to cell cycle, DNA replication, pyrimidine metabolism, and p53 signaling pathway. Additionally, the GEPIA database showed that the CDK1, CCNB1, CDC20, BUB1, MAD2L1, MCM3, BUB1B, MCM2, and RFC4 were associated with the poor survival of HCC patients. UALCAN, Oncomine, and HPA databases and qRT-PCR confirmed that these genes were highly expressed in HCC tissues. LinkedOmics database indicated these genes were correlated with overall survival, pathologic stage, pathology T stage, race, and the age of onset. TF analysis showed that MYBL2, KDM5B, MYC, SOX2, and E2F4 were regulators to these nine hub genes. Overexpression of CDK1, CCNB1, CDC20, BUB1, MAD2L1, MCM3, BUB1B, MCM2, and RFC4 in tumor tissues predicted poor survival in HCC. They may be potential therapeutic targets for HCC.
