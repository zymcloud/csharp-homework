Cytotoxic effects of (R)-4'-methylklavuzon were investigated on hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HuH-7 and HepG2) and HuH-7 EpCAM+/CD133+ cancer stem cells. IC50 of (R)-4'-methylklavuzon was found as 1.25 μM for HuH-7 parental cells while it was found as 2.50 μM for HuH-7 EpCAM+/CD133+ cancer stem cells. (R)-4'-methylklavuzon tended to show more efficient in vitro cytotoxicity with its lower IC50 values on hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines compared to its lead molecule, goniothalamin and FDA-approved drugs, sorafenib and regorafenib. Cell-based Sirtuin/HDAC enzyme activity measurements revealed that endogenous Sirtuin/HDAC enzymes were reduced by 40% compared to control. SIRT1 protein levels were upregulated indicating triggered DNA repair mechanism. p53 was overexpressed in HepG2 cells. (R)-4'-methylklavuzon inhibited CRM1 protein providing increased retention of p53 and RIOK2 protein in the nucleus. HuH-7 parental and EpCAM+/CD133+ cancer stem cell spheroids lost intact morphology. 3D HepG2 spheroid viabilities were decreased in a correlation with upregulation in p53 protein levels.
