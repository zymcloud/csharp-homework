Background:This study aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of hepatectomy for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages B and C advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 314 patients (149 and 165 BCLC stages B and C, respectively) who underwent hepatectomy were included. Complete hepatectomy (without residual tumors after hepatectomy) and reductive hepatectomy (apparent residual tumors after hepatectomy) were performed for 212 and 102 patients, respectively. Short-term operative and postoperative outcomes, as well as long-term outcomes, were evaluated.Results:The median survival times of patients with stage B disease undergoing complete hepatectomy and reductive hepatectomy were 48.9 and 20.1 months, respectively (p = 0.0075), whereas those of patients with stage C disease were 19.5 and 17.6 months, respectively (p = 0.0140). The 3-year overall survival rates of patients with stage B disease undergoing reductive hepatectomy with and without subsequent local treatments after surgery were 47.5% and 0%, respectively, whereas those of patients with stage C diseases were 18.6% and 0%, respectively.Conclusions:Survival benefits are obvious for both BCLC stages B and C HCC when complete hepatectomy can be performed safely. Reductive hepatectomy is also acceptable for BCLC stages B and C when subsequent local treatment for remnant liver tumors can be performed safely after reductive hepatectomy. Without subsequent local treatment, reductive hepatectomy has little clinical relevance. Thus, a cautious approach to patient selection is required for this aggressive strategy.
