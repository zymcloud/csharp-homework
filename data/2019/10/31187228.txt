Purpose:To investigate the feasibility and safety of a helical iodine-125 (I-125) seed implant combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with main portal vein tumor thrombus (MPVTT).Methods:From December 2016 to February 2018, 26 cases of HCC with MPVTT patients were enrolled in this prospective study. Helical I-125 seed implants were placed into the portal vein through the percutaneous transhepatic route. Subsequently, TACE was performed. Follow-up with enhanced CT was performed every 6-8 weeks and TACE was repeated if the residual or recurrent tumor was found. Treatment response was measured with the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. Complication rates and overall survival were also evaluated.Results:Implantation and TACE were successful in all patients. There were no grade â‰¥ 3 complications observed in the patients. The objective response rates (ORR) and disease control rates (DCR) of MPVTT at 3 months after implantation were 42.3% and 84.6%, respectively, whereas ORR and DCR of the liver lesions were 34.6% and 46.2%, respectively. The median overall survival was 10.7 months (95% CI 6.2-15.2 months).Conclusion:Helical I-125 seed implants can be safely placed into the human main portal vein. Helical I-125 seed implants combined with TACE for HCC with MPVTT are safe and feasible.
