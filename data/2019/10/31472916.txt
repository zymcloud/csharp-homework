Hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are often amenable to locoregional therapy, including percutaneous ablation, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), or transarterial radioembolization (TARE). TARE is a technique that delivers a high dose of radiation to the tumor, while limiting the dose to the normal liver parenchyma and the adjacent organs. It has been shown to effectively provide disease control with relatively few toxicities, and in certain cases results in a complete response. It is the preferred therapy as a bridge to liver transplant and can provide necessary compensatory future liver remnant hypertrophy before planned surgical resection.
