Laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) is a newly developed technique associated with advantages as open surgery, but the study on outcome of liver function recovery was scarce. This preliminary report was aimed to comparatively assess the short-term outcomes between LH and open hepatectomy (OH) for primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC). This study retrospectively analyzed the demographic data and short-term outcomes of 81 patients who underwent LH or OH for the primary treatment of PHC between Oct. 2017 and May 2018 at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (China). A total of 81 PHC patients who received major liver resection were enrolled. There were 38 (47%) patients in the LH group and 43 (53%) patients in the OH group. The operative time was significantly longer (373.53±173.38 vs. 225.43±55.08, P
