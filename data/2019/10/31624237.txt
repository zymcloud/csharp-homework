This study was designed to investigate the mechanism by which miR-129-5p affects the biological function of liver cancer cells. The expression levels of miR-129-5p in liver cancer tissues and cells were, respectively, determined. Crystal violet staining and flow cytometry were used to detect cell proliferation and apoptosis. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to test cell migration and invasion. The target gene of miR-129-5p was analyzed and verified by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Tumorigenicity assays in nude mice were used to test the antitumor ability of calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4). miR-129-5p was found to be underexpressed in hepatocellular cancer tissues and cells and also to inhibit liver cells proliferation, migration, and invasion and promote apoptosis. CAMK4 was a direct target for miR-129-5p and was lowly expressed in liver cancer tissues and cells. CAMK4 was also found to inhibit liver cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote apoptosis. CAMK4 might exert an antitumor effect by inhibiting the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). MiR-129-5p was a tumor suppressor with low expression in liver cancer tissues and cells. CAMK4, which is a direct target gene of miR-129-5p, could inhibit tumor by inhibiting the activation of MAPK signaling pathway.
