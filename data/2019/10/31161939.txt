Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In 2009, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) strongly linked genetic variants in the interferon lambda (IFN-λ) chromosomal region to HCV clearance. In 2013, discovery of the IFNL4 gene provided a functional explanation for those GWAS findings. The IFNL4-ΔG/TT (rs368234815) variant controls generation of the IFN-λ4 protein. Paradoxically, the IFNL4-TT allele, which abrogates IFN-λ4, associates with higher rates of spontaneous HCV clearance and better response to treatments for HCV infection. The finding that a "knock-out" allele for IFN-λ4 enhances HCV clearance challenges the paradigm of IFNs as antiviral cytokines. Genetic variants in the IFN-λ region have also been associated with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis from various etiologies, however, alleles that are linked with improved HCV clearance associates with worse inflammation and fibrosis. These studies demonstrate that GWAS of infectious diseases may yield important and unexpected biological insights.
