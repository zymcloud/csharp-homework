Background:Long non-coding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript 2 (CCAT2) is a 1752-bp lncRNA transcribed from m8q24 genomic region. A lot of investigations have confirmed the involvement of CCAT2 in the tumorigenesis of many cancer types. Previous studies found that over-expression of CCAT2 significantly promoted cell migration and proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis of HCC cells. In the present investigation, the clinical value and prognostic significance of CCAT2 were investigated.Methods:The 122 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues were acquired between September 2013 and February 2018. The expression levels of CCAT2 in HCC tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal liver tissues were examined by RT-qPCR analysis. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank test. Independent prognostic indicators were determined in the multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model.Results:CCAT2 expression levels were significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to that in their normal counterparts (P Conclusions:Taken together, this research revealed that lncRNA CCAT2 may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting overall survival time in HCC.
