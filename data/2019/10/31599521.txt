Discovered in 1977, Hepatitis D is the most severe form of chronic hepatitis, with rapid development of cirrhosis, hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite all this, it is still largely underdiagnosed and there is no standardised management. The current treatment options are scarce and bear frequent side-effects, but the early diagnosis and an optimal follow-up with identification of the patients suitable for treatment improve significantly their survival rate and quality of life. Moreover, new promising treatments are entering phase III trials and offer new perspectives for our patients.
