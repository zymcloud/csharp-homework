Background:PARP1-binding protein (PARPBP/PARI/C12orf48), a negative regulator of homologous recombination (HR), has been suggested to function as an oncogene in cervical, lung, and pancreatic cancer.Objective:To investigate the expression profile of PARPBP and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Human Protein Atlas databases, PARPBP expression level and its clinical implication in HCC were identified by t test and Chi-square test. The prognostic value of PARPBP in HCC was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression analysis, and nomogram. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to screen biological pathways correlated with PARPBP expression in HCC.Results:PARPBP was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues (P Conclusion:PARPBP may be a promising prognostic biomarker and candidate therapeutic target in HCC.
