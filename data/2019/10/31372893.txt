Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a malignant tumor which arises from the biliary epithelium and most cases represent adenocarcinoma. CC can be classified into intrahepatic CC (ICC), perihilar CC, and distal CC, based on the site of anatomic origin. The incidence of ICC is increasing in both Western and Eastern countries, while that of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma remains fairly stable. ICC infiltrates into adjacent nerves and lymphatic vessels, resulting in progressive disease with a poor prognosis; thus, early detection of ICC is critical for achieving better outcomes and providing better patient care. However, it is difficult for clinicians to detect an ICC, especially in its early stage. Different from hepatocellular carcinoma, the lack of surveillance system for the high-risk group of CC does not allow for a reliable screening examination. In this context, for early detection and diagnosis of ICC, radiologists need to know predisposing conditions that can lead to the development of ICC, such as chronic biliary or hepatic inflammation, primary sclerosing cholangitis, congenital biliary diseases, and other conditions. In this article, we discuss and illustrate the radiologic features of ICC with special attention to early disease stages and of predisposing conditions of ICC.
