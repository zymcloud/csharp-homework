The objective of this study was to examine the function of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOXA11-AS in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In total, samples from liver tumor and surrounding normal liver tissues were collected from 66 cases of HCC patients. Normal liver cell line HL-7702 and HCC cell lines HepG2, Hep3B, MHCC-97H and BEL7402 were used. Cells were transfected with different small interference RNAs or vectors. Then, transwell assay, qRT-PCR, CHIP, RIP and Western blot experiments were performed. We found that the HOXA11-AS expression level was higher in HCC samples than surrounding normal liver tissues. And the higher expression level of HOXA11-AS in HCC patients indicated a lower 5-year survival rate. Knockdown of HOXA11-AS in HepG2 and Hep3B cells caused impaired cell invasion and migration abilities. Otherwise, upregulation of HOXA11-AS in MHCC-97H and BEL7402 cells displayed higher invasion and migration capabilities. We also demonstrated that HOXA11-AS could inhibit miR-124 expression by binding to EZH2. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-124 or knockdown EZH2 expression could reverse the HOXA11-AS-induced migration and invasion effects in HCC cells. In summary, the high HOXA11-AS expression in HCC patients is associated with the poor outcome. HOXA11-AS could inhibit miR-124 expression by binding to EZH2 and thus promoted the migration and invasion of HCC cells.
