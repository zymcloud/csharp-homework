Colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) is the most common pattern of metastases or recurrence in colorectal carcinoma; however, no robust pathologic prognostic factors have been identified. This study aimed to verify the prognostic value of poorly differentiated clusters (PDC) in liver metastatic lesions and to clarify the correlation between PDC in liver metastatic lesions (PDC) and the primary tumor histology. Consecutive patients who underwent resection for CRLM were pathologically reviewed. PDC was defined as cancer clusters comprising ≥5 cancer cells and lacking glandular formation and was quantifiably graded as G1 (<5 clusters), G2 (5 to 9 clusters), and G3 (≥10 clusters) based on the highest number of clusters observed under ×20 magnification. The cohort comprised 204 patients. PDC was classified as G1, G2, and G3 for 68, 69, and 67 patients, respectively, and it was significantly associated with PDC grade in the primary tumor (P<0.001). Among the potential prognostic factors, tumor budding in the primary tumor, PDC in the primary tumor, the number of liver metastases, extrahepatic metastasis, and PDC significantly influenced overall survival (OS) after CRLM resection. According to the PDC grade, the 5-year OS rates were 68.9%, 48.3%, and 39.5% for G1, G2, and G3 (P<0.001), respectively. Multivariate analysis for OS showed that PDC grade, tumor budding in the primary tumor, the number of liver metastasis and extrahepatic metastasis were independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, there is a correlation in the PDC grade between the primary tumor and liver metastatic lesion, and PDC grade could be a promising new prognostic factor after CRLM resection.
