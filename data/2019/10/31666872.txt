The development of photochromic fluorescence sensors with dynamic and multiple-signaling is beneficial to the improvement of biosensing/imaging precision. However, elaborate designs with complicated molecular structures are always required to integrate these functions into one molecule. By taking advantages of both redox-active/high loading features of two-dimensional (2D) manganese dioxide (MnO2) and dynamic fluorescence photoswitching of photochromic sensors, we here design a hybrid photochromic MnO2 glycosheet (Glyco-DTE@MnO 2 ) to achieve the photoswitchable imaging of intracellular glutathione (GSH). The photochromic glycosheet manifests significantly turn-on fluorescence and dynamic ON/OFF fluorescence signals in response to GSH, which makes it favorable for intracellular GSH double-check in targeted human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) through the recognition between Î²-D-galactoside and asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPr) on cell membranes. The dynamic fluorescence signals and excellent selectivity for detection and imaging of GSH ensure the precise determination of cell states, promoting its potential applications in future disease diagnosis and therapy.
