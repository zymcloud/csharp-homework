Presently, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has become the most common pathogenic factor of chronic liver disease worldwide that can lead to the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lipid metabolism in cancer cells is closely related to tumorgenesis, invasion and metastasis, and thus acts as one of the hallmark of cancer cells. Lipolipomics is an important branch of metabolomics, which has been adapted recently in the study of HCC for analysis of the structure and function of lipid components by chromatography and mass spectrometry. Fatty acids, glycerides, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterol are significantly different in HCC tissues or serum. Therefore, it contributes to the diagnosis, determination of prognosis, mechanistic study and targeted therapy of HCC.
