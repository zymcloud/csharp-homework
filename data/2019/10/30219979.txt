Oxidative stress and inflammation play a pivotal role in the expansion and progression of hepatic cancer. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery can quickly enhance the restorative capability of hepatic cancer. Silver nanoparticles synthesized from plant source are of great importance due to their small size, economic, non-hazardous and different biomedical applications. In the current study, we have evaluated the impacts of oxidative stress and proinflammatory markers of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles of Phyllanthus emblica (PE) leaves against diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in wistar rats till 16 weeks with its underlying mechanism. The physico-chemical properties of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles were determined by ultra-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies. Biofabricated silver nanoparticles (PEAgNPs) significantly enhanced the process of recovery from hepatic cancer in animal models, which was ascertained by increased body weight, reduced hepatic knobs on the outer surface of liver, downregulated serum biochemical parameters (ALT: 134.66 ± 2.60; AST: 120.33 ± 3.18; ALP: 153.33 ± 4.25; AFP: 167.33 ± 3.38), decreased hepatic lipid peroxidation (20.22 ± 1.74), increased membrane-bound enzymes (Na+/K+ATPase: 4.18 ± 0.20; Ca2+ATPase: 6.24 ± 0.12), increased antioxidants parameters (CAT: 64.89 ± 4.13; SOD: 6.01 ± 0.11; GPx: 8.55 ± 0.05), alteration in the level of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α: 90.15 ± 5.77; NF-κB: 173.29 ± 7.26; IL-6: 178.11 ± 3.16; IL-1β: 48.26 ± 1.89) and histopathological studies. Our outcomes implicate successfully biofabrication of silver nanoparticles and exhibited a chemoprotective potential in the prevention and intervention of hepatocellular carcinoma.
