A novel hexanuclear copper(ii)-based complex, [Cu6(tpbb)2(NO3)12] (1), was synthesized, which shows potent cytotoxicity to hepatoma carcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis and apoptosis-related processes. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations based on proteomes revealed that the induced apoptosis was mediated by acting on several targets and multiple pathways in a pleiotropic way.
