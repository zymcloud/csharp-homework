A 64-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer based on an endoscopic examination in June 2009; histological findings indicated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.Computed tomography revealed multiple liver metastases and bulky lymph node metastases of LN#7.The multiple liver metastases of the gastric cancer were not considered to be candidates for surgical resection, and S-1/CDDP chemotherapy was initiated in July 2009. After 6 courses of this regimen, liver and lymph node metastases showed partial response(PR), but the gastric tumor showed progressive disease(PD).Therefore, we switched this regimen to bi-weekly CPT-11/CDDP in March 2010. However, because the gastric tumor had increased in size and presented with bleeding, we performed distal gastrectomy.The pathological diagnosis based on the resected speci- men was large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.After surgery, CPT-11/CDDP was continued but was switched to CPT-11 in June 2011 because of induced renal dysfunction.In November 2011, the regimen was switched to weekly paclitaxel because of a progressive increase in size of a solitary liver metastatic lesion located in S4-5.Two courses of this regimen were administered, but they were ineffective; therefore, we performed partial hepatectomy.No other recurrent lesions were observed during the surgery, and the patient was estimated to have achieved complete response(CR).After the surgery, no further adjuvant chemotherapy was administered.Four years after hepatectomy, the patient was diagnosed with esophageal cancer but exhibited no recurrence of the gastric cancer.We performed esophagectomy for the esophageal cancer in May 2016.T he patient is currently well without any relapse.
