Background:Abnormal activation of protein kinase B (PKB) is associated with many cancers. This makes inhibition of PKB signaling pathway a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Lactoferrin (Lf) has been reported for its inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis, however, the mechanism is not completely understood. Its anti-hepatocarcinogenic activity has not taken the deserved recognition despite the additional advantages of Lf as an antiviral against hepatitis C virus, the main cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and as a targeting ligand for delivering chemotherapeutics to hepatoma cells.Methods:This study evaluated the anti-hepatocarcinogenic effect of Lf, and the role of PKB in this effect using diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-induced HCC rat model, and a primary cell culture prepared from the induced hepatic lesions (DENA-HCC cell culture).Results:Up-regulation of activated PKB in the hepatocytes of rats with DENA-induced HCC was observed, as measured biochemically in the liver homogenate, and localized immunohistochemically. This was accompanied by increment of hepatocytes proliferation, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Involvement of PKB in DENA-induced HCC was confirmed by the observed decrease in cell proliferation in DENA-HCC cell culture that was treated with PKB inhibitor. In Lf-treated rats, a dose-dependent chemopreventive effect was observed, with decreased expression and activation of PKB, amelioration of the other DENA-induced alterations, and stimulation of apoptosis. In vitro, Lf blocked PKB activator-induced cell proliferation.Conclusion:These findings support the chemopreventive activity of Lf against HCC, and suggest regulation of PKB-pathway as a potential mechanism underlying this effect.
