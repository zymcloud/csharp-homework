Propofol is one of the most extensively used intravenous anaesthetic agents, which has been found to improve the surgical intervention outcome of several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, in vitro and in vivo experiments have also indicated that propofol affects the biological behaviour of HCC. However, the underlying mechanisms of the surgical resection of HCC with propofol have not been fully understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of propofol inhibition of the growth and invasion of HCC cells. Our results showed that treatment with propofol suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC in vitro. The subcutaneous xenograft tumour and orthotopic xenograft tumour experiments in nude mice showed that propofol significantly decreased tumour volumes, growth rates and the liver orthotopic xenograft tumour in vivo. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism investigations of the suppressive effects of propofol on HCC cells revealed that propofol treatment upregulated the expression levels of the candidate tumour suppressor miR-219-5p. Silencing of propofol-induced miR-219-5p using anti-miR-219-5p abrogated the inhibitory effects on the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells exerted by propofol treatment. Additionally, we demonstrated that propofol reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of Huh7 and SMMC7721 cells via miR-219-5p induction. The molecular mechanism behind these findings is that propofol-induced miR-219-5p inhibits HCC cell progression by targeting glypican-3 and subsequently results in the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the advantages of the surgical intervention of HCC with propofol anaesthetization.
