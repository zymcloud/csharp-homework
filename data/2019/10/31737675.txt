Inflammatory markers have been studied in cancers and chronic states of inflammation. They are thought to correlate with tumor pathology through disruption of normal homeostasis. Markers such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) among others have shown promise as prognostic tools in various cancers. In this study, we evaluate complete blood count based inflammatory markers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to predict overall and recurrence-free survival of patients after liver transplant. Between 2001 and 2017, all HCC indicated liver transplants were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria included presence of complete blood cell counts with differential within three months prior to transplantation. Exclusion criteria included retransplantation and inadequate posttransplant followup. A total of 160 patients with HCC were included in the study. Of those, 74.4% had hepatitis C virus as the underlying cause of HCC. Calculated Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores were statistically worse in patients with elevated NLR (≥5), derived NLR (≥3), and low lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) (
