Surgical resection and liver transplant remain the cornerstones of curative treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma. Determining the best treatment option for each patient is a complex decision based on degree of liver cirrhosis, extent of tumor, and overall patient performance status. A multidisciplinary approach is best. With widespread adoption, the role of laparoscopic liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma continues to expand. Long-term oncologic outcomes are similar for laparoscopic and open resection, with improved short-term results, mainly blood loss and hospital length of stay. Liver transplant remains the ideal treatment of cirrhotic patients with signs of portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma.
