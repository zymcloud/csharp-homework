Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important reason of liver-related death globally. HCC is the fifth most common cancer, the third most common cause for cancer related death in the world and responsible for approximately one million deaths each year. The incidence of HCC is expected to increase in the next two decades, largely due to hepatitis C infection and secondary cirrhosis. We have reported a case of hepatocellular carcinoma in a 56-year-old man with peritoneal metastasis. Diagnostic imaging (Ultra sonogram & CT-Scan) shown: a large hypo density, irregular outline lesion noted in right lower liver, post contrast image shown patchy enhancement of the lesion. His serum Alpha-Feto Protein (AFP) level was very high with elevated serum alanine amino transaminase (ALT) enzyme and prothrombin time. Histopathological (microscopic) features are compatible with Hepatocellular carcinoma. His Hepatitis C viral DNA load e.g., core protein variants and genotype 1, have been reported. The patient was treated by surgical resection followed by conservative treatment includes sorafenib & interferon alpha. This case report aims to outlines the epidemiology of HCC in chronic HCV, risk factors and pathophysiology that contribute to this disease process, related pathophysiology of patient's clinical features, screening recommendations, and the available statistics on the impact of new direct-acting antiviral treatment on the development on HCC.
