Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important regulatory role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Aberrant expression of miR-497-5p has been reported in various human malignancies. However, the role of miR-497-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.Results:In this study, we found that miR-497-5p was downregulated in HCC tissues. The low level of miR-497-5p in HCC tumors was correlated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics and predicted poor prognosis in HCC patients. The overexpression of miR-497-5p significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, colony formation, and metastasis in vitro and vivo. Bioinformatics analysis further identified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) as a novel target of miR-497-5p in HCC cells.Conclusion:Our study suggested that miR-497-5p regulates HCC cell survival, partially through downregulation of IGF1. Therefore, the miR-497-5p/IGF1 axis might serve as a novel therapeutic target in patients with HCC.
