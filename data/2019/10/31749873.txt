Introduction:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection persists in most infected individuals and can lead to the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a crucial role in various liver diseases, especially HCC. The expression profiles of circulating microRNAs have been studied aiming at the identification of novel non-invasive biomarkers. This study aims to develop a non-invasive diagnostic tool based on measuring the serum levels of different miRNAs in order to detect HCV-induced HCC at the early stages of the disease.Material and methods:Five main miRNAs (miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139, miRNA-145, and miRNA-199a) were selected according to the literature that demonstrated their unique expression pattern during HCC development. Serum samples were collected from 42 cases of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) without cirrhosis, 45 cases of CHC with cirrhosis (LC), 38 cases of HCC with HCV, and 40 healthy individuals serving as a control. The five miRNAs were measured using real-time reverse transcription PCR. The conventional HCC markers α-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) were measured with commercial kits.Results:Serum levels of miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139, miRNA-145, and miRNA-199a were significantly lower (p < 0.01) in HCC than in CHC and LC groups. As a single marker, miRNA-122a had the highest sensitivity for HCC, followed by miRNA-199a, miRNA-145, miRNA-139, and miRNA-125a.Conclusions:These findings indicate that measurement of serum levels of miRNA-122a, miRNA-125a, miRNA-139, miRNA-145, and miRNA-199a can differentiate HCC from CHC and LC. Our results suggest that serum miR-122 might serve as a novel and potential noninvasive biomarker for HCV-induced HCC.
