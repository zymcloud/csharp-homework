Purposes:This study compared the effectiveness of 1-day vs 3-days antibiotic regimen to prevent surgical site infection (SSI) in open liver resection.Method:We performed a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in 480 patients at 39 hospitals across Japan (registered as UMIN000002852). Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma scheduled to undergo resection were randomly assigned to receive either a 1-day regimen for antimicrobial prophylaxis, or a 3-day regimen. The primary endpoint was the incidence of SSI.Results:Among 480 randomized patients, 232 assigned to the 1-day regimen and 235 to the 3-day regimen were included in the full analysis set. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced. SSI was diagnosed in 22 patients (9.5%) in the 1-day group vs 23 patients (9.8%) in the 3-day group (difference, - 0.30; 90% CI - 4.80 to 4.19% [95% CI - 5.66% to 5.05%]; one-sided P = 0.001 for non-inferiority), meeting the non-inferiority hypothesis. In both groups, remote site infection (16 [6.9%] vs 22 [9.4%], P ˂ 0.001 for non-inferiority) and drain-related infection (5 [2.2%] vs 4 [1.7%], P ˂ 0.001 for non-inferiority) were comparable.Conclusion:To prevent SSI in liver cancer surgery, a 1-day regimen of flomoxef sodium is recommended for antimicrobial prophylaxis because of confirming the non-inferiority to longer usage.
