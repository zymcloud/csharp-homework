Cancers of the hepatobiliary tract are highly fatal, prompting the need for early detection to provide treatment and decrease the mortality rate. Screening patients for hepatobiliary cancers can provide early detection, but it is not feasible or efficient to screen all patients. Therefore, it is important to consider the known risk factors for each hepatobiliary cancer which creates a smaller population that is amenable to screening.
