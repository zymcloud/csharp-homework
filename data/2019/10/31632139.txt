Purpose:Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is a severe complication in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who have undergone hepatectomy. This research aimed to investigate the combination of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score and aspartate aminotransferase-platelet ratio index (APRI) as a novel approach in predicting PHLF risk in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients.Patients and methods:HBV-related HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy from January 2006 to October 2013 were enrolled in this study. A novel model was constructed using a combination of ALBI and APRI scores to predict PHLF risk, and the prognostic value of the model was evaluated and compared with Child-Pugh (C-P) grade, ALBI score and APRI score.Results:A total of 1,055 HCC patients were retrospectively studied, which included 151 experienced PHLF. Univariable and multivariate analyses showed that the ALBI and APRI scores were independent predictors of PHLF. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the ALBI score, APRI score, and C-P grade was 0.717, 0.720, and 0.602, respectively, with AUC (ALBI) > AUC (C-P) (P <0.001) and AUC (APRI) > AUC (C-P) (P <0.001). After ALBI was associated with APRI, the AUC (ALBI-APRI) was 0.766, and AUC (ALBI-APRI) > AUC (ALBI) (P <0.001), AUC (ALBI-APRI) > AUC (APRI) (P =0.047). Our results indicated that ALBI and APRI scores had higher discriminatory abilities than C-P grade in predicting the risk of PHLF, and the ALBI-APRI model could enhance the capability of predicting PHLF compared to ALBI or APRI alone.Conclusion:ALBI-APRI score is a novel and effective predictive model of PHLF for HBV-related HCC patients, and its accuracy in predicting the risk of PHLF is better than that of C-P, ALBI and APRI scores.
