Liver diseases form a heterogenous group of acute and chronic disorders of varying etiologies. Not only do they result in significant morbidity and mortality, but they also lead to a marked reduction in quality of life, together with a high socioeconomic burden globally. A better understanding of their global distribution is necessary to curb the massive health-care and socioeconomic burden that they entail. Notable differences and similarities have been described between common liver disease conditions occurring in Asia and the West (Europe and North America), giving rise to the need for an updated collective appraisal of this subject. In this review, the epidemiological differences of common liver conditions, specifically acute liver failure, drug-induced liver injury, acute-on-chronic liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, between Asia and the West are discussed.
