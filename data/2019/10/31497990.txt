Introduction:the characteristics, screening, and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for patients without cirrhosis have not been fully studied.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was performed in non-cirrhotic patients with histological HCC, between January 2004 and October 2018. Their characteristics, treatment, follow-up and overall survival were described.Results:25 of the 332 patients with HCC met the inclusion criteria (7.5%), 76% were males and the median age was 69.9 years. The main etiology of liver disease was the hepatitis B virus (HBV) (32%), followed by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (20%). Liver fibrosis was mild (0-1) in 44% of cases. The nodule was diagnosed by ultrasonography in 32% of cases, 60% were found incidentally and 8% due to clinical symptoms. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging was 0 in 4% of cases, A in 88%, B in 4% and C in 4%. The main initial treatment was surgical resection (76%) and 8% refused to be treated. Percutaneous ethanol injection, chemoembolization, sorafenib and palliative care were each performed in 4% of cases. There were some complications in 21% of patients treated with surgery, half of them were severe. The median follow-up was 22.2 (2.9-150.6) months and 56% were in remission and the median overall survival was 57.4 Â± 29.8 months. The overall cumulative survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 84%, 61.6% and 47.9%, respectively.Conclusion:7.5% of HCC presented without cirrhosis and almost half of patients had mild fibrosis. HBV was the main cause of HCC, followed by NASH. The most frequent BCLC stage at diagnosis was early stage and surgery was the most common treatment. Overall cumulative survival at 5 years was almost 50%.
