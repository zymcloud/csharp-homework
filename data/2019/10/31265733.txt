FOXO3 belongs to the Forkhead O transcription factor family and it is an important gene in multiple biological processes, such as cell cycle control, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, human longevity, and oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown that FOXO3 is associated with skeletal muscle growth and adipose development in mammals. However, the sequence of chicken FOXO3 is still incomplete and the cellular functions of FOXO3 in chickens are poorly understood. Thus, we obtained the full-length sequence of chicken FOXO3 by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE) and the phylogenetic tree showed that the chicken FOXO3 sequence was homologous with those in other species. Flow cytometry analysis and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays showed that FOXO3 repressed cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in a chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (LMH). Mutations were screened in the second exon of FOXO3 and 13 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the test population. Further analysis showed that rs317670452 and rs15379317 were associated with many growth and carcass traits, such as the body weight at different ages and breast muscle weight. Our results indicate that chicken FOXO3 has similar cellular functions to those found in mammals and it is significantly associated with chicken growth.
