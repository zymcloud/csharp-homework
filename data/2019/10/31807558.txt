Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death with a limited efficacy of treatment for intermediate and advanced stages of the disease. Several therapeutic approaches such as trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with anthracyclines, cisplatin and multikinase inhibitor sorafenib have been appealing choices of treatments yet failed to reach a satisfactory outcome mainly due to the numerous mechanisms that influence patient's response. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of many intracellular processes related to drug resistance. This phenomenon has been linked to the modulation of several complex pathways, ranging from the loss of ability of drug accumulation, protective mechanism of autophagy, adaptive mechanism of cancer cells towards the drugs-induced environment, decrease DNA damage and suppression of downstream events that transduce its signal into apoptosis. We summarize the recent findings on the involvement of miRNAs in various drug resistance-related mechanisms in the development of resistance to anthracyclines, cisplatin and sorafenib therapies. Furthermore, we describe the possible application of miRNAs as circulating biomarkers predicting therapy response in HCC. Thus, the undeniable potential and paramount role of miRNA in drug resistance may eventually lead to improved clinical strategies and outcomes for HCC patients.
