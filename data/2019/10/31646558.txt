Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the exact role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RUNX1-IT1 in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, and to explore the possible underlying mechanism.Patients and methods:LncRNA RUNX1-IT1 expressions in paired HCC tissues (cancer and paired non-cancer tissues) (n=80) and HCC cell lines were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The effects of lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 on the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cells were estimated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and tunnel assay, respectively. Furthermore, the association between lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 expression and the overall survival of patients was analyzed by the survival curve.Results:The expression level of lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 significantly decreased in HCC tissues. The overexpression of lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 remarkably inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of HCC cells. On the contrary, the knockdown of lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 remarkably enhanced the ability of proliferation and repressed the apoptosis of the HCC cells. In addition, lower expression of lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 indicated the worse prognosis of HCC patients.Conclusions:We found that lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 played an important role in the development of HCC by participating in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, lncRNA RUNX1-IT1 might be a powerful candidate as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.
