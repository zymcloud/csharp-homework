As a novel orally active multitarget small molecule inhibitor, CS2164 has shown broad antitumor activities against several human tumor xenograft models in immune-compromised mice. However, the ability of CS2164 to modulate antitumor immunity in an immune-competent mouse tumor model remains undefined, although antiangiogenic treatment has been reported to affect immune cell infiltration and remodel the tumor immune microenvironment. In the present study, the subcutaneous and ascites hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models in syngeneic Balb/c mice established by inoculation of an H22 hepatoma cell line were utilized to investigate the antitumor and immunomodulatory effects of CS2164. Although the antitumor effects of CS2164 were validated in both subcutaneous and ascites HCC models in syngeneic mice, CS2164 treatment consistently modulated immune cell populations, both in the periphery and in tumor microenvironments, with upregulation of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the spleen, but downregulation of immunosuppressive populations including regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and tumor-associated macrophages in the spleen and tumor tissues. Furthermore, CS2164 increased the relative gene expression and protein production of several proinflammatory cytokines in tumor-related ascites. These results indicate that CS2164 exerts an antitumor effect associated with its immunomodulatory activities in mouse HCC models, and may also provide evidence for the immunotherapy potentiation of CS2164 in future cancer treatment.
