Background:Recently, much attention has been paid to use circulating microRNAs (miRs) as a non-invasive tumor marker. The present study for the first time was designed to evaluate concurrent use of miR-21, miR-638, miR148 and miR-152 as putative diagnostic tool for detection of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).Methods:Forty-three patients diagnosed as primary NSCLC was included in this study. The level of selected miRs was measured in whole blood specimens of patients and controls. The corresponding values were also obtained in stages I-IV. We also assessed possible correlation between selected miRs and the clinicopathological findings of studied individuals.Results:miR-21 was increased in patients compared to controls (P = 0.004). In contrast, circulating miR-638, miR-148 and miR-152 was observed to be down-regulated in NSCLC patients than controls (P = 0.001, 0.003, 0.053, respectively). Rise in miR-21-5p expression and decreased blood level of miR-148a-3p was associated with higher stage of NSCLC. The highest sensitivity (90%) was observed for miR-21 while miR-148 had the highest specificity (71%). The corresponding sensitivity and specificity for combined-miRs-panel was 96.4% and 86.67%, respectively.Conclusion:In summary, our data suggested the diagnostic importance of combined-miR-panel including miR-21, miR-638, miR148 and miR-152 for effective discrimination of NSCLC from non-cancerous subjects.
