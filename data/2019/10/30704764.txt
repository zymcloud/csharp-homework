Aim:Complications due to iron overload exert a problematic situation in patients with thalassemia. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like pantoprazole are effective agents to reduce acid gastric acid secretion and perhaps to interrupt iron absorption in conditions with increased iron absorption. Our purpose was to study effects of pantoprazole addition to chelators on iron levels in patients with thalassemia major and intermedia.Methods:This randomized, controlled, and single center trial was performed on 60 patients with thalassemia major and intermedia in Amir Kabir hospital, Iran. Patients were randomized 1:1 to pantoprazole group (iron chelator plus pantoprazole) or control group (iron chelator) for 6 months. Serum ferritin was measured by ELISA. Iron content was measured by magnetic resonance imaging; heart T2*, and liver T2*.Results:After 6 months of treatment, a significant reduction was seen in serum ferritin levels in the pantoprazole group (1444±613μg/mL to 1197±956μg/mL; P<0.001). A further reduction was seen in patients with thalassmeia intermedia. There were no significant changes in myocardial T2* values in pantoprazole group compared to control group (23.6±7.3ms to 24.1±6.4ms). Compared to the control group, pantoprazole therapy had no effect on hepatic T2* value (9.7±2.3ms to 9.8±2.6ms). However, between-group difference was significant (P<0.05).Conclusion:Pantoprazole therapy for 6 months has benefits for reducing serum ferritin in patients with thalassemia major and intermedia. Pantoprazole addition to iron chelators seems safe.
