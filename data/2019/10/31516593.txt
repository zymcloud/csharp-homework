Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (DRHC) is a tumor suppressor in liver cancer. However, the role of this lncRNA in breast cancer has not been investigated. The present study revealed that lncRNA DRHC was downregulated and lncRNA Hox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was upregulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent healthy tissues in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Expression levels of lncRNA DRHC and lncRNA HOTAIR were negatively correlated in tumor tissues but not in adjacent healthy tissues. The lncRNA DRHC expression level was correlated with tumor size but not tumor metastasis. In vitro overexpression of lncRNA DRHC in TNBC cell lines resulted in decreased expression of lncRNA HOTAIR; however, lncRNA HOTAIR overexpression did not affect the expression level of lncRNA DRHC. Overexpression of lncRNA DRHC inhibited, while overexpression of lncRNA HOTAIR promoted the proliferation of the TNBC cell lines. In addition, lncRNA HOTAIR overexpression attenuated the inhibitory effects of lncRNA DRHC overexpression on cancer cell proliferation. The results obtained in the current study suggested that lncRNA DRHC may inhibit the proliferation of TNBC cells by downregulating the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR.
