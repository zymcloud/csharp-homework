Accumulating statistics have shown that liver cancer causes the second highest mortality rate of cancer-related deaths worldwide, of which 80% is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Given the underlying molecular mechanism of HCC pathology is not fully understood yet, identification of reliable predictive biomarkers is more applicable to improve patients' outcomes. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the grouped data from 1557 samples in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) came from different populations, and the mean tumor purity of tumor tissues was 0.765 through the estimate package in R software. After integrating the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we finally got 266 genes. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established based on these DEGs, which contained 240 nodes and 1747 edges. FOXM1 was the core gene in module 1 and highly associated with FOXM1 transcription factor network pathway, while FTCD was the core gene in module 2 and was enriched in the metabolism of amino acids and derivatives. The expression levels of hub genes were in line with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Meanwhile, there were certain correlations among the top ten genes in the up- and downregulated DEGs. Finally, Kaplan-Meier curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the top five genes in PPI. Apart from CDKN3, the others were closely concerned with overall survival. In this study, we detected the potential biomarkers and their involved biological processes, which would provide a new train of thought for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
