Sorafenib (SF) a chemotherapeutic drug is used in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with vast side effects. The aim of the project ahead was synthesis of SF loaded co-polymeric micelles of pectin-deoxycholic acid (P-DOCA) to target the overexpressed asialoglycoprotein receptors of hepatocytes by pectin. DOCA was modified with ethylenediamine and conjugated to pectin. FT-IR and 1HNMR confirmed the bio-conjugation. Pyrene was used to measure critical micelle concentration (CMC) by fluorimetry technique. P-DOCA micelles were loaded with SF and their particle size, zeta potential, drug loading and release efficiency were measured. MTT assay was used for determining cytotoxicity. The cell cycle arrest was studied by flow cytometry analysis and the cellular uptake was studied using cumarin-6 as the fluorophore agent. The micelles capability in preventing the cells migration was tested by Transwell plates. The CMC of P-DOCA micelles was 10.747 Î¼g/mL. The best formulation obtained from SF to polymer ratio of 1:2. SF loaded micelles showed 30% increased cytotoxicity. The micelles cellular uptake was more than the free drug. Relative migration of HepG2 cells treated with SF loaded micelles was reduced to 6.67% compared to free SF which was 26.67%. The designed micelles are promising for antitumor drug targeting to HCC.
