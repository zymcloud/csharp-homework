This issue of the Biomedical Journal honours the laureates of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for their ground-breaking contributions to cancer immunotherapy and unveils the identification of essential intermediates between microtubule-targeting agents and apoptosis. Subsequently, we learn about the hypoglycemic properties of natural phenolic acids, how cone-beam computed tomography assists dental implant surgery and which factors should be taken into account for salvage liver transplantation after recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. Further readings discuss the negative impact of bismuth shields on computed tomography image quality, the predictive value of warning headaches for aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage and the great long-term performance of zirconia implant abutments.
