For the past few decades, structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) has become an inevitable technique in the drug development process for screening hit compounds against therapeutic targets. Here, we have successfully used the SBDD approach viz. virtual high-throughput screening to identify potential inhibitors against the Ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain of Fatty acid synthase (FASN). Overexpression of FASN, and subsequent enhancement of de novo lipogenesis is a key survival strategy of cancer cells. Hence, targeting lipid metabolism using FASN inhibitors has been considered as a promising method to induce metabolic stress, thereby posing a survival disadvantage to cancer cells. In the present study, we have successfully identified eight FASN inhibitors from Asinex Elite database by implementing in silico tools. Five of the hit compounds share a common ring structure, which enables characteristic binding interactions with FASN-KS. Among them, in vitro validation showed that SFA 22637550 possesses significant FASN inhibitory activity and antiproliferative effect in human cancer cells of various origins. The maximum sensitivity was exhibited towards HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (IC50 = 28 ÂµM). The mode of cell death was found to be apoptosis with a significant increase in SubG0 population without affecting any other phases of the cell cycle. The current study puts forward an excellent core structure for the development of potent FASN inhibitors for successfully targeting cancer cell metabolism, thereby causing selective cell death.
