Downregulation of MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) and its association with cancer progression have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line models and a limited number of HCC samples. Recently, restoration of miR-122 expression by direct delivery of miR-122 yielded promising results in HCCs. However, the prognostic effect of miR-122 expression in human HCC samples is not fully understood. We investigated the expression level of miR-122 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 289 curatively resected HCC samples and 20 normal liver samples and evaluated the prognostic effect of miR-122 expression. The relative quantification value of miR-122 was much lower in HCC samples than in normal liver tissues. During a median 119 months of follow-up for survival, the low miR-122 expression group showed shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.033) and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (IHRFS) (p = 0.014), and a trend of short distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (p = 0.149) than high expression group. On multivariate analysis, miR-122 expression was an independent prognostic factor for RFS, IHRFS and DMFS. Downregulation of miR-122 expression, frequently found in HCC samples, was an independent prognostic factor for RFS after curative resection. Emerging therapeutic approaches targeting miR-122 could be applicable in patients with miR-122 downregulated hepatocellular carcinoma.
