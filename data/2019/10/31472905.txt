The accurate diagnosis of a liver mass can usually be established with a thorough history, examination, laboratory inquiry, and imaging. The necessity of a liver biopsy to determine the nature of a liver mass is rarely necessary. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the standard of care for diagnosing liver lesions and high-quality imaging should be performed before performing a biopsy. This article discusses current consensus guidelines for imaging of liver masses, as well as masses found on surveillance imaging. The ability to accurately characterize lesions requires proper use and understanding of the technology and expert interpretation.
