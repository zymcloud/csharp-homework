A 68-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic hepatitis B infection was referred to the nephrology department before planned surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma. He had been receiving low-dose adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for 11 years. Laboratory findings revealed impaired re-absorption in the proximal renal tubules. He had been diagnosed with diabetic kidney disease and osteomalacia due to vitamin D deficiency; thus, ADV was not discontinued until he was referred to us. In this case, concomitant diabetes mellitus and vitamin D deficiency might have prevented the early diagnosis of ADV-induced Fanconi syndrome.
