MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that are closely associated with the occurrence and development of tumors. miR-20b is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and tissues. However, it is not clear whether miR-20b can promote the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In the present study, the proliferation of H22 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. MiRanda software was used to predict the binding sites of miR-20b to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The 3'-UTR sequence of the PTEN gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction in H22 cells. The recombinant plasmid or empty plasmid was co-transfected with miR-20b mimics or miR-20b scramble into HeLa cells, and luciferase activity was assessed by Dual-LuciferaseÂ® Reporter Assay System 24 h post-transfection. In the present study, miR-20b knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation of H22 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, miR-20b inhibition upregulated the expression of PTEN, and it was revealed that miR-20b may directly target the 3'-untranslated region of the PTEN gene. Downregulation of PTEN partially reversed the anti-proliferative effect of miR-20b on H22 cells. In conclusion, miR-20b may promote H22 cell proliferation by targeting PTEN, providing a rationale for further study investigating novel therapeutic strategies for liver cancer.
