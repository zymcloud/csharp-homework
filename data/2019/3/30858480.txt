Iron is an essential mineral required for most forms of life. However, very little is known in relation to the different forms of dietary iron on the development of NAFLD. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of iron intake from different food types on risk of NAFLD and whether this effect may be modified by other factors. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study including 1,273 NAFLD cases and 1,273 gender and age-matched controls. We conducted in-person interviews while participants completed a questionnaire on food habits. We assessed animal- and plant-derived intake of iron and fat. We observed that animal-derived iron intake (>4.16 mg/day) was positively associated with augmented NAFLD risk in a Chinese population (ORadjusted = 1.66 in the highest quartile compared with the lowest, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-2.73). In contrast, a high consumption of iron (>16.87 mg/day) from plant-based foods was associated with a decreased NAFLD risk (ORadjusted = 0.61 in the highest quartile compared with the lowest; 95% CI = 0.40-0.935). In addition, high intake of fat or being overweight may exacerbate this effect. Reduced consumption of iron and fat from animal sources could reduce NAFLD risk, as would weight loss.
