Gastric endocrine carcinoma is a comparatively rare type of gastric cancer, accounting for 0.6% of all gastric cancers. Six cases of gastric endocrine carcinomas that were identified from November 2011 to March 2017 were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 73.3 years, and 1 patient had StageⅠA cancer, 1 had Stage ⅡB, 2 had Stage ⅢA, and 2 had Stage Ⅳ. Three patients had concomitant conventional adenocarcinoma. Four patients underwent total gastrectomy, 3 of whom showed liver metastases after surgery. The prognosis of gastric endocrine carcinoma is poor because it rapidly metastasizes to the liver and lymph nodes. When unresectable metastatic disease occurs, systemic therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapy can be introduced. Chemotherapy is performed in accordance with that for small cell lung cancer; however, the response rate of chemotherapy is very low, so further studies are needed to improve this treatment.
