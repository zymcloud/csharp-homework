Purpose:To compare the diagnostic performance of qualitative and quantitative 18F-FDG PET/CT in detection of regional and distant lymph node metastasis in patients with anal cancer.Methods:Between 2004 and 2017, 28 patients with anal cancer who had staging PET/CT and pathological assessment of suspicious lymph nodes were included. For qualitative analysis, positive lymph nodes were defined as uptake visually higher than the liver reference uptake. For quantitative study, lymph nodes were contoured to determine maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to extract the optimal cut-offs and area under the curve (AUC) of SUVmax, lesion to background (L/B) ratio, short axis diameter (SAD), and MTV of lymph nodes. Histopathologic analysis was a reference standard.Results:A total of 28 lymph nodes (24 inguinal, 2 external iliac, 1 internal iliac, and 1 paraaortic nodes) in 28 patients on PET/CT were included. With the qualitative visual analysis, 19 patients were categorized as positive for nodal metastasis with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 85%, 75%, and 82%. The optimal SUVmax and L/B ratio cut-offs were 2.6 and 1.0 with both sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 75% (AUC of SUVmax = 0.893, AUC of L/B ratio = 0.912). Using the best cut-off of 1.6 cm for SAD and 3.65 cm3 for MTV, both sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 100% (AUC of SAD = 0.950, AUC of MTV = 0.931).Conclusions:SUVmax optimization may be helpful in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT in nodal staging patients with anal cancer.
