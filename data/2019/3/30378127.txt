We present three cases of chronic hepatic porphyria (CHP) in alcoholic patients, in which grayscale ultrasound (US) revealed multiple echogenic masses in the liver, mimicking multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma on alcoholic liver injury. In all cases, contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) showed iso-enhancement of the mass lesions throughout all vascular phases. Additionally, two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2DSWE) (performed in two cases) revealed the mass to have almost the same SWE value as the surrounding parenchyma. When encountering alcoholic patients with multiple echogenic masses in the liver, CHP must be included in the differential diagnosis. CEUS and 2DSWE allow us to increase our diagnostic confidence of CHP.
