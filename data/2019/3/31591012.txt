Background:The encasement of the caudate lobe by a vascular ring of large vessels may apart from the technical difficulties in needle placement increase the probability of local recurrence after thermal ablation due to cooling effects. This single-center retrospective study evaluates the results after multiprobe stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the caudate lobe.Methods:Twenty patients underwent 24 multiple-probe SRFA sessions for the treatment of 24 HCCs in the caudate lobe. Eight of twenty patients had initially solitary tumors, the remaining 12 patients suffered from multifocal disease.Results:The median tumor size was 1.5 cm (range: 1-8 cm). After a mean follow-up of 21 months one local recurrence in the caudate lobe was observed resulting in a local recurrence rate of 4.2% (1/24). The overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years from the date of the first SRFA were 95%, 59%, and 44%, respectively, with a median overall survival of 51.3 months. The disease-free survival after SRFA was 48%, 24% and 24%, at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. One patient suffering from Child C liver cirrhosis died due to septic shock 26 days after SRFA and one postinterventional complication required minimal invasive interventional treatment.Conclusion:Multiprobe SRFA for HCC in the caudate lobe appears to be safe and feasible. The overall outcome is at least comparable to that of surgical resection, with low perioperative mortality and only minimal morbidity.
