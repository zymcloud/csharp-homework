As hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) usually occurs in the background of cirrhosis, which is an end-stage form of liver diseases, treatment options for advanced HCC are limited, due to poor liver function. The exosome is a nanometer-sized membrane vesicle structure that originates from the endosome. Exosome-mediated transfer of proteins, DNAs and various forms of RNA, such as microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA), contributes to the development of HCC. Exosomes mediate communication between both HCC and non-HCC cells involved in tumor-associated cells, and several molecules are implicated in exosome biogenesis. Exosomes may be potential diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage HCC. Exosomal proteins, miRNAs and lncRNAs could provide new biomarker information for HCC. Exosomes are also potential targets for the treatment of HCC. Notably, further efforts are required in this field. We reviewed recent literature and demonstrated how useful exosomes are for diagnosing patients with HCC, treating patients with HCC and predicting the prognosis of HCC patients.
