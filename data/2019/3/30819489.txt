Purpose:To determine if there is a correlation between intrahepatic tumor volume and future liver remnant (FLR) hypertrophy after portal vein embolization (PVE).Materials and methods:Forty-four consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic colorectal cancer who underwent PVE from 2009 to 2017 and who had complete imaging follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. To maximize the accuracy of tumor volume measurements, 11 patients were excluded for having more than 5 intrahepatic tumors. Volumetric analyses of the patient livers before and after PVE, as well as pre-embolization intrahepatic tumor burden, were performed.Results:A significant inverse correlation was observed between tumor volume and FLR hypertrophy after PVE (Spearman œÅ = -0.53, P = .002). Initial FLR volume was also inversely correlated with subsequent hypertrophy (P = .01). Fourteen patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 month prior to intervention. The number of chemotherapy cycles did not affect hypertrophy (P = .57). Patients with cirrhosis experienced less FLR hypertrophy than patients without cirrhosis (P = .02).Conclusions:Patients with large intrahepatic tumor burden may experience limited FLR hypertrophy.
