Purpose:This study aimed to compare radiofrequency (RF) ablation with cryoablation in patients with perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and evaluate the mid-term outcomes of both therapies.Materials and methods:Between January 2015 and April 2018, 111 patients who underwent percutaneous cryoablation (n = 61) or RF ablation (n = 50) for a single perivascular HCC were included. Perivascular HCC was defined as the presence of contacting peritumoral hepatic vessels that were 3 mm or larger in axial diameter. Local tumor progression (LTP) rates were compared by propensity score matching. Procedure-related complications were also assessed.Results:The median follow-up was 23 months (range 2-45 months). Twenty-five patients were matched in each group. The cumulative LTP rates at 1 and 3 years were 8.3% and 17.3% in the cryoablation group and 8.7% and 26.1% in the RF ablation group, with no significant difference (p = 0.379). Although there were no significant differences between the two groups, vascular thrombosis (16.0% vs. 9.8%, p = 0.493) and hepatic infarction (12.0% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.137) more frequently occurred in the RF ablation group than in the cryoablation group.Conclusion:In patients with perivascular HCC, cryoablation is an effective alternative treatment compared with RF ablation regarding local tumor control and complications.Level of evidence:Level 4 (retrospective case-control study).
