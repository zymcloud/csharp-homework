Background:To date few reports have pointed out the role of circulating miRNAs in discriminating metastatic liver tumors from primary hepatocellular (HCC) tumors. Such discrimination will have significant therapeutic and prognostic implications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential value of a panel of HCC-related circulating miRNAs (miR-142, miR-182, miR-200a, mir-210, miR-211, miR-302b, miR-324, miR-338, miR-340 and miR-1246) as noninvasive biomarkers for discriminating primary HCC from metastatic tumors in the liver.Methods:The expression level of the selected miRNAs was quantified by quantitative real time PCR in 33 patients with HCC, 22 patients with metastatic tumors in the liver, and 30 healthy volunteers as control. Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate the difference in miRNAs expression between primary and metastatic liver tumors and to study the associations between their relative expression levels and the clinicopathological factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the individual miRNAs.Results:Statistical analyses revealed a differential expression in the level of serum miR-210 and miR-1246 between the two groups of patients. The sensitivity and specificity of miR-210, for differentiating HCC from metastatic malignancies in the liver were found to be 73.7% and 64.28%, respectively. Whilst, of miR-1246 were 72.2% and 67.8%, respectively. In addition, the differential expression of the two miRNAs was also found to be associated with clinicopathological parameters in the two studied groups.Conclusions:Serum miR-210 and miR-1246 have some diagnostic value for discriminating patients with metastatic tumors to patients with primary HCC.
