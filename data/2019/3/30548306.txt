LncRNAs exhibit crucial roles in various pathological diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, it is significant to recognize the dysregulated lncRNAs in HCC progression. Recently, LINC01133 has been identified in several tumors. However, the biological role of LINC01133 in HCC remains poorly understood. Currently, we focused on the function of LINC01133 in HCC development. We observed that LINC01133 was significantly increased in HCC cells including HepG2, Hep3B, MHCC-97L, SK-Hep-1, and MHCC-97H cells compared with the normal human liver cell line HL-7702. In addition, PI3K/AKT signaling was highly activated in HCC cells. Knockdown of LINC01133 was able to inhibit HCC cell proliferation, cell colony formation, cell apoptosis, and blocked cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. For another, downregulation of LINC01133 repressed HCC cell migration and invasion. Subsequently, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was strongly suppressed by silence of LINC01133 in Hep3B and HepG2 cells. Then, in vivo tumor xenografts models were established using Hep3B cells to explore the function of LINC01133 in HCC progression. Consistently, our study indicated that knockdown of LINC01133 dramatically repressed HCC tumor progression through targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway in vivo. Taken these together, we revealed that LINC01133 contributed to HCC progression by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway.
