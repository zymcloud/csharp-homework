Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects approx. 3% of the world's population and accounts for ca 300 000 deaths per year. 80% of individuals with HCV develop chronic symptoms which, when untreated, may cause cirrhosis (27%) or hepatocellular carcinoma (25%). The hepatitis C virus is a (+)ssRNA enveloped virus of the family Flaviviridae. Seven major HCV genotypes and their subtypes (a, b) have been identified. In the 1990s, interferons alpha-2 were used in the treatment of HCV and in the next decade HCV therapy was based on pegylated interferon alpha-2 in combination with ribavirin. Since 2011, interferons alpha, DNA and RNA polymerase inhibitors, NS3/4A RNA protease inhibitors, NS5 RNA serine protease inhibitors, NS5B RNA polymerase inhibitors have been approved for clinical use. Monotherapy is avoided in medication due to rapidly developing viral resistance. A total of 113 papers were included comprising original publications and reviews. The paper reviews the molecular targets and chemical structures of drugs used in HCV treatment. Indications and contraindications for anti-HCV drugs are also discussed together with application regimens.
