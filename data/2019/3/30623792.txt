Obesity and overweight, the most serious health problems, are associated with chronic metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, current pharmacological therapies for obesity are challenged by potential side effects, low effectiveness, and low aqueous solubility, which limit their clinical application. Here, we develop nifedipine-loaded nanoparticles (NFD-NPs) that alleviate obesity-related metabolic dysfunction to be used as instruments for translational medicine. Nanoparticles (NPs) composed of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) not only enhance water solubility of hydrophobic nifedipine (NFD), a calcium channel blocker, without modifying the chemical structure of NFD for intravenous administration, but also allow prolonged release of NFD in vivo. NFD-NPs do not show cytotoxicity and reduce palmitate-induced protein inclusions and endoplasmic reticulum stress in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Importantly, tail-vein injection of NFD-NPs into diet-induced obese mice results in sustained retention of NFD-NPs in the liver and suppression of metabolic derangements associated with NAFLD by enhancing autophagic clearance through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation, consequently decreasing diet-induced insulin resistance and improving glucose tolerance. Our findings offer new clinical tools for NP-mediated pharmaceutical strategies to treat NAFLD and its related metabolic dysfunction.
