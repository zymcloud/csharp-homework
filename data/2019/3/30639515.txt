Background:Liver transplantation (LT) is the preferred treatment for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in select patients. Differences in outcomes after LT have been previously described between recipient races, but the role of donor race is not well defined. This study sought to examine the effect of donor-recipient race-matching on overall survival after liver transplantation for HCC in African-American patients (AA).Study design:Adult AA patients with HCC undergoing liver transplantation were identified using the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database (1994 to 2015). Recipient and donor demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. Patients were separated into unadjusted cohorts based on whether the liver donor was AA (matched) or another race (unmatched). The primary outcome was overall survival, which was analyzed by log-rank test and graphed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate regression modeling was used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival.Results:Of 1,384 AA patients identified, 325 (23.5%) were race-matched. Matched patients experienced significantly better median overall survival when compared with the unmatched cohort (135 vs 78 months, p = 0.007). Multivariate analysis revealed an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.66 for race-matched transplantation (95% CI 0.49 to 0.88; p = 0.004). Matched patients also experienced an improved 5-year survival (64.2% vs 56.9%; p = 0.019).Conclusions:African-American HCC patients undergoing liver transplantation experienced significantly improved overall survival when the donor race matched the recipient race. Donor-recipient race-matching remained an independent predictor of improved survival after adjusting for comorbidities and disease characteristics. Race-matching should be considered in the process of organ allocation because it may affect long-term survival in African-American HCC patients.
