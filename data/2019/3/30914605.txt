Sorafenib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in cases of unresectable advanced HCC that significantly improves progression-free and overall survival. Complete response(CR)is uncommon; however, if major or complete radiological response are obtained, the issue of the discontinuation of sorafenib remains unresolved. The present study reported a case of a 75-year-old man with non-hepatitis B and C virus-related cirrhosis and multiple recurrent HCCs followingresection. In December 2010, a CT scan revealed multiple intrahepatic recurrence after TACE. Laboratory testingshowed Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis and an alpha-fetoprotein level of over 20,000 ng/mL. Sorafenib(800mg/day)was started in December 2010. The subsequent dynamic CT performed at the 6th month of therapy showed a partial response accordingto RECIST criteria and a complete response accordingto mRECIST. The AFP had decreased to within normal levels. In May 2012, the sorafenib dose was reduced(200 mgtwice daily)due to side effects(skin reaction). In December 2013, treatment was stopped after confirmation of a CR associated with shrinkage of the HCC. The patient maintained this remission until June 2018, more than 54 months after the discontinuation of sorafenib therapy. The adverse events of sorafenib were reversible. Further reportingof similar cases should help in the design of treatment strategies after CR to sorafenib therapy.
