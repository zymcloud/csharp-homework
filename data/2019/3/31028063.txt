Objectives:Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is involved in the development of multiple types of cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of HDAC4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:49 patients with stage B HCC who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this study. All patients were followed up with an observation time of 4.8 to 7 years. Immunohistochemistry was applied to investigate the expression level of HDAC4.Results:HDAC4 protein is over-expressed in HCC tissues compared with matched adjacent non-cancer tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that the positive expression of HDAC4 is associated with poor survival in these patients.Conclusions:Our study shows that HDAC4 over-expression is important for the development of advanced HCC, which may serve as a useful prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for this malignancy.
