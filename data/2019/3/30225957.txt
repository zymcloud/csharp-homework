Background and aim:The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate tumor recurrence (intrasubsegmental recurrence-free survival and local tumor recurrence-free survival) and hepatic functional reserve following no-touch ablation.Methods:The prospective cohort study protocols were approved by the institutional ethics committee. All patients provided written, informed consent. Between January 2014 and September 2016, 231 patients with 277 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules were prospectively enrolled. An internally cooled bipolar electrode was used for no-touch ablation, while a monopolar electrode was used for direct puncture ablation. The intrasubsegmental recurrence-free survival rate was the primary end-point. The secondary outcomes were the local recurrence-free survival rate, the disease-free survival rate, and the changes in the Child-Pugh score.Results:No-touch ablation resulted in significantly higher cumulative intrasubsegmental tumor recurrence-free survival rates than direct puncture ablation (98.0% vs 87.1% at 1 year, 96.9% vs 76.8% at 2 years, and 91.0% vs 68.3% at 3 years, P Conclusions:No-touch ablation appears to be an ideal method for the prevention of intrahepatic dissemination.
