Background:The outcome of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) and advanced, compensated liver disease after sustained virological response (SVR) to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has not yet been completely depicted. We aimed to assess the clinical, biochemical and instrumental outcome of patients with advanced, compensated chronic HCV-related liver disease with DAA-induced SVR to DAAs and who had at least 1-year follow-up.Materials and methods:Fifty-two patients with cirrhosis (n = 27) and fibrosis stage F3 (n = 25) followed up for a median of 60 weeks after successful DAA treatment were included. Laboratory work-up, including APRI and FIB-4 scores, liver transient elastography and measurement of the spleen bi-polar diameter were carried out before treatment and at the end of follow-up.Results:Liver stiffness decreased (P 9 /L [117-176] to 153 Ã— 109 /L [139-186], P = 0.003), and spleen bi-polar diameter decreased (120 mm [112-123] to 110 mm [102-116], P = 0.0009) from baseline to the end of follow-up.Conclusions:In patients advanced, compensated chronic liver disease, liver stiffness significantly improves in the long-term after SVR, and this improvement is accompanied by an amelioration of indirect indices of liver fibrosis and function, and by a decrease in parameters of portal hypertension.
