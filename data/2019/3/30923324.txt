Liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1) plays a critical role in hepatic metabolism and disease. Here we show that LRH-1 protein stability is regulated by the cullin 4 (CUL4) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. We found that DNA damage-binding protein 2 (DDB2) directly interacts with LRH-1 and functions as a substrate recognition component of CUL4-DDB1 to promote LRH-1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, we observed that protein levels of endogenous LRH-1 are increased by insulin without a change in mRNA levels of LRH-1. However, overexpression of DDB2 impaired the insulin-stimulated increase in LRH-1 levels. In addition, DDB2 overexpression decreased LRH-1 transcriptional activation and expression of target genes, such as glucokinase, whereas knockdown of DDB2 increased the expression of glucokinase. Finally, we demonstrated that DDB2 knockdown increases glucose uptake and intracellular levels of glucose-6-phosphate in HepG2 cells. Our study reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of LRH-1 activity and suggests a role for DDB2 in hepatic glucose metabolism.
