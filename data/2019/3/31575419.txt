Introduction:Obesity is a risk factor for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Bariatric surgery can provide durable weight-loss, but little is known about the later development of NASH and HCC after surgery.Methods:Bariatric surgery (n = 3,410) and obese controls (n = 46,873) from an institutional data repository were propensity score matched 1:1 by demographics, comorbidities, BMI, and socioeconomic factors. Comparisons were made through paired univariate analysis and conditional logistic regression.Results:Total of 4,112 patients were well matched with no significant baseline differences except initial BMI (49.0 vs 48.2, p = 0.04). Bariatric group demonstrated fewer new-onset NASH (6 0.0% vs 10.3%, p Conclusions:Bariatric surgery is associated with reduced incidence of NASH and HCC in this large propensity matched cohort. This further supports the use of bariatric surgery for morbidly obese patients to ameliorate NASH cirrhosis and development of HCC.
