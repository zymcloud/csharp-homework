Background:Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a vital process in cancer progression and metastasis. Yanggan Jiedu Sanjie (YGJDSJ) is Traditional Chinese Medicine formulation for liver cancer treatment. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of YGJDSJ on TGF-β1-induced EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma Bel-7402 cells.Methods:Bel-7402 cells were treated with TGF-β1 and YGJDSJ. EMT was identified by morphological changes and expression of marker proteins. Cell morphology was observed under a microscope. Protein expression and phosphorylation was detected by western blotting. Cell migration was measured by the scratch assay. Cell adhesion and invasion was detected by a commercial kit.Results:YGJDSJ reversed TGF-β1-induced morphological changes, as well as the expression of the EMT markers E-cadherin and N-cadherin in Bel-7402 cells. YGJDSJ also inhibited TGF-β1 up-regulated Smad3 phosphorylation and Snail expression in Bel-7402 cells. Moreover, YGJDSJ inhibited TGF-β1-induced cell adhesion, migration and invasion in Bel-7402 cells.Conclusions:YGJDSJ inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT and mediated metastatic potential of Bel-7402 cells, which may be related to down-regulation of Smad3 phosphorylation and Snail expression. The present study provides a new basis for application of this herbal formula for prevention of liver cancer metastasis.
