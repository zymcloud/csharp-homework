We report the sharp reduction in the incidence of AIDS defining cancers in a multicentric, retrospective study carried out since 1991 and involving six Infectious Diseases Units spread across Italy. However, due to the parallel increase in non-AIDS defining cancers, cancer incidence was not reduced. Focusing on predictors of death in HIV-positive patients with neoplastic disease, multivariate models revealed that males as well as drug abusers were independently associated with a poor clinical outcome.
