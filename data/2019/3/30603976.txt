Purpose:To investigate clinical feasibility, technical success and toxicity of 166Ho-radioembolization (166Ho-RE) as new approach for treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and to assess postinterventional calculation of exact dosimetry through quantitative analysis of MR images.Materials and methods:From March 2017 to April 2018, nine patients suffering from HCC were treated with 166Ho-RE. To calculate mean doses on healthy liver/tumor tissue, MR was performed within the first day after treatment. For evaluation of hepatotoxicity and to rule out radioembolization-induced liver disease (REILD), the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and specific laboratory parameters were used 1-day pre- and posttreatment and after 60 days. After 6 months, MR/CT follow-up was performed.Results:In five patients the right liver lobe, in one patient the left liver lobe and in three patients both liver lobes were treated. Median administered activity was 3.7 GBq (range 1.7-5.9 GBq). Median dose on healthy liver tissue was 41 Gy (21-55 Gy) and on tumor tissue 112 Gy (61-172 Gy). Four patients suffered from mild postradioembolization syndrome. No significant differences in median MELD-Score were observed pre-, posttherapeutic and 60 days after 166Ho-RE. No deterioration of liver function and no indicators of REILD were observed. One patient showed a complete response, four a partial response, three a stable disease and one a progressive disease at the 6 months follow-up.Conclusion:166Ho-RE seems to be a feasible and safe treatment option with no significant hepatotoxicity for treatment of HCC.
