A 59-year-old man who was receiving lenvatinib as a third-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple bone metastases complained of general fatigue four months after starting lenvatinib. A blood examination showed unexpectedly elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Computed tomography (CT) revealed rupture of the gallbladder wall, indicating gallbladder perforation. After conservative treatment, the patient received lenvatinib again under informed consent; however, one month later, CT revealed repeated rupture of the gallbladder wall. Gallbladder perforation had again been induced by lenvatinib. For this reason, lenvatinib is strongly considered a causative drug for gallbladder perforation.
