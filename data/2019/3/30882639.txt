Rationale:Available literature states that the common reasons for non-traumatic spontaneous liver rupture are hepatocellular carcinoma, macronodular cirrhosis, hemangioma, and other tumors; gallbladder perforation is not cited as a cause.Patient concerns:The patient presented with sudden-onset right upper quadrant pain with tarry stool for 3 days after eating with dysphoria and increasing thirst; gradually, hemorrhagic shock developed. He had no history of trauma, no background of chronic hepatitis, and no cirrhosis.Diagnosis:Hemorrhage secondary to spontaneous rupture of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.Interventions:Left hemihepatectomy, cholecystectomy, and common bile duct exploration were performed.Outcomes:The patient was diagnosed with massive hemoperitoneum accompanying upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage following liver rupture secondary to gallbladder perforation. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization.Lessons:If patients present with non-traumatic spontaneous liver rapture accompanying cholelithiasis and gallbladder hematoma, gallbladder perforation should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Misdiagnosis can lead to incorrect treatment.
