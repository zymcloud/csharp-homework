This report describes a single-center experience with balloon-occluded transarterial chemoembolization for liver-directed therapy. A total of 26 patients (11 male, 4 female; mean age, 65 y Â± 7) with 28 tumors (mean diameter, 2.7 cm; range, 1.1-5.9 cm) were treated. Technical success rate was 100% (28 of 28 cases), with 1 minor complication of left portal vein thrombosis and small liver infarct. Of the 15 tumors analyzed for response, 60% (9 of 15) exhibited complete response, 33.3% (5 of 15) exhibited partial response, and 6.6% (1 of 15) had stable disease on follow-up. Eight patients exhibited overall progression with a new hepatic lesion and a median time to progression of 7.9 months (range, 5-11 mo).
