Background & aims:Chronic liver disease is a major health concern worldwide and the identification of novel modifiable risk factors may benefit subjects at risk. Few studies have analyzed periodontitis as a risk factor for liver complications. We studied whether periodontitis is associated with incident severe liver disease.Methods:The study comprised 6165 individuals without baseline liver disease who participated in the Finnish population-based Health 2000 Survey (BRIF8901) during 2000-2001, a nationally representative cohort. Follow-up was until 2013 for liver-related admissions, liver cancer and mortality from National Hospital Discharge, Finnish Cancer Registry and Causes of Death Register, Statistics Finland. Mild to moderate periodontitis was defined as ≥1 tooth with periodontal pocket ≥4 mm deep, and advanced periodontitis as ≥5 teeth with such pockets. Multiple confounders were considered.Results:A total of 79 subjects experienced a severe liver event during follow-up. When adjusted for age, sex and number of teeth, hazards ratios by Cox regression regarding incident severe liver disease were, for mild to moderate periodontitis, 2.12 (95% CI 0.98-4.58), and, for advanced periodontitis, 3.69 (95% CI 1.79-7.60). These risk estimates remained stable after additionally adjusting for alcohol use, smoking, metabolic risk, serum gamma-glutamyltransferase, dental-care habits, lifestyle and socioeconomic status. Periodontal disease-associated liver risk was accentuated among subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or heavy alcohol use at baseline.Conclusions:Periodontitis was associated with incident liver disease in the general population independently of various confounders. As a preventable disease, periodontal disease might present a modifiable risk factor for chronic liver disease.
