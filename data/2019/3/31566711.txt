Several studies have shown that low expression of epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) is closely associated with varying human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to explore the potential mechanism of EPHX1 silencing and revealed a novel regulatory pathway in the pathogenesis of HCC. In this study, micro ribonucleic acid (miR)-184 was predicted and validated to be a regulator of EPHX1 through experiments, and its expression was negatively correlated with the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of EPHX1 in primary tumors. Elevation of EPHX1 suppressed cell proliferation and migration as well as cell cycle progression, and induced apoptosis, while downregulation of miR-184 exhibited the opposite effect on cellular processes. Moreover, LINC00205 interacted with miR-184 and was markedly downregulated in tumors. The effects of the miR-184 inhibitor on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were reversed in part by the transfection with LINC00205 small interfering RNAs. In addition, LINC00205 acted as a molecular sponge to positively regulate the mRNA and protein levels of EPHX1 via regulating miR-184. The tumorigenicity of HCC cells was enhanced by LINC00205 shRNA but diminished by overexpression of EPHX1 in vivo. Clinically, the EPHX1 expression in patients with HCC was markedly downregulated. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that as a competing endogenous RNA, LINC00205 may regulate EPHX1 by inhibiting miR-184 in the progression of HCC and that targeting the LINC00205/miR-184/EPHX1 axis may provide a treatment protocol for patients.
