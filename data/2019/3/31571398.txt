Background & aims:Disease-related malnutrition is common in cirrhosis. Multiple studies have evaluated nutritional screening tools (NSTs, rapid bedside tests targeting who needs assessment) and nutritional assessment tools (NATs, used in diagnosing malnutrition) as predictors of clinical outcome in this population. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of this literature with the aim of summarising the varying definitions of malnutrition across studies, the available evidence for NSTs and the ability of NSTs and NATs to predict clinical outcomes in cirrhosis.Methods:The primary outcome measures were pre- and post-transplant mortality with a range of secondary outcomes. Inclusion: cirrhosis over age 16. Exclusion: >25% with hepatocellular carcinoma, primarily laboratory test-based NATs or lack of screening, assessment or outcome criteria.Results:Eight thousand eight hundred fifty patients were included across 47 studies. Only 3 studies assessed NSTs. Thirty-two definitions for malnutrition were utilised across studies. NATs predicted pre-transplant mortality in 69% of cases that were assessed with a risk ratio (RR) of 2.38 (95% CI 1.96-2.89). NATs were prognostic for post-transplant mortality only 28% of the times they were assessed, with a RR of 3.04 (95% CI 1.51-6.12).Conclusions:The cirrhosis literature includes limited data on nutrition screening and multiple definitions for what constitutes malnutrition using NATs. Despite this discordance, it is clear that malnutrition is a valuable predictor of pre-transplant mortality almost regardless of how it is defined. We require clinical and research consensus around the definition of malnutrition and the accepted processes and cut-points for nutrition screening and assessment in cirrhosis.
