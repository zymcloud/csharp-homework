Polysaccharides extracted from Morchella angusticepes Peck (PMEP) were chemically modified to obtain sulfated, carboxymethylated, and acetyled derivatives. Results showed that the acetyled derivatives with the degree of substitution (0.40 ± 0.07) exerted higher antioxidant ability than native polysaccharides, demonstrating inhibitory effects on growth of human hepatoma cells (EC50 = 0.710 ± 0.002 mg/mL) and human colon cancer cells (EC50 = 1.229 ± 0.008 mg/mL). It indicated that the acetylation was a favorable way to enhance the bioactivities of PMEP. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Polysaccharides extracted from Morchella angusticepes Peck (PMEP) have many health-promoting properties. Chemical modifications could improve the bioactivities of polysaccharides. We demonstrated that acetylation enhanced the cellular antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of PMEP. The results support further research that explores clinical utility, and may justify ex vivo and in vivo designs toward that end.
