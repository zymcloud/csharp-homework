The aim of this study was to explore the relationship of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) C1236T and C3435T single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathological features and prognosis. A total of 143 patients with HCC were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Moreover, 251 controls were included in the study. C1236T and C3435T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected by PCR-RFLP. Association of C1236T and C3435T SNPs with HCC was analyzed subsequently. There was no significant difference in genotypes distribution between HCC group and control group (P>0.05), indicating comparability. Among patients with portal vein tumor thrombus, the CC+CT genotype of C1236T locus was significantly higher than that of TT genotype (P=0.031). The median progression-free survival after interventional therapy for patients with C3435T genotype T (TC+TT) and C genotype (CC) was 36 and 18 months, respectively. CC and TC+TT genotype patients with C1236T loci showed statistically significant differences in tumor size stratification (Ï‡=4.006, P=0.045). When tumor diameter was less than 5 cm, 5-10 cm, and more than 10 cm, the mean survival time of C and T genotypes was decreased gradually. The logistic regression model suggested that lesion size, blood volume value, and permeability surface value were influential factors for response to chemoradiotherapy (all P
