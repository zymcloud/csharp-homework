Background:The benefit of performing major hepatic resection (MHR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis remains controversial because of its high risk of posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). This study was conducted to assess the risk of MHR for HCC in patients with cirrhosis.Methods:Patients with Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis and HCC who underwent MHR from January 2000 to June 2014 were retrospectively identified. Risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality using univariate and multivariate analyses were evaluated.Results:Seventy patients with Child-Pugh A (93%) and 5 (7%) with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis underwent MHR for HCC. Thirteen (17%) had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A, 39 (50%) had BCLC B, and 23 (32%) had BCLC C disease. A perioperative blood transfusion was performed in 18 patients (24%). Ninety-day postoperative mortality was 9% (n=7). Major complications occurred in 16 patients (21%), including PHLF in 9 patients (12%). A multivariate analysis showed that perioperative blood transfusion was the main independent factor associated with mortality (OR= 6.5) and major morbidity (OR=10).Conclusion:In selected patients with HCC and cirrhosis, MHR is feasible and has acceptable mortality, but careful perioperative management and limiting blood loss are required.
