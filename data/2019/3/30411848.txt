Background & aims:HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfected subjects are thought to have faster progression to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) than HBV mono-infected subjects. We assessed whether this remains in the current cART-era.Methods:Data from subjects with follow-up completion post-2003 were compared between HIV/HBV coinfected subjects in the Dutch HIV Monitoring database and HBV mono-infected subjects from two centres. The primary outcomes of composite ESLD included portal hypertension, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation and liver-related mortality. Outcomes were analysed using time-dependent cause-specific Cox regression models adjusted for follow-up time and relevant covariates. Subset-analyses were done in subjects with follow-up pre-2003.Results:In the 1336 co- vs 742 mono-infected subjects, coinfected subjects had no increased probability for ESLD compared to mono-infected subjects (cHR 0.7 (95% CI 0.4-1.1), but had increased probabilities for all-cause (cHR 7.4 [4.9-11.1]) and liver-related mortality (cHR 3.4 [1.6-7.5]). In the current combined cohort, treatment with tenofovir or entecavir was inversely associated with ESLD, all-cause and liver-related mortality (cHR 0.4 [95% CI 0.3-0.7], cHR 0.003 [0.001-0.01]), cHR 0.007 [0.001-0.05]). Other predictors for ESLD were older age, being of Sub-Sahara African descent, increased alanine aminotransferase levels and hepatitis C virus coinfection. While the probability for all-cause mortality was increased in coinfected subjects, this rate decreased compared to pre-2003 (HR 40.2 (95% CI: 8.7-186.2).Conclusions:HIV/HBV coinfected patients no longer seem to be at increased risk for progression to ESLD compared to HBV mono-infected patients, likely due to widespread use of highly effective cART with dual HBV and HIV activity.
