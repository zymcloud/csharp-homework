Background:Sorafenib is the first targeted agent proven to improve survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and it has been used in first line treatments with heterogeneous response across patients. Most of the promising agents evaluated in first-line or second-line phase III trials for HCC failed to improve patient survival. The absence of molecular characterisation, including the identification of pathways driving resistance might be responsible for these disappointing results.Methods:2D DIGE and MS analyses were used to reveal proteomic signatures resulting from Notch3 inhibition in HepG2 cells, combined with brivanib treatment. The therapeutic potential of Notch3 inhibition combined with brivanib treatment was also demonstrated in a rat model of HCC and in cell lines derived from different human cancers.Results:Using a proteomic approach, we have shown that Notch3 is strongly involved in brivanib resistance through a p53-dependent regulation of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA), both in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion:We have demonstrated that regulation of the TCA cycle is a common mechanism in different human cancers, suggesting that Notch3 inhibitors combined with brivanib treatment may represent a strong formulation for the treatment of HCC as well as Notch3-driven cancers.
