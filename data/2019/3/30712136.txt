Objective:To evaluate the ability of volumetric quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram parameters and LI-RADS categorization to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from other primary liver cancers [intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and combined HCC-ICC].Methods:Sixty-three consecutive patients (44 M/19F; mean age 62 years) with primary liver cancers and pre-treatment MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were included in this IRB-approved single-center retrospective study. Tumor type was categorized pathologically. Qualitative tumor features and LI-RADS categorization were assessed by 2 independent observers. Lesion volume of interest measurements (VOIs) were placed on ADC maps to extract first-order radiomics (histogram) features. ADC histogram metrics and qualitative findings were compared. Binary logistic regression and AUROC were used to assess performance for distinction of HCC from ICC and combined tumors.Results:Sixty-five lesions (HCC, n = 36; ICC, n = 17; and combined tumor, n = 12) were assessed. Only enhancement pattern (p Conclusion:The combination of quantitative ADC histogram parameters and LI-RADS categorization yielded the best prediction accuracy for distinction of HCC compared to ICC and combined HCC-ICC.
