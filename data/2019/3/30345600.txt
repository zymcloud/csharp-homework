Background and aim:Geographic differences have existed in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and efforts to reduce regional disparities have been initiated. The aim of this study is to use the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to determine if regional disparities in the treatment of HCC continue to exist.Method:A retrospective database analysis using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was performed that included patients with a primary diagnosis of HCC. Logistic regression models were utilized to determine geographic disparities in liver decompensation, treatment, inpatient mortality, and metastatic disease.Results:This study's locational reach of 62 604 patients included 22 769 patients from the South (36%), 14 554 in the Northeast (23%), 14 041 in the West (22%), and 11 240 in the Midwest (18%). Patients who received treatment in the West were more likely to have inpatient mortality (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03, 1.53) than patients who received treatment in the Midwest. No significant differences were observed between rates of resection, ablation, and transarterial chemoembolization when comparing by region. Rates of liver transplantation were lower in the West compared with the Midwest (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29, 0.87). There was no significant difference between other regions.Conclusion:Geographic disparities in the treatment of HCC are improving.
