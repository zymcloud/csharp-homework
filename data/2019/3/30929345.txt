This article makes a comparative analysis of the key recommendations in surveillance, diagnosis, staging and treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) from the newest updated guidelines issued by American Association for the Study Liver Disease, European Association for the Study of Liver, and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology, respectively. It is agreed that patients at high risk for developing HCC should undergo surveillance with ultrasound every six months. Detected hepatic nodules should be diagnosed and followed-up by further imaging examination or liver biopsy. The HCC staging system varies among different guidelines. The studies and clinical trials of system therapy in advanced HCC are becoming new highlights.
