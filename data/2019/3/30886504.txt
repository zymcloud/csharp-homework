Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors with high mortality-to-incidence ratios. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 3 (NFE2L3), also known as NRF3, is a member of the cap 'n' collar basic-region leucine zipper family of transcription factors. NFE2L3 is involved in the regulation of various biological processes, whereas its role in HCC has not been elucidated.Aim:To explore the expression and biological function of NFE2L3 in HCC.Methods:We analyzed the expression of NFE2L3 in HCC tissues and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference technology was utilized to knock down NFE2L3 in vitro. Cell apoptosis, clone formation, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays were used to identify the biological effects of NFE2L3 in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers was examined by Western blot analysis.Results:TCGA analysis showed that NFE2L3 expression was significantly positively correlated with tumor grade, T stage, and pathologic stage. The qPCR and Western blot results showed that both the mRNA and protein levels of NFE2L3 were significantly decreased after shRNA-mediated knockdown in BEL-7404 and SMMC-7721 cells. The shRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L3 could induce apoptosis and inhibit the clone formation and cell proliferation of SMMC-7721 and BEL-7404 cells. NFE2L3 knockdown also significantly suppressed the migration, invasion, and EMT of the two cell lines.Conclusion:Our study showed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of NFE2L3 exhibited tumor-suppressing effects in HCC cells.
