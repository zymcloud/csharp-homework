Importance:Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) has emerged as the most common indication for liver transplant in the United States, but data on the reasons for this increase and long-term post-liver transplant outcomes among liver transplant recipients are sparse.Objective:To characterize trends and long-term outcomes of liver transplant for ALD in the United States between 2002 and 2016.Design, setting, and participants:This multicenter, prospective, national cohort study used data from the United Network for Organ Sharing database to evaluate all liver transplants performed in the United States between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2016.Main outcomes and measures:National and regional trends in liver transplant for ALD, with a sensitivity analysis with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) included, and early (â‰¤90 days after liver transplant) and late (>90 days after liver transplant) patient and graft survival.Results:The cohort consisted of 32 913 patients, including 9438 with ALD and 23 475 without ALD (patients who had HCV infection and HCC indications were excluded). Median age of patients with ALD was 54 years (interquartile range, 47-60 years) and of patients without ALD was 54 years (interquartile range, 44-61 years). Patients with ALD (vs non-ALD) were more frequently male (7197 of 9438 [76.2%] vs 11 767 of 23 475 [50.1%]; P Conclusions and relevance:The findings suggest that early liver transplant for alcoholic hepatitis may be leading to broader acceptance of ALD for liver transplant. Late survival among liver transplant recipients with ALD was inferior to that among recipients with non-ALD indications, suggesting a need for future studies to identify patient profiles associated with best outcomes. Regional differences suggest heterogeneity in policies toward liver transplant for ALD.
