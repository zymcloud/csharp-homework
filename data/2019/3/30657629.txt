Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the inhibition of autophagy have been linked to cancer cell death. However, the involvement of serum nitric oxide (NO), the expression of NOS and autophagy have not been investigated in HCC. In the present study, we first established that the NO level was significantly higher in hepatitis B virus-related HCC than in the liver cirrhosis control (53.60 ± 19.74 vs 8.09 ± 4.17 μmol/L, t = 15.13, P
