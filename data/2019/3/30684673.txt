Studies have shown that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (the most important type of liver cancer) is the fifth most common cancer, and the third cause of mortality, globally. Although major progress has been made in the treatment and diagnosis of this disease, its eradication remains limited. Consequently, discovering new diagnosis and treatment methods is important. Cancer nanotechnology is an emerging field in medicine with the aim to accomplish advances in both cancer diagnosis and treatment. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs/ AuNPs) have attracted much attention, owing to their biocompatibility (bio-inertness, and low cytotoxicity), ability to chemically modify their surface by attaching multiple types of ligands, and their superior optical properties. This review will focus on the current applications of AuNPs in different aspects, such as imaging, drug and gene delivery, radiotherapy, and photothermal therapy of liver cancer treatment.
