Objective:Although computed tomography (CT) is frequently used to determine body composition, the effects of using different CT protocols is not well known. The aim of this study was to determine whether contrast media phase, radiation dose, and slice thickness in CT affect body composition segmentation.Methods:Clinically indicated perfusion CTs of the upper abdomen in 20 patients (seven women) between 40 and 87 y of age with high suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively. Axial images from the L3 level with varying imaging delay were reconstructed after contrast media injection (18 images per patient), slice thickness (5 images, 2-10 mm), and radiation dose (4 images with one-third to four-thirds of standard dose). Muscle and fat areas were segmented semiautomatically by drawing regions of interests and using established cutoff thresholds. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), steatotic muscle area, and adipose tissue index, as well as muscle attenuation and fat attenuation, were evaluated.Results:Average SMI increased by up to 2.8% after contrast media injection. Steatotic muscle area decreased by ≤13.8%, and adipose tissue index decreased by ≤6.5%. Muscle attenuation increased after contrast media injection, whereas fat attenuation decreased (all P Conclusions:Contrast media have a strong effect on the evaluation of body composition, whereas the influence of slice thickness is less pronounced. Radiation dose can be reduced by ≥66% without significantly affecting segmentation.
