Transient increases in α-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K antagonist II (PIVKA-II), so-called flares, are frequently observed after treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, changes in AFP and PIVKA-II levels after proton therapy (PT), and the relationship between the flare phenomenon and clinical response were investigated. In 82 patients with stage I/II HCC (59 with no recurrence and 23 with out-of-field recurrence within 1 year), serum AFP and PIVKA-II levels were measured at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-PT. AFP and PIVKA-II flares were defined as a >20% increase from the preceding serum level above 20 ng/ml (AFP) or 40 mAU/ml (PIVKA-II), followed by a >20% drop. Among the 59 patients with no recurrence, 3 (5.1%) had an AFP flare, while 23 (39%) had a PIVKA-II flare. The median time to AFP and PIVKA-II flare peaks was 1 and 6 months, respectively. In 4 patients, PIVKA-II flares were observed twice during follow-up. In 1 patient, AFP and PIVKA-II flares were observed simultaneously at 1 month post-PT. The PIVKA-II level pre-PT was significantly higher in the PIVKA-II flare-positive group compared with that in the flare-negative group (P=0.015, odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-14.0). In the 23 patients with out-of-field recurrence, the median increase rate of PIVKA-II (203%) was higher than that in the PIVKA-II-flare-positive group (111%, P=0.035) and the time to recurrence (median, 9 months) was longer than the time to peak AFP level (1 month) in the AFP-flare-positive group (P=0.033). There was no significant association between flares and clinical response. Increases in AFP and PIVKA-II levels following PT should be assessed with caution to avoid misinterpretation of therapeutic outcome.
