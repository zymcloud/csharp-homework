BACKGROUND Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in cancer development and therapeutic resistance. However, the role of small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS In situ hybridization (ISH) staining was performed to detect the expression level of SNHG16 in HCC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the level of SNHG16 in HCC samples, adjacent non-cancerous tissues and HCC cell lines. Transwell assay was performed to investigate the migration and invasion ability of HCC cells. Cell viability assays were performed to determine the ability of proliferation and sorafenib resistance of HCC cells. RESULTS We found that SNHG16 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines and that it was negatively correlated with survival time in HCC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that SNHG16 was a significant and independent predictor for the overall survival of HCC patients. Furthermore, downregulation of SNHG16 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, and sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. CONCLUSIONS Our findings revealed that lncRNA SNHG16 could be used as an oncogene to predict the outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma.
