This study consists of a retrospective study including 71 childhood leukemia survivors (36 females) treated with allo-HSCT 12 Gy fractionated total body irradiation (fTBI) conditioning, with a median age of 25.0 y at time of follow-up and a median delay of 14.8 y since the graft. The recovery ratio was 90%. The number of severe late-effects was specified for each patient: 21 with growth deficiency (final height <162.5 cm for 12/35 men and <152.0 cm for 9/36 women - Growth deficiency was correlated to young age at the time of the allograft); 5 with sclerodermic chronic graft vs. host disease; 9 with osteonecrosis; risk of impaired fertility for 25 women and 28 men (only 2 women had a child); 8 with diabetes; 5 with pulmonary late-effects including 1 death; 5 with chronic renal insufficiency including 1 death; 2 with cardiac late-effects; 2 with arterial high blood pressure; 11 (8 women) declared 14 subsequent cancers (7 with thyroid carcinomas, 3 with multiple squamous cell carcinomas, 2 with epidermoÃ¯dis carcinomas of the tongue or the lip, 1 with bone sarcoma, and 1 with carcinoma of the breast); 6 with chelating treatments of hemochromatosis; 14 with important educational underachievement; 11 with depression at adult age; 1 with hepatitis B virus infection; 4 with other severe late-effects, including 2 with blindness. The average number of severe late-effects was 2.3 with a positive correlation according to delay from fTBI (p < 0.0002). Two-thirds had at least 2 late-effects. These results emphasize the urgent abandonment of conditioning by TBI in children.
