Background:Previously, we aimed to predict the effect of bevacizumab in liver metastasis using the ratio of the computed tomography (CT) value for hepatic metastatic lesions in the arterial phase in contrast-enhanced (CE) CT to that on plain CT. However, there is no report on the relation between the CT contrast effect and microvessel density (MVD) in liver metastasis.Patients and methods:Thirty-two patients who underwent liver resection for metastasis from colorectal cancer (excluding neoadjuvant chemotherapy cases) between April 2006 and October 2011 at our Department were analyzed retrospectively. The relation between the CE ratios obtained from the whole tumor or tumor margin and the MVD using the liver metastatic lesion of colorectal cancer were analyzed. It was also examined whether the CE ratios and MVD were related to the clinicopathological factors of the primary tumor.Results:There was a significant correlation between the CE ratios obtained from assessment using the entire tumor and the tumor margin as regions of interest (ROI). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the MVD and CE ratios. Cases with lymphatic invasion, N2, N3 nodal status and grade B and C were significantly more often observed in the group with high MVD. In contrast, in the group with high CE using the whole tumor as ROI, cases with grade B or C were significantly fewer. However, the number of hepatic metastasis was significantly higher and the diameter was significantly larger in the group with high CE using the tumor margin as ROI. Moreover, cases with grade B or C were recognized significantly more often.Conclusion:The CE ratio correlated with the MVD. The CE ratio using the tumor margin was similar to the MVD in relation to the clinicopathological factors. Taken together, these findings suggest that the CE ratio using the tumor margin as ROI may reflect MVD.
