Gastric cancer (GC) is among the most frequently occurring malignancies worldwide. In recent years, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied because of their ability to regulate the cellular processes involved with tumorigenesis. The present study aims to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism by which lncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) influences the progression of GC. Differentially expressed lncRNA UCA1 was initially identified by microarray-based analysis, after which a high expression of UCA1 was determined in GC tissues and cells. It is important to note that UCA1 could upregulate the expression of phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) by sponging miR-495. The expression of UCA1 and miR-495 was altered in human GC cells to evaluate cell activity in vitro, as well as peritoneal metastasis and tumor formation ability in vivo. Results suggested that increased expression of UCA1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, accompanied by suppressed cell apoptosis, as well as enhanced peritoneal metastasis and tumorigenesis of GC cells. Meanwhile, the upregulated expression of miR-495 could reverse the promotive effects exerted by UCA1. Taken conjointly, UCA1, as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-495, could accelerate the development of GC by upregulating PRL-3, highlighting a potentially promising basis for the targeted intervention treatment of GC.
