Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Phospholipids are now well-recognised players in tumour progression. Their metabolic tissue alterations can be associated with plasmatic modifications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the plasma phospholipid profile as a risk and prognostic biomarker in HCC.Methods:Ninety cirrhotic patients with (cases) or without HCC (controls) were studied after matching for inclusion centre, age, gender, virus infection, cirrhosis duration and Child-Pugh grade. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem-mass spectrometry was used to quantify the main species of seven categories of phospholipids in plasma.Results:Elevated concentrations of phosphatidylcholine (PC) 16:0/16:1 (p=0.0180), PC 16:0/16:0 (p=0.0327), PC 16:0/18:1 (p=0.0264) and sphingomyelin (SM) 18:2/24:1 (p=0.0379) and low concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholine 20:4 (0.0093) and plasmalogen-phosphatidylethanolamine (pPE) 16:0/20:4 (p=0.0463), pPE 18:0/20:4 (p=0.0077), pPE 18:0/20:5 (p=0.0163), pPE 18:0/20:3 (p=0.0463) discriminated HCC patients from cirrhotic controls. Two ceramide species were associated with increased HCC risk of death while lysophospholipids, a polyunsaturated phosphatidylinositol, some PC and SM species were associated with low risk of death in HCC patients in 1 and/or 3 years.Conclusion:This study identified phospholipid profiles related to HCC risk in liver cirrhotic patients and showed for the first time the potential of some phospholipids in predicting HCC patient mortality.
