Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal diseases worldwide. Ginkgo Biloba Leaves polyprenol (GBP) is considered potential efficacy in the treatment of HCC. This study involved oil-in-water type nanoemulsion (NE) loading GBP and Fullerene C60 (C60F) were prepared by dissolving GBP and C60F in NE using inversed phase emulsification (EIP) with ultrasonic-assisted emulsification (UAE) method. Folic acid (FA) coupled Chitosan (CS) and Graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites (NCs): FA-CS-GO-NCs were fabricated by ionic cross-linking of positively charged FA-CS-GO solution conjugates and negative charged NE with TPP. We combined these materials for preparing NCs loading GBP and C60F (GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs) based GBP-C60F-NE. GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs in the NE were the mean size was 44.9 nm, PdI was 0.267 and the mean zeta potential was 47.8 mV. And they had good drug loading efficiency, encapsulation efficiency, drug release property and storage stability. In this cytotoxic study, it demonstrated the GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs were greater inhibition capacity on MHCC97H cells compared with GBP-NE, C60F-NE, GBP-C60F-NE, GBP-FA-CS-GO-NCs and C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs. In this genotoxic study, GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs at low C60F concentration showed low genotoxicity on MHCC97H and L02 cells. By comparison, GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs had higher cytotoxicity on MHCC97H than L02 cells. By the cell apoptosis analysis, the results revealed that GBP-C60F-NE and GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs could obviously induce MHCC97H cell apoptosis, especially high concentration GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs had the strongest apoptosis inducing ability. The treatment against MHCC97H cells with moderate C60F concentrations of GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs effectively inhibited the overexpressions of Akt1 and Akt2, and significantly increased the expression of PTEN. Our results suggest that PTEN, Akt1 and Akt2 might play an important role in the aspect of GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs inhibiting against HCC cells. It provides further evidence to speculation that up-regulated PTEN expression and down-regulated Akt1 and Akt2 expression might be one of the important mechanisms for GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs inhibiting HCC cells. All these results suggest that GBP-C60F-FA-CS-GO-NCs effectively inhibited the HCC malignant development and has potentially important value in the HCC treatment.
