High alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) > 1,000 ng/mL is associated with poor outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A new national policy has been implemented for AFP > 1,000 ng/mL requiring a decrease to 1,000 ng/mL to different AFP thresholds before LT on survival and HCC recurrence after LT using the United Network for Organ Sharing database. We identified 407 patients who underwent transplant between January 2005 and September 2015 and who had AFP > 1,000 ng/mL at least once before LT. The last AFP measurement before LT was > 1,000 ng/mL in 72.0%, decreased from > 1,000 to 101-499 ng/mL in 9.6%, and decreased to ≤ 100 ng/mL in 14.3%. Local-regional therapy was not performed in 45.4% of patients with AFP > 1,000 ng/mL at LT versus 12.8% of those with AFP of 101-499 ng/mL and 10.3% of those with AFP ≤ 100 ng/mL at LT (P 1,000 ng/mL at LT was 48.8% versus 67.0% for those with a decrease in AFP to 101-499 ng/mL (P 1,000 ng/mL versus 13.3% for patients with AFP of 101-499 ng/mL and 7.2% for patients with AFP ≤ 100 ng/mL at LT (P 2-fold reduction in posttransplant mortality (P = 0.01) and a nearly 3-fold reduction in HCC recurrence (P = 0.02) compared with AFP > 1,000 ng/mL at LT. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated significantly improved post-LT outcomes when restricting LT to patients with a reduction in AFP from > 1,000 to
