Background & aims:There is a paucity of accurate and current data on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) trends in incidence and survival in developed countries. We performed an Australia-wide assessment of HCC epidemiology across a 33-year time span aiming to accurately describe changes in incidence and survival.Methods:Cases of HCC from 1982 to 2014 were identified via the Australian Cancer Database (ACD). Trends in incidence rates were explored using piecewise linear regression. Survival was compared by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and 1-, 3- and 5-year survival probabilities by year of diagnosis.Results:Age-adjusted HCC incidence rate increased from 1.38 per 100 000 (95% CI: 1.34-1.43) in 1982 to 4.96 per 100 000 (95% CI: 4.89-5.03, P Conclusions:An Australia-wide analysis of HCC epidemiological trends across three decades shows significant and consistent increases in both incidence and survival.Lay summary:There has been a significant increase in hepatocellular cancer (HCC) reported in Australia over the last three decades without evidence of slowing. Across the same time period, a significant improvement in survival has been identified with the average life expectancy after diagnosis now one year. This research lays the foundation for important public health service delivery.
