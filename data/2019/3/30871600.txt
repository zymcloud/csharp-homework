Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 59 (HCA59), which is one of the most important excretory/secretory products of Haemonchus contortus (HcESPs), is known to have antigenic functions. However, its immunomodulatory effects on host cells are poorly understood.Methods:Here, we cloned the HCA59 gene and expressed the recombinant protein of HCA59 (rHCA59). Binding activities of rHCA59 to goat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and dendritic cells (DCs) were checked by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and the immunoregulatory effects of rHCA59 on cytokine secretions, cell migration, cell proliferation, nitric oxide production, and changes in expression of genes in related pathways were observed by co-incubation of rHCA59 with goat PBMCs and DCs. Monocyte phagocytosis and characterization of goat blood DC subsets were detected by flow cytometry.Results:The IFA results revealed that rHCA59 could bind to PBMCs and DCs. Treatment of PBMCs with rHCA59 significantly increased cellular proliferation and NO production in a dose-dependent manner, while cell migration was vigorously blocked. Treatment with rHCA59 significantly suppressed monocytes phagocytosis. The quantity of surface marker CD80 on DCs increased significantly after rHCA59 treatment. In addition, the expression of genes included in the WNT pathway was related to the differentiation and maturation of DCs, and the production of IL-10 and IL-17 produced by PBMCs was altered.Conclusions:Our findings illustrated that rHCA59 could enhance host immune responses by regulating the functions of goat PBMCs and DCs, which would benefit our understanding of HCA59 from parasitic nematodes contributing to the mechanism of parasitic immune evasion.
