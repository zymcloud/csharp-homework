Transarterial embolization of bone tumors is effective in both decreasing intraoperative hemorrhage and alleviating symptoms. Transradial access has been associated with a lower risk of access site complications when compared to transfemoral access. Three cases of transarterial embolization of bony metastases in the upper extremity and shoulder girdle were performed with an ipsilateral transradial access. In each case, significant decrease in tumor blush was noted after embolization, and no auxiliary access site was needed. Positive outcomes were observed in all three patients, including successful subsequent surgery without significant hemorrhage and notable post-procedural pain reduction.
