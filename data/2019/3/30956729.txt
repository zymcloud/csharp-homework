Background:Circular RNAs have been implicated in various malignancies and can function as potential biomarkers for cancers. Reportedly, circSMARCA5 was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme, but upregulated in prostate cancer. The functional roles and clinical significance of circSMARCA5 still remain unknown in the context of gastric cancer (GC).Methods:Expression levels of circSMARCA5 were detected by qRT-PCR. Clinical data including patient basic information, clinicopathological features, and survival data were obtained. The Kaplan-Meier methods, multivariate Cox regression models, and the receiver operating characteristic curve were used to assess the clinical significance of circSMARCA5 in GC. Cell proliferation assays and transwell assays were performed to elucidate the functional roles of circSMARCA5 in GC.Results:The circSMARCA5 level was decreased in GC tissues and cell lines. The low expression level of circSMARCA5 was correlated to poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. Low circSMARCA5 expression was revealed as an independent unfavorable predictive factor for GC. The results indicated that circSMARCA5 had a moderate ability for discrimination between GC patients and controls with an area under the curve of 0.806. Upregulation of circSMARCA5 dampened the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells, whereas circSMARCA5 knockdown promoted GC progression.Discussion:Our results demonstrated that circSMARCA5 was decreased and exerted tumor-suppressive effects in GC. circSMARCA5 can function as a potential biomarker for GC prognosis and diagnosis.
