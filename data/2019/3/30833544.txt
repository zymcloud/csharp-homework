Accumulating evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies has highlighted the close correlation between the individual risk of cancer and nervous system diseases. The expression of neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2) is absent in Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, and depression. Herein, we found that NPTX2 mRNA and protein expression was significantly upregulated in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). NPTX2 expression level gradually increased with CRC progression and was closely associated with poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that NPTX2 promoted CRC proliferation and metastasis through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. As NPTX2 receptors are absent on CRC cells, NPTX2 was shown to physically interact with frizzled class receptor 6 (FZD6) to promote β-catenin translocation into the cell nucleus, resulting in an increase in the expression of MYC, cyclin D1, snail, and N-cadherin along with a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin. Knockdown of FZD6 expression with a small-interfering RNA almost completely reversed the proliferative effects of NPTX2 on CRC development. In conclusion, NPTX2, a molecule related to nervous system diseases, promotes CRC cell proliferation and metastasis through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway via direct interaction with FZD6.
