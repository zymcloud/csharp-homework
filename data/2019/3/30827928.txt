Background:Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a newly discovered family of immune cells that have similar cytokine-secreting profiles as T helper cell subsets. Although ILCs are critical for host defense against infections and tissue homeostasis, their roles in tumor development are not well established.Methods:We studied the function of ILC3 cells in the liver for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in murine HCC models using flow cytometry, adoptive transfer, and in vitro functional assays.Findings:We found that ILC3 lacking the natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor (NCR-ILC3) promoted the development of HCC in response to interleukin 23 (IL-23). IL-23 serum level is elevated in HCC patients and its high expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We found that IL-23 could promote tumor development in murine HCC tumor models. IL-23 promoted the expansion of NCR-ILC3 and its differentiation from group 1 ILCs (ILC1s). Furthermore, NCR-ILC3 initiated IL-17 production upon IL-23 stimulation and directly inhibited CD8+ T cell immunity by promoting lymphocyte apoptosis and limiting their proliferation.Interpretation:Together, our findings suggest that NCR-ILC3 initiates the IL-17-rich immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and promotes the development of HCC, thus may serve as a promising target for future cancer immunotherapy.
