Gut microbiota plays important roles in many diseases, including cancer. It may promote carcinogenesis by inducing oxidative stress, genotoxicity, host immune response disturbance, and chronic inflammation. Colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer are the major gastrointestinal tract cancers in Taiwan. The microbiota detected in patients with tubular adenoma and villous/tubulovillous polyps is different from that in healthy controls and patients with hyperplastic polyps. Normalization of the microbiota is observed in patients after colorectal cancer treatment. Furthermore, the liver is exposed to microbiota-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), bacterial metabolites, and toxins, as it is anatomically connected to the gut via the portal vein. Patients with cirrhosis have significantly higher plasma endotoxin levels than healthy controls. Helicobacter pylori is a well-established risk factor for gastric cancer. Some nitrosating bacteria convert nitrogen compounds in gastric fluid to potentially carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds, which also contribute to gastric cancer development. Growing evidence demonstrates that gut microbiota promotes carcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms and types of microbiota changes involved in these gastrointestinal cancers and the future treatment choices.
