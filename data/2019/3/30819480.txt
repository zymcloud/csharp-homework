Purpose:To compare different imaging techniques (volume perfusion CT, cone-beam CT, and dynamic gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging with golden-angle radial sparse parallel MR imaging) in evaluation of transarterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using radiopaque drug-eluting embolics (DEE).Materials and methods:MR imaging and CT phantom investigation of radiopaque DEE was performed. In the clinical portion of the study, 13 patients (22 HCCs) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent cross-sectional imaging before and after transarterial chemoembolization using 100-300 Î¼m radiopaque DEE. Qualitative assessment of images using a Likert scale was performed.Results:In the phantom study, CT-related beam-hardening artifacts were markedly visible at a concentration of 12% (v/v) radiopaque DEE; MR imaging demonstrated no significant detectable signal intensity changes. Imaging obtained before transarterial chemoembolization showed no significant difference regarding tumor depiction. Visualization of tumor feeding arteries was significantly improved with volume perfusion CT (P Conclusions:Using radiopaque DEE, the imaging modalities provided comparable early treatment assessment. In HCCs with dense accumulation of radiopaque DEE, treatment assessment using volume perfusion CT or cone-beam CT may be impaired owing to resulting beam-hardening artifacts and contrast stasis. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging may add value in detection of residual arterial tumor enhancement.
