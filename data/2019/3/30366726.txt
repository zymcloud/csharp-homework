Background and purpose:To evaluate the safety of carbon-ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) using 60 Gy (relative biological effectiveness, RBE) in four fractions for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:The primary outcome was acute toxicities within 90 days. The secondary outcomes were late toxicities, local control, and progression-free survival and overall survival rates. The key inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 3 cm or larger HCC without major vascular invasion and not adjacent to the alimentary tract; (2) Child-Pugh's grade A/B; and (3) without extrahepatic metastasis.Results:A total of 21 cases were analyzed between October 2012 and April 2016. The median follow-up period among the 17 survivors was 24.2 (range: 6.3-43.7) months. Grade 3 or higher acute toxicity was not observed, while three (14.3%) of the 21 patients experienced grade 3 late toxicities. The 1- and 2-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rates were 100% and 92.3%, 81.0% and 50.0%, and 90.5% and 80.0%, respectively.Conclusion:C-ion RT using 60 Gy (RBE) in four fractions was safe and achieved promising local tumor control.
