A bulky, solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with nonmajor branch portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) was staged as T2 in the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. We aimed to evaluate the prognosis of this group of patients.A total of 2643 patients with HCC in a medical center were consecutively enrolled. The stage of HCC was determined according to the 7th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Patients who were diagnosed as having solitary HCC larger than 5 cm with nonmajor portal vein thrombosis (VP1-VP2) and no lymphadenopathy or metastasis were included.Bulky HCC with nonmajor branch PVTT and without metastasis and lymphadenopathy was identified in 0.15% (4 out of 2643 patients) of the patients with HCC. Child-Pugh scores of the patients were A to B. Tumor sizes all were larger than 5 cm (mean: 6.8 Â± 1.0 cm). All patients had nonmajor branch of PVTT. Three patients initially received trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy, and 1 patient refused treatment because of old age. The response to TACE was poor: 2 patients rapidly progressed to main portal vein thrombosis, and their tumors enlarged within a half year. Only 1 patient's disease remained stable but progressed gradually 2 years later. The median survival time was 16.5 months. The 1- year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rate was 100%, 50%, and 0%, respectively.Solitary HCC > 5 cm with PVTT of a nonmajor branch gave dismal prognoses and required aggressive treatment such as hepatic resection or combination therapy. In our opinion, it should be staged as T3 rather than a T2 in the TNM staging system.
