Objectives:We aimed to investigate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) could be useful for early evaluation of the treatment response to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This study retrospectively selected HCCs in which homogeneous retention of iodized oil was confirmed on non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed immediately after TACE. Therapeutic responses of HCCs were evaluated by CEUS 1 to 2 days after TACE and by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) approximately 4 weeks after TACE. We investigated the noninferiority of CEUS 1 to 2 days after TACE to CECT approximately 4 weeks after TACE in terms of the diagnostic accuracy of the therapeutic response to TACE on HCC.Results:Eighty-nine HCCs were enrolled in this study between April 2014 and June 2016. A complete response was observed in 57 of 89 nodules (64.0%), and an incomplete response was observed in the remaining 32 nodules (36.0%). The accuracy rates for CEUS 1 to 2 days after TACE and CECT approximately 4 weeks after TACE in the therapeutic effect of TACE on HCCs were 83.1% (95% confidence interval, 73.7%-90.2%) and 83.1% (95% confidence interval, 73.7%-90.2%), respectively. The difference in diagnostic accuracy between methods was 0%, which was below the predetermined noninferiority limit of 15%, and CEUS 1 to 2 days after TACE was noninferior to CECT approximately 4 weeks after TACE.Conclusions:Our results suggest that CEUS is a useful modality for early therapeutic evaluation of TACE for HCC, and we can thus plan the next treatment strategies for HCC within a few days after TACE.
