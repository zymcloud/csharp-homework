"Difficult vascular anatomy" is a challenge for Interventional Radiologists especially in liver directed therapies such as trans arterial radio embolization. Trans arterial radio embolization is a long and difficult procedure in which the basic knowledge of hepatic and gastro-enteric vascularization, with its high degree of variations, is very important in order to correctly administer the therapeutic drug selectively. In this report, we present a case of an atypical patient affected by an unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, candidate for Radio-embolization treatment. His vascular anatomy was very difficult to manage, but the Interventional Radiologist was not only able to go over the "difficult anatomy," but also to take advantage of it.
