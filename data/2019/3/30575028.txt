Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a recurrence rate of up to 70% in 5 years after resection, detrimentally lowering survival. The role of adjuvant therapy remains controversial; therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the disease-free and overall survival of patients with HCC, not candidates for transplantation, undergoing resection and adjuvant hepatic artery infusion therapy vs resection alone. Our meta-analysis showed that adjuvant HAIC improves overall and disease-free survival after resection, especially in tumors â‰¥7 cm.
