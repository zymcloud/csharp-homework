Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT confirmed somatostatin receptor (SR) expression in hypervascularized liver lesions suggestive of neuroendocrine tumor that was later diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Being highly vascularized on CT, HCC lesions may mimic neuroendocrine tumors. Although HCC is not included among current indications for SR-PET/CT imaging, it may represent a pitfall in image interpretation when studying neuroendocrine tumor patients. Further studies are needed to better ascertain the potential diagnostic role of SR-imaging in HCC.
