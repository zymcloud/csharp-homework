RNA activation (RNAa) allows specific gene upregulation mediated by a small activating RNA (saRNA). Harnessing this process would help in developing novel therapeutics for undruggable diseases. Since its discovery in mid 2000s, improvements of saRNA design, synthetic chemistry and understanding of the biology have matured the way to apply RNAa. Indeed, MiNA therapeutics Ltd has conducted the first RNAa clinical trial for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients with promising outcomes. However, to fully realize the RNAa potential better saRNA delivery strategies are needed to target other diseases. Currently, saRNA can be delivered in vivo by lipid nanoparticles, dendrimers, lipid and polymer hybrids and aptamers. Further developing these delivery technologies and novel application of RNAa will prove to be invaluable for new treatment development.
