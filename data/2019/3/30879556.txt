Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis is a widely accepted indication for liver transplantation (LT). Many scoring systems have been proposed intending to an extension of the established Milan criteria. Bridging treatments are systematically applied in order to maintain or to downstage such patients to the listing criteria. The objective of our study was to estimate the feasibility of the prediction of microvascular tumor invasion in transplant candidates.Patients and methods:Data corresponding to transplanted HCC patients were reviewed for the purposes of this study. All tumor slices were blindly re-evaluated by a single pathologist in order to score for tumor necrosis and microvascular invasion. Recipients of pediatric or split LT were excluded.Results:Eighty patients (30 women and 50 men) were included in the study. Tumor necrosis was absent in 29 of 80 liver explants (36.25%). In the majority of instances (63.75%) tumor necrosis was evident in proportions between 5% and 100%. In 58 liver explants showing 0%-60% tumor necrosis and 22 liver explants showing > 60% tumor necrosis, microvascular tumor invasion was detectable in 11 and 0 cases, respectively (P = .0385).Conclusion:In about one-fourth of the cases (27.5%) microvascular tumor invasion could not be detected due to extended areas of tumor necrosis. Preoperative detection of microvascular invasion is misleading.
