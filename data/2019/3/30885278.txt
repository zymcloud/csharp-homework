Background:The technique for arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) is not standardized which limits its widely application. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term functionality and complications of port-catheter system using percutaneous unilateral trans-femoral implantation with coil only fixed-catheter-tip method.Methods:From January 2013 to January 2017, 205 consecutive patients (138 men; aged 28-88 years; mean, 59.1 ± 11.2 years) with unresectable malignant liver tumors underwent percutaneous implantation of side-hole infusion port-catheter into hepatic artery using coil only fixed-catheter-tip method via the unilateral femoral artery. Technical success, procedure time, duration of port functionality, and complications of port dysfunction were investigated.Results:Implantation technical success was 98.5% and the procedure time was 59.1 ± 10.2 min. Predictable functionality of the port-catheter system at 6-, 12-, and 24 months were 97.5, 89.9, 70.5%, respectively. Complications of port irreversible dysfunction were hepatic artery obstruction (4.0%), catheter occlusion (3.5%), and catheter dislocation (0.5%). Median 5 HAIC cycles (range: 1-14 cycles) were received via port.Conclusion:Percutaneous unilateral trans-femoral implantation of a side-hole port-catheter with coils only fixed-catheter-tip method is a simple and feasible interventional technique for HAIC which offers long-term functionality.
