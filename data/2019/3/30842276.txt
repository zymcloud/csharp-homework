Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) is a multifunctional cytokine displaying broad-spectrum anticancer activity in vitro or in vivo in preclinical animal cancer models and in a phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced cancers. mda-7/IL-24 targets specific miRNAs, including miR-221 and miR-320, for down-regulation in a cancer-selective manner. We demonstrate that mda-7/IL-24, administered through a replication incompetent type 5 adenovirus (Ad.mda-7) or with His-MDA-7/IL-24 protein, down-regulates DICER, a critical regulator in miRNA processing. This effect is specific for mature miR-221, as it does not affect Pri-miR-221 expression, and the DICER protein, as no changes occur in other miRNA processing cofactors, including DROSHA, PASHA, or Argonaute. DICER is unchanged by Ad.mda-7/IL-24 in normal immortal prostate cells, whereas Ad.mda-7 down-regulates DICER in multiple cancer cells including glioblastoma multiforme and prostate, breast, lung, and liver carcinoma cells. MDA-7/IL-24 protein down-regulates DICER expression through canonical IL-20/IL-22 receptors. Gain- and loss-of-function studies confirm that overexpression of DICER rescues deregulation of miRNAs by mda-7/IL-24, partially rescuing cancer cells from mda-7/IL-24-mediated cell death. Stable overexpression of DICER in cancer cells impedes Ad.mda-7 or His-MDA-7/IL-24 inhibition of cell growth, colony formation, PARP cleavage, and apoptosis. In addition, stable overexpression of DICER renders cancer cells more resistant to Ad.mda-7 inhibition of primary and secondary tumor growth. MDA-7/IL-24-mediated regulation of DICER is reactive oxygen species-dependent and mediated by melanogenesis-associated transcription factor. Our research uncovers a distinct role of mda-7/IL-24 in the regulation of miRNA biogenesis through alteration of the MITF-DICER pathway.
