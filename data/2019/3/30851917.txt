Objectives:To develop and validate a radiomics-based nomogram for the preoperative prediction of posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One hundred twelve consecutive HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy were included in the study pool (training cohort: n = 80, validation cohort: n = 32), and another 13 patients were included in a pilot prospective analysis. A total of 713 radiomics features were extracted from portal-phase computed tomography (CT) images. A logistic regression was used to construct a radiomics score (Rad-score). Then a nomogram, including Rad-score and other risk factors, was built with a multivariate logistic regression model. The discrimination, calibration and clinical utility of nomogram were evaluated.Results:The Rad-score could predict PHLF with an AUC of 0.822 (95% CI, 0.726-0.917) in the training cohort and of 0.762 (95% CI, 0.576-0.948) in the validation cohort; however, the approach could not completely outmatch the existing methods (CP [Child-Pugh], MELD [Model of End Stage Liver Disease], ALBI [albumin-bilirubin]). The individual predictive nomogram that included the Rad-score, MELD and performance status (PS) showed better discrimination with an AUC of 0.864 (95% CI, 0.786-0.942), which was higher than the AUCs of the conventional methods (nomogram vs CP, MELD, and ALBI at P Conclusions:A nomogram based on the Rad-score, MELD, and PS can predict PHLF.
