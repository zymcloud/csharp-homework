Background: Cisplatin (Cispt) is a common anticancer drug for the treatment of several malignancies, including hepatocarcinoma. However, this drug suffers from instability in aqueous solutions. The study aimed to evaluate cisplatin efficacy on HepG2 and E. coli cells under an acidic condition. Methods: Acidic Cispt was prepared via incubation in acidic condition (pH=2) for a month duration. The chemical structure of the acidic Cispt was evaluated by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method. The cytotoxicity of the standard and acidic Cispt were then determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays on HepG2 and E. coli cells, respectively. Results: After preparing of acidic Cispt, its chemical structure was determined by FTIR method. In addition, cytotoxicity effects of Cispt in the standard and acidic forms were calculated 58 ± 2.9 and 65 ± 3.25 μM, respectively. MIC results also confirmed the results of MTT assay. MIC results for the standard and acidic Cispt were estimated 9.5 ± 0.47 and 9.8 ± 0.49 μM, respectively. Conclusion: Preparing Cispt in acidic condition not only did not degrade the drug, but also kept the potency of the drug approximately equal to parent drug. Regarding the instability issues of Cispt, keeping Cispt in acidic condition could be a promising approach to preserve its efficacy.
