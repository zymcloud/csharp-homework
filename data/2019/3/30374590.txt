Purpose:To report on the Erlangen (UK-Er) experience with linear accelerator stereotactic body radiation therapy (LINAC SBRT) for adrenal metastasis from various primary tumors.Materials and methods:33 patients were treated. Primary sites included lung (n = 19), melanoma (n = 8), colorectal (n = 2), hepatocellular (n = 1), esophageal (n = 2), and breast cancer (n = 1). 14 patients were treated palliatively, 19 patients were treated with local curative intent.Radiation treatment:Treatment planning was done based on an exhale, mid-ventilation, and inspiration CT series. Further planning CTs were done to check for the correctness of the breathing pattern. Irradiation was performed using a NOVALIS (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA; Brainlab AG, München, Germany) linear accelerator. The isocenter was verified before each treatment session using the BrainLab ExacTrac® (Brainlab AG, München, Germany) system to minimize setup errors. Dose was prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV) surrounding 90% isodose.Follow-up:Depending on their overall performance status and prognosis, patients received clinical check-ups and radiological imaging. Median follow-up was 11 months.Statistical analysis:IBM SPSS v. 24 was used for univariate analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, and the chi-square test for frequency distributions. Toxicity was graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0. Depending on radiologic imaging, patients were classified as stable, regression, and progression.Results:Median survival was 11 months, median PFS was 5 months. Median local failure-free survival was 21 months. Patients who were treated with curative intent showed a better survival curve (p
