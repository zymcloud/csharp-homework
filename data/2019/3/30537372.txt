Some lncRNAs can encode small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), called small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs), which exert diverse regulatory effects on cellular processes. In this study, using RNA-seq and survival data in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC), we examined the expression profile of some SNHG genes and explored their prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Level-3 RNA-sequencing data, the clinicopathological and survival data of patients with primary HCC were downloaded from the UCSC Xena browser (https://xenabrowser.net/), for a secondary analysis. Results showed that SNHG1, GAS5, SNHG3-7 and SNHG10-12 were significantly upregulated in HCC tissues (N = 49) compared with adjacent normal tissues (N = 49). After adjustment for confounding factors, the multivariate analysis confirmed that increased SNHG4 expression was independently associated with shorter OS (HR: 1.319, 95%CI: 1.131-1.537, P
