This study demonstrated that fenofibrate, a lipid-lowering drug, induced a significant time-dependent cytotoxicity of hepatoma Hep3B cells. Hep3B cells are significantly more sensitive to cell killing by fenofibrate than hepatoma HepG2, lung cancer CH27 and oral cancer HSC-3 cells. From the result of docking simulation, fenofibrate can bind excellently to the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase (FASN) binding site as orlistat, a FASN inhibitor, acts. The fenofibrate-induced cell cytotoxicity was protected by addition of palmitate, indicating that the cytotoxic effect of fenofibrate is due to starvation of Hep3B cells by inhibiting the formation of end product in the FASN reaction. Inhibition of lipid metabolism-related proteins expression, such as proteins containing thioesterase domain and fatty acid transport proteins, was involved in the fenofibrate-induced Hep3B cell death. Fenofibrate caused S and G2/M cell cycle arrest by inducing cyclin A/Cdk2 and reducing cyclin D1 and E protein levels in Hep3B cells. The anti-tumor roles of fenofibrate on Hep3B cells by inducing apoptosis and necroptosis were dependent on the expression of Bcl-2/caspase family members and RIP1/RIP3 proteins, respectively. These results suggest that fenofibrate has an anti-cancer effect in Hep3B cells and inhibition of lipid metabolism may be involved in fenofibrate-induced Hep3B cells apoptosis and necroptosis.
