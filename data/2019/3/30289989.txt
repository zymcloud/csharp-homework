Approved treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) with all-oral direct-acting antivirals (DAA) therapy is now entering into its fourth year; however, little has been reported on the real-world clinical (decompensated cirrhosis [DCC] and hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) and economic outcomes. A retrospective cohort analysis of the Truven Health MarketScan Database (2012-2016) was conducted. In a cohort of 26,105 patients with newly diagnosed HCV, 30% received all-oral DAA therapy (DAA group) and 70% were not treated (untreated group). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the risk of developing HCC and DCC, stratified by cirrhosis status. Among patients with cirrhosis (n = 2157), DAA therapy was associated with a 72% and a 62% lower incidence of HCC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.52) and DCC (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26-0.56). Similarly, DAA therapy was associated with a 57% and a 58% lower incidence of HCC (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.71) and DCC (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.30-0.58) in patients with noncirrhotic HCV (n = 23,948). A propensity score-matched cohort of 8064 HCV-infected patients who had at least a 12-month follow-up after HCV treatment was included for economic analysis. For patients with cirrhosis in the DAA group, the mean adjusted liver-related costs ($1749 vs. $4575; P
