Objective:Increasing studies have indicated the important functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis and progression including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study aims to explore the role of long non-coding RNA AK001796 in HCC progression.Patients and methods:Quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) analysis was performed to examine the lncRNA AK001796 expression in 73 cases of human HCC tissue samples and matched adjacent normal tissues. Besides, the relationship between lncRNA AK001796 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics was analyzed. Overall survival (OS) curves of patients were constructed by the Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate independent risk factors affecting HCC prognosis. Cell proliferation and invasion abilities are analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell invasion assays.Results:We showed that the lncRNA AK001796 expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, compared to their controls, respectively. Higher lncRNA AK001796 expression closely correlated with tumor size (pConclusions:Our results suggested that lncRNA AK001796 acts as a predictor of HCC prognosis and may provide an important clinical value for HCC treatment.
