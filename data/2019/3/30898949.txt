A 43-year-old woman, whose pregnancy was complicated by the presence of a large single solid intra-abdominal fetal mass, was referred from the private sector into our fetal maternal unit at the Corniche Hospital, Abu Dhabi at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.Investigations subsequently confirmed that this mass was a congenital hepatoblastoma, one of the very rare embryonic tumours. The baby had chemotherapy and surgical excision of the tumour. Fifteen months later, the alpha feto-protein levels remain normal and follow-on MRI scans do not show recurrence or any residual disease.To our knowledge, this is the first case of congenital hepatoblastoma in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In the UAE, the interphase between private health insurance schemes and medical (public and private) care within a growing health economy enhances access to unique services such as cancer treatments within specialised centres.
