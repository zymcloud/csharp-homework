Background:Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy is widely used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent studies suggested that therapeutic resistance of tumors was affected by tumor microenvironment (TME). As a major component of TME, the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) on drug resistance in HCC is largely unknown.Methods:26 HCC samples were obtained from patients who had underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) within 3 months before receiving curative resections. Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect the density of TAMs in these tissues. SMMC-7721 and Huh-7 cell lines were used to co-culture with THP-1 derived macrophages. Under oxaliplatin treatment, cell death was measured using MTT and annexin V/propidium iodide assays. Autophagy activation was evaluated by GFP-LC3 redistribution and LC3 conversion in SMMC-7721 and Huh-7. Short-interfering RNA against ATG5 gene was applied to inhibit autophagy. In vivo validation was conducted in Huh-7 with or without macrophages using an HCC xenograft model in nude mice after oxaliplatin administration.Results:We found that the density of TAMs in HCC samples was associated with the efficacy of TACE. Macrophages inhibited cell death induced by oxaliplatin in HCC cells. Autophagy was functionally activated in HCC cells after co-culturing with macrophages. Suppression of autophagy using RNA interference of ATG5 in HCC cells promoted the oxaliplatin cytotoxicity in the co-culture system. Critically, co-implantation with macrophages in HCC xenografts weakens cytotoxic effect of oxaliplatin through inducing autophagy to avoid apoptosis.Conclusions:Our results suggest that TAMs induce autophagy in HCC cells which might contribute to oxaliplatin resistance. Targeting TAMs is a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the effects of chemotherapy oxaliplatin in HCC patients.
