Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended first-line treatment for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In patients who became refractory to TACE, a treatment switch to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) needs to be considered. However, TACE could worsen liver function, thereby narrowing the time window for a switch to TKIs because TKIs are recommended for patients with Child-Pugh grade A (CP-A). We investigated the factors associated with CP grade deterioration after TACE. Among patients who underwent TACE, 125 patients with CP-A were enrolled. The cumulative CP grade deterioration rates were 20.3%, 27.1%, and 41.4% at six months, one year, and two years, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that factors associated with CP grade deterioration included high Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) levels (>2.00 cut-off index) and beyond the up-to-seven criteria. The cumulative CP grade deterioration rates of patients with high M2BPGi and beyond the up-to-seven criteria were 50.6% and 59.2% at six months and one year, respectively, which were significantly higher than for those in any other groups. The combination of M2BPGi and up-to-seven criteria could be a surrogate marker for predicting CP grade deterioration after TACE. In patients with intermediate-stage HCC, elevated M2BPGi levels, and beyond the up-to-seven criteria, an early treatment switch to TKIs should be considered to improve their prognosis.
