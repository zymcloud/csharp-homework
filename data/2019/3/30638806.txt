Purpose:CRS/HIPEC has evolved as an effective method for management of selected patients with peritoneal metastatic disease. Abdominal wall resection (AWR) is often required, and may require complex reconstructions, such as component separation (CST) leading to wound dehiscence (WD) and wound complications (WC). The purpose of our study was to analyse factors contributing to wound complications and wound recurrence (WR).Methods:Retrospective review of a prospective database of 1074 patients undergoing CRS/HIPEC procedures from 1996 to 2017 at St George Hospital.Results:AWR and reconstruction for abdominal wall metastases was performed in 197 (18.3%) patients. Tumour types included mesothelioma, appendiceal, colorectal and ovarian cancers. Grade III WC were found in 21 (10.6%). WD was found in 14 (7.1%) compared to 30 (3.4%) in 877 patients without AWR (p = 0.028). Midline WR was seen in 26 (13.3%) with AWR and mean time to recurrence of 18 months. Multivariable' regression analysis showed age (OR 1.06, 95%CI 1.01-1.11, p = 0.022) and CST (OR 9.63, 95%CI 2.55-36.23, p = 0.001) were independent predictors of Grade III WC, and CST (OR 4.19, 95%CI 1.27-13.86, p = 0.019) was an independent predictor of WD after AWR. The presence of a higher prior surgical score (PSS) 2-3 (OR 2.74, 95%CI 1.16-6.49, p = 0.022) was an independent predictor of midline WR post AWR.Conclusion:This study demonstrates that patients undergoing AWR have a higher incidence of postoperative WD. CST was associated with an increased incidence of Grade III WC and WD. Patients with a higher PSS were more likely to develop midline wound recurrence.
