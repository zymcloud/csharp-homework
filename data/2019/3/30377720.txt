Background:Right hepatectomy with caudate lobectomy (RHx) is considered an appropriate procedure for Bismuth type I/II perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in terms of its anatomical and oncological aspect. However, validity of left hepatectomy with caudate lobectomy (LHx) concomitant with arterial resection and reconstruction (AR) is not fully evaluated.Methods:The patients who underwent surgical resection for Bismuth type I/II perihilar cholangiocarcinoma between 2002 and 2013 were studied. The standard procedure for Bismuth type I/II cholangiocarcinoma in the institute was RHx, while in patients who had insufficient functional reserve of the left liver, LHx was selected, irrespective of the necessity of AR. The clinicopathologic and perioperative outcomes after LHx + AR were compared with those after RHx.Results:The surgical procedures comprised LHx + AR in 12 and RHx in 24. The left liver volume and left liver functional reserve were significantly lower with LHx + AR than with RHx (left liver volume: 28.0 vs. 33.7%, p = 0.026; estimated indocyanine green clearance of the left liver: 0.036 vs. 0.046, p < 0.001). The rate of surgical morbidity was almost identical between the two procedures. No arterial reconstruction-related complications occurred. The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates and median survival time were 66.7%, 41.7% and 44 months for LHx + AR and 70.8%, 49.0% and 57 months for RHx (p = 0.640).Conclusion:LHx + AR for Bismuth type I/II perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is considered to be a valid alternative to RHx in patients with an insufficient left liver functional reserve.
