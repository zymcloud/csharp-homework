Objective: To explore chromobox protein homolog 2 (CBX2) expressions in relation to clinical features of patients and elucidate its role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, R language was used to analyze the distribution of differentially expressed mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma. The different expression of CBX2 in HCC and adjacent tissues and its relationship with survival and clinical characteristics of patients were further analyzed. The expression of CBX2 in liver tissues, liver cancer tissue, and L02, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines was detected by real time-PCR and western blot. The expression of CBX2 was interfered by siRNA in hepatoma cell line. MTT, colony formation, transwell assays, and flow cytometry were used to identify the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and clone-formation ability of HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells after CBX2 down-regulation. According to the different data, t-test, ANOVA, chi-square test, and COX regression model were used for statistical analysis. Survival curve was plotted through Kaplan-Meier method. Results: TCGA public database analysis showed that the expression of CBX2 mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (7.296 ± 1.6115) was significantly higher than normal liver tissues (4.706 ± 0.940) (P = 0.000). In addition, the overall survival time of patients with low CBX2 mRNA expression was significantly longer than that of patients with high CBX2 mRNA expression [(5.971 ± 0.411) years vs. (4.650 ± 0.503) years, P = 0.001]. The expression level of CBX2 mRNA was correlated with the pathological TNM stage (P = 0.025) and differentiation degree (P < 0.001) of liver cancer. COX regression analysis showed that CBX2 mRNA expression was an independent predictor of patient survival (P = 0.013). siRNA was transfected and compared with the blank control group. The transgenic ability of HepG2 and SMMC-77221 cells decreased significantly at 72h (P < 0.05) and 96h (P < 0.05), and the apoptosis rate (11.430% ± 0.215%) was higher than blank control group (6.6 00% ± 0.170%) (P = 0.003). The number of invasive cells ((both P < 0.05) and relative colony forming cells ((both P < 0.001) were significantly decreased. In 20 cases of tissue samples, the expression of CBX2 protein (relative expression level 3.020 ± 0.269) in liver cancer was higher than that in adjacent tissues (relative expression level 0.886±0.065) (P < 0.001). The overall survival time of patients with low CBX2 expression in liver cancer was longer than that of patients with high expression [(3.670 + 0.576) years vs. (0.834 + 0.153) years, P = 0.004]. Conclusion: An evident high expression of CBX2 is an independent poor prognostic factor in hepatoma. Down-regulation of CBX2 expression can inhibit the progression of liver cancer. Therefore, CBX2 may be a prognostic biomarker and a new target for HCC treatment.
