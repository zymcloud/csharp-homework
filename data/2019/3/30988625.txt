Purpose:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of "on-demand" combination therapy with sorafenib and hepatic arterial treatments, such as transarterial chemoembolization and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Eighty consecutive patients with advanced HCC, 58 administered sorafenib monotherapy and 22 administered on-demand combination therapy, were retrospectively evaluated.Results:The disease control rate was significantly higher in the combination group than in the monotherapy group (86.3% vs 51.7%, p=0.01). Elevated alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly more frequent in the combination group (40.9% vs 12.1%, p=0.01), but it was tolerable. Progression-free survival (180 vs 45 days, p=0.045) and overall survival (983 vs 452 days, p=0.004) were significantly longer in the combination group, as was the duration of sorafenib treatment (367 vs 66 days, p<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that hepatitis C virus infection, disease control, and combination therapy were positive independent prognostic factors for survival, whereas alpha-fetoprotein >400 ng/mL was negatively prognostic. In patients receiving combination therapy, male sex, hepatitis B virus infection, performance status deterioration, Barcelona clinic liver cancer-B, and major vascular invasion were prognostic of survival.Conclusion:On-demand combination therapy was tolerated and may be a therapeutic option for patients with advanced HCC.
