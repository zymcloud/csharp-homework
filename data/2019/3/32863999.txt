Introduction:In recent years, an increasing number of studies have revealed the possible prognostic significance of Golgi protein 73 (GP73) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the results are still controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to explore the possible correlation between GP73 and prognostic value in HCC.Material and methods:Relevant publications were searched for in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database up to March 2018. Odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of eligible studies were assessed by either fixed-effect or random effects models. Publication bias analysis was also performed to assess the reliability of the meta-analysis results.Results:In total, 9 studies including 1292 patients with HCC were included and analysed systematically in the study. The results indicated that GP73 overexpression was significantly associated with later tumour stage, higher tumour grade and poor overall survival (OS). Combined analysis of three studies showed no statistical correlation between high GP73 expression and disease-free survival (DFS). Subgroup analyses were also performed to illustrate the relationship between high GP73 expression and OS.Conclusions:The meta-analysis suggested that overexpression of GP73 may be associated with poor prognosis in HCC and may also have a predictive role for HCC invasion and metastasis.
