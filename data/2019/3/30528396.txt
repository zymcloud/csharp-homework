Introduction:Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) brain metastasis is generally viewed as poor prognostic features and often excludes patients from cytoreductive nephrectomy or participation in clinical trials. We aim to evaluate patients presenting with brain metastasis and their outcomes.Methods:Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-18 registries database was queried for all patients with metastatic RCC from 2010 to 2014. Patients with renal cancer as their only malignancy were included. Information was available for metastatic disease to bone, liver, lung, and brain. Patients were then further stratified into those with isolated brain metastases and those with additional metastasis to other sites as well. Overall survival was compared between groups using logrank analysis.Results:A total of 6,667 patients were identified with metastatic RCC. Among them, 775 (12.1%) had brain metastasis at time of diagnosis. Of these patients with brain metastasis, 152 (20.4%) had isolated brain metastasis. Only 23.8% of all patients with brain metastasis underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy, compared to 40.8% of patients with isolated brain metastasis. Patients with brain and other metastasis and brain metastasis only treated by cytoreductive nephrectomy exhibited a median survival of 11 and 33 months, respectively. Those patients who did not undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy experienced a median survival of 4 and 5 months, respectively.Conclusion:It appears that selected patients with brain metastasis may experience durable long-term survival. This information may be beneficial for patient counseling, surgical planning, and consideration for inclusion in clinical trials.
