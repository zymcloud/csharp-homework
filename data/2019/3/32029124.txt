Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer lacking specific biomarkers that can be correlated to disease onset, promotion and progression. To assess whether tumor cell electrophysiology may serve as a marker for PDAC tumorigenicity, we use multi-frequency impedance cytometry at high throughput (âˆ¼350 cells/s) to measure the electrical phenotype of single PDAC tumor cells from xenografts, which are derived from primary pancreatic tumors versus those from liver metastases of different patients. A novel phase contrast metric based on variations in the high and low frequency impedance phase responses that is related to electrophysiology of the cell interior is found to be systematically altered as a function of tumorigenicity. PDAC cells of higher tumorigenicity exhibited lowered interior conductivity and enhanced permittivity, which is validated by the dielectrophoresis on the respective cell types. Using genetic analysis, we suggest the role of dysregulated Na+ transport and removal of Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasm on key oncogenic KRAS-driven processes that may be responsible for lowering of the interior cell conductivity. We envision that impedance cytometry can serve as a tool to quantify phenotypic heterogeneity for rapidly stratifying tumorigenicity. It can also aid in protocols for dielectrophoretic isolation of cells with a particular phenotype for prognostic studies on patient survival and to tailor therapy selection to specific patients.
