Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious health problem worldwide, especially in Asian countries, such as China. However, there are difficulties in diagnosing and treating hepatocellular carcinoma. The alteration of fucosylated proteins was closely associated with carcinogenesis. This study is designed to evaluate the early diagnostic value of associated detection of fucosylated alpha-fetoprotein (fuc-AFP), fucosylated des-Î³-carboxy prothrombin (fuc-DCP), and fucosylated glypican 3 (fuc-GPC3) in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:All serum specimens collected from patients were diagnosed by complete clinicopathological examination and then subjected to the associated detection of fuc-AFP, fuc-DCP, and fuc-GPC3 by protein microarray. Canonical discriminant analysis was adopted to discriminate between the hepatocellular carcinoma group and the benign liver disease group.Results:A total of 51 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 47 patients in the benign liver disease group were included in this study. Fuc-AFP, fuc-DCP, and fuc-GPC3 were significantly higher in the hepatocellular carcinoma group than in the benign liver disease group. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of canonical discriminant analysis classification were 80.4%, 97.9%, and 88.8%, respectively.Conclusions:Fuc-AFP, fuc-DCP, and fuc-GPC3 are effective and useful tumor biomarkers. Associated measurement of these biomarkers with canonical discriminant analysis classification is a promising method for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
