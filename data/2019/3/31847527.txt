Non-coding RNAs, especially miRNAs, have been shown to be important regulators in multiple human diseases, including malignant tumors, congenital disease, and autoimmune disease. In this study, we screened the metastasis-associated miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Based on the miRNA microarray screening, miR-1203 was confirmed to be the most significant miRNA and was also highly associated with HCC metastases. Bioinformatics prediction indicated direct binding of miR-1203 in SOCS3, which was also confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay, resulting in suppression of SOCS3. Increased miR-1203 also promoted invasion of HCC cells through suppressing SOCS3, while no effect on cell proliferation or apoptosis was detected. Circulating expression of miR-1203 and SOCS3 might serve as a predictor of metastases and poor prognosis in HCC patients. In conclusion, miR-1203 might promote HCC metastasis by decreasing SOCS3. MiR-1203 predicts a poor outcome in HCC patients and thus might serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of HCC.
