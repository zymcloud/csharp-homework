Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death over the world. It is well studied that long noncoding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript-1 (CCAT1) played important roles in variety of cancers promoting cell proliferation and metastasis by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of microRNAs. However, whether CCAT1 could regulate HCC by serving as a ceRNA of microRNA remains to be revealed. In this study, we demonstrated that CCAT1 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and remarkably associated with metastasis. With a bioinformatics prediction and functional assay validation, we found a binding site of miR-30c-2-3p on CCAT1, which was important for CCAT1 to promote cell proliferation. Interestingly, we further revealed a novel recognition site for miR-30c-2-3p on the 3'UTR of CCNE1 by mutative method, luciferase assay, and cell viability confirmation. In general, CCAT1 regulate the expression of CCNE1 by acting as a ceRNA to sponge miR-30c-2-3p in regulating the cell proliferation of HCC. These results suggest that CCAT1 may be a new therapy target for HCC in the future. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Our findings may broaden the understanding of the role of CCAT1 in tumorigenesis and may provide a new therapy target for HCC.
