Mutations affecting the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway have been identified in 26‑40% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases. Aberrant activation of this pathway leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and survival. Thus, identifying Wnt/β‑catenin pathway inhibitors may benefit a subset of patients with HCC. In the present study, the effects of sorafenib and a MEK inhibitor on tumor growth and Wnt/β‑catenin signaling in HCC models were evaluated. A β‑catenin mutant and β‑catenin wild‑type HCC models were treated once daily with i) 10 mg/kg sorafenib, ii) 15 mg/kg refametinib (or 25 mg/kg selumetinib), or iii) sorafenib/refametinib. Western blotting was employed to determine changes in biomarkers relevant to Wnt/β‑catenin signaling. Apoptosis, cell proliferation and β‑catenin localization were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Sorafenib/refametinib markedly inhibited tumor growth and cell proliferation, and caused cell death in naïve and sorafenib‑resistant HCC models. Despite similar total β‑catenin levels, significant reductions in phosphorylated (p)‑RanBP3 Ser58, p‑β‑catenin Tyr142, active β‑catenin and β‑catenin target genes were observed in sorafenib/refametinib‑treated tumors. Greater levels of β‑catenin in sorafenib/refametinib‑treated tumors were accumulated at the membrane, as compared with in the control. In vitro, sorafenib/refametinib inhibited the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway and suppressed Wnt‑3A‑induced p‑low‑density lipoprotein receptor‑related protein 6 Ser1490, p‑RanBP3 Ser58 and p‑β‑catenin Tyr142 in HCC cells. Combination of sorafenib and refametinib inhibits the growth of naïve and sorafenib resistant HCC tumors in association with active suppression of β‑catenin signaling regardless of β‑catenin mutational status. Thus, the sorafenib/MEK inhibitor combination may represent an alternative treatment for patients with HCC whose tumors develop resistance to sorafenib therapy.
