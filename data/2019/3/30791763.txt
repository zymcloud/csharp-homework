Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer, currently ranking as one of the highest neoplastic-related mortalities in the world. Due to the difficulty in early diagnosis and lack of effective treatment options, the 5-year survival rate of HCC remains extremely low. Histone deacetylation is one of the most important epigenetic mechanisms, regulating cellular events such as differentiation, proliferation and cell cycle. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), the chief mediators of this epigenetic mechanism, are often aberrantly expressed in various tumours including HCC. Areas covered: This review focuses on the most up-to-date findings of HDACs and their associated molecular mechanisms in HCC onset and progression. In addition, a potential network between HDACs and non-coding RNAs including microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs underlying hepatocarcinogenesis is considered. Expert opinion: Unmasking the role of HDACs and their association with HCC pathogenesis could have implications for future personalized therapeutic and diagnostic targeting.
