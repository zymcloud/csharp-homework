Aim:This study was designed as a preliminary investigation of safety and efficacy of LifePearl, polyethylene glycol microspheres loaded with doxorubicin for treatment of locally untreatable (i.e., unresectable and not suitable for local thermal ablation) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:Patients with locally untreatable HCC (mono- or bilobar disease, ECOG performance status 0-1, Chilg-Pugh score Results:Twenty subjects with 29 tumours were treated (mean age 66.2 years). Child-Pugh status was A for 12 pts. (60%), B for 6 pts. (30%) and C for 2 pts. (10%). Three patients had insignificant ascites. Most patients (70%) underwent Conclusion:The results from this investigation suggest that LifePearl microspheres, Terumo loaded with doxorubicin can provide an excellent local tumour control with very few side effects in a relatively homogeneous group of patients with locally untreatable HCC.
