Background/aim:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is one of the most widely used palliative therapies for the unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, a large difference is found in prognosis among patients treated with TACE. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of β-catenin in HCC patients treated with TACE.Materials and methods:Seventy patients with HCC were included in this study. Expression of β-catenin was determined by immunohistochemistry in biopsy samples taken before TACE. The patients were treated with TACE and followed-up. Clinicopathological parameters, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated to analyze the association of β-catenin expression with prognosis for HCC patients after TACE.Results:HCC patient biopsies exhibited a significantly higher positive rate of β-catenin expression (72.86%) compared to paracancer normal tissues (19.44%) (pConclusion:The HCC patients with increased β-catenin expression have a poor prognosis with lower survival rate.
