To observe the curative effect of surgery combined with gene therapy on small hepatocellular carcinoma. Seventy-seven patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (diameter 12/ml). The prognosis of patients was analyzed by imaging twice a year. In the gene group, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 91.4, 63.6, and 52.1%. In the control group, the survival rates were 84.3, 54.4, and 32.6%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the overall survival rates between two groups. Factors associated with overall survival in univariate analysis included bilirubin, prothrombin activity, cirrhosis, and gene therapy (P < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, it included cirrhosis, gene therapy, and bilirubin. The gene therapy hepatocellular carcinoma patients with a diameter < 5 cm could significantly reduce recurrence after operation. It was worthy of being popularized.
