Purpose:To investigate the outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) following artificial ascites (AA) and artificial pleural effusion (AP) creation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk locations.Materials and methods:Eligible patients were divided into 2 study periods (non-AAAP and AAAP groups) with AAAP performed in the latter period. Local tumor progression, primary technique effectiveness and complications were compared between patients with and without AAAP. Cumulative probability of local tumor progression and overall survival were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:One hundred thirty-eight patients with 195 tumors were evaluated. AAAP was performed in 48 patients with 76 tumors. Local tumor progression rates at 12 and 24 months were 9.3% and 22.2% in the non-AAAP group versus 5.5% and 9% in the AAAP group (p Conclusion:RFA following AA and AP for high-risk located HCC may improve outcomes.
