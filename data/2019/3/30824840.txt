Tumor-associated immune response plays a critical role in cancer pathogenesis. This study evaluated clinical implications of T cell cytokines and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in HCC patients treated with TACE. Whole blood was obtained for analysis of T cell cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-22, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) and Tregs from 142 HCC patients. Patients with CTP class A had a significantly lower proportion of detectable IL-4 or IL-6, but a higher proportion of detectable IL-22 than patients with CTP class B/C. IL-6 level was well correlated with tumor stage and undetectable IL-17A was associated with extrahepatic metastasis. The overall survival rate was significantly higher in patients who had undetectable IL-6 or detectable IL-22 than patients who did not. IL-6 among cytokines remained independently predictive factor for survival. Increased IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio and no increase in IL-6 level following TACE were associated with prolonged survival, and baseline Tregs could affect Th1/Th2 balance. T cell cytokines are associated with a variety of clinical aspects of HCC, and IL-6 is the most significant predictor of survival. A shift toward increased Th1 response and no increase in IL-6 level exert favorable immunologic effects on HCC prognosis.
