Î²-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a major ketone body in mammals, is produced from fatty acids through mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes. To elucidate the role of BHB in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we examined the effects of BHB on hepatic ER stress induced by tunicamycin. In mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells, BHB treatment suppressed the protein expression of ER stress responsive genes and increased cell viability, while reducing the protein expression of apoptosis inducible genes, without causing any alterations in the protein expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) or the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase. The intraperitoneal administration of BHB also reduced the protein expression of ER stress responsive genes in mouse livers. In human hepatoma HepG2 cells, the protein expression levels of ER stress responsive genes were increased by the partial inhibition of BHB production with siRNA targeting endogenous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) lyase, whereas they were decreased by promoting BHB production with fenofibrate. These findings revealed that BHB helps to suppress hepatic ER stress via a SIRT1-independent pathway, and it might be possible to manipulate ER stress by regulating BHB production genetically or pharmacologically.
