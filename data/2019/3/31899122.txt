Half of patients newly diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) have metastatic disease (mESCC) and therefore a poor prognosis. Furthermore, half of patients with initial loco-regional disease present disease recurrence after surgery and/or chemoradiation. In mESCC, the recommended first-line treatment combines 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, although this has not been validated by a phase III trial. Patients with disease progression or recurrence after platinum-based chemotherapy and good performance status probably benefit from second-line chemotherapy. Several molecules have been evaluated in phase I/II trials or retrospective studies (docetaxel, paclitaxel and irinotecan) but no randomised studies are available. OESIRI is a multicentre, randomised, open-label phase II trial designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) plus 5-FU versus paclitaxel as second-line therapy in patients with mESCC. The main inclusion criteria are histologically proven mESCC in progression after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with initial resectable disease can be included if recurrence occurred within 6 months. The primary objective is to evaluate the percentage of patients alive 9 months after randomisation. Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, safety and quality of life. In addition, circulating tumour DNA will be monitored to assess its prognostic value.
