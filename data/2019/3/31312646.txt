Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Upon ineligibility for resection, liver transplantation, or locoregional therapies, sorafenib has been the only systemic treatment option of advanced HCC for more than a decade. Immunotherapy is an evolving HCC treatment option that has shown promise in treatment efficacy at an acceptable safety profile during several preceding phase I/II trials. Numerous clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) alone, in combination of two, or combined with other targeted or locoregional therapies are ongoing. Encouraging results of two-phase III trials testing pembrolizumab or nivolumab versus standard care therapy even resulted in Food and Drug Administration approval for second-line treatment of advanced HCC. ICPIs may open new avenues to the treatment of hepatobiliary tumors, alone or in combination.
