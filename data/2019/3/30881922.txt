The sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) acts as a cellular receptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on host hepatocytes. We aim to investigate how the NTCP p.Ser267Phe variant affects HBV-related disease progression and analyze viral genomic variability under a host genetic background carrying the p.Ser267Phe variant. A total of 3187 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were enrolled and genotyped for the p.Ser267Phe variant. The variant's association with disease progression was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. We also enrolled 83 treatment-naive CHB patients to analyze the variability of the HBV preS1 region. The frequency of the NTCP p.Ser267Phe variant was significantly lower in patients diagnosed with acute-on-chronic liver failure [OR (95% CI) = 0.33 (0.18-0.58), P = 1.34 × 10-4], cirrhosis [OR (95% CI) = 0.47 (0.31-0.72), P = 4.04 × 10-4], and hepatocellular carcinoma [OR (95% CI) = 0.54 (0.34-0.86), P = 9.83 × 10-3] as compared with CHB controls under the additive model after adjustment. Furthermore, the percentage of amino acid mutations in HBV preS1 region was significantly higher in the NTCP p.Ser267Phe heterozygote group than in the NTCP wild type homozygote group (P < 0.05). We herein demonstrate that the NTCP p.Ser267Phe variant is a protective factor reducing CHB patient risk for liver failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. A host genetic background carrying NTCP p.Ser267Phe exerts selective pressure on the virus, leading to more variability.
