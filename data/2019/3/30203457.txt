Several studies investigated the association between miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism and the risk of several human cancers, but the findings remain inconclusive. To evaluate the impact of miR-34b/c rs4938723 on cancer risk, we performed a meta-analysis on all available studies including 12 361 cancer cases and 14 270 controls. Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google scholar databases. Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated in codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and allele models to quantitatively estimate the association. The overall findings showed no significant association between miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism and cancer risk in codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and allele inheritance model. However, in stratified analysis by cancer types, the rs4938723 polymorphism significantly increased the risk of gastrointestinal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, the rs4938723 polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The findings did not support an association between rs4938723 variant and digestive tract as well as gastric cancer. In summary, the findings of this meta-analysis indicated that the miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism might be associated with some cancer development. Larger and well-designed studies are necessary to estimate this association in detail.
