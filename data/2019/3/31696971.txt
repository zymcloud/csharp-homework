Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) for regulating the cell cycle and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) remain elusive. In this study, SNHG16 expression profiles of HCC tissues or cell lines were compared with those of normal tissues or hepatocyte cell line. The effect of SNHG16 knockdown in HCC cell lines was investigated by using in vitro loss-of-function experiments and in vivo nude mouse experiments. The potential molecular regulatory mechanism of SNHG16 in HCC progression was investigated by using mechanistic experiments and rescue assays. The results revealed that SNHG16 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, which predicted poor prognosis of HCC patients. On one hand, the downregulation of SNHG16 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, inducing cell apoptosis and suppression of cell proliferation. On the other hand, it inhibited cell metastasis and EMT progression demonstrated by in vitro loss-of-function cell experiments. Besides, knockdown of SNHG16 increased the sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin. For the detailed mechanism, SNHG16 was demonstrated to act as a let-7b-5p sponge in HCC. SNHG16 facilitated the G2/M cell cycle transition by directly acting on the let-7b-5p/CDC25B/CDK1 axis, and promoted cell metastasis and EMT progression by regulating the let-7b-5p/HMGA2 axis in HCC. In addition, the mechanism of SNHG16 for regulating HCC cell proliferation and metastasis was further confirmed in vivo by mouse experiments. Furthermore, these results can provide new insights into HCC treatment and its molecular pathogenesis, which may enlighten the further research of the molecular pathogenesis of HCC.
