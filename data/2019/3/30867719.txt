The present study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of neuroepithelial cell transforming 1 (NET-1), a member of the Ras homolog gene family, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To determine the association between the expression of NET-1 and the proliferation and migration of MHCC97-H cells, the cells were transfected with NET-1 small interfering (si)RNA and si negative control. Following transfection with NET-1 siRNA, the proliferation rate of MHCC97-H cells decreased significantly and the percentage of apoptotic cells increased. The HCC cell line MHCC97-H was used in the present study as it exhibited an increased expression level of NET-1 compared with the MHCC97-L cell line. Expression levels of apoptosis-associated proteins including apoptosis regulator Bax (Bax), cyclinD1, apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (Bcl-2) and caspase-3 were determined. Expression levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) and their phosphorylated forms were also measured by western blotting. Following NET-1 knockdown, the expression of Bax and cyclinD1 decreased, the expression of Bcl-2 and caspase-3 increased, and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited. The results of the present study suggest that inhibition of NET-1 can suppress the progression of HCC by targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. NET-1 expression level in HCC cells increased compared with normal liver cells.
