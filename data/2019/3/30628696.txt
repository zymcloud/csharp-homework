The SET domainâ€‘containing 1B (SETD1B) gene is involved in multiple biological processes, including tumor development and progression. However, the role of SETD1B in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unexplored. The present study, examined the expression of SETD1B in patients with HCC and assessed its clinical significance. Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis results revealed that the expression levels of SETD1B mRNA and protein were significantly increased in HCC tumor tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. In addition, an analysis of the patient clinical factors indicated that increased levels of SETD1B expression were associated with tumor size, clinical stage and liver cirrhosis. Patients with HCC with decreased levels of SETD1B expression exhibited longer survival times compared with those with increased levels of SETD1B expression. In addition, Cox's regression analysis results implied that the upregulation of SETD1B was an independent prognostic marker in patients with HCC. Taken together, the results demonstrated that SETD1B is essential in the progression of HCC and may be used as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCC.
