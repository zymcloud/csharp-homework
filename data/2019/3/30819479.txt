Purpose:To evaluate the effects of the degree of ethiodized oil accumulation achieved by transarterial chemoembolization followed by radiofrequency (RF) ablation on the treatment efficacy for a single intermediate-sized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A total of 153 consecutive patients who underwent chemoembolization and RF ablation for a single intermediate-sized HCC (2-5 cm) were included. On the basis of the degree of ethiodized oil accumulation in HCC on cone-beam CT images, patients who underwent chemoembolization and RF ablation were classified into 2 groups: compact accumulation (â‰¥ 75%) and noncompact accumulation (Results:Of the 153 patients, 89 were classified into the compact ethiodized oil accumulation group and 64 in the noncompact ethiodized oil accumulation group. There were no significant differences in patient demographic or HCC characteristics between groups except for the incidence of liver cirrhosis (P = .038) and the tumor margin morphology (P = .008). The cumulative LTP rate was significantly lower in the compact accumulation group than in the noncompact accumulation group (P = .013). There were no significant differences in the incidences of complications, DFS rates (P = .055), or OS rates (P = .184).Conclusions:The degree of ethiodized oil accumulation does not play a role in decreasing the OS or DFS rate after chemoembolization and RF ablation for intermediate-sized HCC; however, it may contribute to reducing the rate of LTP.
