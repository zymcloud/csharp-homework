Golgi protein 73 (GP73, also referred to as Golph 2) with 400 amino acids is a 73 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein typically found in the cis-Golg complex. It is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, which has been found upregulated in hepatocytes in patients suffering from both viral and non-viral liver diseases. GP73 has drawn increasing attention for its potential application in the diagnosis of liver diseases such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Herein, we reviewed the discovery history of GP73 and summarized studies by many groups around the world, aiming at understanding its structure, expression, function, detection methods and the relationship between GP73 and liver diseases in various settings.
