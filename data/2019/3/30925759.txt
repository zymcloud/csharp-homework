Hepatic intrasinusoidal (HI) natural killer (NK) cells from liver perfusate have unique features that are similar to those of liver-resident NK cells. Previously, we have reported that HI CD56bright NK cells effectively degranulate against SNU398 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Thus, the aim of this study was to further investigate the phenotype and function of HI NK cells. We found that HI CD56bright NK cells degranulated much less to Huh7 cells. HI CD56bright NK cells expressed NKG2D, NKp46, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and FAS ligand (FASL) at higher levels than CD56dim cells. SNU398 cells expressed more NKG2D ligands and FAS and less PD-L1 than Huh7 cells. Blockade of NKG2D, TRAIL, and FASL significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of HI NK cells against SNU398 cells, but blockade of PD-L1 did not lead to any significant change. However, HI NK cells produced IFN-Î³ well in response to Huh7 cells. In conclusion, the cytotoxicity of HI CD56bright NK cells was attributed to the expression of NKG2D, TRAIL, and FASL. The results suggest the possible use of HI NK cells for cancer immunotherapy and prescreening of HCC cells to help identify the most effective NK cell therapy recipients.
