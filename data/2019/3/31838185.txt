In the study the modulating effect of inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKK): ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated), ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 Related) and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase) on genotoxicity of dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBC) in HepG2 human hepatocellular cancer cells was investigated. The cytotoxicity of DBC was determined, also in combination with PIKK inhibitors, using the MTT reduction assay. The high cytotoxicity of DBC was observed after 72 h incubation (IC50 = 0.06 μM). The PIKK inhibitors applied at non-cytotoxic concentrations: caffeine (1 mM) and KU55933 (2.5 μM) had no significant influence on the DBC cytotoxicity, however NU7026 (5 μM) caused significant increase in the cell viability by about 25%. The combinations of the inhibitors (double or triple) where NU7026 was present also caused increase in the cell viability (i.e. cytoprotective effect) compared to the effect of DBC. The level of damage to the genetic material (DNA double strand breaks, DSB) was assessed by measuring levels of phosphorylated form of H2A histone (γH2AX) and neutral comet assay. DBC induced DSB in a concentration and time-dependent manner. NU7026 considerably reduced the level of DSB level measured by γH2AX and comet assay. The obtained results confirm that DBC is cytotoxic and causes damage to the genetic material including DSB. The DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 increases cell viability after exposure to DBC and reduces DNA damage, what indicates an important role of the sensor kinase in mediating the effect.
