Background:Sorafenib (SOR) is recommended for locally advanced and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the tolerability of SOR is unsatisfactory. Selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) has shown efficacy in intermediate-locally advanced HCC patients. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of SIRT and SOR in the treatment of intermediate-locally advanced HCC.Methods:We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases for eligible studies. The endpoints evaluated included the overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR) and grade≥3 adverse events (AEs).Results:Six studies were included in this analysis. The OS was similar between the two groups (HR 1.06, 95%CI 0.93-1.20; P = 0.40). There was no difference in the DCR between the two groups (RR 1.13, 95%CI 0.87-1.46; P = 0.35). However, the ORR in the SIRT group was significantly higher than that in the SOR group (RR 4.10, 95%CI 1.92-8.76; P = 0.0003). The incidence rate of grade≥3 AEs was higher in the SOR group.Conclusions:In patients with intermediate-locally advanced HCC, SIRT and SOR result in similar survival rates. The improved toxicity profile of SIRT may help when choosing between the two treatments.
