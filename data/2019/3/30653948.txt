Background:A number of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients have developed resistance against transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment. In this study, we aimed to develop a panel of microRNAs (miRs) biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes in HCC patients after TACE treatment.Methods:The expression level of twenty miRs was evaluated in FFPE tissues collected from 33 HCC patients. We selected four differentially expressed miRs in TACE-responders versus non-responders and re-assessed their expression in 51 serum samples. The expressions of miRs associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment outcomes were investigated. The diagnostic accuracy of these miRs in predicting patients' response to TACE was also evaluated.Results:The baseline of miR-106b, miR-107 and miR-133b was significantly elevated (p Conclusion:Circulating miR-133b, miR-26a, miR-107 and miR-106 in serum are potential candidates to be utilized as prognostic biomarkers for predication of TACE treatment outcomes in HCC patients.
