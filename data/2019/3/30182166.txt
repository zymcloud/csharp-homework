Background:Elevation of serum ferritin levels is frequently observed in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Our study aims to examine the association between serum ferritin levels and NAFLD in Korean population.Methods and results:A total of 25,597 participants were selected from Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys 2007-2012. The NAFLD liver fat score (NLFS) was used to define NAFLD. Elevation of ALT levels was defined as ALT level > 40 IU/L for male and ALT level > 31 IU/L for female. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association of serum ferritin levels and NAFLD by sex. After adjusting for multiple covariates, the ORs (95% CI) of the elevated ALT levels were 1.56 (95% CI: 1.17-2.07), 1.84 (95% CI: 1.39-2.45), and 4.08 (95% CI: 3.08-5.40) for the second, third and fourth serum ferritin quartiles in male (p for trend < 0.01), 1.67 (95% CI: 1.24-2.23), 2.23 (95% CI: 1.68-2.96), and 5.72 (95% CI: 4.32-7.60) for the second, third and fourth serum ferritin quartiles in female (p for trend < 0.01). Serum ferritin levels were also significantly associated with NAFLD and liver fibrosis both in male and female.Conclusions:Elevation of serum ferritin level is significantly associated with NAFLD and blood ALT elevation in Korean general population.
