A60s woman was followed-up regularly for primary biliary cholangitis and a solitary enlarging hepatic mass in the S6 segment of her liver was discovered by ultrasonography. We diagnosed the mass as hepatocellular carcinoma by contrast ultrasonography, contrast computed tomography, and ethoxbenzyl magnetic resonance imaging and laparoscopic partial hepatectomy of S6 segment was performed. The resected specimen was histopathologicaly diagnosed as liver-reactive lymphoid hyperplasia(RLH). The patient is alive without recurrence 17 months after the surgery. Although liver RLH is a rare disease, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small liver tumors.
