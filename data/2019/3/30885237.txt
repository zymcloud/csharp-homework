Background:Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lacks effective curative therapy and there is an urgent need to develop a novel molecular-targeted therapy for HCC. Selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promise in treating cancers including HCC. Tyrosine kinases c-Met and Trks are potential therapeutic targets of HCC and strategies to interrupt c-Met and Trks cross-signaling may result in increased effects on HCC inhibition.Methods:The effects of Indo5 on c-Met and Trks activity were determined with in vitro kinase activity assay, cell-based signaling pathway activation, and kinases-driven cell transformation. The in vivo anti-tumor activity was determined with xenograft mice and liver orthotopic mice models. The co-expression of c-Met and TrkB in 180 pairs of HCC and adjacent normal tissues were detected using immunohistochemical staining.Results:Indo5, a novel lead compound displayed biochemical potency against both c-Met and Trks with selectivity over 13 human kinases. Indo5 abrogated HGF-induced c-Met signaling activation and BDNF/NGF-induced Trks signal activation, c-Met or TrkB-mediated cell transformation and migration. Furthermore, Indo5 significantly decreased the growth of HCC cells in xenograft mice and improved the survival of mice with liver orthotopic tumors. In addition, co-expression of c-Met and TrkB in HCC patients was a predictor of poor prognosis, and combined inhibition of c-Met and TrkB exerted a synergistic suppressive effect on HCC.Conclusions:These findings indicate that Indo5 is associated with marked suppression of c-Met and Trks co-expressing HCC, supporting its clinical development as an antitumor treatment for HCC patients with co-active c-Met and Trks signaling.
