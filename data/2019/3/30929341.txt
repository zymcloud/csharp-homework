The incidence of metabolic syndrome gradually multiplied with the change of dietary structure of high fat- high sugar in the population, bringing it as independent risk factors for tumors. Liver is an important organ of lipid metabolism. The main manifestations of metabolic syndrome are obesity and abnormal lipid metabolism, which are closely related to hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence. MicroRNA (miRNA) is an endogenous non-coding RNA that participates in the post-transcriptional regulation of target genes by binding to the 3'-UTR of mRNA. Research studies have found that abnormal miRNA expression can influence the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating lipid metabolism-related proteins in the liver. This article reviews and discusses the characteristics and pathogenesis of lipid metabolism disorder in hepatocellular carcinoma, and the mechanism by which miRNA regulates the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma through lipid metabolism-related proteins. Furthermore, it also provides a reliable theoretical foundation for the study of the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
