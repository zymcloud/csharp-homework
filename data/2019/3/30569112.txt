Sorafenib is the standard of care for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, identifying secreted biomarkers that predict sorafenib efficacy in all HCC patients remains challenging. It was recently reported that sorafenib interferes with protein homeostasis and inhibits global translation in tumour cells. A likely consequence of this inhibition would be the interruption of autocrine loops. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of sorafenib on two growth factors implicated in autocrine loops and HCC tumour invasion: amphiregulin (AREG) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). ELISA, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, western blotting and a cytokine array were performed on HCC cell lines and the prognostic role of these two biomarkers in HCC patients was evaluated. Serum AREG and VEGF levels were assayed by ELISA in 55 patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib. It was observed that sorafenib decreased AREG, VEGF and cytokine expression at the transcriptional and post‑transcriptional levels. All HCC patients in our cohort had detectable concentrations of AREG and VEGF both at baseline and after sorafenib treatment. The decreased serum levels of AREG and VEGF after 15 days of sorafenib treatment were significantly associated with better overall and progression‑free survival. The results of the multivariate analysis demonstrated that a decrease in AREG was an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.208; 95% confidence interval, 0.173‑0.673; P=0.0003). These results suggest that sorafenib inhibits auto-crine loops and that early decrease in serum AREG or VEGF levels predicts sorafenib efficacy in HCC patients.
