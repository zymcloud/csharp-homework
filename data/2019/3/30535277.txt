The hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced chronic liver diseases are serious health threats worldwide. There is evidence to display the alterations of salivary N-linked glycans related to the development of HBV-infected liver diseases. Here, we further investigated the alterations of fucosylated N/O-glycans recognized by LTL in saliva from 120 subjects (30 healthy volunteers (HV), 30 patients with hepatitis B (HB), 30 patients with hepatic cirrhosis (HC), and 30 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) using salivary microarrys and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. The results showed that the expression level of fucosylated glycans recognized by LTL was significantly increased in HCC compared with other subjects (P
