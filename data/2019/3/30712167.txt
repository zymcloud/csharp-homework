Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is heterogeneous in terms of its biological nature. Various factors related to its biological nature, including size, multifocality, macroscopic morphology, grade of differentiation, macro/microvascular invasion, bile duct invasion, intra-tumoral fat and molecular factors, and their value as prognostic imaging biomarkers have been reported. And recently, genome-based molecular HCC classification correlated with clinical outcome has been elucidated. The imaging biomarkers suggesting a less aggressive nature of HCC are smaller size, solitary tumor, smooth margin suggesting small nodular type with indistinct margin and simple nodular type with distinct margin, capsule, imaging biomarkers predicting early or well-differentiated grade, intra-tumoral fat detection, and low fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation. The imaging biomarkers suggesting an aggressive HCC nature are larger size, multifocality, non-smooth margin suggesting simple nodular type with extranodular growth, confluent multinodular, and infiltrative type, imaging biomarkers predicting poor differentiation, macrovascular tumor thrombus, predicting microvascular invasion imaging biomarkers, bile duct dilatation or tumor thrombus, and high FDG accumulation. In the genome-based molecular classification, CTNNB-1 mutated HCC shows a less aggressive nature, while CK19/EpCAM positive HCC and macrotrabecular massive HCC show an aggressive one. Better understanding of these imaging biomarkers can contribute to devising more appropriate treatment plans for HCC.
