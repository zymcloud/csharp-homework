Background:Preliminary evidence suggests that weight loss among obese has differential metabolic effects depending on the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We assessed whether NAFLD predisposes to differential changes in liver fat content, liver function, and metabolic parameters upon diet-induced weight loss in a 50-week intervention trial.Methods:143 overweight and obese non-smokers underwent a 12-week dietary intervention and a 38-week follow-up. Diet-induced changes in anthropometric measures, circulating biomarkers, and magnetic resonance (MR)-derived liver fat content and adipose tissue volumes were evaluated by mixed linear models stratifying by NAFLD at baseline.Results:The prevalence of NAFLD at baseline was 52%. Diet-induced weight loss after 12 (NAFLD: 4.8 ± 0.5%, No NAFLD: 5.1 ± 0.5%) and 50 weeks (NAFLD: 3.5 ± 0.7%, No NAFLD: 3.5 ± 0.9%) was similar in both groups, while the decrease in liver fat was significantly greater in the NAFLD group (week 12: 32.9 ± 9.5% vs. 6.3 ± 4.0%; week 50: 23.3 ± 4.4% vs. 5.0 ± 4.2%). Decreases in biomarkers of liver dysfunction (GGT, ALT, AST) and HOMA IR were also significantly greater in the NAFLD group. Other metabolic parameters showed no significant differences.Conclusion:Our data suggest that individuals with NAFLD show greater improvements of liver function and insulin sensitivity after moderate diet-induced weight loss than individuals without NAFLD.
