To understand the androgen receptor (AR) in different human malignancies, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of AR in different tumor tissues and association with patient survival and obtained AR expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Pan-Cancer Analysis of AR indicated that 12 tumor types had decreased AR expression in the tumor, while glioblastoma multiforme has overexpressed AR. The survival analysis showed that high AR mRNA is associated with poor survival of stomach adenocarcinoma and low-grade glioma, but better survival of adrenocortical carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, and skin cutaneous melanoma based on AR mRNA, protein or AR-score. AR was associated with different clinical characteristics and AR correlated genes enriched in cancer-related pathways. These data indicate that AR signaling may be strongly associated with some cancer development and patients' survival, which is promising for potential treatment using antiandrogen therapies.
