Quantitative radiomics features, extracted from medical images, characterize tumour-phenotypes and have been shown to provide prognostic value in predicting clinical outcomes. Stability of radiomics features extracted from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-maps is essential for reliable correlation with the underlying pathology and its clinical applications. Within a multicentre, multi-vendor trial we established a method to analyse radiomics features from ADC-maps of ovarian (n = 12), lung (n = 19), and colorectal liver metastasis (n = 30) cancer patients who underwent repeated (<7 days) diffusion-weighted imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T. From these ADC-maps, 1322 features describing tumour shape, texture and intensity were retrospectively extracted and stable features were selected using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC > 0.85). Although some features were tissue- and/or respiratory motion-specific, 122 features were stable for all tumour-entities. A large proportion of features were stable across different vendors and field strengths. By extracting stable phenotypic features, fitting-dimensionality is reduced and reliable prognostic models can be created, paving the way for clinical implementation of ADC-based radiomics.
