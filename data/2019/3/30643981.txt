Alcohol and high-fat diet are two major risk factors responsible for metabolic diseases, which are manifested as steatohepatitis and liver cancer in the liver, and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the pancreas. These metabolic diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent around the globe, and more importantly, their two major etiologies commonly coexist to precipitate the disease processes. To highlight the importance of these metabolic diseases, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology (JSGE) and National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse of National Institute of Health cosponsored the JSGE's 7th International Forum jointly held with the 12th International Symposium on ALPD and Cirrhosis. Toward the main theme of "Frontiers in ASH, NASH, NBNC-HCC and PDAC", this platform showcased presentations by 12 invited international and Japanese speakers on brain-gut-liver interactions, emerging mechanisms of ASH and NASH, metabolic reprogramming, and new therapeutic targets for cirrhosis, HCC, and PDAC. This editorial discusses the most recent data on global statistics on how alcohol and obesity impact health and longevity as a prelude to a brief summary of the symposium presentations and discussions, primarily focusing on the first two session themes.
Alcoholic steatohepatitis; High-fat diet; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; Risk factors.
