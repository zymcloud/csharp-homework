Hepatitis C virus clearance is expected in more than 95% of patients treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). However, an extensive debate about the impact of DAAs on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently ongoing. This review aimed to explore currently available evidence about the relationship between DAAs and HCC development. The American studies and some European studies clearly showed no relation, while the Japanese and Egyptian studies and the other European studies showed an increased risk of developing HCC after DAA exposure. These conflicting results may be due to geographical and ethnic variations and differences in the design and inclusion criteria among the studies. After reviewing the data from these different studies, it seems that some patients are at increased risk of developing HCC after DAA exposure. Identifying those at increased risk is very important for the management of HCC in light of the potentially major consequences of HCC for the patients' quality of life and the subsequent major burden imposed on healthcare resources.
