Objective:To review the development of adult and pediatric liver transplantation in Tianjin First Center Hospital, and to enhance academic exchanges, improve technological innovation, and jointly promote the progress and maturity in the field of liver transplantation.Methods:The development of liver transplantation in Tianjin First Center Hospital was analyzed. The clinical data of adult and pediatric liver transplantation from September 1998 to September 2018 were collected. The important events and technological innovation achievements of liver transplantation during the 20 years were summarized.Results:The first clinical liver transplantation was attempted in Tianjin First Central Hospital in April 1980. The first long-term survival adult liver transplantation in China was completed in 1994 (11 years survival after the operation). The specialized team of liver transplantation was formally established in September 1998. The 20-year clinical exploration and progress reflected the characteristics of era changes and technological innovation during the rapid development of liver transplantation in China. Our center performed liver re-transplantation in January 1999, reduced-size pediatric liver transplantation in August 2000. In May 2001, we organized the formulation for the preventive and treatment plan for hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation. We performed combined liver and kidney transplantation in July 2002, split liver transplantation (SLT) in April 2004, the first domino liver transplantation (DLT) in August 2005. Pediatric living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) was initiated in October 2006, adult LDLT was carried out in August 2007. In September 2007, the first living donor combined liver and kidney transplantation from the same donor in Asia was performed. The first domino+living donor double grafts liver transplantation in the world was performed in January 2009. In March 2011, we performed laparoscopically assisted right hepatic lobe liver transplantation (LDLT) with middle hepatic vein. In May 2014, living donor laparoscopic left lateral lobe procurement was successfully established. In April 2016, simultaneous liver, pancreas and kidney multi-organ transplantation was completed. Domino donor-auxiliary liver transplantation was performed in February 2017. In December 2017, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-supported liver transplantation in a patient with severe pulmonary hypertension was successfully completed. Liver transplantation combined with partial splenectomy was established in April 2018. Cross-domino liver transplantation (hypersensitive kidney transplantation with auxiliary liver transplantation+pediatric liver transplantation) was performed in May 2018. During the 20 years, the team has performed or assisted other centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen to carry out more than 10 000 cases of liver transplantations. A total of 7 043 cases of various types of liver transplantation were performed in the single center of the hospital (6 005 adult liver transplantations and 1 038 pediatric liver transplantations). Concerning adult liver transplantation, the cumulative 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rate from September 1998 to March 2003 were 83.1%, 73.0% and 69.0%, from April 2003 to March 2009 were 85.3%, 76.2% and 72.1% and from April 2009 to September 2018 were 87.5%, 79.2% and 75.1%, respectively. The cumulative 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rate for pediatric liver transplantation were 93.5%, 92.2% and 90.2%, respectively. The nucleoside (acid) analogue combined with low dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) was developed to prevent the recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation, this plan has reduced the recurrence rate of hepatitis B and the 5-year re-infection rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation significantly. The risk assessment system for tumor recurrence after liver transplantation was established and individual treatment method was established based on this assessment system. Continuous exploration and improvement of liver transplantation for liver cancer, liver re-transplantation, liver transplantation with portal vein thrombosis, SLT, DLT and multi-organ combined transplantation have significantly improved the clinical efficacy of patients and the post-operative survival rate.Conclusions:The liver transplantation team of Tianjin First Center Hospital has carried out a scientific and technological exploration on the key problems and technical difficulties of clinical liver transplantation. This work strongly has initiated and promoted the rapid development of liver transplantation in China. The restrictive barrier of hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation has been overcome. The risk prevention and control system of tumor recurrence after liver transplantation has been established. A series of innovative achievements that can be popularized have been achieved in the field of complex liver transplantation and expansion of donor liver source. The iterative progress and sustainable development of liver transplantation have been realized.
