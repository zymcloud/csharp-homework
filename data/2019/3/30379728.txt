Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of a personalized, 3-dimensional (3D)-printed, transparent liver model with focal liver lesions (FLLs) for lesion-by-lesion imaging-pathologic matching.Materials and methods:This preliminary, prospective study was approved by our institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained. Twenty patients (male-to-female ratio, 13:7; mean age, 56 years) with multiple FLLs, including at least one presumed malignant, or an indeterminate lesion 10 mm or less on the preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were included. After digital segmentation of hepatobiliary phase MRI, a transparent, 3D-printed liver model with colored anatomical structures and FLLs was produced. During the gross examination of the liver specimen, the per-lesion detection rates were compared between those without (routine protocol) and those with the aid of the 3D-printed liver model.Results:Among 98 MRI-detected FLLs (11.5 Â± 12.5 mm), the per-lesion detection rate on gross examination using the 3D-printed liver model was 99.0% (97/98), which was significantly higher than that obtained on routine examination (82.7% [81/98]; P Conclusions:A personalized, 3D-printed liver model with FLLs may improve the lesion-by-lesion imaging-pathologic matching for small FLLs, thus leading to accurate pathologic tumor staging and obtaining a reliable reference for imaging-detected FLLs.
