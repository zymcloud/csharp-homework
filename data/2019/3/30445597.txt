We investigated the efficacy of combined radiotherapy (RT) and zoledronic acid in treating painful bone metastases from gastrointestinal cancers. Sixty patients were prospectively enrolled between November 2014 and July 2016. The most common primary cancer type was hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 25), followed by colorectal cancer (n = 6). Patients received external beam RT of 30-54 Gy in 10-17 fractions or 20 Gy in 5 fractions for symptomatic bone metastases. On the first day of RT, patients received 4 mg intravenous zoledronic acid, which was repeated monthly for a total of six cycles. The mean pain score before treatment was 6.7, and it decreased to 2.8 at 1 month and 2.1 at 3 months (P
