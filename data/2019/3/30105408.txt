Objectives:To determine the methodology of non-invasive test for evaluation of liver stiffness (LS) with tumours using two-dimensional (2D) shear wave elastography (SWE).Methods:One hundred and twenty-seven patients with liver tumours underwent 2D-SWE before surgery to measure liver and spleen stiffness (SS). Two-dimensional SWE values were obtained in the liver at 0-1 cm, 1-2 cm and >2 cm from the tumour edge (PLS-1, PLS-2 and RLS, respectively). The influence of tumour-associated factors was evaluated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each value was analysed to diagnose cirrhosis.Results:PLS-1 was higher than PLS-2, which was even higher than RLS (p < 0.001). The AUCs of PLS-1, PLS-2, RLS and SS for diagnosing cirrhosis were 0.760, 0.833, 0.940 and 0.676, with the specificity of 75.7%, 67.6%, 90.3% and 77.4%, respectively. Tumour sizes, locations or types showed no apparent influence on 2D-SWE values except for RLS, which was higher in patients with primary hepatic carcinomas (p < 0.05).Conclusions:LS with tumours is best measured at >2 cm away from the tumour edge. SS measurement could be used as an alternative to LS measurement in the event of no available liver for detection.Key points:• Tumour-associated factors impact background liver stiffness assessment. • Background liver stiffness is best measured at >2 cm from tumour edge. • Spleen stiffness can be an alternative to assess background liver stiffness.
