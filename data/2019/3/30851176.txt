Background and aims:In 2009, the Danish Government instituted "Fast Track Clinical Pathways" (FTCP) to accelerate diagnosis and treatment of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined how the implementation of FTCP affected the time from referral to diagnosis and treatment as well as the patient survival.Methods:309 consecutive patients with suspected HCC were included, 79 referred during the period 2007-2008 (before FTCP) and 230 during 2009-2011. Of those, 271 (88%) were diagnosed with HCC and 161 (60%) had cirrhosis, in most cases caused by alcohol.Results:The time from referral to the first visit was reduced from a mean 16.4 (11.5) to 5.4 (6) days (pConclusions:The implementation of FTCP reduced the total time from referral to treatment by three weeks; however, without significant effects on overall mortality. While shortened waiting time is a comfort for the patient, it remains to be elucidated whether it will change the prognosis.
