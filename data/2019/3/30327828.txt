Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate the utility of fusion images of pre- and post-ablation hepatobiliary phase (HBP) series to assess the ablation margins after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). Additionally, to identify factors indicative of an adequate ablation margin and predictors of local tumor progression (LTP).Methods:Fifty-nine HCCs in 29 patients were treated by RFA and followed-up for > 1 year (mean 37.9 months). Fusion images of pre- and post-ablation HBP series were created using a non-rigid registration and manual correlation. The ablation margin appearance was classified as ablation margin + (ablation margin completely surrounding the tumor), ablation margin-zero (a partially discontinuous ablation margin without protrusion of HCC), ablation margin-(a partially discontinuous ablation margin with protrusion of HCC), and indeterminate (index tumor was not visible). The minimal ablation margin was measured, and clinical factors were examined to identify other risk factors for LTP.Results:LTP was observed at follow-up in 12 tumors. The mean minimal ablation margin was 3.6 mm. Multivariate analysis revealed that the ablation margin status was the only significant factor (p = 0.028). The cumulative LTP rates (3.3%, 3.3%, and 3.3% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively) in 30 ablation margin + nodules were significantly lower (p = 0.006) than those (20.0%, 28.0%, and 32.2% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively) in 25 ablation margin-zero nodules.Conclusions:Fusion images enable an early assessment of the ablation efficacy in the majority of HCCs. The ablation margin status is a significant factor for LTP.
