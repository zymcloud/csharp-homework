Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a biologically complex disease. Combination chemotherapy is a good strategy after surgery treatment. In this study, we report that berberine combined with HMQ1611 (BCH) had a good synergistic effect on the HCC. Our findings concluded that BCH showed good inhibition on the HCC proliferation and colony formation, which attributed to cell cycle arrest by BCH at G1 phase through impairing the expression of cyclinD1, cyclinE, and cdc2 and downregulated the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and ERK. Moreover, BCH negatively regulated Wnt signaling pathway by upregulating the Axin and inhibiting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. BCH suppressed the phosphorylation of LRP5/6, GSK3β, the expression of Wnt5a, Frizzled8, CK1, and APC, as well as the nucleus protein included MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, and c-myc. The above data of Wnt signaling regulators contributed to inhibition by BCH on cell migration. In vivo studies, BCH significantly suppressed the growth of SMMC-7721 xenograft tumors through downregulating Ki67 and β-catenin, as well as upregulating Axin and p-β-catenin. In conclusion, the results revealed that BCH exhibited potential antitumor activities against human liver cancer in vitro and in vivo, and the potential mechanism underlying these activities depended on the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
