Atypical lung carcinoids frequently metastasize to mediastinal nodes, liver, bone, lungs, and brain and rarely to ovaries, pancreas, subcutaneous, and skin. Solitary peritoneal metastasis is extremely rare and unreported previously. We present a case of a 36-year-old woman with cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea with detection of lung mass, and incidental detection of pelvic mass. Fine needle aspiration cytology failed to reveal the true nature of both the lesions. FDG PET/CT showed intensely avid mediastinal nodes, left lung, and rectouterine masses. Core biopsy from lung mass revealed atypical carcinoid without appreciable uptake on Ga-DOTANOC scan. Subsequent postchemotherapy CT scan shows significant regression in lung and peritoneal masses.
