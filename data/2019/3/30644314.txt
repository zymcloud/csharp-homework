Ramucirumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody directed selectively at VEGFR-2 - a key player in the VEGF orchestra and angiogenic process. It has demonstrated clinical efficacy and a favorable safety profile in the treatment of a number of malignancies including gastric, lung, urothelial, colorectal and, most recently, advanced liver cancer. This article describes the recent Phase III trial results of ramucirumab in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, including safety data and patient-reported outcomes, with particular emphasis on efficacy data in the patient population with baseline α-fetoprotein levels ≥400 ng/ml, traditionally considered a poor prognostic group.
