Serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) has been presented as a biomarker of liver fibrosis in several cross-sectional studies. COMP is also an essential mediator in carcinoma development and has also been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. We present a prospective analysis of this biomarker in 38 patients with chronic hepatitis C who were subject to eradication therapy with direct acting antivirals. We confirm previous studies associating COMP elevation with liver cirrhosis. We also show how viral levels are correlated with COMP at baseline. In our prospective analysis, we report that successful eradication of hepatitis C results in improvement in liver stiffness and laboratory liver function tests at 1 year follow-up. In contrast, median COMP-levels remain unchanged during the study period. We conclude that the biomarker potential of COMP in the prospective evaluation of liver diseases, remains to be elucidated.
