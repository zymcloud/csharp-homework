Aim:To assess the patterns of disease progression in advanced/metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on first-line treatment with erlotinib and identify potential prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS).Patients and methods:Patients with stage IIIB/IV EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC receiving first-line erlotinib were followed-up until 24 months after the last patient was enrolled or until premature withdrawal for any cause.Results:A total of 127 evaluable patients were enrolled. The median PFS and overall survival were 8.8 and 19.1 months, respectively. Disease progression was asymptomatic in 57.6% of patients and 53.3% developed new sites of metastasis. The presence of liver metastasis was identified as an independent prognostic factor for poor PFS.Conclusion:Metastatic progression with asymptomatic disease seems to be the predominant pattern of disease progression on first-line erlotinib in real-life practice in patients with advanced/metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Additionally, the presence of liver metastases may negatively affect PFS in these patients.
