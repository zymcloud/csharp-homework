Background:Liver cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in 2015. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. miR-1-3p plays important roles in cancer, including prostate, bladder, lung cancer, and colorectal carcinoma. The function of miR-1-3p in HCC remains poorly understood.Methods:qRT-PCR was performed to detect the miR-1-3p expression in HCC cell lines (HCCLM3, Hep3B, Bel-7404, SMMC-7721) and the normal human hepatic cell line (LO2). HCCLM3 and Bel-7404 cells were transfected with miR-1-3p mimic or scramble control followed by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay. Western bolt analysis was performed to determine the protein levels. TargetScan7.1 (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/) was used to predict the potential targets of miR-1-3p. SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (SOX9), which has been previously shown to play an important role in HCC, was found to be a target of miR-1-3p. Luciferase reporter assay was used to explore the targeting of miR-1-3p on SOX9. For in vivo tumorigenesis assay, HCCLM3 cells with stable overexpression of miR-1-3p or control plasmid were injected subcutaneously into the flank of the SCID mice and animals were monitored for tumor growth.Results:miR-1-3p was significantly downregulated in HCC cell lines (HCCLM3, Hep3B, Bel-7404, and SMMC-7721) compared to normal human hepatic cell line (LO2). Overexpression of miR-1-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in HCCLM3 and Bel-7474 cells. SOX9 was a direct target of miR-1-3p in HCC cells. Inhibition of SOX9 significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCCLM3 and Bel-7474 cells. In vivo, overexpression of miR-1-3p decreased tumor volume in a xenograft model.Conclusion:These results highlight the role of miR-1-3p in HCC. Overexpression of miR-1-3P inhibited the proliferation of HCC at least partly due to the regulation of SOX9. miR-1-3p may be a promising therapeutic candidate for HCC.
