Background:The ERBB2 oncogene hypothesis is challenged in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the conflicting evidences of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression. HER2 could be a new target as a treatment option for HCC as well as tumor recurrence after surgery. HER2 in HCC biology needs further explorations.Methods:Clinical and mRNA data of HCC patients were obtained from TCGA HCC cohort, GSE89377 and GSE115018. Western Blotting and immunohistochemistry were employed to test expression of HER2, E-cadherin, and Vimentin. In HepG2, JM1, HER2-transfected McA cells, and TGF-β cocultured JM1 cells, HCC biology, including cell survival, proliferation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes were evaluated.Results:ERBB2 mRNA amplification was found in HCC datasets, and its expression was downregulated in high grade HCC with a worse overall survival. HER2 overexpression was identified in H4IIE, HepG2, JM1 cells, and 82% (14/17) HCC samples, and tumor stage was correlated with expression of HER2, E-cadherin, and Vimentin (P Conclusion:HER2 expression pattern is linked with tumor stage and overall survival; the transforming function of HER2 is found more relevant through β-catenin and SMAD3. HER2-targeted treatment is recommended to suppress the HER2-mediated tumor growth during postoperative liver regeneration.
