Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the major causes of death worldwide due to infectious agents. The advent of direct-acting antivirals has dramatically improved the chance of HCV elimination, even for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Along with HCV cure, benefits are recognized in terms of regression of liver fibrosis and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, beyond hepatic outcomes, several extrahepatic benefits may result from sustained HCV eradication, including improvements in the neurocognitive function and reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Finally, there is no doubt that the individual success of direct-acting antivirals is largely contributing to halt HCV transmission globally, in the absence of an effective HCV prophylactic vaccine.
