Background:The aim of this study was to test the effect of TNF484 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.Materials and methods:Various doses (0, 1, 10, 50, and 100 nM) of TNF484 were applied to the HepG2 and Bel7402 cells, and cell proliferation was measured by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay after 72 h. Cell migration rate was measured using the xCELLigence system, and the cell invasion ability was examined by the three-dimensional spheroid BME cell invasion assay. The expression level of ADAM17 was also measured with RT-PCR.Results:With the treatment of TNF484, the cell proliferation of HepG2 and Bel7402 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, under TNF484 treatment, the cell migration rate as well as cell invasion ability of the HepG2 and Bel7402 cells were suppressed.Conclusion:TNF484 could inhibit the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of some HCC cell lines, making it a potential therapeutic option for liver cancer treatment.
