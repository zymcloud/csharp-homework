The objective of this study is to improve the overall prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); therefore, new therapeutic methods that can be used in vivo are urgently needed. In this study, the relationship between the quantities of microRNA (miR)-125b-5p in clinical specimens and clinicopathological parameters is analyzed. A folate-conjugated nanocarrier is used to transfect miR-125b-5p in vivo and to observe the therapeutic effect on HCC. The inhibitory effect and mechanism of miR-125b-5p on hepatoma cells are also studied. Data from clinical specimens and in vitro experiments confirm that the miR-125b-5p quantity is negatively correlated with progression, and the target protein that regulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/cancer stem cells (CSC) potential in HCC is STAT3. The miR-125b-5p/STAT3 axis inhibits the invasion, migration, and growth of HCC via inactivation of the wnt/β-Catenin pathway. miR-125b-5p-loaded nanomedicine effectively inhibits the EMT/CSC potential of hepatoma cells in vivo together with their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visualization characteristics. An HCC-therapeutic and MRI-visible nanomedicine platform that achieves noninvasive treatment effect monitoring and timely individualized treatment course adjustment is developed.
