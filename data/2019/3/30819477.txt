Purpose:To compare treatment with hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy (HAIC) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with both extrahepatic spread (EHS) and intrahepatic tumor and patients with intrahepatic tumor only.Materials and methods:This single-center retrospective study comprised 116 patients with advanced HCC with both intrahepatic tumor and EHS (EHS group; n = 50) or with intrahepatic tumor only (non-EHS group; n = 66) treated with HAIC including oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin between June 2014 and July 2016. Overall survival (OS) and radiologic responses to treatment were determined and compared between the 2 groups.Results:Both the objective response rate and the clinical benefit rate were higher in the non-EHS group than in the EHS group (37.9% vs 16% objective response rate, P = .010; 81.8% vs 62% clinical benefit rate, P = .017). Median OS was not statistically different between the 2 groups (14.8 months vs 9.8 months, P = .068). Subgroup analysis of OS found that patients with lung metastases survived for a shorter time (OS 7 months) than patients with other metastatic sites (P = .003) and patients free of metastases (P = .001).Conclusions:HAIC is a potential treatment option for advanced HCC with limited extrahepatic metastases in a population with hepatitis B virus infection.
