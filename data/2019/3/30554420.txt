Background:We sought to define the management of mixed hepatocellular carcinoma-intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-ICC) as well as characterize short- and long-term outcomes of patients with mixed HCC-ICC.Methods:Patients diagnosed with HCC-ICC, HCC, or ICC between 2004 and 2015 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes. Short- and long-term outcomes were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:Among 174 454 patients, 86.8% had HCC, 12.1% ICC, and 1.1% HCC-ICC. The incidence of lymphadenectomy was 55.6% among ICC patients vs 15.1% and 34.2% for HCC and HCC-ICC patients, respectively (P 0.2). While 42.0% of ICC patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy among HCC and HCC-ICC patients was 13.1% and 27.4%, respectively (P Conclusion:Patients who underwent resection of mixed HCC-ICC had a prognosis that was comparable to ICC, yet worse than HCC. Utilization of lymphadenectomy and adjuvant therapy were low. HCC-ICC remains a rare disease with a guarded prognosis that should be treated in a multidisciplinary setting.
