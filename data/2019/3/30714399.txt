Aim:To explore the prognostic value of the pretreatment platelet (PLT) count in patients undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials & methods:We prospectively analyzed 317 hepatitis B virus-related HCC patients undergoing TACE. Time to progression (TTP) was selected to evaluate the clinical significance of PLT level in HCC patients.Results:PLT was the only parameter showing statistical significance of all the clinical characteristics between two distinct tumor response groups. After ruling out cirrhosis as a potential major confounding factor, the conclusion was further established. Higher pretreatment PLT level, portal vessel invasion and higher stratification of Î±-fetoprotein level were independently associated with longer TTP. The prognostic score model combining the three risk factors revealed that higher risk scores might mean shorter TTP.Conclusion:The pretreatment PLT level is a potentially useful biomarker to predict the prognostic outcomes in HCC patients undergoing TACE and deserves to be further explored in subsequent works.
