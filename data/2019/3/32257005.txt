Background/purpose:Oral metastatic carcinomas are rarely found in oral soft tissues. This study reported the clinicopathological features of 13 intraoral soft tissue metastatic carcinomas.Materials and methods:A total of 13 intraoral soft tissue metastatic carcinomas were included in this study. The clinicopathological features of the 13 cases including the primary cancer site, metastatic intraoral soft tissue region, clinical presentation, and histopathological diagnoses were examined and reported.Results:The 13 intraoral soft tissue metastatic carcinomas occurred in 13 patients (11 males and 2 females) with a mean age of 59.4 (range, 39-78) years. Nine cases originated from the liver (69.2%), and one each from the colon (7.7%), pancreas (7.7%), thyroid (7.7%), and kidney (7.7%). The histopathological diagnoses of the metastatic lesions were hepatocellular carcinoma in 9 cases, adenocarcinomas in 2 cases (one each from the colon and pancreas), clear cell carcinoma of the kidney in one case, and follicular thyroid carcinoma in one case. The gingiva and alveolar mucosa were the major metastatic sites (10 cases, 76.9%), followed by the buccal mucosa (two cases, 15.4%), and soft palate (one case, 7.7%). Twelve metastatic lesions manifested as ulcerated, easy-bleeding, and pyogenic granuloma-like lesions.Conclusion:The results of our series of 13 cases indicate that intraoral soft tissue metastatic carcinomas have a male predilection with a male to female ratio of 11:2, are commonly found in the gingiva and alveolar mucosa (76.9%), present frequently as an easy-bleeding pyogenic granuloma-like lesion (92.3%). In addition, the most common primary cancer site is the liver.
