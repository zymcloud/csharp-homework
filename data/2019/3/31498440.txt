Glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDA) is closely associated with carcinogenesis and chemoresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a transcription factor, is involved in various human tumors. Whether GCDA induces chemoresistance through STAT3 and the mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, we firstly found that the expression level of STAT3 has a positive correlation with chemoresistance of HCC cells. Moreover, GCDA can upregulate the expression of STAT3 protein. Hence, we suspect that GCDA may induce chemoresistance of HCC cells via STAT3. Mechanistically, GCDA stimulates phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 site and mediates pSer727-STAT3 protein to translocate and aggregate in the nucleus, which is important for cell survival. When Ser727 of STAT3 mutated to Asp, the capacity of STAT3 to accumulate in the nucleus was attenuated, STAT3-induced cell survival was impaired and GCDA-induced chemoresistance was abolished. In addition, while activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) was inhibited by PD98059, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 induced by GCDA was suppressed. Taken together, these data demonstrate that GCDA-enhanced survival of liver cancer cells may occur through the activation of STAT3 by phosphorylation at Ser727 site via mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK1/2 pathway, which may contribute to the progression of human liver cancer and chemoresistance.
