Background:Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a sign of advanced stage disease, which is associated with poor prognosis. Liver resection (LR) may provide better prognosis in selected patients. In the present study, we aimed to assess information from HCC patients with PVTT who died within 3 months or 2 years after LR in order to identify preoperative factors correlated to short-term or long-term survival, by which inappropriate selection of patients for LR might be avoided in the future.Methods:A retrospective cohort study consisting of 487 consecutive cases of HCC patients with PVTT was performed from 2008 to 2010 at Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital. Medical records, including laboratory values, imaging results and treatment information, were obtained from participants. Study endpoints were survival at 3 months and 2 years post-hepatectomy. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the significant pre-operative factors influencing short-term or long-term survival.Results:In multivariable analysis, α-fetoprotein, total bilirubin and radiologic ascites were significantly associated with short-term survival, while α-fetoprotein level, clinical significant portal hypertension, extent of PVTT and tumor differentiation were factors significantly associated with long-term survival.Conclusions:The independent risk factors of poor short-term survival were the liver function-associated, such as factors radiologic ascites and total bilirubin, while tumor differentiation indicating the tumor biology was associated with longer-term survival. In addition, α-fetoprotein was a risk factor associated with both short-term and longer-term survivals.
