Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features, radiological findings, risk factors, and management of liver abscesses following transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy in patients with primary and metastatic liver cancer.Methods:The medical records of 163 patients who were treated with TACE in our hospital for a total of 313 times between January 2012 and January 2018 were reviewed. The incidence rate of patients who developed liver abscesses after undergoing treatment, the computed tomography findings of the abscesses, predisposing risk factors, and the method of treatment were evaluated.Results:Formation of liver abscesses was observed after treatment in four of the 163 (2.4%) patients and in four (1.3%) of the 313 chemoembolization procedures. Additionally, bilioenteric anastomosis was found in two patients and diabetes mellitus in two patients.Conclusion:Formation of liver abscesses after TACE is a rare, but serious, complication. Physicians should be aware of the predisposing risk factors of TACE because of the possibility of death.
