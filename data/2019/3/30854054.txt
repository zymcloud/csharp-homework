Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-NEF is a newly discovered lncRNA, which exhibits an inhibitory function on the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while its involvement in other types of malignancy are unknown. In the present study, tumor and adjacent healthy tissues were obtained from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and blood was obtained from patients with NSCLC and healthy individuals. Expression levels of lncRNA-NEF in tumor tissue samples, healthy tissue samples and serum were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and survival curve analysis were performed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum lncRNA-NEF for NSCLC. The effects of lncRNA-NEF overexpression in NSCLC cell lines on tumor cell proliferation, glucose uptake, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein expression and mRNA expression were investigated by Cell Counting kit-8 assay, glucose uptake assay, western blot analysis and RT-qPCR, respectively. It was identified that lncRNA-NEF was downregulated in NSCLC tissues, compared with healthy controls, and the serum level of lncRNA-NEF was negatively associated with primary tumor stage. Therefore, serum lncRNA-NEF may be a sensitive diagnostic and prognostic marker for NSCLC. Overexpression of lncRNA-NEF inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and glucose uptake, and downregulated GLUT1 expression. Therefore, it can be concluded that lncRNA-NEF can target glucose transportation to inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells.
