Background Menthol is widely used as a constituent of functional foods and chemical drugs. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression of cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4mRNA after treating human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells with menthol. We also examined the effects of pretreatment with menthol on the cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel (PAC) and vincristine (VIN), which are substrates of CYP3A4, in the cells. Methods HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium. Expression of CYP3A4 was examined by the real-time polymerase chain reaction. Survival rate of HepG2 cells was evaluated by the MTT assay. Results The gene expression level of CYP3A4 in HepG2 cells was significantly reduced by treatment with menthol for 1 day. The viability of HepG2 cells was not affected by treatment with menthol alone once a day for two consecutive days. The degree of reduction in cell viability by PAC or VIN in HepG2 cells was significantly increased by menthol treatment for 24 h prior to exposure to these anti-cancer drugs. Conclusions These results demonstrate that menthol enhanced the anti-tumor effects of PAC and VIN through the downregulation of CYP3A4 in HepG2 cells without exerting cytotoxic activity.
