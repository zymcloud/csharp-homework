Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often develops on a background of chronic inflammation and a complex immunosuppressive network with increased regulatory T cells, impaired CD8⁺ T cells and the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. Previous clinical studies have reported a superior disease-free survival (DFS) following a radiofrequency-based ablation or resection in HCC tumours compared to conventional liver resection techniques. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is any correlation with the use of a radiofrequency-assisted liver resection and clinical outcome.Material and methods:Patients' peripheral blood was collected prior and 7 days following surgery from patients undergoing a liver resection for HCC. There were 5 liver resections performed using CUSA and 6 liver resections with the RF-based device, HabibTM 4X. The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the immunological parameters of circulating immune cell populations as well as serum cytokines. The Student's t-test, chi-square or Fisher's Exact test were applied for statistical comparisons, as appropriate.Results:Patients undergoing an RF-assisted liver resection with HabibTM 4X had a significant decrease in the inhibitory Treg cells (p = 0.002) and a significant increase in CD8⁺ T lymphocytes (p = 0.050) and CD4⁺CD45RO⁺/CD4⁺ memory T cells (p = 0.002) compared to those patients undergoing a liver resection with CUSA. It was also noted that the RF-assisted liver resection group had a significant decrease in circulating TGF-ß (p = 0.000), IL10 (p = 0.000) and a significant increase in IFN-gamma (p = 0. 027) and IL-17 compared to the CUSA group.Conclusion:A liver resection with RF-based device HabibTM 4X was associated with positive immunomodulatory changes in circulating immune cells and circulating cytokines which could explain the significant improvement in DFS.
