The nanoplatform of synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy has superior advantages on antitumor. It is urgently needed to explore novel nanocarrier for improving photothermal performance in drug delivery process. Herein, we synthesized polydopamine doped mesoporous silica-coated reduced graphene oxide (rGO/MSN/PDA) by simply adding dopamine hydrochloride into the oil-water biphasic reaction system as a multifunctional drug carrier for anticancer treatment, which combines chemotherapy and photothermal therapy. The rGO/MSN/PDA showed nearly twice the photothermal conversion efficiency of mesoporous silica-coated graphene oxide (GO/MSN) due to the reduction of GO and doping with PDA. In addition, the rGO/MSN/PDA showed pH-response DOX release abilities, which means higher release of DOX in tumor cells. The cell experiments in vitro proved that rGO/MSN/PDA with better biocompatibility compare to GO/MSN might offer a promising tool for improving the therapeutic effects of hepatocellular carcinoma cells through synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy.
