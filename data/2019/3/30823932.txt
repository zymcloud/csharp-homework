Background:The effect of antiviral therapy (AVT) on clinical outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are seronegative for hepatitis B virus (HBV), defined as HBV DNA Methods:From January 2006 to January 2013, 161 HCC patients with positive serum tests for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) but negative tests for HBV DNA who had undergone hepatectomy were included and analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the heterogeneity in baseline characteristics.Results:All patients were divided into the following two groups: the AVT group (n = 73, 45.34%) and the non-AVT group (n = 88, 54.66%). HBV reactivation occurred in 20 patients in the non-AVT group (22.73%) but in only 2 patients in the AVT group (2.74%, p Conclusions:Antiviral therapy can reduce HBV reactivation but is not correlated with a significant increase in postoperative RFS and OS in HCC patients with HBV DNA levels
