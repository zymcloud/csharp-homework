Chemotherapy has been the standard for cancer therapy, but the nonspecific cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents and drug resistance of tumor cells has limited its efficacy. However, multidrug combination therapy and targeting therapy have resulted in enhanced anticancer effects and have become increasingly important strategies in clinical applications. In this study, a biotin-/lactobionic acid-modified poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) (BLPP) copolymer was synthesized, and curcumin- and 5-fluorouracil-loaded nanoparticles (BLPPNPs/C + F) were prepared to enhance the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Blank BLPPNPs were shown to have great biocompatibility via both in vitro and in vivo studies. Good targeting of tumor cells of BLPPNPs was confirmed by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and biodistribution. The synergistic anticancer effects of BLPPNPs/C + F were demonstrated by cytotoxicity and animal studies, while western blotting was used to further verify the synergistic effect of curcumin and 5-fluorouracil. The dual-targeting and drug-loaded codelivery nanosystem demonstrated higher cellular uptake and stronger cytotoxicity for tumor cells. Therefore, these dual-targeting NPs are a promising codelivery carrier that could be made available for cellular targeting of anticancer drugs to achieve better intracellular delivery and synergistic anticancer efficacy.
