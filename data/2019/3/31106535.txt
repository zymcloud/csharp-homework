Objective:To explore the regulatory function of long intergenic non-coding RNA LINC ROR that contained within hepatocarcinoma cells-derived exosomes.Methods:The physiological appearance of exosomes isolated from PLC/PRF/5 cells was examined by using differential ultracentrifugation and the images were captured by transmission electron microscopy. The internalization of exosomes by THP-1 cells was examined via laser-scanning confocal microscopy. The expression of LINC ROR was analyzed through qRT-PCR. The expression of interleukin (IL) -1β was examined by ELISA.Results:Exosomes were found spherical and the diameters mainly distribute around 100 nm. LINC ROR can be transferred by tumor derived exosomes to macrophages. Exosomes isolated from PLC/PRF/5 cells significantly expressed higher levels of LINC ROR. Suppression of LINC ROR by siRNA significantly increased the release of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β) in THP-1 cell upon LPS stimulation.Conclusion:LINC ROR from hepatocarcinoma cell-derived exosomes plays an important role in regulating the inflammation of macrophages.
