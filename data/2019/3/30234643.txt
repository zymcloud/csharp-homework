The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a widespread comprehensive system for standardising the reporting and data collection of liver imaging to standardise chronic liver disease evaluation. However, the LI-RADS, based on the identification of some categories of lesions by means of a conceptual and nonquantitative probability approach, has many limitations. In fact, recently, the European Association for the Study of the Liver Guidelines regarding the management of hepatocellular carcinoma did not accept the LI-RADS. The aim of this paper was to critically analyse the LI-RADS, focusing on some interesting issues such as the absence of a clear distinction between two different imaging modalities (computed tomography and MRI), the lack of validation of some major features, the assessment of its ancillary features and its complexity. Despite these limitations, the LI-RADS represents a great opportunity for the radiological community. We must not let it escape, but time and experience are necessary for its improvement.
