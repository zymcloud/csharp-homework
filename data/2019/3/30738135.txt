Recent studies have reported the positive association between exposure to insecticides and increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, it is not known if insecticide exposure can contribute to NAFLD. Thus, the goal of the current study was to determine if insecticide exposures can exacerbate the physiological conditions of NAFLD by modulating hepatic lipid metabolism. The effects of 12 insecticides on triglycerides (TG) accumulation were tested using palmitic acid (PA)-induced HepG2 hepatoma steatosis model. Results showed that among tested insecticides, permethrin and ivermectin significant interacted with palmitic acid to potentiate (permethrin) or decrease (ivermectin) TG accumulation. Further study showed that permethrin significantly promoted fatty acid synthesis, while suppressed lipid oxidation-related genes only under steatosis conditions. In comparison, ivermectin inhibited lipogenesis-related genes and promoted farnesoid X receptor, which upregulates fatty acid oxidation. Results in this study suggested that hepatic lipid metabolism may be more susceptible to insecticide exposure in the presence of excessive fatty acids, which can be associated with the development of NAFLD.
