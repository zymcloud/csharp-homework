Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs in the progression of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) promotes the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. However, the correlation between SULT2B1b and the EMT in hepatocytes has not yet been addressed. The present study demonstrated that the SULT2B1b overexpression promoted the EMT process in mouse primary hepatocytes in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 treatment. Moreover, SULT2B1b interference suppressed the EMT and attenuated the migration and invasion abilities of human hepatocarcinoma BEL-7402 cells by inhibiting the activation of the β-catenin/MMP-7 pathway. In summary, SULT2B1b enhanced the EMT of hepatocytes and promoted the migration and invasion abilities of BEL-7402 cells by activing the β-catenin/MMP-7 pathway. Therefore, inhibition of SULT2B1b has therapeutic potential for the treatment of HCC.
