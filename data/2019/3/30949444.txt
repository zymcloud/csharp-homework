Background:Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is a gene that regulates tumor survival, neovascularization and invasion. Overexpression of HIF-1α correlates with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RO7070179 is a HIF-1α inhibitor that decreases HIF-1α mRNA and its downstream targets, it could be a potential treatment in HCC.Aim:To evaluate safety and preliminary activity of RO7070179 in patients with previously treated HCC, with focus on a patient with prolonged response to RO7070179.Methods:In the preclinical study of RO7070179 in a HCC xenograft model, the mice were separated into 4 groups with each group received doses of 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg for total 10 doses. HCC patients who failed at least one line of systemic treatment, received RO7070179 as a weekly infusion, each cycle is 6 wk. We evaluated the safety and HIF-1α mRNA levels of RO7070179.Results:Preclinical evaluation of RO7070179 in orthotopic HCC xenograft model showed no significant differences in HCC tumor weight between the 3 and 10 mg/kg groups. However, dose of 10 mg/kg of RO7070179, has shown 76% reduction of the amount of HIF-1α mRNA in HCC tissue. In the phase 1b study of RO7070179 in previously treated HCC patients, 8 out of 9 were evaluable: 1 achieved PR and 1 SD. The patient with PR responded after 2 cycles treatments, which has been maintained for 12 cycles. This patient also showed reduction in perfusion of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) after 1 cycle of treatment. After 1 cycle of treatment, both patients with PR and SD showed decrease in HIF-1α mRNA at the root of biopsies (each biopsy was divided into 2 specimens, the tip and the root).Conclusion:RO7070179 can reduce HIF-1α mRNA level in HCC patients with SD or PR. It is well tolerated at 10 mg/kg, with transaminitis as the dose of increased toxicity. This study indicates that RO7070179 might benefit HCC patients, and an early signal for clinical benefit can potentially be predicted through changes in either mRNA level or DCE-MRI within 1 cycle of therapy.
