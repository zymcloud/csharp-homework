Background:Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases-4 (MKP-4) is reported to exert a prognostic merit in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been clearly defined.Methods:Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) approach was used to identify interactive proteins with MKP-4. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were employed to detect proteins in HCC tissues. Cell counting kit-8, colony formation, Edu incorporation and sphere formation assays were performed to investigate functions of MKP-4/ERK1/2 interaction. Tumor xenografts in nude mice were used to determine effects in vivo.Results:Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) were identified as binding partners of MKP-4. Knockdown of MKP-4 increased cell proliferation and cancer stem cell (CSC) traits while upregulation of MKP-4 or pre-incubation with ERK1/2 inhibition reversed these effects. Mechanistically MKP-4 negatively regulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and reduced expressions of CyclinD1 and c-Myc. Both xenograft tumor models and clinical analysis of HCC patients indicated that lower expression of MKP-4 and higher expressions of ERK1/2 were associated with worse prognosis.Conclusions:MKP-4-mediated dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 might serve as a novel tumor-suppressive mechanism and provide a potential therapy for HCC.
