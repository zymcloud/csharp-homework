MIR210HG is a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) and has been found to be overexpresed in osteosarcoma and glioma. However, the level of MIR210HG and its clinical significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not well known. In results of our research, MIR210HG expression was increased in HCC tissue samples and cells compared with paired adjacent normal liver tissue samples and normal liver cell line respectively, and a good marker to discriminate HCC tissues from non-tumorous tissues. MIR210HG high-expression was correlated advanced clinical stage, big tumor size, present vascular invasion and unfavorable histological differentiation. The survival analysis from our cohort and TCGA cohort consistently suggested that HCC patients with MIR210HG high-expression had poorer prognosis than HCC patients with MIR210HG low-expression. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that MIR210HG high-expression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC patients. The in vitro study showed that silencing of MIR210HG depressed HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In conclusion, MIR210HG functions as an oncogenic lncRNA in HCC, and may be a potential biomarker for predicting clinical progression and prognosis.
