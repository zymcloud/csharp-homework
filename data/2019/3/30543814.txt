NLRC5, a newly discovered member of the NLR family, has been reported to regulate immune responses and promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, to date, the potential regulatory roles and molecular mechanisms by which NLRC5 affects the development and progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remain largely unknown. In this study, human clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed that increased NLRC5 expression was associated with advanced stage and poor prognosis in ccRCC patients. Moreover, experimental results showed that NLRC5 is aberrantly overexpressed in human ccRCC tissues and cell lines. Depletion of NLRC5 attenuated ccRCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and suppressed ccRCC growth in a nude mouse model. By contrast, overexpression of NLRC5 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ccRCC cells in vitro. Additionally, NLRC5 expression is not only positively correlated with β-catenin but also coordinates the activation of the downstream Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. Together, our data suggest that NLRC5 may be a potential therapeutic target for ccRCC therapy.
