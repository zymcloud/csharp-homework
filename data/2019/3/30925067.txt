Purpose:Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with breast cancer present with up-front metastasis and carry a poor prognosis (5-year survival rates of approximately 20%). To date, little is known about the long-term outcome of patients with metastatic breast cancer from developing nations.Materials and methods:We performed an ambispective review of approximately 1,800 patients who were registered in breast cancer clinics between January 2012 and August 2018. Approximately 410 (22.8%) patients presented with up-front metastasis. Out of 410, 375 were considered for additional analysis. Clinical, pathologic, and radiologic details were obtained from the medical records.Results:Median age of presentation was 49 years (range, 22 to 80 years), and median duration of symptoms was 6 months (interquartile range, 3-12 months). Baseline receptor status suggested that 234 patients (62.4%) were hormone receptor (HR) positive, 145 (38.6%) were human epidermal growth factor receptor positive, and 69 (18.6%) had triple-negative breast cancer. Various sites of metastasis were: visceral 219 (58.4%), bone only 100 (26.7%), nonregional lymph node metastasis 21 (5.6%), brain 10 (2.7%), and others 25 (5.8%). Approximately 309 patients (82.4%) received up-front chemotherapy, 192 HR-positive patients (82.1%) received endocrine therapy, and 78 human epidermal growth factor receptor-positive patients (53.8%) received targeted agents. Median progression-free survival was 14.2 months (95% CI, 12.7 to 16.8 months), and median overall survival (OS) was 31.7 months (95% CI, 25.8 to 38.2 months) for the cohort. Median time of follow-up was 22.2 months. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, HR-positive disease, good performance status (0 or 1), and oligometastasis were associated with better OS, whereas triple-negative breast cancer and liver and brain metastasis were associated with inferior OS.Conclusion:This is the first comprehensive study, to our knowledge, of metastatic breast cancer from India. HR-positive status, oligometastasis, and good performance status were associated with better outcomes.
