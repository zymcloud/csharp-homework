Idiopathic copper toxicosis (ICT) is characterized by marked copper deposition, Mallory-Denk body (MDB) formation and severe hepatic injury. Although the characteristics are apparently different from Wilson disease, large amounts of copper accumulate in the liver of the patients. We extensively treated a patient with ICT to reduce the body copper, however, the patient needed liver transplantation. Previous liver biopsy revealed high copper content. But extirpated liver contained an extremely small amount of copper, although MDBs and severe inflammation remained. These phenomena suggest abnormal copper metabolism is not the principle cause of ICT but some other abnormality must exist.
