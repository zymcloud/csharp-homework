The severity of liver fibrosis can be noninvasively evaluated by measuring liver stiffness (LS) using transient elastography. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of achieving low liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in patients with cirrhosis confirmed from the resected liver due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 184 patients that received curative surgery for HCC related to the hepatitis B virus at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0⁻A, and had a METAVIR fibrosis score of 4 were investigated. LSM significantly decreased after antiviral therapy during follow-up (p = 0.001), and achieving LSM ≤8 kilopascal (kPa) suggested a reduced risk of late recurrence (>12 months) (hazard ratio (HR), 0.519; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.307⁻0.877; p = 0.014). Older age at surgery (≥45 years) and multiple HCC nodules predicted an increased risk of late recurrence (HR, 3.270; 95% CI, 1.296⁻8.251; p = 0.012; and HR, 3.146; 95% CI, 1.396⁻7.089; p = 0.006). Decreased LSM also suggested decreased mortality (HR, 0.251; 95% CI, 0.086⁻0.756; p = 0.045) along with baseline low aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score (<1.5) (HR, 0.251; 95% CI, 0.086⁻0.759; p = 0.041). Having early HCC recurrence (HR, 9.416; 95% CI, 3.566⁻24.861; p < 0.001) and microvascular tumor invasion (HR, 3.191; 95% CI, 1.188⁻8.568; p = 0.021) predicted increased mortality. Among HCC patients with liver cirrhosis under antiviral therapy, achieving low LSM (≤8 kPa) predicted reduced late HCC recurrence.
