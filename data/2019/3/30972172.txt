Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) carries genetic information consistent with tumor cells and has potential value for molecular diagnosis of tumors. The present study analysed the gene mutations of plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and tumor tissue DNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and explored the clinical application value of plasma cfDNA as a tumor marker in HCC molecular diagnosis. Samples from 29 patients with primary HCC were collected. Hotspot mutations in 50 tumor-associated genes were analysed using amplicon sequencing technology and gene loci with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) >1% were analysed. 35 mutant genes in total were detected by deep sequencing method of which the genes with maximum mutation frequencies were TP53, ATM, and ALK. In addition, a total of 21 patients were found to have a consistent gene mutation in plasma cfDNA and tumor tissue DNA and 17 cases had consistent gene mutations in the paracancerous tissue and tumor tissue DNA. Further analysis showed that the MAFs in the TP53, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, and CDKN2A genes were higher in patients with tumor diameters >5 cm than those with tumor diameters <5 cm. And the MAFs in the TP53, RET, FGFR3 and APC genes were significantly higher in patients with multiple tumors or with metastasis than in single tumor patients. In conclusion, amplicon sequencing technology is highly sensitive for the detection of mutant genes in the plasma cfDNA of HCC patients. Plasma cfDNA might be an effective molecular marker for HCC molecular diagnosis.
