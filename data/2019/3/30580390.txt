The present document describes the SIUMB (Italian Society of Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology) guidelines for the use of ultrasound in the management of focal liver disease. The aim of the paper is to provide a clinical practice guideline for Italian physicians who are approaching the ultrasound study of a focal liver lesion. In particular, these guidelines provide simple indications, recommendations and general practice advices for the correct use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in this scenario. They represent the SIUMB position of the ultrasound role in the diagnostic flow charts of the principal focal liver lesions, and are in agreement with other, previously published national and international guidelines.
