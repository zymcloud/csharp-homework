Ethnopharmacological relevance:Luffa cylindrica (L.) M.Roem. has been recognized as traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases like inflammatory diseases, diarrhea and viral infections. The usual parts used include fruit, seeds and leaves.Aim of the study:To evaluate the anticancer activity of the hot water extract of the whole plant of Luffa cylindrica using circulating tumor cells and cancer stem cells isolated from the peripheral blood of hepatocellular carcinoma patients in vitro.Materials and methods:Seventy five adult patients who reported as stage II and III Hepatocellular carcinoma were selected. Blood samples were withdrawn and the circulating tumor cells were isolated from the whole blood. Tumor cells and cancer stem cells were detected and isolated by flow cytometric techniques. The isolated cell types were cultured and propagated in the tissue culture facility, the extract was tested on the isolated cells.Results:Luffa cylindrica hot water extract has shown cytotoxic activity against circulating tumor cells of hepatocellular carcinoma especially the cells sub-population CD133+/CD44+ with little effect among CD133+/CD44- sub-population.Conclusion:Hot water extract of Luffa cylindrica whole plant could decrease the ratio of cancer stem cells in blood of HCC patients and may be used to minimize recurrence and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
