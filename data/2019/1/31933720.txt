Background:Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) has been reported to play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Although there is evidence on HOTAIR being associated with HCC progression, the underlying mechanism remains to be further clarified.Methods:HOTAIR, miR-214-3p and FLOT1 expression were measured by quantitative real-time PCR or western blot. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were displayed by transwell assay, MTT, and colony formation assay. The relationship between HOTAIR, miR-214-3p, and FLOT1 was investigated by luciferase reporter assay. Tumor suppressive effect of HOTAIR was displayed by HepG2 xenografting to nude mice.Results:HOTAIR and FLOT1 expression were significantly up-regulated, whereas miR-214-3p was obviously down-regulated. Also, down-regulation of HOTAIR and FLOT1 as well as up-regulation of miR-214-3p inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. Intriguingly, the effects of miR-214-3p overexpression on HCC cells were rescued by high expression of HOTAIR. Otherwise, HOTAIR regulated FLOT1 expression through targeting miR-214-3p in HCC cells. Simultaneously, low HOTAIR expression inhibited FLOT1 expression by up-regulating miR-214-3p, which suppressed tumor growth in vivo.Conclusion:HOTAIR expression indirectly regulated FLOT1 expression through endogenous competition with miR-214-3p. HOTAIR/miR-214-3p/FLOT1 axis affected the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC.
