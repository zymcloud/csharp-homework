Polycomb group family is a class of proteins that have important roles in both physiological and pathological processes, and its family member Chromobox homolog 8 (CBX8) regulates cell differentiation, aging, and cell cycle progression in numerous carcinomas; however, the effects and underlying mechanisms of CBX8 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rarely reported. We found that CBX8 expression in clinical HCC specimens correlates inversely with patient survival. In HCC cells, we found that enforced overexpression of CBX8 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasive migration, and stem cell-like traits, which are associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Conversely, CBX8 silencing inhibits the aggressive phenotype of HCC cells that have high CBX8 expression. Mechanistically, CBX8 modulates H3K27me3 in the gene promoter of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), which is associated with active BMP4 transcription and, consequently, the activation of Smads and mitogen-activated protein kinases. BMP4 expression reverses the effects of CBX8 silencing in inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, stemness, and metastasis. Our results establish CBX8 as a critical driver of HCC stem cell-like and metastatic behaviors and characterize its role in modulating BMP4 expression. These findings have implications for the targeting of CBX8 as an approach to HCC prognosis and treatment.
