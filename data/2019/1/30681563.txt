This study was aimed to estimate the survival rate characteristics of 2887 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in the single-center and identify useful prognostic factors to help in the clinical management of patients with HCC.Two thousand eight hundred eighty-seven patients diagnosed with HCC at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, China, between January 2002 and December 2015 were involved.The causes and baseline characteristics were summarized. Median survival time was 9.0 (20.0) months. Overall, HCC patients showed 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates equal to 49.3%, 35.3%, 26.6%, and19.5% respectively. The median survival time of HCC patients first hospitalized in 2009 to 2015 was higher than those in 2002 to 2008. The results showed that the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage and Tumor size were independent prognostic factors to HCC patients.The survival rate of HCC patients has increased in recent years, but the overall survival rate and the prognosis were poor.
