Transcriptional coactivators represent critical components of the transcriptional pre-initiation complex and are required for efficient gene activation. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC1) family differentially regulate hepatitis b virus (HBV) biosynthesis. Whereas PGC1α has been shown to be a potent activator of HBV biosynthesis, PGC1β only very poorly activates HBV RNA and DNA synthesis in human hepatoma (HepG2) and embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells. Furthermore, PGC1β inhibits PGC1α-mediated HBV biosynthesis. These observations suggest that a potential competition between human hepatoma (HepG2) and embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells PGC1α and PGC1β for common transcription factor target(s) may regulate HBV transcription and replication in a context and signal transduction pathway dependent manner.
