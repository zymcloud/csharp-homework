Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells play a key role maintaining the hepatic homeostasis, the disruption of which is associated with such end-stage liver diseases as hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. In the present study we investigated the role of brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), a chromatin remodeling protein, in regulating endothelial transcription and the implication in liver fibrosis. We report that endothelial-specific deletion of BRG1 in mice attenuated liver fibrosis induced by injection with thioacetamide (TAA). Coincidently, alleviation of liver fibrosis as a result of endothelial BRG1 deletion was accompanied by an up-regulation of eNOS activity and NO bioavailability. In cultured endothelial cells, exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) suppressed eNOS activity whereas BRG1 depletion with small interfering RNA restored eNOS-dependent NO production. Further analysis revealed that BRG1 was recruited to the caveolin-1 (CAV1) promoter by Sp1 and activated transcription of CAV1, which in turn inhibited eNOS activity. Mechanistically, BRG1 interacted with the H3K4 trimethyltransferase MLL1 to modulate H3K4 trimethylation surrounding the CAV1 promoter thereby contributing to LPS-induced CAV1 activation. In conclusion, our data unveil a novel role for BRG1 in the regulation of endothelial function and liver fibrosis.
