Background:The role of laparoscopically anatomical resection (LAR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear due to the more demanding technique required in laparoscopy. This study is to analyze the clinical impact of LAR compared to laparoscopically non-anatomical resection (LNAR) for HCC.Methods:All patients received laparoscopic hepatectomy for HCC (diameter 5-10 cm) from January 2015 to December 2018 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into LAR and LNAR groups. The perioperative and oncological outcomes were evaluated based on propensity score matching (PSM) method.Results:After PSM, 51 patients in each group were enrolled. The operative time in LAR group was longer (240 vs 195.0 min, p = 0.012) and blood loss was more (200.0 vs 150.0 mL, p = 0.030) than those of LNAR group, respectively. The total complication rates were comparable between them (21.6% vs 17.6%, p = 0.500). The 3-year overall survival rates were 59.4% in LAR group and 38.7% in LNAR group, respectively (p = 0.045). The 3-year disease-free survival rates were 52.3% in LAR group and 27.0% in LNAR group, respectively (p = 0.042).Conclusion:LAR could be feasibly performed with comparable perioperative outcomes and contributed to improve long-term survival in patients with HCC (diameter 5-10 cm) when compared to LNAR.
