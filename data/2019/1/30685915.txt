Since the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up, earth-shattering development has taken place in all walks of life across the country. Research field on the prevention and treatment of chronic hepatitis B has been rewarding after 40 years of trials and tribulations. Additionally, hepatitis B vaccination program and effective antiviral therapy has amazingly reduced the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection. Coupled with the literary evidence, a consensus has gradually emerged in the field of anti-HBV treatment that "high potency, low incidence of drug resistance and immunomodulation coexists". We believe that in the near future, according to the principle of "prevention first, prevention with treatment", universal vaccination program for infants, vaccination of high-risk groups, active treatment of HBV carriers and chronic hepatitis B patients, and the realization of "early screening, diagnosis and treatment" of hepatocellular carcinoma will eradicate HBV infection.
