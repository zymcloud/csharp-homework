Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization TACE is an effective treatment for stage BCLC-B hepatocellular carcinoma (1). The development of skin lesions in the supraumbilical region is an unusual complication following this procedure. We report the case of an 80-year-old male with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension PHT (Child-Pugh A) and multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient had already undergone four radiofrequency ablations, one alcoholization procedure and four TACEs via femoral access.
