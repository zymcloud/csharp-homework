Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has recently been recognized as an important etiology contributing to the increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD, characterized by fat accumulation in the liver, is affecting at least one-third of the global population. The more aggressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis and inflammation. The development of effective approaches for disease prevention and/or treatment heavily relies on deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying NAFLD to HCC development. However, this has been largely hampered by the lack of robust experimental models that recapitulate the full disease spectrum. This review will comprehensively describe the current in vitro and mouse models for studying NAFLD/NASH/HCC, and further emphasize their applications and possible future improvement for better understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the cascade of NAFLD to HCC progression.
