BACKGROUND Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators in human disease, including cancers. LncRNA MIR22HG has been shown to inhibit the progression of endometrial carcinoma, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its role in gastric cancer is unclear. This study investigated MIR22HG effects on gastric cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Gastric cancer tissues (n=43) and adjacent normal tissues (n=21) were collected. Patients' 5-year overall survival rate was analyzed. Human normal gastric mucosal cell line (GES-1) and gastric cancer cell lines (MKN-45, AGS, SGC-7901) were cultured. AGS and MKN-45 cells were transfected by pcDNA3 empty vector, pcDNA3-MIR22HG overexpression vector, MIR22HG siRNA and its negative control, NOTCH2 siRNA and its negative control, respectively. Proliferation was explored by CCK-8 assay. Migration and invasion were explored by Transwell. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to investigate mRNA and proteins expression, respectively. RESULTS MIR22HG expression was decreased in gastric cancer tissues and cells (P
