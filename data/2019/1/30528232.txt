Apoptosis stimulated protein of p53-2 (ASPP2) induces the transcription of p53-targeted genes to stimulates its pro-apoptosis function. The poor chemotherapeutic sensitivity is associated with the decreased ASPP2 expression in many human cancers. Here, multiple genes real-time RT-PCR array and western blotting analysis show that ASPP2 suppress the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), determinant of chemoresistance in cancer, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a p53-independent manner. Further experiments with ASPP2-rAd and ASPP2-Lv confirmed that ASPP2 enhanced sensitivity of sorafenib to HCC via suppressing XIAP expression. XIAP mainly found on the cytoplasm and perinuclear areas of ASPP2 over-expressed HepG2 cells, while both cytoplasm and nucleus in ASPP2 shut down HepG2 cells. The association of poor sensitivity of sorafenib and XIAP expression was also found both in ASPP2 shut down and overexpress mice, where liver tissue with decreased or increased ASPP2 displayed less or more apoptosis, respectively. Finally, ASPP2 and XIAP expression analyzed in 43 hepatocellular carcinoma tumors and 44 adjacent normal tissues from 38 hepatocellular carcinoma patients for fully understand their expression within HCC patients. Compared with the tumor tissues, ASPP2 mRNA levels were increased, and XIAP levels decreased in the adjacent normal tissues. Taken together, XIAP suppressed ASPP2 increased tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy in a p53-independent manner, which was associated with chemotherapy resistance, suggesting that p53 activation and XIAP suppression were two independent ways that ASPP2 enhance the sensitivity of chemotherapy.
