Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) is an uncommon neoplasm which can clinico-radiologically mimic carcinoma. But the management of these patients differs from that of a carcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) serves as a potential tool to identify pancreatic lymphomas and thus prevent an invasive diagnostic test. This case report describes the presentation and diagnosis of primary pancreatic lymphoma. A 37-year-old female presented with nausea, vomiting with signs of icterus and elevated liver function test and Bilirubin. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a hypodense lesion in the head of the pancreas. EUS guided FNA was performed and cytological material was collected. The lesion was diagnosed as Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and subtyped as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-germinal centre (DLBCL-GCB) base on immunohistochemistry on cell block. The patient was started on rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (RCHOP) regimen. EUS guided FNA along with ROSE, cell bock, and immunocytochemistry helps in the diagnosis of primary pancreatic lymphoma.
