Objective:To examine population-based cancer survival trends in Kuwait; to facilitate public assessment of cancer control.Methods:Data were obtained from the Kuwait Cancer Registry for Kuwaiti adults (15-99 years) and children (0-14 years) diagnosed with one of 18 common cancers during 2000-2013 and followed up to 31 December 2014. Net survival was estimated at 1, 3, and 5 years by sex. To control for background mortality, life tables of all-cause mortality in the general population were constructed by single year of age, sex, and calendar year of death ("complete" life tables). Net survival estimates were age-standardised using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights.Results:Cancers with the highest net survival throughout the 14-year period were prostate, breast (women) and rectum in adults, and lymphoma in children. Survival was lowest for liver, pancreas and lung cancer in adults, and brain tumours in children. During 2010-2013, one year survival was over 80% for cancers of the prostate, breast, rectum, cervix and colon. Five-year survival was above 80% only for prostate cancer. For children, one and five-year survival was above 80% only for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoma. Survival was generally higher for women than men, and declined faster in women than men between 1 and 3 years after diagnosis. Differences between boys and girls were small.Conclusion:Cancer survival improved for most Kuwaiti adults and children over the 14-year period, with women generally having a more favourable prognosis than men. Continuous surveillance is required to monitor cancers for which survival did not improve, and to dissect the underlying causes for the differences in survival between Kuwait and other countries.
