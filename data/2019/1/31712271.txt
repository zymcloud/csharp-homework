Background:Incidence rates for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) vary considerably by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We assessed whether the underlying reasons for variations in HCC among subgroups of the population by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and birth cohort are uniform or whether they interact with one another or have changed over time.Methods:Data were from the U.S. Cancer Statistics registry. We assessed annual trends within population subgroups and examined for secular trends in the male-to-female ratio for HCC incidence. We used joinpoint regression to compute annual percent change and average annual percent change (AAPC) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also used age-period-cohort models to disentangle period and cohort effects.Results:Between 2001 and 2015, HCC rates increased in men and women â‰¥50 years, remained stable among women ages 40 to 49 years, but decreased among males ages 40 to 44 years (AAPC = -2.47%; 95% CI, -3.15% to -1.80%) and 45 to 49 years (AAPC = -3.49%; 95% CI, -4.78% to -2.17%). As a result, the male-to-female incidence rate ratio (IRR) among persons aged Conclusions:As a result of decreasing incidence among males aged Impact:The sex and racial disparities and strong birth cohort effect on HCC risk identified in this study have important implications for population-based HCC prevention efforts.
