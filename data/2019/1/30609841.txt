Blockade of the immunosuppressive checkpoint receptors cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) or programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its cognate ligand, programmed death 1 ligand (PD-L1), has altered the landscape of anti-tumor immunotherapy. B7 family and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily play a crucial role in T cell activation, tolerance, and anergy through co-stimulatory and inhibitory signal transduction. Investigating the immune molecular landscapes of the B7 and TNFR families is critical in defining the promising responsive candidates. Herein, we performed comprehensive alteration analysis of the B7 and TNFR family genes across six hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) datasets with over 1000 patients using cBioPortal TCGA data. About 16% of patients had both B7 and TNFR gene alterations. TNFR gene amplifications were relatively more common (1.73⁻8.82%) than B7 gene amplifications (1.61⁻2.94%). Analysis of 371 sequenced samples revealed that all genes were upregulated: B7 and TNFR mRNA were upregulated in 23% of cases (86/371) and 28% of cases (105/371), respectively. Promoter methylation analysis indicated an epigenetic basis for B7 and TNFR gene regulation. The mRNA levels of B7 and TNFR genes were inversely correlated with promoter methylation status. B7-H6 expression was significantly associated with worse overall survival, and B7-H6 mRNA was increased gradually in cases with gene copy number alterations. B7-H6 overexpression was associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and poor prognosis in HCC. Downregulation of B7-H6 in HCC cells significantly inhibited cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of B7-H6 in HCC cells inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. B7-H6 promoted HCC metastasis via induction of MMP-9 expression and STAT3 activation. B7-H6 and STAT3 performed functional overlapping roles on enhancing the MMP-9 promoter activity in HCC cells. These results suggest that alterations of the immunologic co-stimulator B7 and TNFR families correlate with HCC metastasis and prognosis, and especially B7-H6 plays a critical role in promoting metastasis of HCC.
