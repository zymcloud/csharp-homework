Background:The present study was carried out to prepare multi-herbal combination via comparing antioxidant activity and polyphenolic composition of five medicinal plant extracts of Punica granatum L., Putranjiva roxburghii Wall., Swertia chirata Buch.-Ham., Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers and Trigonella corniculata L.Methods:The herbs were individually evaluated using in vitro antioxidant assays and analyzed by HPLC-PDA. The resultant data was examined using principal component analysis (PCA). Further, herbal combination was prepared on the basis of PCA.Results:The PCA divided the plants into three groups. The leading or primary group contained P. granatum and P. roxburghii with the highest antioxidant activity strongly correlated with high amount of kaempferol. S. chirata was acknowledged as nourisher herb in one and T. cordifolia and T. corniculata were identified as stimulator herbs in other group. The herbal combination exhibited high antioxidant activity as compared to the individual plants. The combination revealed good antiproliferative efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells with IC50 of 75.864 Î¼g/ml.Conclusions:The activity observed in vitro with HepG2 cells suggests that the herbal combination can provide therapeutic activity in vivo in future. The study may provide information regarding precise preparation of multi-herbal formulations using PCA as a tool in pharmaceutical industries.
