Background:Measures of skeletal muscle abnormalities are rapidly emerging as independent predictors of outcomes after liver transplantation (LT). We describe a simple, novel assessment of myosteatosis acquired prior to liver transplantation using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) derived fat fraction.Methods:A retrospective longitudinal cohort study included clinical and biochemical data from patients who underwent liver transplantation at our institution between Feb 2008 and Aug 2014. Patients transplanted for a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded from the study. The fat fraction of erector spinae muscles was estimated using MRI at the level where muscle volume was highest, with myosteatosis defined at a cut-off value of 0.8.Results:180 patients were included. At baseline, those with myosteatosis were, on average, older, more likely to be female, and more likely to receive a multi-organ transplant (p Conclusion:This preliminary study suggests myosteatosis, as measured by fat fraction on MRI prior to LT, may be associated with increased graft loss and mortality after transplant.
