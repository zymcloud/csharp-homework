BACKGROUND Iodine-125 interstitial brachytherapy (125I-IBT) is a promising treatment option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study evaluated the usefulness of micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (micro-PET/CT) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in assessing response to 125I-IBT in HCC HepG2 xenograft. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve mice with bilateral HepG2 xenografts were divided into 3 equal groups implanted with iodine-125 seeds into the left xenografts with a dose of 30, 50, and 80 Gy, respectively, and the right xenografts were used as internal controls. Before and 28 days after treatment, the 18F-FDG micro-PET/CT was performed. The ratios of left to right xenografts of tumor volume (RTV), maximum standardized uptake value (RSUVmax), mean optical density of caspase-3 expression (RMODcaspase-3), and apoptosis index (RAI) were compared. RESULTS The RTV means of the 50 and 80 Gy groups were significantly lower than in the 30 Gy group after treatment (P
