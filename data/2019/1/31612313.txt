Increasing evidence demonstrates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the development and progression of human cancers. LncRNA LINC00470 has been reported to function as an oncogene in glioblastoma. Until now, the roles and underlying mechanisms of LINC00470 in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Here, we found that LINC00470 was upregulated in HCC cells and tissues. High-level LINC00470 was significantly correlated with bigger tumor size, advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Functional studies showed that knockdown of LINC00470 expression inhibited HCC cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, while overexpression of LINC00470 showed the opposite effects. Further investigation suggested that LINC00470 was associated with NF45/NF90 complex and increased its interaction with cyclin E1 mRNA, thus inhibiting the degradation of cyclin E1 mRNA. Additionally, knockdown of cyclin E1 in LINC00470-overexpressed cells abolished its promotive effects on HCC cell proliferation. In summary, our findings suggest that targeting LINC00470 could be a potential therapeutic approach in treating HCC patients.
