The essential oil of 'Gannanzao' orange peel was extracted by hydrodistillation, and the extraction conditions were optimized by Box⁻Behnken response surface methodology. The components of essential oil were analyzed by GC-MS. Thirty-nine different components were detected, accounting for 99.59% of the total oil. Limonene (88.07%) was the prominent component. The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: liquid material ratio of 8.4:1 (mL/g), sodium chloride concentration of 5.3%, and distillation time of 3.5 h. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay showed that 'Gannanzao' orange peel essential oil had good dose-dependent inhibition effect on the proliferation of HepG2 hepatoma cells and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. When the concentration of the essential oil was 0.6 μL/mL or higher, the viability rate of both cancer cells became lower than 13.0%. The transwell assay indicated the essential oil can inhibit migration of both cancer cells at the concentration of 0.3 μL/mL.
