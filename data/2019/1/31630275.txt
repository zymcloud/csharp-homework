Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major public health issue in Africa. In Tunisia, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to be an important risk factor for HCC in the south of the country, but the role played by hepatitis C virus (HCV) still remains unclear. The aim of the current case-control study was to identify risk factors for HCC development in the northern part of the country. Clinical and biological data including viral hepatitis status (serological and molecular) and non-infectious risk factors from 73 patients with HCC and 70 control subjects without hepatic diseases were collected. The mean age of the patients was 63 Â± 10 years, and the ratio of males to females was 1.1. HCC occurred in cirrhotic liver in 72.0% of the cases. HCV infection was the dominant risk factor (64.3% of cases); the presence of HBV was observed in 53.4% of the cases. Occult hepatitis B and C were implicated, respectively, in 30.1% and 9.6% of the cases. HCV genotype 1b was predominant. Patients originating from western Tunisia formed a homogeneous group, characterized by significantly higher rates of tattoos or scarifications (83%) and HCV infection (80%) than those from other parts of the country. Chronic HCV infection is currently the primary risk factor for HCC in Tunisia; HBV infection remains frequent in its overt or occult infection forms. Traditional esthetic practices apparently contribute to increasing the burden of terminal liver diseases in western Tunisia.
