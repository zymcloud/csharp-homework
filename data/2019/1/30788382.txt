Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry various molecules involved in intercellular communication and have raised great interest as drug delivery systems. Several engineering methods have been investigated for vesicle loading. Here, we studied the electroporation of EVs isolated from plasma to load antitumor microRNAs (miRNAs). First, we optimized the transfection protocol using miRNA cel-39 by evaluating different parameters (voltage and pulse) for their effect on vesicle morphology, loading capacity, and miRNA transfer to target cells. When compared with direct incubation of EVs with miRNA, mild electroporation allowed more efficient loading and better protection of miRNA from RNase degradation. Moreover, electroporation preserved the naive vesicle cargo, including RNAs and proteins, and their ability to be taken up by target cells, supporting the absence of vesicle damage. EVs engineered with antitumor miRNAs (miR-31 and miR-451a) successfully promoted apoptosis of the HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, silencing target genes involved in anti-apoptotic pathways. Our findings indicate an efficient and functional miRNA encapsulation in plasma-derived EVs following an electroporation protocol that preserves EV integrity.
