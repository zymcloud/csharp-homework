Nucleos(t)ide analogs are used for preventing liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B patients, but the risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in these patients remain unclear. We designed this retrospective cohort study, the aim is to determine the risk factors for HCC development and its image presentation under nucleos(t)ide analogs treatment.In this study, patients were treated with lamivudine (LAM), entecavir 0.5 mg (ETV), or telbivudine (LdT), and followed-up for at least 2 years to detect HCC and its presentation. Assessment of the risk factors for HCC included age, sex, HBeAg, viral load, liver cirrhosis, current and previous medications, and liver function tests.Totally, 396 patients were recruited, and 18 patients developed HCC. The mean time from the treatment to HCC development was 28.5 ± 16.7 months. The clinical characteristics in HCC and no-HCC groups showed significant differences among age (52.8 ± 6.1 vs 47.1 ± 12.6 years, P
