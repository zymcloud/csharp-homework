We investigated the preventive potential of paeonol on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced oral carcinogenesis. Oral tumors were developed in the buccal pouches of Syrian golden hamsters using topical application of 0.5% DMBA three times/week for 10 weeks. DMBA treated hamsters developed hyperplasia, dysplasia and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The animals also exhibited increased lipid oxidation, decreased antioxidant status and altered levels of detoxification agents. Paeonol treatment of DMBA treated hamsters for 14 weeks decreased tumor incidence, volume and burden Paeonol treatment also increased antioxidant activity and decreased lipid oxidation to near normal levels. Histomorphology and the expression patterns of mutant p53, cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2) and caspase-9 were investigated in the oral buccal mucosa. Paeonol exhibited protective effects against DMBA induced oral carcinogenesis owing to its antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and apoptosis inducing properties.
