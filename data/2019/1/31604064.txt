Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. HCC patients are commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage, for which highly effective therapies are limited. Hence, there is a growing need to discover promising biomarkers for HCC diagnosis, and in this context, microRNAs (miRNAs) hold great promise. MiRNAs function as gene expression regulators by directly binding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and subsequently causing suppression of mRNA translation or degradation of target mRNAs. Two major types of noncoding RNAs act as competing endogenous sponges: circular RNAs and long non-coding RNAs.They can competitively bind to miRNA through miRNA response elements (MREs), thereby reducing the number of miRNAs binding mRNAs and regulating the expression of downstream target genes of miRNAs at the posttranscriptional level. The relationship between single miRNA sponge and HCC has been explored. However, comprehensive reviews on the sponge's function in HCC are lacking. In this review, we describe the methods to find endogenous sponges and construct exogenous sponges, and briefly compare endogenous and exogenous sponges. We also summarize the current progress on the functional role of miRNA sponges in HCC pathogenesis and present their potential value as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In-depth investigations on the function and mechanism of miRNA sponges in HCC will enrich our knowledge of HCC pathogenesis and contribute to the development of effective diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC.
