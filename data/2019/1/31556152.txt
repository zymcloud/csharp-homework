Background:In addition to non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous RNAs with various functions, which have recently become a research hotspot. CircRNAs are a kind of closed circular RNA molecule widely existing in transcriptomes. Due to lack of free ends, they are not easily cleaved by RNase R, thus avoiding degradation. They are more stable than linear RNAs.Methods:Data were collected through PubMed. The following search terms were used: "circular RNA," "circRNA," "cancer," "mechanism," "biogenesis," "biomarker," "diagnosis." Only articles published in English were included.Results:Most circRNAs express tissue/developmental stage specificity. Moreover, circRNAs are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological activities. In this review, we discuss the formation, classification, and biological functions of circRNAs, especially their molecular diagnostic values in common cancers, including gastric cancer (hsa_circ_002059, circ_LARP4, hsa_circ_0000190, hsa_circ_0000096, circ-SFMBT2, and circ_PVT1), hepatocellular carcinoma (circ_104075, circRNA_100338, circ_MTO1, and circZKSCAN1), colorectal cancer (hsa_circ_0136666 and hsa_circ_0000523), lung cancer (hsa_circ_0006427, circ_100876, and circ_ABCB10), breast cancer (hsa_circ_0089105, circAGFG1, and circEPSTI1), bladder cancer (circFNDC3B and circTFRC), and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (circ_100876 and circ-DLG1).Conclusion:CircRNAs not only play important roles in tumorigenesis, but also may become new diagnostic biomarkers.
