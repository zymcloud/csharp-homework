With currently available molecular imaging techniques, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a liver cancer with high mortality rates and poor treatment responses, is mostly diagnosed at its late stage. This is largely due to the lack of highly sensitive contrast agents with high liver specificity. Herein, we report a novel bimodal contrast agent molecule CNCI-1 for the effective detection of HCC at its early stage both in vitro and in vivo. The agent has high liver specificity with effective X-ray computed tomography (CT)/near-infrared (NIR) imaging functions. It has been successfully applied to in vivo NIR imaging with high sensitivity and high selectivity to the HCC region of the HepG2 tumor-xenografted mice model and LM3 orthotopic hepatoma mice model. Moreover, the agent was found to be noninvasive and hepatocarcinoma cells preferential. Furthermore, it also enhanced the tumor imaging by revealing the blood vessels nearby for the CT image acquisition in the VX2 orthotopic hepatoma rabbit model. Our design strategy provides a new avenue to develop the medical relevant bimodal contrast agents for diagnosis of HCC at its early stage.
