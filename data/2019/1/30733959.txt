Objectives:Long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) has been characterized as a tumor suppressor in numerous kinds of human cancers. Its anticancer function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes repression of cell proliferation and metastasis, leaving the internal mechanisms unclear. In this study, we intended to examine the anti-invasion effects of GAS5 on HCC and explore the downstream regulatory mechanisms.Methods:Expression of GAS5 and microRNA-135b (miR-135b) was analyzed by qRT-PCR in paired HCC tissue samples. Their correlation with HCC patients' survival was determined. Transwell assays were done to evaluate in vitro invasion ability. Targeting of GAS5 and RECK by miR-135b was confirmed by qRT-PCR, western blot, and luciferase reporter assays.Results:Decreased GAS5 and increased miR-135b in HCC inversely correlate with each other and both correlate with poor prognosis of HCC patients. Functionally, GAS5 suppresses while miR-135b promotes HCC cell invasion capacities in vitro. Mechanistically, GAS5 is a target of miR-135b. Furthermore, GAS5 positively regulates expression of RECK, also a target of miR-135b, which further inhibits MMP-2 expression and contributes to invasion repression.Conclusion:GAS5 acted as a tumor suppressor in HCC invasion in a competing endogenous RNA manner. Our findings indicate that GAS5 is a promising therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
