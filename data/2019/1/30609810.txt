Adenanthin, a natural ent-kaurane diterpenoid extracted from the herb Isodon adenantha, has been reported to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species in leukemic and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. However, the function and mechanism of the compound in adipogenesis and the development of obesity is still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that adenanthin inhibited adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and the underlying mechanism included two processes: a delayed mitotic clonal expansion via G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the RB-E2F1 signaling pathway and a reduced C/EBPβ signaling by inhibiting the expression and activity of C/EBPβ during mitotic clonal expansion. Furthermore, adenanthin significantly reduced the growing body weight and adipose tissue mass during high-fat diet-inducing obesity of mice, indicating the beneficial effects of adenanthin as a potential agent for prevention of obesity.
