Tuberculosis (TB) is a common opportunistic infection which may be reactivated in immunocompromised patients. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is on the rise with healthcare resulting in increased longevity of people. Reactivation of TB has been reported with liver-directed therapies for HCC like transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and transarterial radio-embolisation (TARE). However, the co-occurrence of both TB and HCC in the same patient without any such history is rarely found. Only three isolated case reports have been published previously. We report the case of an elderly hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease patient who developed two different nodular liver lesions with multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy, one such nodule being confirmed as HCC and another as TB along with nodal TB.
