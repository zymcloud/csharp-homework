Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Sarcomatoid HCC is a rare histological subtype of HCC with largely unclear clinical manifestations and outcomes.

We identified 5,047 patients with histologically proven HCC from the Cancer Registry Database (1996-2016) of National Taiwan University Hospital. Among them, 40 patients with sarcomatoid HCC were identified from the pathology database of National Taiwan University Hospital. We included 160 patients with nonsarcomatoid HCC through propensity score matching according to sex, age, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. The majority of these patients with sarcomatoid HCC were men (75%); their median age was 58 years. Only 47.5% of the patients with sarcomatoid HCC presented with typical image patterns of HCC. The pathological grading of sarcomatoid HCC was more advanced compared with that of nonsarcomatoid HCC (42.5% vs. 23.8% in grade III and IV, P
