Adipocytokine alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (AZGP1) is a 41-kDa protein which regulates insulin sensitivity and glycolipid metabolism. Recently, mounting evidence has indicated that AZGP1 plays a vital role in the progression and prognosis of many types of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Also, previous research has reported that AZGP1 levels are reduced significantly in patients with gastric carcinoma (GC). Here, we aim to assess the potential role and molecular mechanism underlying AZGP1-mediated regulation of GC progression. Both RT-PCR and Western blot methods demonstrated that AZGP1 levels were decreased in all GC cell lines tested, which included AGS, NCI-N87, MKN-28, SGC-7901 and MKN-45, relative to the normal human gastric mucosa epithelial (GES-1) cell line. Cell survival and proliferation rates were correspondingly were reduced, while cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity were increased in NCI-N87 and SGC-7901 cells with high levels of AZGP1. Additionally, the mTOR signaling pathway was suppressed, whereas PTEN expression was elevated following transfection of NCI-N87 and SGC-7901 cells with an AZGP1 overexpressing plasmid. PTEN inhibition reversed the effects of AZGP1 on cell growth and apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. Therefore, we conclude that AZGP1 induced apoptosis and growth inhibition in GC cells via the regulation of the mTOR/PTEN signaling pathway.
