RNA binding motif protein 8A (RBM8A) is an RNA binding protein in a core component of the exon junction complex. Abnormal RBM8A expression is associated with carcinogenesis. We used sequencing data from the Cancer Genome Atlas database and Gene Expression Omnibus, analyzed RBM8A expression and gene regulation networks in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Expression was analyzed using OncomineTM and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis tools, while RBM8A alterations and related functional networks were identified using cBioPortal. LinkedOmics was used to identify differential gene expression with RBM8A and to analyze Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Gene enrichment analysis examined target networks of kinases, miRNAs and transcription factors. We found that RBM8A is overexpressed and the RBM8A gene often amplified in HCC. Expression of this gene is linked to functional networks involving the ribosome and RNA metabolic signaling pathways. Functional network analysis suggested that RBM8A regulates the spliceosome, ribosome, DNA replication and cell cycle signaling via pathways involving several cancer-related kinases, miRNAs and E2F Transcription Factor 1. Our results demonstrate that data mining efficiently reveals information about RBM8A expression and potential regulatory networks in HCC, laying a foundation for further study of the role of RBM8A in carcinogenesis.
