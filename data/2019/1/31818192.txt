In 2019 the British Journal of Biomedical Science published 40 articles in the various disciplines that comprise biomedical science. These were one review, 22 original articles and 17 'In Brief' short reports. Of those citing original data, the majority were in cellular pathology (14 papers), clinical chemistry (9 papers), and microbiology (6 papers: 4 in bacteriology and 2 in virology). There were 3 papers in haematology and 2 in andrology, whilst 5 papers crossed traditional discipline boundaries (such as the molecular genetics of IL6, liver function tests, and hepatocellular carcinoma). Over two-thirds of papers used techniques in molecular genetics. The present report will summarise key aspects of these publications that are of greatest relevance to laboratory scientists.
