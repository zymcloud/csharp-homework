A 68-year-old man presented with generalfatigue due to anemia. Gastrointestinalendoscopy showed a tumor approximately 60mm in diameter in the lesser curvature of the angle of the stomach. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma was diagnosed by biopsy of a tumor specimen. Computed tomography revealed bulky regional lymph node metastases, solitary liver metastasis, and left adrenal metastasis. After three courses of combined chemotherapy with S-1 and CDDP, the gastric lesion and lymph node metastases shrunk, but the liver metastasis and left adrenal metastasis enlarged. After three courses of combined chemotherapy with ramucirumab and paclitaxel, the liver metastasis and left adrenal metastasis also shrunk, and no other new metastatic lesions appeared. Accordingly, total gastrectomy with lymph nodes dissection, partial resection of the liver and left adrenalectomy were performed for a curative resection. The histological findings revealed neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The lesions of the liver and lymph nodes were all burned out, and a tiny metastatic lesion of neuroendocrine carcinoma was left in the left adrenal gland. S-1 was administrated for 3 months after surgery. The patient has been alive for 16months without recurrence after surgery.
