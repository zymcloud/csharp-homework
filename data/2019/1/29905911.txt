Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of malignant tumors with high recurrence and metastasis rates. Radiotherapy represents a major therapeutic option for HCC patients. However, the efficacy of radiotherapy has been limited due to the development of intrinsic radioresistance of the tumor cells. Small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 pseudogene 3 (SUMO1P3), one member of SUMO pseudogene family, is a novel identified lncRNA that was originally identified to be upregulated in gastric cancer. However, the detailed roles of SUMO1P3 in HCC development remain to be elucidated. Here, the expression of SUMO1P3 in HCC tissues and cells was examined by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation, colony formation ability, invasion ability, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity were detected by MTT assay, colony formation assay, cell invasion assay, flow cytometry analysis, and survival fraction assay, respectively. We found that SUMO1P3 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cells. Besides, SUMO1P3 was highly expressed in HCC patients with higher TNM stage. Furthermore, SUMO1P3 knockdown markedly suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation ability, and cell invasiveness, promoted apoptosis, and enhanced radiosensitivity of HCC cells. We concluded that the knockdown of SUMO1P3 repressed tumor growth, invasion, promoted apoptosis, and enhanced radiosensitivity in HCC, providing evidence that SUMO1P3 might be a potential novel biomarker and a therapeutic target for HCC.
