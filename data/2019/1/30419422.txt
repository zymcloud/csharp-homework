Bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF), a core subunit of nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF) complex, plays an important role in chromatin remodeling. However, its precise function and molecular mechanism involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth are still poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated the tumor-promoting role of BPTF in HCC progression. BPTF was highly expressed in HCC cells and tumor tissues of HCC patients compared with normal liver cells and tissues. Knockdown of BPTF inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and stem cell-like traits in HCC cells. In addition, BPTF knockdown effectively sensitized the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapeutic drugs and induced more apoptosis in HCC cells. Consistently, knockdown of BPTF in a xenograft mouse model also suppressed tumor growth and metastasis accompanied by the suppression of cancer stem cells (CSC)-related protein markers. Moreover, the mechanism study showed that the tumor-promoting role of BPTF in HCC was realized by transcriptionally regulating the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Furthermore, we found that HCC patients with high BPTF expression displayed high hTERT expression, and high BPTF or hTERT expression level was positively correlated with advanced malignancy and poor prognosis in HCC patients. Collectively, our results demonstrate that BPTF promotes HCC growth by targeting hTERT and suggest that the BPTF-hTERT axis maybe a novel and potential therapeutic target in HCC.
