BACKGROUND Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAPs) is an important negative regulator of the Rho signaling pathway that is involved in tumorigenesis in liver, colon, and renal cancer. However, the mechanism by which Rho GTPase activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24) regulates cell invasion and migration of lung cancer has not been fully explained. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, ARHGAP24 expression in lung cancer tissues and cell lines was measured by immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. Transwell or wound healing analysis was performed to detect the cell migration and invasion of ARHGAP24 modulated A549 and NCI-H1975 cells with β-catenin inhibitor XAV-939 (10 µM) treatment, and the expression of MMP9, VEGF, and β-catenin protein was measured by Western blotting. RESULTS Our results showed that ARHGAP24 expression was downregulated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. pLVX-Puro-ARHGAP24 transfection in A549 cells significantly inhibited cell invasion and migration, along with increased E-cadherin and decreased MMP9, VEGF, Vimentin, and β-catenin protein expression. pLKO.1-ARHGAP24-shRNA transfection in NCI-H1975 cells significantly promoted cell invasion and migration, accompanied with decreased E-cadherin and increased MMP9, VEGF, and β-catenin protein expression. Moreover, NCI-H1975 cells with XAV-939 treatment showed decreased cell invasion and migration when compared with pLKO.1-ARHGAP24-shRNA transfection. ARHGAP24 silencing promoted the transcriptional activity of β-catenin in NCI-H1975 cells. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that ARHGAP24 silencing promotes lung cancer cell migration and invasion through activating β-catenin signaling.
