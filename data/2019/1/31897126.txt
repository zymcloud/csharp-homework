Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) has been reported to be associated with prognosis in colorectal carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma; however, the clinical significance of LBP in human primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is inconclusive. We aimed to investigate the clinical significance and prognostic value of LBP in human primary HCC. In the present study, 346 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection were retrospectively analyzed. LBP protein expression was evaluated using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. LBP scores collected from immunohistochemical analysis were obtained by multiplying staining intensity and the percentage of positive cells. An outcome-based best cutoff-point was calculated by X-tile software. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regressions were used for prognosis evaluation. LBP was frequently overexpressed in HCC compared with that in peritumor tissues (five pairs by western blot analysis, P=0.0533; 77 pairs by immunohistochemistry, P=0.0171), and LBP expression was positively associated with tumor-node-metastasis stage and tumor differentiation. Patients who had high LBP expression had decreased overall survival and time to recurrence compared with patients with low LBP expression. Furthermore, patients who were both serum α-fetoprotein positive and had high LBP expression had poor prognoses. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses indicated that this combination was an independent prognostic factor [overall survival: Hazard ratio (HR), 1.458; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.158-1.837; P=0.001; time to recurrence: HR,1.382; 95% Cl, 1.124-1.700; P=0.002]. In conclusion, LBP is highly expressed in HCC, and high LBP expression combined with serum α-fetoprotein may predict poor outcomes in patients with HCC following curative resection.
