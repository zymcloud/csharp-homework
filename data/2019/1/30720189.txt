Objective:The relationship between in-hospital mortality (IHM) and acute oesophageal variceal bleeding (AOEVB) has not been fully assessed. The aim of this study was to establish the association between sex and mortality for patients hospitalized with AOEVB.Patients and methods:We analyzed hospitalizations from the Italian Health Ministry database by identifying all patients discharged with AOEVB from January 2001 to December 2015. A total of 144,943 hospitalizations were for oesophageal varices, but only 24,570 emergency admissions with AOEVB coded as the primary or secondary diagnosis were included for analysis. Factors independently associated with IHM were evaluated by multilevel logistic regression.Results:Approximately half of the population was aged â‰¥ 65 years, and nearly 10% was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. Overall, the IHM was 11.8%, with 12.1% in males and 11.3% in females, increasing from 9.2% among subjects aged Conclusions:AOEVB-related IHM decreased from 2001-2005 to 2011-2015. Factors affecting mortality included liver disease, age, sex, development of hepatocellular carcinoma and comorbidities.
