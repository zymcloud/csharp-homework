Background:Epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes have prognostic influence on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previously, the following four epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes were considered to be significantly influential: E-cadherin (CDH1), inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and transcription factor 3 (TCF3). A prognostic prediction model, NRISK4 = (-0.333 × [CDH1] - 0.400 × [ID2] + 0.339 × [MMP9] + 0.387 × [TCF3]) was constructed, but from patients with HCC with predominantly hepatitis B virus infection. We therefore aim to validate if this model also fits patients with HCC and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Methods:We collected HCC tissue samples from 67 patients with HCV infection. Discrimination of the NRISK4 was re-estimated using receiver operating curve analysis and we redefined the appropriate cutoff value. Using this cutoff value, patients were divided into two groups (high/low risk patients) and we compared their clinicopathological factors and prognosis.Results:Area under the curve of NRISK4 prediction was 0.70 and an appropriate cutoff value was 3.19 in this cohort. Patients were divided into high- (n = 25) and low-risk (n = 42) patients for prognosis. There were no significant differences in tumor factors between the two groups. Cancer-specific survival rates at 5 y after surgery on high- and low-risk patients were 45% and 68%, respectively (P = 0.02). At 2 y after surgery, recurrence rates were 68% and 37% among high- and low-risk patients, respectively (P = 0.01). Aggressive recurrences were highly observed in the high-risk patients (P = 0.01).Conclusions:NRISK4 model could also successfully validate prognosis of patients with HCC with HCV infection similarly to in the previous report of patients with hepatitis B virus infection, especially in the early period after surgery.
