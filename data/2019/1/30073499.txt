Objectives:To compare the sensitivity of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2017 for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using multiphasic computed tomography (CT) between patients with and without moderate to severe fatty liver (MSFL).Methods:This retrospective study included a total of 106 high-risk patients with 112 pathologically proven HCCs who underwent multiphasic CT. Patients were classified as MSFL (24 men, 2 women; mean age, 59.5 years [range, 38-79 years]) and non-MSFL (64 men, 16 women; mean age, 62.9 years [range, 40-89 years]) groups according to unenhanced CT liver and spleen parenchymal attenuation. Two independent radiologists assigned LI-RADS categories and accessed HCC features on CT. Sensitivities for LR-5 assignment and frequencies of HCC features were compared between the two groups.Results:Sensitivities of LR-5 assignment for diagnosing HCCs were not significantly different between MSFL and non-MSFL groups (65.4% [17/26] vs. 76.7% [66/86] for reviewer 1, p = 0.247; 73.1% [19/26] vs. 76.74% [66/86] for reviewer 2, p = 0.702). No significant differences in the frequencies of arterial hyperenhancement, washout, and capsule were observed between the two groups (96.2% [25/26] vs. 98.8% [85/86], p = 0.412; 80.8% [21/26] vs. 89.5% [77/86], p = 0.308; and 53.8% [14/26] vs. 57% [49/86], p = 0.778, respectively).Conclusions:LI-RADS v2017 using CT showed comparable sensitivity for diagnosing HCC regardless of MSFL.Key points:• Using LI-RADS v2017 with CT, diagnosis of HCC in patients with MSFL showed similar sensitivity to that in patients without MSFL. • Frequencies of major HCC features (arterial hyperenhancement, washout, and capsule) on CT between the MSFL and non-MSFL groups were not significantly different. • LI-RADS using CT may be feasible for diagnosing HCC in patients with fatty liver.
