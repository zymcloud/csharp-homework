We report the case of a 6-year-old boy with citrin deficiency and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed by using imaging. He exhibited intrahepatic cholestasis 2 days after his birth and was misdiagnosed with inspissated bile syndrome at that time. The symptoms of jaundice spontaneously resolved when he was 5 months old. However, his transaminase levels remained elevated for ∼6 years, for which he received no treatment. He preferred a high-protein, high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, which has been observed in many patients with citrin deficiency, but no clinical features of adult-onset type II citrullinemia were observed. At the age of 6 years, he was admitted to our hospital with a nonviral infection and high α-fetoprotein level; results from an abdominal MRI and computed tomography revealed multiple tumors in the liver. Because of his history of intrahepatic cholestasis in the neonatal period, he was suspected to have citrin deficiency. A genetic analysis of solute carrier family 25, member 13 revealed the presence of a homozygous 851del4 mutation, and a diagnosis of citrin deficiency was made. The patient did not qualify for liver transplantation and died 2 months later, after discharge from our hospital. Thus, this case reveals that not all patients with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis spontaneously and totally improve, and this case is used to emphasize that patients with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis should be managed carefully, especially in the stage of failure to thrive and dyslipidemia caused by citrin deficiency, which may lead to advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
