Epidermalgrowth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor(EGFR-TKI)is the first choice for the treatment of EGFR mutation- positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). There have been few reports on the efficacy and safety of gefitinib in elderly patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. We retrospectively assessed the efficacy and safety of gefitinib as first-line chemotherapy in 22 patients with advanced NSCLC aged 75 years or older and who were treated with gefitinib. The response rate was 81.8%, and the disease controlrate was 95.5%. The median progression-free survivaltime was 14.2 months, and the median survivaltime was 30.7 months. The common adverse events were skin toxicities(50.0%), liver dysfunction(18.2%), and diarrhea(18.2%). The dose of gefitinib was reduced in 36.3% of the patients, and the treatment of gefitinib was discontinued in 18.2% of the patients. Gefitinib is effective and safe for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.
