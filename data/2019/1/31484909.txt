A 78-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 11 years prior to presentation. He was diagnosed with multiple intrahepatic recurrences of HCC with portal vein invasion and received hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with cisplatin. He developed abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood-stained stool following treatment. Computed tomography revealed significant bowel wall thickening throughout the colon. Colonoscopy revealed reddish edematous mucosa with a reduced vascular pattern without ischemic changes. Conservative treatment with total parenteral nutrition improved his condition and his imaging findings. This is the first report of severe colitis following HAIC with cisplatin.
cisplatin; colitis; hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.
