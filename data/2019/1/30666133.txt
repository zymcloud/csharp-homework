Objective:Microvascular invasion (MVI) has been proved to be an independent risk factor for the recurrence of HCC. If promptly treated, the recurrence rate can be reduced and the total survival time can be prolonged. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of sorafenib on the clinical outcomes in HCC patients with MVI after curative hepatectomy.Methods:HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy and were pathologically diagnosed with MVI were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into sorafenib group and control group. Sorafenib 400 mg, twice daily, was administered orally after surgery in the sorafenib group. The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed during follow-up, and associated factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate COX regression.Results:There was no significant difference in demographics, clinical staging, and tumor index between sorafenib group (16 patients) and control group (33 matched patients). The RFS and OS were both longer in the sorafenib group, and the 3-years RFS rates of the sorafenib group and control group were 56.3% (9 of 16) and 24.2% (8 of 33), respectively (P=0.027). The 3-year OS rate of the sorafenib group was 81.3% (13 of 16), which was significantly higher than that of the control group (39.4%, P=0.006). The results of multivariate COX regression indicated that treatment with sorafenib was an independent associated factor for RFS and OS.Conclusion:We believe that using sorafenib therapy after curative hepatectomy in HCC patients with MVI is effective and beneficial as it can reduce recurrence and prolong the survival time.
