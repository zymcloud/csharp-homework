Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the most common and aggressive human cancers worldwide. Accumulating evidences indicate that non-coding RNAs are critical regulators implicated in various physiological processes including HCC development. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MYCN opposite-strand (MYCNOS) was reported to be up-regulated in several human cancers, yet its role in HCC progression is still elusive. In the present study, MYCNOS was up-regulated in both HCC tissues and cell lines, and elevated MYCNOS expression was correlated to shorter survival time of HCC patients. We knocked down MYCNOS expression using short hairpin RNAs specifically targeting MYCNOS. MYCNOS knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation in HCC cells in vitro accompanied by exacerbated cell apoptosis; it also suppressed tumor growth in mouse model in vivo. Besides, the migration and invasion of HCC cells were remarkably inhibited after MYCNOS knockdown. In addition, MYCNOS acted as a negative regulator of miR-340 in HCC cells, and all effects of MYCNOS knockdown were abrogated by further miR-340 inhibition. We also discovered that oncogene phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2 (PREX2) was a downstream target of miR-340, and PREX2 expression was positively correlated to that of MYCNOS in HCC tissues. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that MYCNOS knockdown inhibited HCC progression through regulating miR-340.
