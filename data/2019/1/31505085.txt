The study aimed to investigate the relationship between the use of COX inhibitors and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) using a nationwide population-based data. A nested case-control study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) from 2002 to 2013 in Korea. We compared the use of COX inhibitors between HCC cases and matched controls by categorizing 5 groups according to the cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD, 360) adjusting the use of antiviral agents. A total of 4980 patients with CHB were analysed as 996 HCC cases and 3984 matched controls. The number of COX inhibitor users (â‰¥28 cDDD) was 358 patients (36%) and 1814 patients (45%) in the HCC group and control group, respectively. The use of COX inhibitors was significantly associated with a decreased risk of HCC development compared with nonusers (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.73, P 360 cDDDs, respectively (P
