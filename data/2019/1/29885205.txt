Background:Increasing global life expectancy has resulted in a greater demand for cancer surgery in aged patients. However, whether extreme age causes poorer clinical outcomes remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of extreme age (≥80 years) on outcomes in patients after liver cancer surgery.Methods:A systematic search was performed to enrol relevant studies. Data were analysed using fixed-effects or random-effects models. Eight retrospective studies involving 253 participants older than 80 years were included.Results:Compared with younger patients, patients of extreme age (≥80 years) who had undergone curative liver cancer surgery experienced less operating time and blood loss (both P Conclusion:Although an extreme age may not be a contraindication for undertaking liver cancer surgery, it may cause more morbidity. Perioperative intervention should be considered for prevention and early treatment of POI, delirium and cardiovascular events.
