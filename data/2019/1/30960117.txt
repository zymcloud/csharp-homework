A multifunctional targeted drug delivery platform (CDHA⁻MGO) has been successfully constructed by grafting β-cyclodextrin⁻hyaluronic acid polymers (CDHA) to Fe₃O₄⁻graphene oxide (MGO). The obtained CDHA⁻MGO nanocomposite has good water-dispersibility, easy magnetic separation, high near-infrared (NIR) photothermal heating, and excellent biocompatibility. The β-cyclodextrin-hyaluronic acid polymers efficaciously enhance the doxorubicin (DOX) loading amount up to 485.43 mg·g-1. Meanwhile, the Fe₃O₄⁻graphene oxide provides a facile photothermal response mechanism to handle the NIR-triggered release of DOX in weak acidic solvent environments. Significantly, the DOX-loaded nanocomposite (DOX@CDHA⁻MGO) has displayed CD44 receptor-mediated active targeting recognition and chemo-photothermal synergistic therapy of hepatoma cells. These findings suggest that the as-prepared drug delivery platform would be of valuable potential for cancer-targeted photo-chemotherapy.
