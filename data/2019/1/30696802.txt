The aim of this study was to investigate BCL2L10 and BECN1 expression and their effect on autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that BCL2L10 expression was low in hepatoma tissues and cells. Overexpression of BCL2L10 decreased the activity of hepatoma cells. To analyze autophagic flux, we monitored the formation of autophagic vesicles by fluorescence protein method. Autophagy-related protein LC3B-II was accumulated and P62 was decreased, which indicated that autophagy was induced by BECN1, while BCL2L10 could suppress this trend. Immunofluorescence assay showed that BCL2L10 and Beclin 1 were co-located in hepatoma cells. Immunoprecipitation showed that BCL2L10 could inhibit the autophagy of hepatoma cells by combining with Beclin 1. ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation suggested that the combination between BCL2L10 and Beclin 1 reduced the bond between Beclin 1 and PI3KC3. Based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was significantly upregulated in HCC. In conclusions, BCL2L10 had a low expression in HCC tissues and cells, which could release BECN1 to induce autophagy of hepatoma cells by downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
