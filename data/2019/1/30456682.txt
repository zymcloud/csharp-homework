Background:Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is increasingly utilized for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, long-term outcomes for patients requiring conversion to an open procedure during LLR have not been examined.Methods:Patients undergoing attempted LLR for HCC were identified within the National Cancer Database. Patients undergoing successful LLR were compared with those who required unplanned conversion with regard to perioperative outcomes and overall survival (OS). Those experiencing conversion were further compared with patients who underwent planned open resection after propensity score matching.Results:Unplanned conversion occurred in 228 (18.0%) of 1270 patients undergoing LLR. Compared with successful LLR, conversion was associated with greater length of stay (6 vs. 4 days, p Conclusions:Unplanned conversion during LLR for HCC is associated with inferior OS. This difference is most pronounced for major hepatectomy. LLR should be considered cautiously in patients with larger, more advanced tumors likely to require major resection.
