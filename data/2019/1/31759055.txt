Chemo-resistance to conventional therapy is a major barrier requiring further investigation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cancer stem like cells (CSCs) contribute to the tumorigenicity, progression, and chemo-resistance of malignancies. Studies have implicated the anti-cancer effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and have explored the underlying mechanisms. However, whether ATO might reverse chemo-resistance by inhibiting the CSC like properties remains under investigation. Here, we explored the potential of ATO in chemotherapy in constructed multiple drug resistant (MDR) liver cancer cells. ATO re-sensitized the MDR Bel-7402 cells (BelMDR) cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, an effect mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB pathway and CSCs properties. For the molecular mechanisms, via inducing the DNA de-methylation, ATO activated the microRNA-148a (miR-148a), leading to the repression of NF-κB pathway by targeting the 3'-UTR of p65. In summary, epigenetic regulation of miR-148a by ATO is an important mechanism in drug resistance that decreases the expression of NF-κB and hence represses CSC like phenotype. These findings may suggest a novel mechanism for HCC treatment.
