Background and aim: Imaging guided microwave ablation (MWA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a widely used method over recent years. Tumors close to the diaphragm, gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, pancreas, hepatic hilum and major bile duct or vessels are generally considered relative contraindications for microwave ablation. This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of ultrasonography-guided MWA in treating patients with HCC in difficult anatomical sites in comparison to those in conventional sites. Patients and methods: Eighty-eight patients were included and divided into two groups: the study group of 44 with 46 lesions lying
Difficult sites; Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC); Liver cirrhosis; Microwave Ablation (MWA).
