Objective:To compare therapeutic outcomes between hepatic resection (HR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for small hepatic masses diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on pre-treatment imaging study.Methods:Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and informed consent was waived. Patients with a single (≤3 cm) mass diagnosed as HCC on pre-treatment imaging study between January 2008 and December 2009 who underwent HR (n = 145) or RFA (n = 178) were included. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. In the HR group, the false-positive rate for imaging diagnosis was calculated. For the RFA group, the local tumor progression rate was calculated.Results:RFS rates at 5 years were 59.3% for the HR group and 32.2% for the RFA group. OS rates at 5 years were 85.4% for the HR group and 76.8% for the RFA group. In the RFA group, cumulative local tumor progression rates were 8.3 and 20.2% at 1 and 3 years. Treatment modality was not an independent prognostic factor for either RFS or OS on multivariate analysis. The false-positive rate for HCC diagnosis based on imaging criteria was 4.8% in the HR group.Conclusion:The imaging criteria for diagnosis of HCC have a high positive predictive value. Multivariate analysis showed that RFS and OS rates were not significantly different between HR and RFA for small hepatic masses diagnosed as HCC on pre-treatment imaging.Advances in knowledge:Treatment modality (hepatic resection vs RFA) was not an independent prognostic factor for both RFS and OS for small masses (≤3 cm) diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma on pre-treatment imaging.
