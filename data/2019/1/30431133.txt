The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of long non‑coding RNA Fer‑1‑like family member 4 (FER1L4) in the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through the regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was used to detect the expression levels of FER1L4 and PTEN mRNA in HCC tissues, and western blotting was performed to measure the protein expression level of PTEN; MTT and colony formation assays were performed to detect the cell proliferative ability. Furthermore, nude mice were injected with transfected HCC cells and the tumor volume and weight were measured. The results indicated that FER1L4 was expressed at a low level in human HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Functional studies indicated that FER1L4 may inhibit the proliferative ability of HCC cells. In addition, PTEN was highly expressed in HCC tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues and was positively associated with FER1L4. In addition, it was demonstrated that FER1L4 inhibited the proliferative ability of HCC cells in vitro, and silencing FER1L4 expression by small interfering RNAs promoted the growth of HCC tumors in vivo. Therefore, FER1L4 may be a potent therapeutic target for HCC.
