Value of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and in analysis of the prognostic factors of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) were compared. A total of 300 patients with PHC were selected from January 2013 to January 2016. Among them, 170 patients were diagnosed with small HCC. Patients were diagnosed by MRI and CT scans, respectively, and diagnostic efficacy of the methods was compared. A single factor and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors were performed on 300 patients. The sensitivity of MRI screening was 78.82%, specificity was 78.46%, accuracy was 78.67%, positive predictive value was 82.72%, and negative predictive value was 73.91%. CT screening showed a sensitivity of 62.35%, a specificity of 73.85%, an accuracy of 67.33%, a positive predictive value of 75.71%, and a negative predictive value of 60.00%. Differences in sensitivity, accuracy, and negative predictive value between MRI and CT screening were statistically significant (P0.05). Diagnostic efficiency of MRI is better than that of CT diagnosis. Univariate analysis showed that age, hepatitis B cirrhosis background, tumor stage, and portal vein embolization were prognostic factors for PHC. Cox multivariate regression analysis showed that the background of liver cirrhosis, tumor stage, and portal thrombosis were independent risk factors for poor prognosis for PHC patient and the differences were statistically significant (P
