Background and aims:To evaluate long-term outcomes and prognostic factors of laparoscopic microwave ablation as a first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma located at the liver surface not feasible for percutaneous ablation.Methods:51 consecutive patients receiving laparoscopic microwave ablation in our center between January 11, 2012, and July 31, 2014, were enrolled. Technique effectiveness (complete ablation or incomplete ablation) was evaluated 1 month postprocedure. Procedure-related complications were recorded. The influences of patients' baseline characteristics on recurrence-free survival and overall survival were analyzed after a median follow-up of 34.0 (ranging 19.0-49.0) months.Results:Complete ablation was gained in 47 (92.2%) of the 51 patients. No patients died within 30 days of microwave ablation procedure. A total of 3 (5.9%) cases of complications were observed. Tumor progression/recurrence were observed in 40 patients (78.4%). The median recurrence-free survival and median overall survival of the total cohort was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval: 7.573-14.427) and 34.0 months (95% confidence interval: 27.244-40.756), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified alanine transaminase level and tumor number as independent significant prognosticators of recurrence-free survival whereas α-fetoprotein level as significant prognosticators of overall survival.Conclusions:As a first-line treatment, laparoscopic microwave ablation provides high technique effectiveness rate and is well tolerated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma located at liver surface. Alanine transaminase and tumor number were significant predictors of recurrence-free survival, whereas α-fetoprotein level was significant predictor of overall survival. Laparoscopic microwave ablation might serve as a rational treatment option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with tumors at the liver surface, which merits validation in future perspective studies.
