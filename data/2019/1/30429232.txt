The present study investigated the effects of Colchicine on gastric carcinoma (GC) cells and explored its possible mechanisms underlying such effects. The results of MTT and colony formation assays showed that Colchicine (2, 5, and 10 ng/ml) markedly inhibited the proliferation of AGS and NCI-N87 cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also led to a reduction in cell migration in both GC cells as determined by Transwell migration assay. Mover, data form Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry assay indicated that Colchicine (2, 5, and 10 ng/ml) promoted the apoptosis of NCI-N87 cells. In addition, the release of cytochrome c, the activation of bax, and the inhibition of bcl-2 were observed in NCI-N87 cells treated with Colchicine. Furthermore, the in vivo experiment further confirmed that Colchicine administration remarkably suppressed the tumor growth in nude mice via induction of apoptosis at 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg. In addition, no visible toxicity was observed in liver and renal tissue of mice. This finding suggests that Colchicine-induced apoptosis is associated with caspase-3-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.
