Background:Minimally invasive approaches for major hepatectomy have been marred by significant rates of conversion and associated morbidity. This study aimed to determine risk factors for conversion as well as postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing minimally invasive right-sided hepatectomy (MIRH).Methods:Data for patients undergoing MIRH between 2008 and 2017 at Emory University were reviewed. Risk factors for conversion were determined using multivariate regression analysis. Outcomes of conversion patients were compared with those who underwent successful MIRH or elective open surgery.Results:Unplanned conversion occurred in 7 (6.25%) of 112 patients undergoing MIRH. Primary reason for conversion was difficult dissection secondary to inflammation and severe adhesions. No preoperative clinical factor was identified that predicted conversions. Converted cases had higher EBL and pRBC transfusion compared to non-converted cases however morbidity was similar to those undergoing primary open surgery.Conclusion:Difficult dissection and adhesions remained the only clinically applicable parameter leading to unplanned conversions. While these did offset benefits of a successful minimally invasive approach, it did not increase risk of postoperative complications compared with planned open surgery.
