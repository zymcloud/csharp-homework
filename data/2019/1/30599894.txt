Background:As an effective antimalarial medicine, Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has therapeutic potential on human cervical cancer. However, its working mechanism has not been elucidated.Purpose:This study aimed to investigate the reversal effect of DHA on human cervical cancer HeLa cells, and explored its mechanism of action in vitro and in vivo.Study design/methods:The effect and mechanism of DHA on HeLa cells was examined by using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Results:In this study, it was confirmed that DHA had statistically equivalent anti-tumor efficiency in HeLa cells with a clinical chemotherapeutic agent of cisplatin. Meanwhile, DHA triggered autophagy, where LC3B-II expression was dose-dependently increased. Further, it was revealed that DHA promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, with DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) damage, as up-regulation of Î³H2AX protein and foci formation. Interestingly, we firstly demonstrated that DHA induced autophagy through promotion of the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (Ser70), independent of the phosphorylated JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185). Moreover, DHA-treated HeLa cells displayed an increase in the pro-autophagic protein Beclin-1 with downregulated the phospho-mTOR (Ser2448). Furthermore, upregulated pro-apoptotic protein Bak-1, but not Bax, suggesting Bak-1 is included in DHA-induced autophagy.Conclusion:Therefore, DHA upregulates the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (Ser70) and mTOR (Ser2448) and induces autophagic cell death in Hela cells. This study provided a mechanism to support DHA, an autophagy inducer, as a potential therapeutic agent for human cervical cancer.
