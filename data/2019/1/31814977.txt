Although sorafenib is the standard treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predictive factors sorafenib tolerance in intermediate-stage HCC cannot be accurately determined. The aim of the current study was to identify the predictive characteristics for the continuation of sorafenib treatment (≥400 mg) in patients with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)-refractory intermediate HCC and to identify candidates for second-line sorafenib treatment. A total of 33 TACE-refractory intermediate patients with HCC that were treated with sorafenib, and who had reached progressive disease (PD), were analyzed in the present retrospective study. Of 33 patients, 6 patients (18.1%) were able to continue sorafenib treatment (≥400 mg) until PD, however, a total of 27 patients (71.9%) were unable to continue treatment (180 mg/dl; P=0.026) and cholinesterase (ChE; ≥220 U/l; P=0.024) were significant factors, and a multivariate analysis indicated that ChE (≥220 U/l) was a significant prognostic factor (HR: 11.9; 95% CI: 1.19-118.0; P=0.004). Both progression-free survival [279 (204-403) vs. 117.5 (63-197) days; P=0.0136] and OS [470 (277-679) vs. 171.5 (80-236) days; P=0.0004] were significantly increased in patients with ChE levels ≥220 U/l compared with patients exhibiting ChE levels
