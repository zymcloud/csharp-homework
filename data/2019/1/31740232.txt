Rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR) is a key component of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2), and promotes cellular proliferation and survival through the activation of downstream AGC kinase family members. The amplification of RICTOR has been proposed as a therapeutically relevant genomic alteration. However, other than next-generation sequencing, precise diagnostic methods to detect RICTOR amplification in advanced solid cancers have not been fully explored. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis on solid tumor tissues from 435 cancer patients. Overexpression of RICTOR was found in 213 cases (49.0 %: 1+, 29.4 %; 2+, 15.2 %; 3+, 4.4 %) consisting of 111 colorectal cancers, 42 gastric cancers, 16 renal cell carcinomas, 8 soft tissue sarcomas, 6 hepatocellular carcinomas, 6 cholangiocarcinomas, 4 lung cancers, and 37 other tumors. RICTOR overexpression was heterogeneous (stained
