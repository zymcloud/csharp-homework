A polysaccharide characterized as galactomannan (GMann) with a molecular weight of 117.76 kDa was isolated from the aqueous extract of Caesalpinia gilliesii (C. gilliesii) seeds then assessed for antiproliferative potential against human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2). Further, HCC was induced in Wister albino rats by Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) ip injection (200 mg/kg bw), and CCl4 orally (2 ml/kg bw) for two months then subjected to GMann orally treatment (2 mg/kg bw) for one month. In results, isolated GMann is constituted of sugars (89.99 ± 2.3%), moisture (6.89 ± 0.45%), ash (0.06 ± 0.2%), and protein (2.81%) and composed mainly of mannose and galactose in ratio M/G 3.79. In vitro study, data revealed a concentration-dependent potency of GMann to induce cell death of HepG2 cells with IC50 value of 0.375 µg/ml. Mechanistic studies revealed the potential of GMann to arrest cell cycle at G2/M phase with induction of apoptosis. Biochemical results in vivo showed a significant reduction in serum transaminases (ALT and AST) as well as hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NOx). Molecular analysis declared a significant down-regulation in mRNA gene expression of both nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Furthermore, a significant down-regulation in the cellular oncogene-fos (C-fos) and marked up-regulation in Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3β) level were observed. These results were supported with histopathological investigation. Whereas GMann improved inflammatory and apoptotic markers, it could be a promising new therapeutic agent for HCC suppression and this warrant further development as a possible drug candidate for HCC.
