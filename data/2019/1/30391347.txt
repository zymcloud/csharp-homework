Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequently occurring cancer worldwide and the fifth most common malignancy. The Hippo pathway has been found to play a critical role in cancer development. YAP, a transcriptional coactivator, is the major downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway. Hypocrellin A (HA), a natural perylenequinone light-sensitive compound, is usually used for the therapy of eukoplakia of the vulva and keloids in China. Oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpene compound, is prevalent in the treatment of human liver diseases such as viral hepatitis. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanism by which HA modulates the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway in HCC cells and the anticancer effect of HA combined with OA. Treatment with HA resulted in a decrease in cell viability and migration in HCC cells. Furthermore, we found that HA decreased the YAP and TEAD protein levels of the Hippo pathway. Next we demonstrated that HA could potentiate OA's effect on HCC cells. Our results indicated that HA could inhibit the growth of HCC cells in darkness through Hippo-YAP signaling and HA combined with OA had a better effect than HA or OA alone.Thus, our results provide an alternative combinational inhibitor to combat hepatocellular carcinoma diseases.
