Background:B-cell activating factor (BAFF), an important cytokine for B lymphocyte activation, has been shown to be increased in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.Objectives:This study aimed at evaluating clinical correlation and prognostic role of plasma BAFF and related polymorphisms in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Plasma BAFF levels were measured from 100 healthy controls and 490 patients with chronic HBV infection (200 with HCC and 290 without HCC). The rs9514828 and rs12583006 polymorphisms were determined by allelic discrimination.Results:The HCC group had significantly higher BAFF levels compared with the non-HCC group and healthy controls. Among the non-HCC group, the HBeAg-positive subgroup had higher BAFF levels compared with the HBeAg-negative subgroup. In the HCC group, high BAFF levels at initial presentation significantly correlated with alpha-fetoprotein levels, Child-Pugh classification, tumor size and BCLC stage. Multivariate analyses showed that elevated BAFF concentration (± 1,100 pg/ml) was a significant and independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with HCC (OR = 2.28, 95%CI: 1.07-4.87; P = 0.034). HCC patients with high BAFF levels (± 1,100 pg/ml) had a poorer median survival than those with low levels (P Conclusions:Our data demonstrate for the first time that elevated plasma BAFF levels at baseline exhibit clinical correlation in terms of disease severity and overall survival in HCC patients. Thus, plasma BAFF at initial diagnosis could serve as a prognostic marker for HBV-related HCC.
