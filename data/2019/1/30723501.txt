Purpose:Platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) has emerged as one of the key cytokines in malignant transformation of different cells. PDGF-BB also exhibits a potent mitogenic effect on liver cells; studies have advocated clinical implications of monitoring serum PDGF-BB (sPDGF-BB) in patients with liver disease. We thus investigated the predictive relevance of perioperative sPDGF-BB after curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We evaluated perioperative sPDGF-BB in a prospective homogenous cohort of 40 patients diagnosed with HCC. During the first two-year follow-up, patients were evaluated every three months for postresection HCC recurrence.Results:Patients who developed recurrence during two-year follow-up were found to have lower concentration of sPDGF-BB than those without recurrence in both pre- and postoperative settings (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, resp.). We validated that the reduced postoperative sPDGF-BB (< 2133.29 pg/mL) was associated with an increased incidence of postresection HCC recurrence [area under curve (AUC) > 0.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68 - 0.94, P < 0.001]; furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that postoperative sPDGF-BB was an independent predictor of HCC recurrence (hazard ratio = 5.64, 95% CI = 1.56 - 20.30, P < 0.01).Conclusions:These findings provide a new insight into an association between diminished perioperative sPDGF-BB and HCC recurrence. Patients with low perioperative sPDGF-BB progressed early HCC recurrence. Therefore, evaluating perioperative sPDGF-BB may provide useful clinical information to characterize patients with postresection HCC recurrence.
