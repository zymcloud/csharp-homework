The liver is the central metabolic organ and plays a pivotal role in regulating homeostasis of glucose and lipid metabolism. Aberrant liver metabolism promotes insulin resistance, which is reported to be a common characteristic of metabolic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is a complex and bidirectional relationship between NAFLD and T2DM. NAFLD patients with hepatic insulin resistance generally share a high risk of impaired fasting glucose associated with early diabetes; most patients with T2DM experience non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other more severe liver complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, hepatic insulin resistance, which is caused by diacylglycerol-mediated activation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCùúÄ), may be the critical pathological link between NAFLD and T2DM. Therefore, this review aims to illuminate current insights regarding the complex and strong association between NAFLD and T2DM and summarize novel and emerging targets for the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance based on established mechanistic knowledge.
