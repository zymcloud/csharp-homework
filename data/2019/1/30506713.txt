Background:The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is the most widely used staging system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the classifications of early (BCLC-A) and intermediate (BCLC-B) stage HCC remain controversial.Aim:To refine the staging of BCLC-A and -B.Methods:A total of 986 patients with HCC undergoing liver resection from two institutions formed the training cohort, and 694 from another institution were the validation cohort. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the performance of tumour size in predicting overall survival (OS), and determined the optimised cut-off. Discriminatory performance was evaluated using Harrell's concordance index (C-index).Results:Patients with multiple tumours exceeding Milan criteria but within up-to-seven criteria had similar OS and disease-free survival (DFS) to those with multiple tumours meeting Milan criteria, and were assigned to the modified BCLC-A stage. The area under the ROC curve of tumour size for predicting OS was 0.778, and the diameter of 7 cm was the optimal cut-off to identify patients with single tumours who had higher OS than BCLC-B stage patients. Due to the similar OS, patients with single HCCs >7 cm were assigned to the modified BCLC-B stage. The C-indexes of the modified BCLC classification for OS and DFS were higher compared to the original version. The findings were supported by the validation cohort.Conclusions:The modified staging of BCLC-A and -B, based on single tumour >7 cm and multiple tumours beyond up-to-seven criteria, could be more accurate to predict the prognosis of HCC patients. Liver resection could benefit patients with resectable multifocal HCCs beyond the Milan criteria.
