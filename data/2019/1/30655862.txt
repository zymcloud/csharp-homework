Association between the expression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the drug resistance of hepatoma cells was investigated. HepG-2 cells and HepG2/ADM cells were cultured, respectively. The morphology and status of the two groups of cells were observed by cell white light. The immunofluorescence by NF-κB and MDR1 staining on HepG-2 cells and HepG2/ADM cells, respectively, was applied and the fluorescence expression in the two groups of cells was observed. RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of NF-κB and MDR1 mRNA, the NF-κB and MDR1 protein expression was detected by western blot analysis. The results of cell white illumination showed that the structure of HepG-2 and HepG2/ADM cells was complete and the cell morphology was normal, and there was no significant difference, and could be used for comparative study. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression of NF-κB and MDR1 in HepG-2 cells was very low, while the expression of NF-κB and MDR1 in HepG2/ADM cells was increased significantly. The RT-qPCR results showed that NF-κB and MDR1 mRNA expression in HepG-2 cells was very low, while NF-κB and MDR1 mRNA expression in HepG-2/ADM cells was significantly increased, and western blot results showed that NF-κB and MDR1 protein expression in HepG-2 cells was very low, while NF-κB and MDR1 protein expression in HepG-2/ADM cells was increased significantly. The results of variance analysis showed that there was significant difference in the expression of the control group and paeonol group (P<0.01). In conclusion, the expression of NF-κB in the drug-resistant cells of liver cancer is closely related to the resistance-related gene MDR1. This result may provide a new solution for the drug resistance of liver cancer.
