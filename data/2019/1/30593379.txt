Fowl Adenoviruses (FAdVs) are widely-distributed pathogens across the globe. Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4), the causative agent for chicken hydropericardium syndrome (HPS) with a high mortality in the infected flocks, has caused severe economic losses to the poultry industry of China in the past few years. Although vaccination against FAdV-4 has been implemented, the prevention and control of FAdV-4 infection is still not very successful. Here, we report that FAdV-4 markedly inhibits Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cell growth and this inhibition could be abolished by a small molecule SP600125, a JNK MAPK specific inhibitor. Furthermore, SP600125 considerably suppressed FAdV-4-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK MAPK. Importantly, SP600125 promoted type I interferon production associated with inhibition of FAdV-4 replication. Thus, FAdV-4 might employ the JNK MAPK pathway for the benefit of its replication, and SP600125 may have the potential of being used as an anti-virus drug for the control FAdV-4 infection.
