Purpose:To evaluate the utility of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided coaxial needle biopsies for focal liver lesions (FLL) that were inconspicuous or could not be accurately identified the active site on B-mode ultrasound (US).Materials and methods:This prospective study included 76 patients who had CEUS-guided coaxial needle biopsies for FLL between December 2015 and June 2017. We recorded characteristics of target lesions. We evaluated conspicuity of target lesions and accuracy of identifying the active site of target lesions on B-mode US and CEUS using a 5-point scale. Patients were divided into three groups, and analyzed according to body mass index (BMI). Based on the final diagnosis, the diagnostic performance was evaluated.Results:The mean size and depth of target lesions were 41.5 ± 28.5 and 47.9 ± 18.9 mm on CEUS, respectively. In arterial phase, the enhanced pattern of target lesions varied. The conspicuity of target lesions and accuracy of identifying the active site of target lesions was significantly improved on CEUS compared to B-mode US (p < 0.05). The three BMI groups had significant differences in conspicuity of target lesions after using CEUS (p < 0.05). The high BMI group had a greater change in conspicuity of lesions compared to the normal BMI group or the low BMI group (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of this technique for the diagnosis of FLL were 92.8%, 100%, and 93.4%, respectively.Conclusion:Real-time CEUS-guided coaxial needle biopsy can be very useful for FLL that are inconspicuous or cannot be accurately identified the active site on B-mode US.
