ZNF300 plays an important role in the regulation of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. However, little is known about the role of ZNF300 in lipid metabolism and NAFLD. In the present study, we observed that ZNF300 expression was markedly decreased in free fatty acid (FFA)-induced fatty liver. Overexpressed ZNF300 alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation, whereas knockdown of ZNF300 enhanced the FFA-induced lipid accumulation. Investigations of the underlying mechanisms revealed that ZNF300 directly binds to and regulates the PPARα expression, thus promoting fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, bisulfite pyrosequencing PCR (BSP) analysis identified the hypermethylation status of ZNF300 gene in FFA-treated hepatocytes. Importantly, the suppression of ZNF300 could be blocked by DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (5-azadC) or DNMT3a-siRNA. These results suggested that ZNF300 plays an important role in hepatic lipid metabolism via PPARα promoting fatty acid oxidation and this effect might be blocked by DNMT3a-mediated methylation of ZNF300. Therefore, in addition to ZNF300 expression levels, the methylation status of this gene also has a potential as a prognostic biomarker.
