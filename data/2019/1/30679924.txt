Background:Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been proved to be a risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma, but how diabetes affects incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection remains controversial.Methods:A comprehensive search of Medline and Embase was performed. Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B patients was the primary outcome. Pooled HRs and 95% CIs were calculated to assess the correlation between diabetes and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Five cohort studies and two case-control studies were identified, with a total of 21,842 chronic hepatitis B patients. The diabetes mellitus cohort was found to have increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (pooled HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.28-2.47; fixed effect) and worse overall mortality (pooled RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.64-2.27; fixed effect) in comparison with those without diabetes. In case-control studies, hepatocellular carcinoma cases were found to have an insignificantly elevated diabetes mellitus rate in comparison with the control group.Conclusion:Type 2 diabetes mellitus is significantly associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and aggressive management of diabetes mellitus is strongly suggested.
