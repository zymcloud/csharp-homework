Background:Increasing evidence supports the association of microRNA with tumor occurrence and development. However, the expression of miR-6875-3p and its role in cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive.Methods:The expression of miR-6875-3p and BTG2 in HCC tissues and cell lines was detected by using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, respectively. A western blot assay, qRT-PCR and Luciferase reporter assay were employed to study the interaction between miR-6875-3p and BTG2. Cell proliferation invasion and metastasis were measured by MTT, transwell and matrigel analyses in vitro. In vivo, tumorigenicity and metastasis assays were performed in nude mice.Results:We found that miR-6875-3p were elevated expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, and negatively correlated with BTG2 expression, while positively correlated with tumor staging, size, degree of differentiation, and vascular invasion of HCC. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo assays showed that miR-6875-3p regulates EMT and improve the proliferation, metastasis and stem cell-like properties of HCC cells. BTG2 was identified as a direct and functional target of miR-6875-3p via the 3'-UTR of BTG2. We also confirmed that miR-6875-3p plays its biological functions via the BTG2/FAK/Akt pathway.Conclusion:Our study provides evidence that high expression of miR-6875-3p can promote tumorigenesis of HCC in vitro and in vivo, so as to function as a novel oncogene in HCC. In mechanism, we found that miR-6875-3p plays its biological functions via the BTG2/FAK/Akt pathway.
