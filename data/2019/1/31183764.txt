Purpose:Vitamin D is implicated linked to liver cancer and chronic liver diseases, but its association with tumor response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether vitamin D levels influence tumor response in HCC patients treated with TACE.Methods:A total of 58 HCC patients undergoing TACE were enrolled in the study. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels were determined at baseline and 1 day after TACE using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Response to TACE was evaluated after a 4-6 week interval. Univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox regression model were performed to determine the risk factors associated with tumor response. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive performance of baseline 25-OHD levels on tumor response in HCC patients undergoing TACE.Results:43.1% of HCC patients showed 25-OHD deficiency. Baseline 25-OHD level was associated with liver cirrhosis (P = 0.025), vascular invasion (P = 0.031), Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage (P = 0.002) and an alanine aminotransferase increase after TACE (P = 0.021). Serum 25-OHD level was significantly decreased 1 day after TACE (P = 0.045). Multiple tumor numbers (P = 0.034) and low baseline 25-OHD levels (P = 0.040) were independently correlated with poor tumor response after TACE. ROC curve analysis showed that baseline 25-OHD levels present better predictive performance for OR in those patients, compared with other current clinical test pointers.Conclusion:Our study suggested that 25-OHD deficiency at baseline is a prognostic indicator for a poor tumor response in hepatocellular carcinoma treated with TACE.
