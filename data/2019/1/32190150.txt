Introduction:Although long non-coding RNA SNHG1 (lncRNA SNHG1) action on cell proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells has been reported, the effects of lncRNA SNHG1 on migration of HCC cells and the mechanisms are still unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of lncRNA SNHG1 on metastasis in HCC cells and the possible mechanisms underlying this phenotype.Material and methods:Expression of lncRNA SNHG1 and miR-195 was determined using qRT-PCR in both HCC cell lines Huh7 and HepG2. Si-RNA was used to silence SNHG1 and miR-195 inhibitor was used to inhibit expression of miR-195. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm whether miR-195 was the direct binding target of SNHG1.Results:lncRNA SNHG1 was significantly up-regulated and miR-195 was significantly down-regulated in HCC cell lines. When transfected with si-SNHG1, migration and invasion of HCC cells, as well as expression of astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG-1) protein, were significantly inhibited compared with the control cells. Results of dual luciferase reporter assay showed that lncRNA SNHG1 acted as an endogenous sponge of miR-195. On the other hand, the expression of miR-195 in tumor tissue was much lower than that of miR-195 in the corresponding normal tissue. Furthermore, the correlation analysis showed a strong negative relationship between lncRNA SNHG1 and miR-195 expression in HCC tissues.Conclusions:SNHG1 may promote cell invasion and migration in HCC cells by sponging miR-195. These results can provide deeper understanding of SNHG1 in hepatocellular cancer and give new potential targets for treatment of HCC.
