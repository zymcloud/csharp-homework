Interest is growing in finding natural sources of effective antitumor agents that generate fewer side effects than conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Avenanthramides (Avns) are such compounds; these phenolic molecules naturally occur in oats and have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects making them worthy of further research. The aim of this study is to characterise Avns' curative ability and antineoplastic activity on solid-form Ehrlich tumors. For the study, 75 female mice were randomly and equally allocated to five groups (group 1-control, group 2-DMSO, group 3-positive control receiving Avns, group 4-mice with Ehrlich solid tumor, and group 5-Ehrlich solid tumor treated with Avns). Mice with Ehrlich solid tumors exhibit increased tumor volume; elevated expression of AFP, ALT, AST, Bcl2, CEA, cholesterol, creatinine, urea, MDA, PCNA, potassium, triglycerides, TNF-α, and NF-κB; and a concomitant decline in catalase, GSH, P53, and SOD. In the mice with Ehrlich tumors who received Avns, there appeared to be improvement in NF-κB TNF-α, tumor markers (AFP and CEA), electrolytes, liver and kidney function enzymes, and lipid profiles; reduced MDA level; improved antioxidant parameters; normalised liver protein, P53, and PCNA; and reduced Bcl2 expression. Pathological examination of tumor lesions also indicated improvement. These results suggest that Avns exhibit antineoplastic activity and possess antioxidant properties that enhance the antioxidant defence system, thus reducing the oxidative stress caused by Ehrlich solid tumors.
