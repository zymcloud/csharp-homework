Introduction:Scarce reports have commented on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) behavior after direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).Aim:To analyze differences in tumor behavior between patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced HCC and were either treated or not using DAAs.Patients and methods:This case-control study includes patients with HCV-related HCC who received generic DAAs (group I) and all non-DAA treated patients with HCC who presented to our clinic during the same period (group II). Patient and tumor characteristics, treatment types and outcome were compared between the two groups.Results:Group I included 89 patients and group II included 207 patients. No significant difference was detected between groups regarding HCC number or size. Group I showed a more infiltrative HCC pattern, whereas group II had more circumscribed and delineated lesions. The incidence of portal vein thrombosis and significant lymphadenopathy was significantly higher in group I (P=0.03 and 0.03, respectively). Serum levels of Î±-fetoprotein were significantly higher in group I (P=0.02). These factors significantly affected the response to HCC management (P=0.03). Incidence of complete responses were 47.2 and 49.8% for groups I and II, respectively, whereas incomplete responses were 12.4 and 25.1%, respectively. Supportive treatment was applied to 40.4% in group I and 25.1% in group II.Conclusion:HCC behavior was more aggressive in DAA-treated patients regarding portal vein thrombosis, malignant lymphadenopathy, and HCC imaging characteristics, which affected the chance of ablation and the treatment response.
