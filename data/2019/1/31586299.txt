Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to be abnormally expressed in cancer, and lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs) play critical roles in tumour progression. SNHG3 has been identified as an oncogene in multiple tumour types. However, the role of SNHG3 in breast cancer has not been reported. In this study, we found that SNHG3 was upregulated and associated with tumour malignancy in patients with breast cancer. SNHG3 knockdown inhibited the growth and metastatic capabilities of breast cancer cells in vitro and vivo. We used bioinformatics prediction and functional assay validation to determine that SNHG3 upregulation inhibited miR-384 activity and led to hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) overexpression in breast cancer cells. The findings of this study show that SNHG3 functions as an oncogene in breast cancer and promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion by regulating the miR-384/HDGF axis. The present study might provide a new target for the treatment of breast cancer.
