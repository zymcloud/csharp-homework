Considerable evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) are dysregulated in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and their dysregulation may modulate the aggressiveness of GBM. Therefore, miRNAs with dysregulated expression are potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of GBM. miRNA‑876‑5p (miR‑876‑5p) has recently been identified to be aberrantly expressed and serve an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer. However, its expression pattern and functional significance in GBM remains largely unknown. Therefore, the present study detected miR‑876‑5p expression in GBM, examined the biological roles of miR‑876‑5p in GBM progression and explored its underlying mechanism. The present study demonstrated that miR‑876‑5p expression was significantly downregulated in GBM tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR‑876‑5p restricted the proliferation, induced the apoptosis and reduced the migration and invasion capabilities of GBM cells. In GBM cells, Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) was identified as a direct target of miR‑876‑5p. FOXM1 was overexpressed in clinical GBM tissues, and its overexpression was inversely correlated with miR‑876‑5p level. Small interfering RNA‑mediated knockdown of FOXM1 exhibited effects similar to those of miR‑876‑5p overexpression in GBM cells. The tumour suppressive roles of miR‑876‑5p overexpression in GBM cells were significantly reversed by FOXM1 reintroduction. Overall, the present results revealed that miR‑876‑5p may inhibit the development of GBM by directly targeting FOXM1, suggesting that this miRNA may be a potential therapeutic target in patients, for the management of GBM.
