The aim of the study was to comprehensively evaluate the clinical value of miR-125b-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its potential molecular mechanisms. MiR-125b-5p expression was remarkably lower as examined by real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 95 paired HCC and nonmalignant liver tissues in house (P
