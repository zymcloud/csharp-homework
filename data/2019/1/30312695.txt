Amount of evidence demonstrate that aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis and progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among them, miR-645 is recently recognized as cancer-related miRNA and its significance in HCC remains largely unknown. In this study, we reported for the first that miR-645 expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and its up-regulation was associated with malignant clinical features, including tumor size and venous infiltration and poor prognosis. Our data revealed that miR-645 promoted cell proliferation, colony formation and inhibited apoptosis by gain- and loss-of function experiments in vitro. In vivo assays showed that miR-645 overexpression enhanced tumor growth. Moreover, miR-645 directly bound to the SOX30 3'-UTR and post-transcriptionally repressed SOX30 expression in HCC cells. Furthermore, miR-645 inversely correlated with SOX30 expression in HCC tissues. Restoration of SOX30 expression at least partially abolished the biological effects of miR-645 on HCC cells. SOX30 regulated HCC progression through aberrant activation of p53 by directly binding to its promoter. Taken together, this research supports the first evidence that miR-645 exerts an oncogenic role in HCC progression and may be a therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
