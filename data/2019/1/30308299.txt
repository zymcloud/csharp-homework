The clinical translation remains a major challenge for platinum drug loaded nanoparticle due to the complexity of composition and preparation. Here we employed only three ingredients to prepare Pt (IV) prodrug-loaded ligand-induced self-assembled nanoparticles (GA-ALG@Pt NPs) via facile one-pot route for liver tumor treatment. GA-ALG@Pt NPs were found equipped with intelligently ligand self-shielded property in which the internal GA could be induced to expose by initial cellular recognition, resulting in strengthened cellular uptake (20%-30%) and prolonged blood circulation time (3.43 times). Appreciable tumor targeting ability (2 times) and especially tumor selectivity (2.5 times) were obtained. Glutathione-triggered release of therapeutic agent generated satisfactory antitumor effect. Bio-safety is also a distinguishing feature of GA-ALG@Pt NPs that greatly relief the nephrotoxicity and systematic toxicity of cisplatin. This conveniently synthesized nanoparticle processes superior targeting capacity and biosecurity, supplying an effective approach to translational cancer therapy in the future.
