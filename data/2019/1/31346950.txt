Background:Data on alcohol-related HCC are limited.Aims:Our aim was to describe the incidence, management, and prognosis of alcohol compared to Hepatitis C (HCV)-related HCC at a national level.Methods:Incident cases of HCC were identified in French healthcare databases between 2009 and 2012 and analyzed retrospectively. Demographic data, type, location, and annual HCC-caseload of the hospitals where patients were first managed were retrieved. Survival of incident cases was computed from the time of diagnosis and adjusted for potential confounding variables.Results:The study population included 14,060 incident cases of alcohol and 2581 HCV-related HCC. Alcohol-related HCC was more frequent than HCV-related HCC (29.37 and 5.39/100,000 adults/year, respectively) with an heterogeneous distribution on the French territory. The optimal treatment was less frequently curative (20.5% vs 35.9%; p Conclusion:In France, incidence of alcohol-related HCC is high and prognosis is poor compared to HCV-related HCC, with marked variations between regions. These results should guide future health policy initiatives pertaining to HCC care. Importantly, increasing patient' referral in expert centers could increase chances to receive curative treatment and improve outcomes.
