Clinical indications for liver transplantation (LT) in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are identical to those of patients with other chronic liver diseases that end in acute or semiacute liver failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Recurrent disease after LT has been reported in 10%-50% of patients with AIH, and the frequency of detection is influenced in part by the use of protocol or clinically indicated liver biopsy. De novo AIH connotes the development of AIH in patients transplanted for liver diseases other than AIH, and it has been reported in 5%-10% of pediatric and 1%-2% of adult recipients. Recurrent disease can negatively impact on graft and patient survival, and retransplantation has been required in 8%-23%. De novo AIH is within the spectrum of graft dysfunction that includes plasma cell-rich rejection, and it can also progress to cirrhosis and graft failure. Treatment for recurrent or de novo disease is based on the conventional regimens for AIH, and corticosteroid therapy alone or combined with azathioprine is standard. Better control of disease activity prior to LT has been associated with less recurrence, and maintenance corticosteroid treatment after LT can reduce its frequency. In conclusion, recurrent AIH is far more frequent than de novo AIH. Both may have negative impacts on graft and patient survival, and early detection and treatment are key objectives. Future investigations must codify the diagnostic criteria for each graft dysfunction, seek diagnostic biomarkers, and evaluate treatments that improve outcomes without increasing the risk of pre- and post-LT infections.
