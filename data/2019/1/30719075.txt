Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and prognosis remains poor. It has been increasingly recognized that liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are responsible for the carcinogenesis, recurrence, metastasis and chemoresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Targeting LCSCs is promising to be a new direction for the treatment of HCC. Herein, we summarize the potentially therapeutic targets in LCSCs at the level of genes, molecules and cells, such as knockout of oncogenes or oncoproteins, restoring the silent tumor suppressor genes, inhibition of the transcription factors and regulation of noncoding RNAs (including microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs) in LCSCs at the genetic level; inhibition of markers and blockade of the key signaling pathways of LCSCs at the molecular level; and inhibiting autophagy and application of oncolytic adenoviruses in LCSCs at the cellular level. Moreover, we analyze the potential targets in LCSCs to eliminate chemoresistance of HCC. Thereinto, the suppression of autophagy and Nanog by chloroquine and shRNA respectively may be the most promising targeting approaches. These targets may provide novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCC by targeting LCSCs.
