Sometimes, the presentation of some diseases can be fulminating. The authors present the case of a 51-year- old male brought to the emergency department visibly drunk and complaining of abdominal pain. Immediately, the diagnosis of hemorrhagic shock due to an accentuated drop of the hemoglobin level was made. After stabilization, he underwent a computed tomography of the abdomen, revealing a hepatocellular carcinoma with rupture of the Glisson capsule and massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage. With this case, the authors want to bring attention to a rare first presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma with a catastrophic result.
