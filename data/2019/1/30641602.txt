Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 α (HNF1α) mutations cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) type 3 and are associated with hepatocellular adenomatosis. Malignant transformation of HNF1α-mutated hepatocellular adenomas is rare. We report a case of a 28-year-old man with HNF1α-inactivated adenomatosis who developed an inflammatory adenoma with β catenin mutation with malignant transformation into a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
