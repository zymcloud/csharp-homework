Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) were involved in tumorigenesis, progression, recurrence, and drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). miR-365 was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and inhibited HCC cell proliferation and invasion. However, the role of miR-365 in liver cancer stem cells was unknown. Herein, we observed a remarkable decrease of miR-365 expression in CD133 or EpCAM-positive liver CSCs as well as in CSC-enriched hepatoma spheres. Up-regulated miR-365 suppressed liver CSC expansion by inhibiting the dedifferentiation of hepatoma cells and decreasing the self-renewal ability of liver CSCs. Mechanistically, bioinformatic and luciferase reporter analysis identified Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) as a direct target of miR-365. Overexpression of miR-365 in hepatoma cells downregulated the RAC1 mRNA and protein expression. RAC1 also could promote the expansion of liver CSCs. The special RAC1 inhibitor EHop-106 or RAC1 overexpression abolished the discrepancy in liver CSC proportion and the self-renewal capacity between miR-365 overexpression hepatoma cells and control cells, which further confirmed that RAC1 was required in miR-365-suppressed liver CSCs expansion. miR-365 was downregulated in liver CSCs and could inhibit HCC cells dedifferentiation and liver CSCs expansion by targeting RAC1 signaling.
