Our previous results suggested that EPS11, a novel marine bacterial polysaccharide, might be a potential drug candidate for human non-small cell lung carcinoma treatment. In this study, we further investigate the anticancer mechanisms against liver cancer and the anti-metastatic effects in vivo of EPS11. Firstly, we found that EPS11 exerts cytotoxic effects via blocking cell adhesion and destroying filiform structure formation in Huh7.5 cells. Moreover, mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of EPS11-treated Huh7.5 cells revealed that expression of many adhesion-related proteins was significantly changed. It is noteworthy that the expression of CD99, a key factor related to cell adhesion, migration and cell death, is remarkably down-regulated after EPS11 treatment. Importantly, over-expression of CD99 partly rescues cell death rate, and improves cell adhesion and migration ability in Huh7.5 treated by EPS11. Thus, we propose that CD99 is a potential action target of EPS11, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, adhesion and migration. Notably, administration of EPS11 simultaneously with tumor induction evidently reduces tumor nodule formation in the lungs, which strongly indicates that EPS11 has anti-metastatic effects in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that EPS11 inhibits liver cancer cell growth via blocking cell adhesion and attenuating filiform structure formation, and has potential as an anti-cancer drug, targeting metastasis of cancer cells, in the future.
