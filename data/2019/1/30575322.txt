Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignancy with poor prognosis. Complex genetic and epigenetic alterations are the two primary causes of HCC. The aim of the study was mainly to explore the correlation between the methylation status of DNAH17 and HCC.Methods:We evaluated the methylation levels of DNAH17 in 163 HCC samples and their paired normal tissue using Sequenom EpiTYPER assays and performed the TaqMan copy number assay to assess the copy number status of DNAH17 in HCC samples.Results:The mean methylation levels were significantly decreased in the tumor tissues compared to the paired normal tissues in both selected regions of DNAH17 (amplicon 1:58.7% vs 84.5%, P Conclusions:These findings suggested that aberrant methylation of DNAH17 was associated with comprehensive HCC clinicopathological factors and could be a promising biomarker for tumor thrombosis in HCC patients.
