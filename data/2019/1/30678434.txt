Background: Due to the prevalence of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Saudi Arabia, using new markers to give best diagnostic performance than alpha-feto protein (AFP) are important in early diagnosis. The aim of this work was to compare the significance between serum and mRNA Golgi glypican73 (GP-73) as newly identified diagnostic and prognostic markers for HCC among Saudi patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 300 subjects were divided into: 250 blood samples where 145 samples from HCC, 105 samples from chronic liver cirrhosis (CLC) and 50 normal controls were investigated for serum GP73 (sGP73) by ELISA. GP-73 mRNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was amplified by RT-PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of both techniques was compared. Results: Serum Golgi glypican 73 was significantly higher in HCC group compared to cirrhotic and normal controls (p
