Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States. The NAFLD subtype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, represents a progressive form of the disease that can lead to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is a diagnosis of exclusion and is strongly related to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Although there has been an explosion of exciting therapeutic avenues for NAFLD in recent years, the bedrock of management continues to be lifestyle modification, weight loss, and optimization of metabolic risk factors.
