An 81-year-old man with a large hepatocellular carcinoma was referred in our institution for Y radioembolization (RE). The preliminary arteriography using Tc-macroaggregate albumin demonstrated an important hepatopulmonary shunt. It was an exclusion criterion for RE due to high risks of lung radiations. Then, the patient was treated with sorafenib during 4 months, stopped because of grade 3 toxicity. A second liver arteriography was performed, and Tc-macroaggregate albumin imaging showed an important reduction of the lung shunt. Transient therapy with sorafenib permitted to close the lung shunt and was a bridge for RE.
