Objective:To retrospectively review the frequency, patterns and intra-abdominal sites of metastatic invasive lobular breast cancer, and to correlate the findings with overall survival.Materials and methods:From a pathology database search revealing 327 patients with metastatic lobular breast cancer at our institution from January 2004 through August 2014, imaging was available in 116 patients (age range, 31-87 years, mean age, 55). Simple descriptive statistics were performed to record and tabulate the abdominal metastatic spread. Prognostic significance of abdominal metastases and individual abdominal metastatic sites was studied using the Log-rank test and construction of Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:The most frequent sites of intra-abdominal metastatic invasive lobular breast cancer were peritoneum (55 patients, 47%), followed by liver (37 patients, 32%), bowel (34 patients, 29%), ovary (33 patients, 28%), retroperitoneum (16 patients, 14%), ureter (16 patients, 14%), and lymph nodes (15 patients, 13%). Bowel obstruction was noted in 15 patients (13%) and hydronephrosis in 25 patients (22%). The median abdominal metastasis-free survival was 76 months (interquartile range: 17-191). The overall survival (OS) was 86 months (interquartile range: 49-188). Patients with abdominal metastases had shorter OS. Patients with hepatic metastases had shorter overall survival than those patients without hepatic metastases (p = 0.02, Log-Rank test).Conclusion:Invasive lobular breast cancer has a predilection for metastasizing to both typical (liver) and atypical intra-abdominal sites (peritoneum, GI tract, and adnexa). Presence of intra-abdominal disease and hepatic metastases in patients with ILC negatively affects overall survival.
