Objectives:To use Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) categorization and features of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) to intraindividually compare gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-DTPA-MRI) and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI), before and after applying modified major features.Methods:Of 77 HCCs in 64 patients analysed, 17 HCCs were confirmed histopathologically and 46 patients had cirrhosis. Gd-EOB-MRI and Gd-DTPA-MRI were evaluated for the presence of major and ancillary features by two radiologists. LI-RADS categorization was done for Gd-DTPA-MRI (LI-RADS-DTPA) and for Gd-EOB-MRI before and after applying modified major features (hepatobiliary phase [HBP] hypointensity as an additional major feature, LI-RADS-EOBm1; HBP hypointense rim as capsule appearance, LI-RADS-EOBm2; and transitional phase [TP] hypointensity as washout appearance, LI-RADS-EOBm3). Sensitivities of LR-5 categorization for the diagnosis of HCC were compared.Results:Washout (p=0.012) and capsule appearance (pConclusion:Modifying LI-RADS for use with Gd-EOB-MRI, such as applying HBP hypointensity as an additional major feature or using TP hypointensity as washout appearance, can improve the sensitivity for the detection of HCC.Key points:• Adding HBP hypointensity as additional major feature improved sensitivity of LR-5 categorization. • Adding TP hypointensity as modified washout appearance improved sensitivity of LR-5 categorization. • Sensitivities for LR-5 classification were comparable between LI-RADS-DTPA, LI-RADS-EOBm1, and LI-RADS-EOBm3.
