Worldwide increasing prevalence of obesity and lifestyle changes has put nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as the most prevalent liver disease of the coming decade. NAFLD not only causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but also acts as a component of metabolic syndrome together with obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dyslipidemia. Consequently, its mutual cause-and-effect interactions have brought a huge clinical and financial burden to patients and society.
