Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a disease of small bile ducts, which can lead to morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to assess recent trends in mortality and healthcare use of PBC patients in the Medicare program. Data from Medicare beneficiaries between 2005 and 2015 (5% random samples) were used. The diagnosis of PBC was established with International Classification of Diseases-9 code 571.6 used for both primary and secondary diagnoses. Mortality was assessed by Medicare-linked death registry. Healthcare use included episodes of care, length of stay, and total charges/payments. Independent predictors of outcomes were evaluated in multiple generalized linear or logistic regression models. The study cohort included a total of 6,375 inpatient/outpatient Medicare beneficiaries (mean age 69.8 years, 17% male, 88% white, and 18% with disability). Over the study period, 1-year mortality remained stable (9.1% to 14.3%, P = 0.11). Independent predictors of 1-year mortality were older age, male gender, black race, the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, and higher Charlson score. Outpatient total yearly charges and payments per beneficiary with PBC increased from $3,065 and $777 (2005) to $5,773 and $967 (2014), respectively. Similarly, inpatient total yearly charges and payments per beneficiary with PBC increased from $59,765 and $19,406 (2007), to $98,941 and $27,948 (2013), respectively (P
