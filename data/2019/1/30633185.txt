Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a component of ISG (Interferon-Stimulated Gene) family. The association between IFITM3 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported. While the relationship between this genetic variation and the progress of HCC remains unclear. To address this issue, we explore the relationship between the IFITM3-rs12252 genetic variants and the progression of HCC in this study.A total of 336 candidates were enrolled in the study, including 156 patients with HBV related HCC and 180 patients with chronic Hepatitis B infections or liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B were diagnosed with clinical characteristics and staging, laboratory testing, and imaging results of viral infection and hepatic damage. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to determine the gene polymorphism of IFITM3, and analyzed with the GraphPad Prism v 5.The patients with HCC had a significantly higher proportion of IFITM3 rs12252-CC as compared with the patients with chronic HBV infection or liver cirrhosis. Moreover, the distribution of CC genotype in HCC patients with low differentiation was significantly higher than that in those with high differentiation. Furthermore, the patients with CC genotype were found with bigger tumor size, higher percentage of vascular thrombosis, higher distribution of low differentiation and higher 5-year relapse rate than those with CT/TT genotypes.This study indicates a correlation between the IFITM3-rs12252 CC genotype and the progression of HCC.
