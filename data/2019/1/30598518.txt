BACKGROUND Patients with massive ascites (MA) after liver transplantation (LT, defined here as daily ascitic drainage more than 1000 ml per day for more than 7 days after liver transplantation) are at increased risks of infection, hypoalbuminemia, graft loss, and even mortality. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the effects of somatostatin on patients with MA after LT. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-eight patients with liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent LT complicated by MA postoperatively were included. Ten participants were receiving somatostatin therapy. The postoperative course and adverse drug effects were investigated. Daily postoperative ascitic drainage and urine output were also recorded and compared to those in the non-somatostatin group. RESULTS The somatostatin group had significantly less ascites drainage after LT compared to the non-somatostatin group (p=0.002). Urine output was significantly increased after somatostatin administration (p
