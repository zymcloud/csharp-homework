A 53-year-old man with tentative diagnosis of likely hepatocellular carcinoma underwent FDG PET/CT, which showed intense activity in both right lobe and caudate lobe of the liver. However, pathology examination from biopsy showed neuroendocrine tumor. He received transarterial chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy. Posttherapy follow-up FDG PET/CT revealed no abnormal FDG activity in the liver.
