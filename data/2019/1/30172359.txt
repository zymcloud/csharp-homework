Background:Patients undergoing hepatectomy often require packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion, which has been associated with worse oncologic outcomes. However, limited data exist regarding the impact of PRBC donor factors. We hypothesized that PRBC donor age impacts survival after hepatectomy for non-hepatocellular malignancies.Methods:Patients who underwent hepatectomy for non-hepatocellular malignancy from 2005 to 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. Impact of clinicopathologic and PRBC factors on oncologic outcomes were assessed.Results:Of 149 identified patients, 76 received a perioperative PRBC transfusion (median 2 units). Transfusion was associated with increased median length of stay (8 vs. 6 days; p < 0.01) and median operative blood loss (700 vs. 350 mL; p < 0.01) versus non-transfused, respectively. In transfused patients, receipt of PRBC from older donors compared to younger resulted in decreased RFS (0.94 vs. 2.63 years, respectively; p = 0.02) and OS (1.94 vs. 3.44 years, respectively; p = 0.6). The PRBC donor age was an independent predictor of decreased recurrence free survival on multivariate analysis (HR 2.5, p = 0.04).Conclusions:In patients undergoing hepatectomy for non-hepatocellular malignancies and receiving perioperative transfusion, PRBC donor age may impact survival and warrants further investigation.
