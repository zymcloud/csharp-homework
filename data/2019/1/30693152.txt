Background:Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1/TTK) is an apical dual-specificity protein kinase in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that guarantees accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. High levels of Mps1 are found in various types of human malignancies, such as glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. Several potent inhibitors of Mps1 exist, and exhibit promising activity in many cell cultures and xenograft models. However, resistance due to point mutations in the kinase domain of Mps1 limits the therapeutic effects of these inhibitors. Understanding the detailed resistance mechanism induced by Mps1 point mutations is therefore vital for the development of novel inhibitors against malignancies.Methods:In this study, conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) simulation were performed to elucidate the resistance mechanisms of Cpd-5, a potent Mps1 inhibitor, induced by the four representative mutations I531M, I598F, C604Y, S611R.Results:Our results from conventional MD simulation combined with structural analysis and free energy calculation indicated that the four mutations weaken the binding affinity of Cpd-5 and the major variations in structural were the conformational changes of the P-loop, A-loop and Î±C-helix. Energetic differences of per-residue between the WT system and the mutant systems indicated the mutations may allosterically regulate the conformational ensemble and the major variations were residues of Ile-663 and Gln-683, which located in the key loops of catalytic loop and A-loop, respectively. The large conformational and energetic differences were further supported by the GaMD simulations. Overall, these obtained molecular mechanisms will aid rational design of novel Mps1 inhibitors to combat inhibitor resistance.
