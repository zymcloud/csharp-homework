Liver cancer is still one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. This study is dedicated to developing a multi-long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) model for risk stratification and prognosis prediction on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We first downloaded lncRNA expression profiles and corresponding clinical information of patients with liver cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs between HCC samples and normal samples were identified. In total, 308 patients with HCC were randomly divided into a training group (n = 154) and a testing group (n = 154). Univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression analyses were performed to select the best survival-related candidates from these DE lncRNAs in the training set. Seven lncRNAs (AC009005.2, RP11-363N22.3, RP11-932O9.10, RP11-572O6.1, RP11-190C22.8, RP11-388C12.8, and ZFPM2-AS1) were finally identified and used to construct a seven-lncRNA signature. The signature could classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different overall survival. The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve for the signature to predict 5-year survival reached more than 0.75. Besides, the prognostic value of the seven-lncRNA signature was independent of conventional clinical factors. The predictive performance of the signature was further validated in the testing set and the whole set. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the seven prognostic lncRNAs may be involved in several essential biological processes and pathways. The current study demonstrated the potential clinical implications of the seven-lncRNA signature for survival prediction of patients with HCC.
