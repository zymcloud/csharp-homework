Background:Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can modulate various biological processes by influencing microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and altering target selection. Common SNPs may alter the processing of miRNA and may be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the relationship between miR-499A>G, miR-149C>T, miR-196a2T>C, and miR-146aG>C and HCC susceptibility, examining the interaction of the miRNAs with hepatitis B virus (HBV).Methods:We evaluated the associations of miR-499A>G (rs3746444), miR-149C>T (rs2292832), miR-196a2T>C (rs11614913), and miR-146aG>C (rs2910164) with HCC susceptibility in 100 HCC patients (70 males and 30 females) and 120 healthy controls (70 males and 50 females), using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.Results:For miR-499A>G, the frequencies of the AG genotype and G allele were higher in female HCC patients than in female controls (P=0.02 and 0.045, respectively). The frequency of the A allele was higher in HBV-positive HCC patients than in controls (P=0.019). For miR-149C>T, the frequency of the CC genotype was higher in female HCC patients than in female controls (P=0.009). For miR-196a2T>C, the frequencies of the CT and CC genotypes and the C allele were higher in HBV-positive HCC patients than in controls (P<0.001, P=0.009, and P<0.001, respectively). The frequencies of miR-146aG>C polymorphisms did not differ between HCC patients and controls.Conclusions:miR-499A>G, miR-149C>T, and miR-196a2T>C were associated with the development of HCC in women and/or that of HBV-related HCC. They can be considered genetic risk factors for the development of HCC among Iranians.
