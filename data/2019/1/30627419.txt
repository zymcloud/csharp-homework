Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the role of XPD in migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.Methods:The expression of XPD and miR-29a-3p was examined by western blot and qRT-PCR, cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay, cell migration was detected by transwell assay. TargetScan was used to predict potential targets of miR-29a-3p.Results:In this study, we found that the expression of XPD and miR-29a-3p was downregulated in HCC samples and HCC cell lines. XPD suppressed proliferation and migration of HCC cell via regulating miR-29a-3p expression. Target prediction analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed Mdm2 and PDGF-B were direct targets of miR-29a-3p, and miR-29a-3p suppressed proliferation and migration of HCC cells via regulating the expression of Mdm2 or PDGF-B.Conclusions:Our data indicated that XPD suppressed cell proliferation and migration via miR-29a-3p-Mdm2/PDGF-B axis in HCC.
