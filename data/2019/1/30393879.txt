Metastasis to the thyroid is very rare in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and only a few cases have been reported. Herein, we report a rare case of metastatic HCC to the thyroid in a 63-year-old man and discuss the various radiologic findings. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a heterogeneous enhancing mass that had invaded the thyroid cartilage in the left upper thyroid, compressing the airway. Ultrasonography (US) showed a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass with increased vascularity in the peripheral portion. The mass showed focal intense uptake on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). The patient underwent US-guided core needle biopsy and the final diagnosis was metastatic HCC.
