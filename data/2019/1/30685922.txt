Objective: To investigate the inhibitory effect of AKR1B10 inhibitor combined with sorafenib on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) xenograft growth. Methods: HepG2 xenograft model was established in nude mice. The mice were then randomly divided into four groups: control group, epalrestat monotherapy group, sorafenib monotherapy group and combination treatment group. Tumor volume, tumor weight, T/C ratio and the change in body weight of nude mice in each group were compared to evaluate the curative effect. Immunohistochemistry staining was used to detect the expression of Ki-67 in tumor tissues to evaluate the proliferation status of tumor cells. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the differences between the groups. Student's t-test was used to test means of two groups and chi-square test was used for multiple samples. Results: The differences of the grafted tumor volume before and after treatment between the control group, epalrestat group, sorafenib group and combined therapy group was 238.940 ± 39.813, 124.991 ± 84.670, -26.111 ± 11.518, and -54.072 ± 17.673(mm(3)), respectively, (F = 37.048, P < 0.001). The tumor mass were 0.273 ± 0.140, 0.158 ± 0.078, 0.079 ± 0.054, 0.045 ± 0.024 (g), (F = 16.594, P < 0.001); T/C ratio were 100%, 57.9%, 28.9%, 16.5%, and Ki-67 positive rate were 23.295 ± 6.218, 13.503 ± 3.392, 7.325 ± 2.257, 4.664 ± 1.189 (%), (χ(2) = 822.203, P < 0.001) . The tumor volume (t = -3.579, P = 0.002) and Ki-67 positive rate (t = -10.003, P < 0.001) in epalrestat monotherapy group were significantly lower than control group. The tumor volume (t = 2.056, P = 0.025), tumor mass (t = 2.101, P = 0.043), and Ki-67 positive rate (t = -2.850, P = 0.005) in combination treatment group were significantly lower than sorafenib monotherapy group. Compared with the control group, the body weight of nude mice in the treatment group decreased to a certain extent, but there was no statistically significant difference between epalrestat monotherapy group and control group (t = -1.599, P = 0.262), and combined therapy and sorafenib monotherapy group (t = -0.051, P = 0.96). Conclusion: AKR1B10 inhibitor enhanced the inhibitory effect of sorafenib on hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft.
