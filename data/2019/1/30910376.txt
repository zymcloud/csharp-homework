Objective:We aimed to evaluate oncological outcomes after repeat metastasectomies in patients having undergone previous resections for colorectal cancer metastases.Methods:We examined 248 patients who underwent metastasectomies for lung and/or liver metastases at our center during a 7-year period, from January 2005 to December 2011. Recurrence-free survival 1 (RFS1) after the metastasectomy for the initial recurrence, recurrence-free survival 2 (RFS2) after the second, and recurrence-free survival 3 (RFS3) after the third repeated resections for recurrence were assessed. The overall survival (OS) rate after the first metastasectomy for the first recurrence (OS) was also assessed.Results:Sites of recurrence of the first metastasectomy were the liver, lung, and liver and lung in 115, 117, and 16 cases, respectively, and 133 patients had a second recurrence (133/248, 53.6%). Twenty-seven patients had a third recurrence (27/52, 51.9%), of whom 14 underwent a third metastasectomy. The 5-year and 10-year OS rates were 74.8% and 57.9%, respectively. The 1-year RFS1, RFS2, and RFS3 rates were 76%, 75%, and 39%, respectively. The hazard ratios for RFS were 1.142 and 2.590 for the first and second repeat surgeries, when compared to the first metastasectomy. The third metastasectomy showed significantly lower RFS than did the second metastasectomy.Conclusion:A second metastasectomy should be considered the optimal treatment for a second recurrence. However, careful considerations should be made before performing a third metastasectomy.
