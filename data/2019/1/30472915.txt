Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that primarily affects the respiratory system and often leads to respiratory failure and premature death. Although pulmonary complications contribute to 85% of deaths, non-pulmonary complications are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in adults with CF. Areas covered: This review summarizes acute and chronic non-pulmonary complications in CF patients, with emphasis on emerging complications and in the context of the current growth and aging of the CF adult population. It also addresses the potential benefits of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy. Complications that occur after solid organ (e.g. lung and/or liver) transplantation have been excluded. The review is based on an extensive search of the available literature, using PubMed and international guidelines, and on the authors' clinical experience. Expert commentary: Acute non-pulmonary complications have been well described but should be recognized and managed carefully. Managing chronic non-pulmonary complications is an important and changing aspect of CF patient care, particularly with the emergence of novel complications in adults. Early detection of non-pulmonary complications is essential to the development of prevention and treatment strategies that aim to further improve the survival and health status of adult CF patients.
