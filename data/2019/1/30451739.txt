Background:With increasing US adiposity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is now a leading liver transplant (LT) indication. Given its association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the burden of NASH is substantial. We analyzed birth cohort effects among NASH LT registrants, with and without HCC.Methods:All new LT registrants in United Network for Organ Sharing (1995-2015) were identified. Birth cohorts were defined as: 1936-1940, 1941-1945, 1946-1950, 1951-1955, 1956-1960, 1961-1965, 1966-1970, 1971-2015. Poisson regression examined trends in LT registration, by disease etiology (NASH, hepatitis C virus [HCV], other liver disease etiologies [OTHER]), and HCC.Results:We identified 182 368 LT registrants with median age of 52 years (range, 0-86 years). Nine percent (n = 16 160) had NASH, 38% (n= 69 004) HCV, 53% (n = 97 204) OTHER. HCC was present in: 13% (n = 2181), 27% (n = 18 295), and 11% (n = 10 902), of NASH, HCV, and OTHER, respectively. Liver transplant registration for HCC increased significantly from 2002 to 2015 across all etiologies (NASH, 6%-18%; HCV, 19%-51%; OTHER, 9%-16%; P Conclusions:NASH LT registrants, with and without HCC, have increased over time, and are projected to increase unabated in the future, notably among younger birth cohorts ("Adipose Wave Effect"). HCC LT registration patterns demonstrate that, compared with HCV, NASH patients encompass younger birth cohorts. These data illustrate that the full impact of NASH on demand for LT is yet to be realized.
