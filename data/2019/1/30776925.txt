Purpose:This study aimed to assess the safety and technical feasibility of percutaneous ablation therapy for lymph node (LN) metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:A total of 31 consecutive HCC patients with LN metastases who were treated with ablation were included in this retrospective study. Percutaneous ablation was performed under local anesthesia and computed tomography-guidance. The primary endpoint was technique success; secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local progression-free survival (LPFS). Survival curves were constructed using Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The median diameter of metastatic LNs was 30 mm (range, 10-77 mm). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 74.6%, 50.3%, and 50.3%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year PFS rates were 24.7%, 0%, and not available for calculation (NA), respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year LPFS rates were 78.7%, 69.9%, and 69.9%, respectively. The technique success and technical effectiveness rates were 100% and 64.5%, respectively. The technical effectiveness rates were 65.4% (17/26) and 60% (3/5) in abdominal LN metastases and distant LN metastases, respectively. Only one patient (1/31, 3.2%) had major complications (massive pleural effusion and severe pneumonia) related to ablation. Minor complications related to ablation included mild abdominal pain (10/31, 32.3%) and self-limiting hematoma (2/31, 6.5%). No ablation-related death occurred.Conclusion:Percutaneous ablation appears to be a safe and feasible method for treatment of metastatic LNs in patients with HCC.
