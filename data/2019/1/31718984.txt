In the liver, obesity is often manifested by the clinical disorder of the Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). A proportion of NAFLD patients develop hepatic inflammation, known as Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), which can end up in cirrhosis, or Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). In this scenario, partial hepatectomy (PH) is an alternative to promote liver regeneration. However, as liver regeneration is impaired in NASH patients, more knowledge about its metabolic condition is needed to improve the regenerative response of the liver in this pathological condition. Although extensively employed, the panoply of molecular alterations involved in the regenerative response of the liver after partial hepatectomy PH is far from being fully characterized. Metabolic fingerprinting (metabolomics) is a powerful tool to help in the elucidation of complex metabolic networks, by means of a blind, na√Øve approach to study which metabolic nodes (metabolites) show the biggest variations between conditions. The objective of the present study was to gain deeper knowledge about the metabolic processes involved in the NASH animal model, and particularly in the effect of PH by using metabolomics. For achieving such information, twelve 8-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice, fed commercial chow (control diet) or methionine and choline-Deficient diet (MCD) for three weeks were subjected to PH and sacrificed 2 weeks later. Livers were removed and submitted to metabolic profiling analysis through RP-LC/MS (qTOF), GC/MS (qTOF) and CE/MS(TOF). More than 3000 different features were detected and repeated measurements one-way ANOVA analysis was performed to unveil significant features. MCD diet induced changes (p
