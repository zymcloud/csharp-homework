Background:Hepatitis B virus is a viral infection that can lead to acute and/or chronic liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B vaccination is 95% effective in preventing infection and the development of chronic liver disease and HCC due to hepatitis B. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control updated their guidelines recommending that adults at high-risk for hepatitis B infection be vaccinated against hepatitis B including those with diabetes mellitus (DM). We hypothesize that adults at high-risk for hepatitis B infection are not being adequately screened and/or vaccinated for hepatitis B in a large urban healthcare system.Aim:To investigate clinical factors associated with Hepatitis B screening and vaccination in patients at high-risk for Hepatitis B infection.Methods:We conducted a retrospective review of 999 patients presenting at a large urban healthcare system from 2012-2017 at high-risk for hepatitis B infection. Patients were considered high-risk for hepatitis B infection based on hepatitis B practice recommendations from the Center for Disease Control. Medical history including hepatitis B serology, concomitant medical diagnoses, demographics, insurance status and social history were extracted from electronic health records. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify clinical risk factors independently associated with hepatitis B screening and vaccination.Results:Among the 999 patients, 556 (55.7%) patients were screened for hepatitis B. Of those who were screened, only 242 (43.5%) patients were vaccinated against hepatitis B. Multivariate regression analysis revealed end-stage renal disease [odds ratio (OR): 5.122; 2.766-9.483], alcoholic hepatitis (OR: 3.064; 1.020-9.206), and cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease (OR: 1.909; 1.095-3.329); all P < 0.05 were associated with hepatitis B screening, while age (OR: 0.785; 0.680-0.906), insurance status (0.690; 0.558-0.854), history of DM (OR: 0.518; 0.364-0.737), and human immunodeficiency virus (OR: 0.443; 0.273-0.718); all P < 0.05 were instead not associated with hepatitis B screening. Of the adults vaccinated for hepatitis B, multivariate regression analysis revealed age (OR: 0.755; 0.650-0.878) and DM were not associated with hepatitis B vaccination (OR: 0.620; 0.409-0.941) both P < 0.05.Conclusion:Patients at high-risk for hepatitis B are not being adequately screened and/or vaccinated. Improvements in hepatitis B vaccination should be strongly encouraged by all healthcare systems.
