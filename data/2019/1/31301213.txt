Aim:To retrospectively investigate the potential benefit of ultrasound-ultrasound (US-US) overlay fusion guidance for local controllability of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients (n = 101) with 121 HCCs (mean ± SD, 1.8 ± 0.7 cm) who underwent RFA guided by US-US overlay fusion were included in the retrospective study. By overlaying pre/postoperative US, the tumor image could be projected onto the ablative hyperechoic zone. The ablative margin could thereby be evaluated three-dimensionally during the RFA procedure. As a control group, all 325 patients with 453 HCCs who underwent conventional RFA during the same study period were selected.Results:The total number of RF needle insertions per tumor for ablation was significantly more in the US overlay fusion group (mean 1.9 vs. 1.2; P Conclusions:US-US overlay fusion guidance can be highly effective for safety margin achievement in RFA for HCC, providing a lower risk of local tumor progression.
