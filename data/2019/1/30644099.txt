Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as an initial factor and promoter in different tumors as a kind of ncRNAs. The length of them is >200 nucleotides opposite small ncRNAs. Increasing researches have proved that dysregulation lncRNA has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 20 (SNHG20), a member of lncRNAs, expresses frequently in cancer types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and bladder cancer, contributing to cancer development and progression by transcriptional or posttranscriptional modifications. Not only does this review show the recent published literature concerning the biological functions but also demonstrates molecular mechanisms of SNHG20 among above multiple malignancies and others.
