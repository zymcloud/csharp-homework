To identify hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-implicated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), we performed an integrative omics analysis by integrating mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles in HCC tissues. We identified a collection of candidate HCC-implicated lncRNAs. Among them, we demonstrated that an lncRNA, which is named as p53-stabilizing and activating RNA (PSTAR), inhibits HCC cell proliferation and tumorigenicity through inducing p53-mediated cell cycle arrest. We further revealed that PSTAR can bind to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) and enhance its SUMOylation and thereby strengthen the interaction between hnRNP K and p53, which ultimately leads to the accumulation and transactivation of p53. PSTAR is down-regulated in HCC tissues, and the low PSTAR expression predicts poor prognosis in patients with HCC, especially those with wild-type p53. Conclusion: This study sheds light on the tumor suppressor role of lncRNA PSTAR, a modulator of the p53 pathway, in HCC.
