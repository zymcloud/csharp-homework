Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections represent a global health problem and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, timely diagnosis of hepatitis B is crucial to ensure adequate treatment. We developed a powerful and rapid whole blood-based cytokine release assay assessing cellular immune responses to HBV antigens. IL-2 and IFNγ release in this assay depicts hepatitis B vaccination status. Of note, CHB goes along with elevated C5a concentrations in plasma. We aim at mimicking the proinflammatory microenvironment associated with HBV infection to enhance the diagnostic quality of our HBV specific cytokine release assay. We specifically investigated the potential of the complement factors C3a and C5a as costimulators and analyzed their potential effects on activation marker expression on T cells and antigen presenting cells.Results:Whole blood from 87 healthy individuals (n = 59 hepatitis B vaccinated, n = 28 unvaccinated) was stimulated with HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in presence or absence of C3a or C5a, respectively. Further, C3a and C5a were used in combination to investigate potential synergistic effects. IL-2 and IFNγ levels in plasma were quantified using ELISA. Complement factor C5a specifically enhances HBsAg-mediated IL-2 (690.3 ± 195.4 pg/ml vs. 789.4 ± 216.5 pg/ml) and IFNγ (146.0 ± 43.1 pg/ml vs. 336.7 ± 67.9 pg/ml) responses in whole blood. Similar cytokine levels were measured when both C3a and C5a were used. With a diagnostic specificity of 90% the IFNγ release assay reached a diagnostic sensitivity of 49.2% upon whole blood stimulation with HBsAg alone, but of 78.9% when HBsAg was combined with C3a and C5a.Conclusions:Innate signals mediated via complement pathways contribute to HBV-specific cellular immune responses. The massively improved diagnostic sensitivity of the IFNγ release assay after addition of C3a and C5a demonstrates that these effects render whole blood-based cytokine release assays even more potent as screening tools in HBV immunology and HBV vaccination studies.
