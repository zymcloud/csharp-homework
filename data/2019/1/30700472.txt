Fusobacterium infections can have a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from mild infections to severe sepsis and abscess formation. This range depends partly on the patient's underlying conditions, such as immunosuppression or malignancy. Fusobacteria are commensal rods in the oropharyngeal cavity and digestive tract, but should mucosal barrier disruption occur, in the presence of the above-mentioned predisposing conditions, fusobacteria can spread and cause infections in the soft tissues, liver and so on. An elderly woman was admitted with an altered level of consciousness (lethargy). The ensuing workup revealed a posterior oral cavity tumour (squamous cell carcinoma), Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteraemia and liver abscesses. Due to the severe sepsis, the patient was referred to our intensive care unit, but she passed away despite antibiotic treatment.
