Background:Although gout is a common disease, the presence of gouty tophi outside joints is rare and in literature, there is to date only one report of hepatic tophaceous nodule. We would like to highlight here the difficult diagnostic workup in a patient with history of cancer and the presence of a tophus inside the liver. Moreover, we address the possible etiologic role of chronic inflammation related to tophi and liver cancer.Case presentation:We present the case of a 72-year-old man with a localization of gouty tophus in the liver, who thereafter developed a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the same site. The patient was followed up after surgery for left renal cancer from 1992 to 2011, when a hepatic nodule was discovered for the first time. After a detailed evaluation, the nodule was classified as a urate tophus of the liver. However, further follow-up showed that the nodule increased in size and changed its characteristics, bringing to the diagnosis of HCC.Conclusions:With the present case report, we would discuss the possible neoplastic degeneration of a gouty tophus and its etiologic role favouring cellular degeneration linked to chronic inflammation. We would also highlight the importance of histopathological evaluation of hepatic lesions in gouty patients at high risk of liver neoplasm, due to the difficulty in characterizing gouty tophi by imaging.
