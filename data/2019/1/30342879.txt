Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection of humans was first reported in 1977, and now it is now estimated that 15-20 million people are infected worldwide. Infection with HDV can be an acute or chronic process that occurs only in patients with an hepatitis B virus infection. Chronic HDV infection commonly results in the most rapidly progressive form of viral hepatitis; it is the chronic viral infection that is most likely to lead to cirrhosis, and it is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. HDV infection is the only chronic human hepatitis virus infection without a therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Peginterferon alfa is the only recommended therapy, but it produces unsatisfactory results. We review therapeutic agents in development, designed to disrupt the HDV life cycle, that might benefit patients with this devastating disease.
