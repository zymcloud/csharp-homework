Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. More than 90% of primary HCC is HCC. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol consumption have been widely accepted as two major risk factors for developing HCC. Herein, we aimed to identify DNA methylation genes related to both HCV infection and alcohol consumption. In this study, we identified methylation genes that were associated with the risk of HCV infection and alcohol consumption, respectively, by a large-scale bioinformatic analysis. Through PPI network analysis, we revealed the associations between the two types of genes and found six hub genes-TAF1, SAT1, Phospholipase C-beta 2, FGD1, ARHGAP4, and ARHGEF9-that may be associated with both HCV infection and alcohol consumption. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was used to analyze the function which these genes in the network enriched. Among them, TAF1, SAT1, and ARHGEF9 were methylated genes that have been found to be related to tumor progression in HCC patients. Through independent data sets, we verified the methylation pattern of these six genes in HCC samples that had both HCV infection and alcohol consumption risks. Furthermore, we found that three of the six methylated genes were also associated with the prognosis of HCC patients. To summarize, we identified six hub genes that were associated with both HCV infection and alcohol consumption in the progress of HCC. The six methylation genes that might play an important role in both HCV infection and alcohol consumption would be potential therapy targets for HCC.
