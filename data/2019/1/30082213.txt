Background:Whether clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) is a contraindication of partial hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. The aim was to assess the impact of CSPH on surgical morbidity, mortality and long-term survival of HCC patients who underwent partial hepatectomy.Methods:A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted through analyzing the data published before October 2016 on outcomes following partial hepatectomy for HCC patients with CSPH from the Medline, Embase and CENTRAL databases and related literature.Results:A total of 16 studies involving 4029 patients met the inclusion criteria. HCC patients with CSPH had increased incidences of severe postoperative complications (pooled odds ratio [OR]: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.31-2.10), surgical mortality (2.56, 1.77-3.70) and 5-year mortality (1.29, 1.11-1.50) compared with patients without CSPH. Subgroup analysis suggested that CSPH had no impact on peri-operative mortality and long-term survival for European HCC patients whose CSPH was diagnosed by the standard surrogate criteria (1.95, 0.96-3.96; 1.24, 0.98-1.55).Conclusions:CSPH had a negative impact on short- and long-term prognoses for HCC patients undergoing partial hepatectomy. However, CSPH did not affect the prognoses in a subgroup of European HCC patients whose CSPH was diagnosed by the standard surrogate criteria.
