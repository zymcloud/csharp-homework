Objective: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy. Sorafenib is the first-line systemic treatment for advanced HCCs. However, due to safety concerns, researchers are now looking for ways to boost the efficacy of the medication. One approach for reducing toxicity is combining sorafenib with other agents so that a lower dose of sorafenib is required. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can have an inhibitory effect on HCC tumor growth. Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Conditioned Medium (MSC-CM) is the substance extracted from MSC culture and contains most of the potential cytokines secreted by MSCs. We, therefore, anticipated a synergistic Antitumor Effect of sorafenib in Combination with MSC-CM. In this study, we used HepG2 as our target cell lines. Methods: HepG2 cells were treated with sorafenib alone and with sorafenib + MSC-CM. CCK-8 assay was used to evaluate and compare the inhibition of cell growth between the two groups with different treatments. Results: The combination treatment of cell lines with sorafenib and MSC-CM had significantly reduced the values of IC50 compared to the use of sorafenib alone (3.4 vs. 2.7 respectively). Conclusion: This study suggests that a combination of sorafenib with MSC-CM can synergistically suppress the growth of HCC cells.
