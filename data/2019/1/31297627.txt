Background and aims:Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common inflammatory liver condition that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Risk factors for NASH include a saturated fat diet, altered lipid metabolism, and genetic and epigenetic factors, including microRNAs. Serum levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) are elevated in mice and humans that consume a high-saturated fat diet. CCK receptors (CCK-Rs) have been reported on fibroblasts which when activated can induce fibrosis; however, their role in hepatic fibrosis remains unknown. We hypothesized that elevated levels of CCK acting on the CCK-Rs play a role in the development of NASH and in NASH-associated HCC.Methods:We performed a NASH Prevention study and Reversal study in mice fed a saturated fat 75% choline-deficient-ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for 12 or 18 weeks. In each study, half of the mice received untreated drinking water, while the other half received water supplemented with the CCK-R antagonist proglumide. CCK-R expression was evaluated in mouse liver and murine HCC cells.Results:CCK receptor antagonist treatment not only prevented NASH but also reversed hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and steatosis and normalized hepatic transaminases after NASH was established. Thirty-five percent of the mice on the CDE diet developed HCC compared with none in the proglumide-treated group. We found that CCK-BR expression was markedly upregulated in mouse CDE liver and HCC cells compared with normal hepatic parenchymal cells, and this expression was epigenetically regulated by microRNA-148a.Conclusion:These results support the novel role of CCK receptors in the pathogenesis of NASH and HCC.
