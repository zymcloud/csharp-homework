Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is involved in nonmalignant pathological processes. However, TREM2's function in malignant diseases, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In the present study, we report that TREM2 is a novel tumor suppressor in HCC. TREM2 expression was obviously decreased in hepatoma cells (especially metastatic HCC cells), and in most human HCC tissues (especially extrahepatic metastatic tumors). Reduced tumor TREM2 expression was correlated with poor prognosis of HCC patients, and with aggressive pathological features (BCLC stage, tumor size, tumor encapsulation, vascular invasion, and tumor differentiation). TREM2 knockdown substantially promoted cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo, while TREM2 overexpression produced the opposite effect. TREM2 suppressed HCC metastasis by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, accompanied by abnormal expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Further study revealed that downregulation of TREM2 in HCC was regulated by miR-31-5p. Moreover, by directly interacting with β-catenin, TREM2 attenuated oncogenic and metastatic behaviors by inhibiting Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, and activating β-catenin. TREM2 suppressed carcinogenesis and metastasis in HCC by targeting the PI3K/Akt/β-catenin pathway. Thus, we propose that TREM2 may be a candidate prognostic biomarker in malignant diseases and TREM2 restoration might be a prospective strategy for HCC therapy.
