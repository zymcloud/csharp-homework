Angiogenesis represents one of the critical mechanisms that facilitates carcinoma development. The study objective was to evaluate whether the microsatellite instability of colorectal carcinoma has impact on the angiogenesis activity in liver metastases.In a cohort of 80 randomly selected patients with stage IV colorectal carcinoma, 30% were recognized as microsatellite unstable (Microsatellite instability high-frequency (MSI-H)). The endothelial progenitor cell fraction (CD309+) was counted within the subpopulation of CD34+CD45+ cell and CD34+CD45- cells by flow cytometer. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) factor levels were quantified in serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A control group consisted of 36 healthy volunteers. The relationship of genomic instability to angiogenesis activity was evaluated by multivariate analysis in comparison to the controls, adopting a P < .05 value as statistically significant.The expression of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and VEGF was significantly higher in MSI-H compared to both microsatellite stability (MSS) patients and healthy controls (P < .008). Multi-parametric analysis showed microsatellite instability (OR=9.12, P < .01), metastases in both lobes (OR = 32.83, P < .001) and simultaneous metastases outside liver (OR = 8.32, P < .01), as independent factors associated with increased angiogenesis as assessed by measures of EPC and VEGF. A higher percentage of EPCs within the white blood cell fraction (total % EPCs / white blood cells (WBC)) and higher serum concentrations of VEGF were present in patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer, and not with MSS cancers (P < .001).MSI-H patients with colorectal cancer metastases are associated with the overexpression of circulating EPCs and VEGF, potentially driving angiogenesis. This should be considered in therapeutic decision-making.
