Ketone bodies, including acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), are produced from acetyl coenzyme A in the liver and then secreted into the blood. These molecules are a source of energy for peripheral tissues during exercise or fasting. βOHB has been reported to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1, 3, and 4 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Thus, βOHB may regulate epigenetics by modulating HDACs. There have been several reports that the administration of βOHB or induction of a physiological state of ketosis has an antitumor effect; however, the mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether βOHB enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by modulating activity and/or expression of HDACs. We found that βOHB significantly enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cleavage of caspase-3 and -8 in HCC cells. Further, βOHB significantly decreased the expression of HDCA 3/5/6 and survivin in liver hepatocellular (HepG2) cells. In HDAC3/6 gene silencing, survivin expression was significantly decreased, and cisplatin-induced cleavage of caspase-3 was significantly enhanced compared with control in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, βOHB enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis via HDAC3/6 inhibition/survivin axis in HepG2 cells, which suggests that βOHB could be a new adjuvant agent for cisplatin chemotherapy.
