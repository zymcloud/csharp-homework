Patients are often diagnosed with liver cancer in advanced stages, contributing to its poor prognosis. Of all liver cancer cases, >90% are hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) for which chemotherapy and immunotherapy are the best options for therapy. For liver cancer patients, new treatment options are necessary.
