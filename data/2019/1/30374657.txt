Introduction:Nivolumab is the first checkpoint-inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced HCC patients. Real-life experience data of nivolumab treatment in HCC patients, especially those with advanced liver disease, is scarce.Materials and methods:All patients with confirmed advanced HCC and nivolumab treatment from three large German centers were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical parameters and outcome were assessed.Results:A total of 34 patients were included. At the time of treatment initiation 5 patients (14.7%) were classified as stage BCLC B and 29 (85.3%) BCLC C, respectively. 25 (73.5) patients had received prior sorafenib treatment. All patients presented with cirrhosis, namely Child-Pugh stages A (56%) or B (41%), respectively. At time of patient's assessment, 20 out of 34 (58.8%) patients had died. Grade 3 toxicities occurred in two patients (5.9%). Best overall responses were partial response in four patients (11.8%) and stable disease in eight patients (23.5%). The median overall survival of the whole cohort was 7.5 weeks (range 0-46). Child-Pugh B stage disease at treatment start was significantly associated with poor outcome.Discussion:Nivolumab treatment seems safe and clinical efficacious. Patients with advanced liver disease require further prospective evaluation due to probable limited efficacy of nivolumab.
