Purpose:The aim of our study was to propose a strategy based on indocyanine green (ICG) (SBI) to provide better clinical guidelines for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatments for Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Materials and methods:From October 2005 to December 2012, 112 BCLC stage C HCC patients initially treated with TACE were investigated, randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 79) and validation cohort (n = 33). In training group, the patients were grouped based on their 15 minutes ICG retention rate (ICG R15), different chemo drugs and dose of lipidol in TACE. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed in subgroups. Strategy based on ICG was built and verified in validation group.Results:For those patients with ICG R15 values >10%, the lipiodol ≤10 mL group showed better survival than the lipiodol >10 mL group. For those patients with ICG R15 values ≤10%, the group that received triple-drug chemotherapy treatments with lipiodol diameter ratio values between 1 and 3 showed better survival than the other group. Patients who conformed with the SBI had better survival times than those who did not conform with the SBI, in both the training cohort (median OS 10.3 vs 5.1 months; P Conclusions:The SBI is suitable and may provide survival benefits for TACE treatments in BCLC stage C HCC patients.
