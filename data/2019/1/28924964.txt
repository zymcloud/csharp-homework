Studies have investigated the effect of ROBO1. All the same, the relationship between miR-490-5p and ROBO1, and the underlying mechanism are still unclear. We aimed to study the effect of microRNA-490-5p (miR-490-5p) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation, migration and invasion by directly regulating ROBO1. The expression of miR-490-5p and ROBO1 in HCC tissues and cells were tested by RT-qPCR, and the Hep3B cells were selected for subsequent experiments. We confirmed the relationship between miR-490-5p and ROBO1 by luciferase reporter system. The effects of miR-490-5p on cell proliferation, migration and invasion of Hep3B cells were assessed by MTT assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay, respectively. Flow cytometry was employed to detect the influence of miR-490-5p on cell cycle and apoptosis of Hep3B cells. The expression of miR-490-5p was down-regulated, while ROBO1 was up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells than the controls. MiR-490-5p can target ROBO1. MiR-490-5p inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but promoted cell apoptosis of Hep3B cells by inhibiting ROBO1. We confirmed that miR-490-5p could directly suppress ROBO1, which might be a potential mechanism in inhibiting HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
