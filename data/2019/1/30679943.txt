Background:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for the occurrence and development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Microvascular invasion (MVI) of HCC is closely related to postoperative recurrence. We aimed to investigate the effect of HBV DNA replication levels and anti-HBV treatment on the occurrence of MVI in HCC.Methods:A retrospective analysis of the clinical and pathological data of 660 patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from January 2015 to December 2017 is included in this study.Results:This study involved a total of 660 patients with an MVI incidence rate of 46.8% (309/660). Univariate analysis revealed that positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), detectable HBV DNA load, and administration of antiviral treatment were significantly associated with the formation of MVI. Multivariable logistic regression analysis in patients with positive seral HBsAg showed that detectable HBV DNA load (OR = 5.33, P < 0.001) was an independent risk factor for MVI. Antiviral treatment for more than six months (OR = 0.37, P = 0.002) was an independent protective factor against MVI. Patient groups with severe MVI had significantly higher rates of HBV infection (P = 0.017), a detectable HBV DNA load (> 100 IU/ml) rate (P < 0.001), and obvious low antiviral treatment rate (P = 0.021).Conclusions:HBV DNA replication level is an independent risk factors for the formation of HCC MVI, and anti-hepatitis B virus treatment has an inhibitory effect on MVI formation.
