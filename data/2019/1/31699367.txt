Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) display essential roles in cancer progression. FLVCR1-AS1 is a rarely investigated lncRNAs involved in various human cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer. However, its function in glioma has not been clarified. In our study, we found that FLVCR1-AS1 was highly expressed in glioma tissues and cell lines. And upregulation of FLVCR1-AS1 predicted poor prognosis in patients with glioma. Moreover, FLVCR1-AS1 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified that FLVCR1-AS1 was a sponge for miR-4731-5p to upregulate E2F2 expression. Moreover, rescue assays indicated that FLVCR1-AS1 modulated E2F2 expression to participate in glioma progression. Altogether, our research demonstrates that the FLVCR1-AS1/miR-4731-5p/E2F2 axis is a novel signaling in glioma and may be a potential target for tumor therapy.
