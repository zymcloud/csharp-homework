According to cancer genome sequences, more than 90% of cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) harbor active KRAS mutations. Digital PCR (dPCR) enables accurate detection and quantification of rare mutations. We assessed the dynamics of circulating tumor DNA (ct-DNA) in patients with advanced PDAC undergoing chemotherapy using dPCR. KRAS G12/13 mutation was assayed by dPCR in 47 paired tissue- and ct-DNA samples. The 21 patients were subjected to quantitative ct-DNA monitoring at 4 to 8-week intervals during chemotherapy. KRAS mutation was detected in 45 of those 47 patients using tissue DNA. In the KRAS mutation-negative cases, next-generation sequencing revealed KRAS Q61K and NRAS Q61R mutations. KRAS mutation was detected in 23/45 cases using ct-DNA (liver or lung metastasis, 18/19; mutation allele frequency [MAF], 0.1%-31.7%; peritoneal metastasis, 3/9 [0.1%], locally advanced, 2/17 [0.1%-0.2%]). In the ct-DNA monitoring, the MAF value changed in concordance with the disease state. In the 6 locally advanced cases, KRAS mutation appeared concurrently with liver metastasis. Among the 6 cases with liver metastasis, KRAS mutation disappeared during the duration of stable disease or a partial response, and reappeared at the time of progressive disease. The median progression-free survival was longer in cases in which KRAS mutation disappeared after an initial course of chemotherapy than in those in which it was continuously detected (248.5 vs 50 days, P < .001). Therefore, ct-DNA monitoring enables continuous assessment of disease state and could have prognostic utility during chemotherapy.
