Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most lethal malignancy worldwide. There has been virtually no change in the survivability of HCC in spite of improvement in therapies. Surgery is considered the ideal first, curative intervention, however most patients present in advanced stages with unresectable disease. Therefore, systemic and liver-directed non-operative therapies are initially offered to downstage the disease. To ensure optimal management, a multidisciplinary team approach is often warranted. Our case highlights the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach in a young woman with multifocal, bilobar HCC.Case summary:A 36-year-old Chinese woman with untreated hepatitis B was found to have large bilobar HCC during work up for abdominal pain. Her initial serum alpha-fetoprotein was significantly elevated to 311136 ng/mL. Computed tomography scan demonstrated bulky bilobar liver masses, consistent with intermediate stage HCC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B. Her case was discussed and a personalized care plan was developed at the Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Minimally Invasive Liver Oncologic Therapies at the University of Washington. She initially underwent bilobar transarterial chemoembolization with partial response of the left lobar tumor. Salvage hypofractionated proton beam radiation therapy was delivered to the right lobe followed by two additional transarterial chemoembolizations to the left lobe with good response. Finally, to remove left lobar residual disease, she was taken to the operating room for a left hepatectomy eleven months after her initial presentation. She continues to be without evidence of disease.Conclusion:Coordinating the multiple HCC treatment modalities is complex and our case highlights the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach.
