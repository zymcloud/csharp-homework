Choledochal cysts are rare congenital anomalies of the biliary tree, which are more prevalent in female Asian population. Malignant transformation occurs in 10% to 30% of adults with choledochal cysts. A 39-year-old man presented with abdominal pain for 2 months, with irregular thickening of bile duct wall on ultrasound and enhanced CT. Staging with F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated lymph node and liver metastasis. F-FDG PET/CT may become a valuable imaging procedure in diagnosing and staging of carcinoma arising from choledochal cysts.
