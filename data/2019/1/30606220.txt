Background:For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver resection is a classical curative modality, despite its technical complexity. The incidence of HCC in the oldest old people (aged â‰¥ 85 years) is rising along with the global increase in life expectancy. Currently, no report has addressed liver resection for HCC in this aged population.Patients and methods:We conducted a retrospective review of 1889 patients receiving curative liver resection for newly diagnosed HCC from 1992 to 2016. At the time of operation, 1858 of them were aged Result:Group B had a significantly higher incidence of associated co-morbidities and hepatitis C infection. Postoperative complication rates and 90-day mortality rates after liver resection did not differ between groups A and B (p = 0.834 and p = 1.000, respectively), though group B had a longer postoperative stay (p = 0.001). In groups A and B, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 29.7% and 22.6% (p = 0.163), respectively, and their overall survival rates were 43.5% and 35.5% (p = 0.086). The overall survival rate of group B was significantly different from group C (35.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.001).Conclusion:Despite a longer postoperative recovery period, liver resection for HCC in the oldest old patients may be justified if co-morbidities are well controlled.
