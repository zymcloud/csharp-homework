Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine as a basic analgesic sedative for patients with radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors. Methods: A total of 443 liver cancer patients underwent percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in the 302 Hospital of PLA from January 2015 to December 2016 were retrospectively studied. The experimental group was dexmedetomidine group, with a total of 165 cases. The control group was pethidine group with a total of 278 cases. The indexes of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate of two groups were collected before and after operation, and the VAS score and incidence of nausea and adverse reactions were recorded. Results: The results of the experimental group added dose of pethidine (64.6 mg) lower than that of the control group pethidine dose (90.8 mg), the difference was statistically significant (Z=-10.205 3, P<0.01). The experimental group and the control group with VAS score average value was not statistically significant(Z=1.801 9, P=0.076), group two with 4 points for the critical point of the stratification, more than 4 points and<4 group comparison, the test group VAS score greater than 4 were significantly lower than the control group (Ï‡(2)=7.05, P=0.007 9). The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in the experimental group were significantly lower than those before operation (P<0.01), while the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in the control group significantly increased compared with those before operation. Dexmedetomidine has the effect of stabilizing hemodynamics. The heart rate of the two groups decreased, and the rate of heart rate decreased in the experimental group. In addition, dexmedetomidine did not significantly increase the incidence of nausea and vomiting compared with the control group. Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine is safe and effective as a basic drug for analgesic and sedative in patients with liver tumor radiofrequency ablation.
