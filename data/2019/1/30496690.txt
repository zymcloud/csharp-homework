Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is quickly emerging as a global epidemic in parallel with the rise in obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome. NAFLD, once seen simply as a passive consequence of the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), has been found to interact with other features of MetS to exacerbate insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. NAFLD is also becoming the top indication for liver transplant and an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment of this disorder is limited mainly to lifestyle modifications to promote weight loss along with consideration for off-label use of certain medications, but recent progression in clinical trials means more effective treatments are on the horizon. Therefore, the primary care provider must be prepared to recognize and determine the severity of this disorder in order to optimize management. In this review, we will discuss risk factors for NAFLD, workup and differential, and finally, offer recommendations on screening.
