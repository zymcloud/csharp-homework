Cancer immunotherapy has been increasingly applied in the treatment of advanced malignancies. Consequently, immune checkpoints have become a major concern. As PD-1 is an important immunomodulatory protein, the blockade of PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 is a promising tumour immunotherapy for human carcinoma. In this review, we first discuss the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in gastrointestinal tract cancers. Targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 in immune cells and tumour cells may show remarkable efficiency in gastrointestinal tract cancers. Second, the PD-1/PD-L1-associated signalling pathway involved in cancer immunotherapy in gastrointestinal tract cancers is discussed. Most importantly, this review summarizes the PD-1/PD-L1-targeted immunotherapy combinations with relevant signalling pathways, which may result in a breakthrough for the treatment of gastrointestinal tract cancers, such as gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and liver cancer. Meanwhile, the review provides a deeper insight into the mechanism of checkpoint blockade immunotherapies.
