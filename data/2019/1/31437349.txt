Hepatitis C virus infection has been the most common etiology in HCC-related liver transplantation (LT). Since 2014, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have dramatically improved HCV cure. We aimed to study the changing pattern of etiologies and impact in outcome in HCC-related LT according to HCV treatment-era through retrospective analysis of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) database (1987-2017). A total of 27 855 HCC-related liver transplants were performed (median age 59 years, 77% male). In the DAA era (2014-2017) there has been a 14.6% decrease in LT for HCV-related HCC; however, HCV remains the most common etiology in 50% of cases. In the same era, there has been a 50% increase in LT for NAFLD-related HCC. Overall survival was significantly worse for HCV-related HCC compared to NAFLD-related HCC during pre-DAA era (2002-2013; P = .031), but these differences disappeared in the DAA era. In addition, HCV patients had a significant improvement in survival when comparing the DAA era with IFN era (P
