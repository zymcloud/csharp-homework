Advanced gastric cancer (GC) is aggressive with a high mortality rate. Rhesus family, C glycoprotein (RhCG) participates in tumor progression in many cancers, however its function in GC is still unknown. Here, we showed that RhCG was overexpressed in GC tissues at mRNA (P = 0.036) and protein levels (P i and impeded tumor cellular proliferation, migration and invasion and repressed Î²-catenin and c-myc expression in GC cells. Moreover, GC cells with high RhCG level had reduced oxaliplatin efficacy suggesting a role for RhCG as a therapeutic target for GC. Our findings revealed a function of RhCG in cancer pathogenesis, invasion and metastasis in human GC. We suggest that RhCG act may as a novel prognostic indicator and a therapeutic target for gastric adenocarcinoma.
