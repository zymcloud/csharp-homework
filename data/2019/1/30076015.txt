Background:Diabetes is a risk factor of fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, only one longitudinal study exploring whether diabetes is associated with progression from non-cirrhotic liver to cirrhosis in CHC patients has been conducted.Aims:We investigated whether diabetes is associated with progression from non-cirrhotic liver to cirrhosis in non-genotype 3 CHC patients.Methods:A cohort consisting of 976 non-genotype 3 patients histologically proven to have CHC was studied. After excluding patients with biopsy-proven or ultrasound-identified cirrhosis, there were 684 patients without cirrhosis. All 684 patients underwent hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance using ultrasound every 6 months, with a median duration of follow-up evaluation of 102.4 months. During the follow-up period, 60 patients developed cirrhosis according to ultrasound findings.Results:For the subgroup of 684 patients without cirrhosis, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed no significantly different cumulative incidences of cirrhosis (log-rank test; P = 0.71) among the patients with diabetes as compared to those without. However, after making adjustments for age, gender, fibrosis, steatosis, sustained virological response status, and obesity using Cox's proportional hazard model, diabetes was found to be an independent predictor for cirrhosis (HR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.05-3.43, P = 0.03).Conclusions:Diabetes is associated with progression from non-cirrhotic liver to cirrhosis in non-genotype 3 CHC patients.
