Background:Day-case surgery (DCS) has become increasingly popular over recent years, as has laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for the treatment of benign or malignant liver tumours. The purpose of this prospective study was to demonstrate the feasibility of minor LLR as DCS.Methods:Prospective, intention-to-treat, non-randomised study of patients undergoing minor LLR between July 2015 and December 2017. Exclusion criteria were resection by laparotomy, major LLR, difficult locations for minor LLR, history of major abdominal surgery, hepatobiliary procedures without liver parenchyma resection, cirrhosis with Child > A and/or portal hypertension, significant medical history and exclusion criteria for DCS. The primary endpoint was the unplanned overnight admission rate. Secondary endpoints were the reason for exclusion, complication data, criteria for DCS evaluation, satisfaction and compliance with the protocol.Results:One hundred sixty-seven patients underwent liver resection during the study period. LLR was performed in 92 patients (55%), as DCS in 23 patients (25%). Reasons for minor LLR were liver metastasis (n = 9), hepatic adenoma (n = 5), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 4), ciliated hepatic foregut cyst (n = 2) and other benign tumours (n = 3). All day-case minor LLR, except two patients, consisted of single wedge resection, while one patient underwent left lateral sectionectomy. There were four unplanned overnight admissions (17.4%), one unscheduled consultation (4.3%), two hospital readmissions (8.6%) and no major complications/mortality. Compliance with the protocol was 69.5%. Satisfaction rate was 91%.Conclusion:In selected patients, day-case minor LLR is feasible with acceptable complication and readmission rates. Day-case minor LLR can therefore be legitimately proposed in selected patients.
