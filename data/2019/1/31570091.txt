Objective:To investigate the role of miR-26a-5p in cell proliferation and doxorubicin sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We evaluated miR-26a-5p expression in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cell lines by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to examine cell proliferation. Relationship between miR-26a-5p and aurora kinase A was evaluated by luciferase report system. Western blot was used to detect expression of aurora kinase A.Results:In this study, we observed miR-26a-5p was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and cell lines. Gain-of-function experiments showed that proliferation rate of hepatocellular carcinoma cells decreased under condition of miR-26a-5p mimics. We found miR-26a-5p mimics could enhance doxorubicin sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Further study showed that aurora kinase A was target gene of miR-26a-5p. Suppression of aurora kinase A could lead to lower cell proliferation and higher doxorubicin sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Conclusion:Our study found that miR-26a-5p could inhibit cell proliferation and enhance doxorubicin sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting aurora kinase A.
