A 72-year-old man with general fatigue was referred, and CT and MRI revealed a pancreatic mass with necrosis that was suspected of invading the stomach, splenic artery, celiac artery, liver, and portal vein. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an extrinsic mass with ulcer formation in the posterior wall of the upper gastric corpus and irregular mucosa in the lower esophagus incidentally. Biopsy showed squamous cell carcinoma from both lesions, leading to the diagnosis of pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma and early esophageal cancer. We performed distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, total gastrectomy, partial hepatectomy, superior mesenteric-portal vein resection, and reconstruction. The pathological results revealed pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma and infiltration of cancer cells at the dissected peripancreatic margin. Therefore, we administered radiotherapy(50.4 Gy to the retroperitoneal region)in postoperative month 2. Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed for the early stage esophageal cancer lesion in postoperative month 5. Three courses of S-1 were administered as adjuvant therapy since postoperative month 7, and he is currently alive without recurrence 1 year and 8 months after surgery. Multidisciplinary treatment can be effective for locally advanced pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma.
