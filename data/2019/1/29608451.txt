Goals/background:We aimed to assess temporal changes in the different types of liver disease (LD) cases and outcomes from emergency departments (EDs) across the United States.Study:We used data from the National Inpatient Survey database from 2005 to 2011. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) clinical modification codes identified hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and other LDs including autoimmune hepatitis. We excluded cases without LD, nonhepatocellular carcinoma-related cancers, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or those with missing information. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Controls were matched to cases without LD.Results:During the study period, 20,641,839 cases were seen in EDs. Of these, 1,080,008 cases were related to LD and were matched to controls without LD (N=19,557,585). The number of cases with LD increased from 123,873 (2005) to 188,501 (2011) (P<0.0001). Among cases with LD, diagnosis of HCV, HBV, and ALD remained stable during the study years (41.60% vs. 38.20%, 3.70% vs. 2.80%, and 41.4% vs. 38.5%, respectively), whereas NAFLD doubled [6.00% of all LD (2005) to 11.90% of all LD (2011) (P<0.0001)]. Diagnosis of LD in the ED independently predicted increased patient mortality [odds ratio, 1.20 (1.17 to 1.22)].Conclusions:The number of LD cases presenting to EDs is increasing, and a diagnosis of LD is associated with a higher patient mortality for those admitted through the ED. There is a dramatic increase of NAFLD diagnoses in the ED.
