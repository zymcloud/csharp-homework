Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common carcinoma of the digestive tract. The slow growing nature of CRC offers a great opportunity for prevention strategies. The concept of chemoprevention of colorectal cancer using plant derived natural products is gaining substantial attention because it is an inherently safe and cost-effective alternative to conventional cancer therapies. Piperlongumine (PL), a natural alkaloid present in Piper longum Linn has been reported to exhibit notable anticancer effects in various in vitro studies. Nonetheless, the chemopreventive potential of PL has not been studied in experimentally induced colon cancer yet. Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis plays a central role in promoting tumor cell growth, proliferation and survival by inhibiting apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated, for the first time, the chemopreventive effects of PL in DMH + DSS induced colon carcinogenesis animal model. We showed that PL displayed potent antineoplastic activity against colon cancer cell growth by targeting Ras proteins and PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. PL mediated inhibition of tumor cell growth was associated with inhibition of Ras protein levels and its preferred companion protein PI3K levels that led to suppressed activity of Akt/NF-ÎºB, c-Myc and cyclin D1. It was also found that PL arrested the cell cycle progression at G2/M phase and induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by downregulating Bcl-2 levels. Furthermore, the results of liver and kidney toxicity suggested that PL exhibit no toxicity in animals. Our results suggest that PL may be an effective chemopreventive agent for colon cancer.
