Purpose:We compared the rate and severity of fatigue in patients who completed stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the liver daily (QD) compared with every other day (QOD).Methods and materials:From 2010 to 2017, 91 patients with Child Pugh (CP) A (n = 57) or CP-B (n = 34) cirrhosis who completed 100 SBRT sessions to 110 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions were analyzed in this study. Confounding variables with fatigue such as CP-C cirrhosis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score >2, or a history of ascites or encephalopathy were excluded. Fatigue was assessed against several treatment- and patient-related variables with univariate and propensity score-matched multivariate analysis. The median follow-up time was 18 months.Results:Patients with HCC and Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer stages 0 (n = 10), A (n = 32), and B (n = 58), and a median age of 62 years were analyzed. The median tumor diameter was 3 cm (1.1-11 cm). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score was 0 (n = 44), 1 (n = 43), or 2 (n = 13). The median dose was 45 Gy in 5 fractions, and 65 treatments were QD and 45 QOD. Grades 1 and 2 fatigue developed in 49% and 14% of treatments, respectively. Among the patients who were treated daily, 78% developed Grade 1 or 2 fatigue compared with 44% who were treated QOD (odds ratio: 4.52; P = .001). Grade 2 fatigue occurred in 22% of patients compared with 7.3% for QD and QOD treatment, respectively (odds ratio: 3.83; P = .048). There was no difference in fatigue rate for time of treatment (morning or afternoon), dose, treated volume, CP score, Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer stage, or performance status, which were not associated with any level of fatigue. There was no difference in local control between QD and QOD treatments.Conclusions:Compared with traditional daily treatment fractions, SBRT that is delivered QOD to cirrhotic patients with HCC may reduce the risk of fatigue.
