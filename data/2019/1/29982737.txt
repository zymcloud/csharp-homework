Background:The effect of newer oral anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) medication, tenofovir disoproxil (TDF), on liver-related outcomes among Asians is limited. We examined the effect of TDF on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an Asian population with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:This was a retrospective cohort study of 6914 adults with chronic HBV monoinfection and no history of transplantation who were recruited from 6 US referral, community medical centers and a community based Taiwan cohort for a total of 774 patients who received TDF and 6140 who were not treated. Propensity score matching (PSM) for age, sex, HBV e antigen status, HBV DNA level, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, baseline cirrhosis status, and follow-up time was performed to balance the groups, resulting in 591 treated individuals and 591 untreated individuals. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the cumulative risk of HCC. Cox proportional hazards models were run to estimate the HCC risk between groups.Results:The 8-year cumulative HCC incidence was significantly higher in the PSM untreated group (20.13% vs 4.69%; P Conclusions:Among cirrhotic and noncirrhotic Asian patients with CHB, TDF therapy was significantly associated with a reduction in the 8-year HCC cumulative incidence rate.
