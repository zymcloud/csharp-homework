Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are safe and effective at eradicating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Unfortunately, DAAs remain expensive, so treatment of all HCV-infected patients would substantially affect health care costs. It is therefore important to continue to assess the hepatic and extrahepatic benefits of a DAA-induced sustained virologic response (SVR). A DAA-induced SVR reduces a patient's risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection; there are also data to indicate that an SVR can reduce mortality. SVR is a relevant clinical end point, but further analyses are required to confirm its importance among diverse HCV-infected populations and to document the public health benefits of HCV elimination at the population level. We review the evidence for the benefits associated with SVRs in different clinical settings and challenges to data collection.
