Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a complex process with high morbitity and can cause liver dysfunction, which contains a wide spectrum of hepatic lesions, including steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. To date, the molecular mechanisms for ALD have not been fully explored and an effective therapy is still missing. Overwhelming evidence shows dysregulation of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), is correlated with etiopathogenesis and progress of ALD including hepatocyte damage, disrupted lipid metabolism, aggressive inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, programmed cell death, fibrosis, and epigenetic changes induced by alcohol. For example, circulating miRNA-122 is a marker of hepatocyte damage, and miRNA-155 is a potential marker of inflammation, indicating their diagnosis therapeutic potential in ALD. In addition, roles for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs in ALD are being uncovered. Further, circulating ncRNAs and exosome-derived ncRNAs have attracted more attention lately, suggesting a role in the prevention and treatment of ALD. This review covers the roles of ncRNAs in ALD, and the potential uses as markers for diagnosis and therapeutic options.
