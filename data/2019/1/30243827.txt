Ethnopharmacological relevance:As an important Chinese herb injection, Aidi injection is composed of the extracts from Astragalus, Eleutherococcus senticosus, Ginseng, and Cantharis. Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy is often used to in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China.Aim of the study:The objective of this study is to further confirm whether Aidi injection can improve the tumor responses and survivals, and reveal its safety, optimal usage and combination with paclitaxel.Materials and methods:A meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy for NSCLC were selected. Main outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), survivals, quality of life (QOL) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). All data were extracted by using a standard data extraction form and synthesized through meta-analysis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used for rating the quality of evidence.Results:Thirty-one RCTs involving 2058 patients were included, and most trials had an unclear methodological bias risk. The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of ORR, DCR, QOL, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicity and liver injury were as following: 1.32 (1.20-1.46), 1.14 (1.09-1.20), 1.89 (1.66-2.16), 0.61 (0.51-0.74), 0.62 (0.45-0.87), 0.59 (0.49-0.72) and 0.52 (0.36-0.75). Compared to chemotherapy alone, all differences were statistically significant. Subgroup analysis showed that only with the TP, Aidi injection could increase the ORR and DCR. Treatment with 100 ml, 80 ml or 50 ml/time, and 14 days/2 cycles or 21 days/2-4 cycles, Aidi injection could increase the ORR and DCR, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results had good robustness. None of the trials reported the overall survivals (OS), progression free survival (PFS). The quality of evidences was moderate.Conclusions:Current moderate evidence revealed that Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, especially TP can significantly improve the clinical efficacy and QOL for patients with stage III/IV NSCLC. Aidi injection can relieve the risk of hematotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity and liver injury in patient with NSCLC receiving paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. The optimal usage may be 50 ml/time and 14 days/2 cycles.
