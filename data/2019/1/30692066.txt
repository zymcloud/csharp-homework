Objective:To explore the diagnostic value of the serum metabolites identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 126 patients admitted to Tianjin Third Central Hospital were enrolled, including 27 patients with HBV-related hepatitis with negative viral DNA (DNA-N), 24 with HBV-related hepatitis with positive viral DNA, 24 with HBV-related liver cirrhosis, 27 with HBV-related HCC undergoing surgeries or radiofrequency ablation, and 24 with HBV-related HCC receiving interventional therapy, with 25 healthy volunteers as the normal control group. Serum samples were collected from all the subjects for HPLC/MS analysis, and the data were pretreated to establish an orthogonal partial least- squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model. The differential serum metabolites were preliminarily screened by comparisons between the HBV groups and the control group, and the characteristic metabolites were identified according to the results of non-parametric test. The potential clinical values of these characteristic metabolites were evaluated using receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.Results:A total of 25 characteristic metabolites were identified in the HBV- infected patients, including 9 lysophosphatidylcholines, 2 fatty acids, 17Î±-estradiol, sphinganine, 5-methylcytidine, vitamin K2, lysophosphatidic acid, glycocholic acid and 8 metabolites with few reports. The patients with HBV- related HCC showed 22 differential serum metabolites compared with the control group, 4 differential metabolites compared with patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis; 10 differential metabolites were identified in patients with HBV-related HCC receiving interventional therapy compared with those receiving surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation. From the normal control group to HBV-related HCC treated by interventional therapy, many metabolites underwent variations following a similar pattern.Conclusions:We identified 25 characteristic metabolites in patients with HBV-related HCC, and these metabolites may have potential clinical values in the diagnosis of HBV-related HCC. The continuous change of some of these metabolites may indicate the possibility of tumorigenesis, and some may also have indications for the choice of surgical approach.
