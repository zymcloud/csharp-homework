Proline-rich protein 11 (PRR11) has been shown to play an critical roles in the development of cancer. However, the clinical significance and the biological role of PRR11 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the expression pattern, prognostic value and the biological role of PRR11 in HCC. PRR11 expression in 80 HCC surgical specimens was examined, and its clinical significance was analyzed. The role of PRR11 in cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion were also determined. The results showed that PRR11 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in 56.25% (45/80) HCC from that in matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. High PRR11 was correlated with tumor size (P = 0.01) and TNM stage (P = 0.006). Patients with higher PRR11 expression had poor overall survival time (P
