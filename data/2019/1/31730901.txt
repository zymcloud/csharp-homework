The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 7 (TRAF7) is a component of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and is a putative E3-ubiquitin ligase. Based on importance of chronic inflammation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we investigated the biological effects and the molecular mechanisms of deregulated TRAF7 signaling in HCC. Our results showed that high TRAF7 expression in HCC samples was inversely associated with Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) expression and the prognosis of HCC patients. TRAF7 could degrade KLF4 protein through ubiquitin by interacting with its N-terminus. The up-regulation of TRAF7 promoted HCC cell migration and invasion in vivo and in vitro, and TRAF7 knockdown had the opposite effects. Restoration of KLF4 abrogated the motility promotion induced by TRAF7. TRAF7 promotes HCC cell motility through inducing KLF4 protein turnover.
