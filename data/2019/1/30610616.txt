Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a tumor with poor prognosis and frequently aggressive. The development of HCC is associated with fibrosis and cirrhosis, which mainly results from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and viral infections. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNAs transcribed from the genome, but are not translated into proteins. Recently, ncRNAs emerged as key contributors to tumor development and progression because of their abilities to regulate various targets and modulate cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and development. In this review, we summarize the frequently activated pathways in HCC and discuss the pathological implications of ncRNAs in the context of human liver disease progression, in particular HCC development and progression. This review aims to summarize the role of ncRNA dysregulation in the diseases and discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials of ncRNAs.
