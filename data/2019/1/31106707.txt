Micro-RNAs play critical roles in initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the biological role of microRNA-145-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma and how it works are still not clearly understood. Expression levels of microRNA-145-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were examined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell counting kit-8, wound-healing assay, and flow cytometry assay were conducted to investigate the role of microRNA-145-5p von proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot were performed to investigate the correlation between microRNA-145-5p and RAB18. We found microRNA-145-5p was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines compared to the normal cell line. Overexpression of microRNA-145-5p inhibited the proliferation and migration but promoted apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro. RAB18 was validated a target of microRNA-145-5p and ectopic expression of RAB18 can promote the proliferation and migration but inhibit apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. These findings indicate that microRNA-145-5p functions as a novel tumor suppressor through targeting RAB18, suggesting that microRNA-145-5p might be a potential new therapeutic molecule for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
