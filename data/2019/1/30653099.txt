The prognositc value of dynamic liver stiffness (LS) variation on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains to be explored. We aim to compare HCC incidence in patients with compensated CHB-related cirrhosis with increased and decreased LS after nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) regimens.A total of 168 patients with CHB-related compensated cirrhosis were divided into groups according to LS variation post to NA treatment. The laboratory results of 2 groups were reviewed and investigated. The probability of HCC development among each group was analyzed and compared.A total of 168 patients with CHB with compensated cirrhosis received NA treatment and Fibroscan. Child-Pugh score, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin level, status of hepatitis B e antigen, and serum hepatitis B virus DNA level were compared between groups. The cumulative probability of HCC development in patients with decreased LS was significantly lower than in patients with increased LS (P
