Purpose:Currently, radiologists use tumor-to-normal tissue contrast across multiphase computed tomography (MPCT) for lesion detection. Here, we developed a novel voxel-based enhancement pattern mapping (EPM) technique and investigated its ability to improve contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) in a phantom study and in patients with hepatobiliary cancers.Methods:The EPM algorithm is based on the root mean square deviation between each voxel and a normal liver enhancement model using patient-specific (EPM-PA) or population data (EPM-PO). We created a phantom consisting of liver tissue and tumors with distinct enhancement signals under varying tumor sizes, motion, and noise. We also retrospectively evaluated 89 patients with hepatobiliary cancers who underwent active breath-hold MPCT between 2016 and 2017. MPCT phases were registered using a three-dimensional deformable image registration algorithm. For the patient study, CNRs of tumor to adjacent tissue across MPCT phases, EPM-PA and EPM-PO were measured and compared.Results:EPM resulted in statistically significant CNR improvement (P Conclusions:EPM increases CNR compared with grayscale MPCT for primary and secondary hepatobiliary cancers. This new visualization method derived from MPCT datasets may have applications for early cancer detection, radiomic characterization, tumor treatment response, and segmentation.Implications for patient care:We developed a voxel-wise enhancement pattern mapping (EPM) technique to improve the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of multiphase CT. The improvement in CNR was observed in datasets of patients with cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal liver metastasis. EPM has the potential to be clinically useful for cancers with regard to early detection, radiomic characterization, response, and segmentation.
