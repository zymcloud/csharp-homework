Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignancy of the liver. Tumors can recruit and promote the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to suppress antitumor immune responses for survival and progression. Furthermore, there is a strong evidence for the potential roles of cytokines in promoting HCC carcinogenesis and progression. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of Treg cells and serum levels of IL6 and IL10 before and after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). We carried out a cross-sectional study at Assiut University hospitals that included 34 HCC patients and 10 matched apparently healthy controls. Peripheral Treg frequency was evaluated by Flow cytometry. IL6 and IL10 serum levels were evaluated by ELISA before and after TACE. HCC patients had a significantly higher level of IL6 and IL10 when compared to the control group (P=0.0002, P
