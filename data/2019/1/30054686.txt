Purpose:The aim of this study was to assess hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response with CT perfusion parameters before and after two transarterial chemo embolization (TACE) courses compared with MRI, and to search for predictive factors of response.Methods:37 lesions (19 patients) were included between October 2015 and September 2017, based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer guidelines. CT perfusion with 160-mm coverage and MRI were performed before and after the first TACE course, and after the second TACE course. Quantitative perfusion parameters were compared to the response assessed with MRI using mRECIST criteria, defining response groups: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), no response (NR), response (including CR and PR), no complete response (NCR, including PR and NR).Results:Pre-TACE blood flow (BF) and hepatic arterial blood flow (HABF) were significantly higher in lesions with post-TACE 1 CR than in those with NCR (BF: 118.8 vs. 76.3 mL/100 g/min, p = 0.0231; HABF: 76 vs. 44.2 mL/100 g/min, p = 0.0112). Pre-TACE time to peak (TTP) and mean transit time (MTT) were significantly lower in lesions with post-TACE 2 response than in those with NR (TTP: 31.5 vs. 46.1 s, p = 0.0313; MTT: 15.8 vs. 22.8 s, p = 0.0204). Post-TACE 1 and post-TACE 2 perfusion parameters did not exhibit any statistically significant differences relative to MRI response.Conclusion:Our study did not find, after a first TACE course, perfusion parameters associated with a response to a second TACE course. However, baseline perfusion parameters analysis could lead to better therapeutic management of HCC by targeting lesions likely to respond well to TACE courses.
