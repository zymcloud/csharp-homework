Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play an important role in carcinogenesis. In a recent NTP study, chronic exposure of B6C3F1/N mice to Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) resulted in a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Genome-wide promoter methylation profiling on GBE-exposed HCC (2000 mg/kg group), spontaneous HCC (vehicle-control group), and age-matched vehicle control liver was performed to identify differentially methylated genes in GBE-exposed HCC and spontaneous HCC. DNA methylation alterations were correlated to the corresponding global gene expression changes. Compared to control liver, 1296 gene promoters (719 hypermethylated, 577 hypomethylated) in GBE-exposed HCC and 738 (427 hypermethylated, 311 hypomethylated) gene promoters in spontaneous HCC were significantly differentially methylated, suggesting an impact of methylation on GBE-exposed HCC. Differential methylation of promoter regions in relevant cancer genes (cMyc, Spry2, Dusp5) and their corresponding differential gene expression was validated by quantitative pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR, respectively. In conclusion, we have identified differentially methylated promoter regions of relevant cancer genes altered in GBE-exposed HCC compared to spontaneous HCC. Further study of unique sets of differentially methylated genes in chemical-exposed mouse HCC could potentially be used to differentiate treatment-related tumors from spontaneous-tumors in cancer bioassays and provide additional understanding of the underlying epigenetic mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis.
