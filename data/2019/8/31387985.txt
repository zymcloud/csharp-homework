Target therapy aiming at critical molecules within the metastatic signal pathways is essential for prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Hic-5 (hydrogen peroxide inducible clone-5) which belongs to the paxillin superfamily, can be stimulated by a lot of metastatic factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF-Î²), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Previous studies implicated Hic-5 cross-talks with the ROS-c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal cascade in a positive feedback manner. In this report, we addressed this issue in a comprehensive manner. By RNA interference and ectopic Hic-5 expression, we demonstrated Hic-5 was essential for activation of NADPH oxidase and ROS generation leading to activation of downstream JNK and c-jun transcription factor. This was initiated by interaction of Hic-5 with the regulator and adaptor of NADPH oxidase, Rac1 and Traf4, respectively, which may further phosphorylate the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2 at Tyr881. On the other hand, promoter activity assay coupled with deletion mapping and site directed mutagenesis strategies demonstrated the distal c-jun and AP4 putative binding regions (943-1126 bp upstream of translational start site) were required for transcriptional activation of Hic-5. Thus Hic-5 was both downstream and upstream of NADPH oxidase-ROS-JNK-c-jun cascade. This signal circuit was essential for regulating the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors, such as Snail, Zeb1, E-cadherin, and matrix metalloproteinase 9, involved in HCC cell migration and metastasis. Due to the limited expression of Hic-5 in normal tissue, it can be a promising therapeutic target for preventing HCC metastasis.
