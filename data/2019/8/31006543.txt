Background and aims:Contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasonography (CH-EUS) is used for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Here, we examined the usefulness of CH-EUS for evaluating therapeutic responses in PC.Methods:The study included 23 patients with PC who received chemotherapy. Patients underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) and CH-EUS before chemotherapy and at the time of evaluation of the therapeutic response. Patients with a â‰§50% reduction in serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels after chemotherapy were defined as "super responders". The incidence of an avascular area in the tumor on CH-EUS after chemotherapy was compared between "super responders" and non-super responders.Results:Nine patients were included in the "super responders" group.Tumor reduction rates did not differ significantly between CE-CT and CH-EUS in the "super responders". The appearance of an avascular area was detected in 7 of 9 super responders (77.8%) and in 4 of 14 non-super responders (28.6%), and the difference was significant (P = 0.036). The mean survival time of patients with an avascular area after chemotherapy was longer than that of without an avascular area.Conclusions:Detection of avascular areas by CH-EUS after chemotherapy may predict long-term survival of patients with PC.
