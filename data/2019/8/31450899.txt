Background: There is no doubt that hyperthermia is one of the powerful radiosensitizers. Finding a proper mechanism working in hyperthermia/radiation combination is still pronounced challenge. Objectives: This study is focusing on the anti-cancer activities (anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and antiapoptotic) of thermoradiotherapy. Materials and Methods: Liver cancer cell line (HepG2) was treated by 37oC, 40oC and 43oC hyperthermia degrees combined with three radiation doses (2 Gy, 4 Gy and 8 Gy) for 24, 48 and 72 hrs. Cell viability, apoptotic/necrotic cell screening, apoptotic (BAX and FasL) and antiapoptotic (BCL-2 and GRP78) genes, and pro-angiogenic mediators [vascular endothelial- (VEGF) and Platelet derived-growth factors (PDGF) ware investigated. Results: Our data showed that 40oC temperature combined with 4 Gy radiation gives a significant decrease (p
