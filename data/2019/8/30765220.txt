Background:The Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) score was developed to predict the long-term prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. We aimed to investigate the performance of ALBI for predicting severity and long-term prognosis of chronic hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis (CHB-LC).Methods:CHB-LC patients were enrolled from two medical centers between 2011 and 2017. The prognostic performance of ALBI was evaluated and compared with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) and MELD integrating sodium (MELD-Na) scores.Results:This study enrolled 398 CHB-LC patients and patients were followed up for a median of 33.9 (IQR 21.6-48.8) months. The ALBI (HR: 3.151, 95% CI: 2.039-4.869,P 0.05) for predicting 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year and global mortality. The AUROCs of ALBI score were significantly higher than MELD-Na score(P Conclusions:ALBI score accurately predicts the severity and long-term prognosis of patients with CHB-LC. The prognostic performance of ALBI score was superior to MELD and MELD-Na score.
