Fetuin-A (Fet-A), a hepatokine associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and incident type 2 diabetes, is shown to exist in both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms in circulation. However, studies on fetuin-A phosphorylation status in insulin-resistant conditions and its functional significance are limited. We demonstrate that serum phosphofetuin-A (Ser312) levels were significantly elevated in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, insulin-resistant Zucker diabetic fatty rats, and in individuals with obesity who are insulin resistant. Unlike serum total fetuin-A, serum phosphofetuin-A was associated with body weight, insulin, and markers of insulin resistance. To characterize potential mechanisms, fetuin-A was purified from Hep3B human hepatoma cells. Hep3B Fet-A was phosphorylated (Ser312) and inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in L6GLUT4 myoblasts. Furthermore, single (Ser312Ala) and double (Ser312Ala + Ser120Ala) phosphorylation-defective Fet-A mutants were without effect on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in L6GLUT4 myoblasts. Together, our studies demonstrate that phosphorylation status of Fet-A (Ser312) is associated with obesity and insulin resistance and raise the possibility that Fet-A phosphorylation may play a role in regulation of insulin action.
