Kraft lignin is a polyphenolic compound generated as a by-product from the kraft pulping process in large quantities annually worldwide. In addition to its commercial availability, its structural features make it worth to be considered in the pharmaceutical area. The present study was carried out to evaluate in vitro antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of kraft lignin on mouse hepatoma MH-22A, melanoma B16 (tumor cells) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO, non-cancerous) cells. Moreover, several analytical techniques were used in order to elucidate the chemical structure of isolated industrial lignins (FT-IR, GPC, Py-GC-MS, 2D HSQC NMR). Results revealed high phenolic content in their composition, high-condensed structure and high phenolic hydroxyls group content. DPPH and ABTS‚Åé+ radical scavenging assays demonstrated their strong antioxidant activity, which was higher than found for commercial antioxidant (BHT). Kraft lignins act cytotoxically inducing apoptosis- and necrosis-like processes on both on tumor and normal cells. However, the results evidenced that MH-22A cells showed greater sensitive behavior than B16 and non-cancerous CHO cells, which were more tolerant of kraft lignin.
