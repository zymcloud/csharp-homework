Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Systemic treatments with several multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib and cabozantinib, have been widely utilized int the treatment of HCC. However, with tolerable adverse events and relative low survival time, neo or optimized therapies for advanced HCC are still urgently needed. New developed immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy have been first demonstrated effective in metastatic melanoma through against CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 to renew T cell effector function. Preclinical data indicated that interference with immune checkpoint molecules results in HCC growth suppression, suggesting it may bring hope to the HCC treatment. Several clinical trials applying monoclonal antibodies to immune checkpoint molecules demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors are safe and enable durable antitumor activity in advanced HCC patients. Several published immunotherapy trials in HCC using Anti-CTLA-4 agents (tremelimumab) or anit-PD-1 agents (Nivolumab) have showed promising results, in which have similar response rate (15%-30%) and disease control rate with TKIs therapies. This article will review the on-going clinical trials associated with immune checkpoint molecules monotherapy or co, and then discuss the optimal scheme of immune checkpoint therapy for advanced HCC.
