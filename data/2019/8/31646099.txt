CD47 is known to be involved in phagocyte-mediated tumor clearance; however, its expression, clinical significance, and regulatory mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood. In the present study, we found that upregulation of CD47 expression on tumor cells was correlated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival in patients with HCC. Abundance of macrophages (Mϕs) infiltration was found in CD47+ tumor tissues. Mechanistic studies revealed that IL-6 derived from tumor-infiltrating Mϕs could upregulate CD47 expression on hepatoma cells through activation of the STAT3 pathway. Neutralization of CD47 or disruption of the IL-6-STAT3 axis reduced the ability of tumor cells to escape phagocytosis. Moreover, CD47 blockade could enhance Mϕ-mediated phagocytosis in the presence of chemotherapeutic drugs, and HCC patients with lower CD47 expression were more likely to beneﬁt from adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment. These findings revealed that Mϕ-derived IL-6 was responsible for CD47 expression on hepatoma cells, which might be served as a potential prognostic marker and a predictor for patients who might benefit from adjuvant TACE treatment.
