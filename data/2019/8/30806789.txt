Purpose:Although alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a useful prognostic marker in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a recent study has shown that the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is also associated with the postoperative survival in such patients.Objective:To investigate the significance of the NLR in patients with primary HCC (p-HCC) showing a normal preoperative AFP.Methods:Among 478 p-HCC patients undergoing curative surgery, 112 who had a normal AFP ( 3.2). Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to compare clinical features with the overall survival (OS).Results:A multivariate analysis of the clinical features showed that the NLR (> 3.2/≤ 3.2) (hazard ratio 2.366; 95% CI 1.069-5.235; P = 0.034) was closely associated with the OS, along with the age (> 65/≤ 65 years) (P = 0.033). Group B had a significantly lower survival ratio than group A in terms of not only the OS (P = 0.013), but also the cancer-specific survival (P = 0.002) and relapse-free survival (P = 0.039).Conclusions:An elevated NLR (> 3.2) is predictive of a poor survival in patients with primary HCC (p-HCC) showing normal AFP levels.
