As one of the major alkaloid components in Sophoraflavescensait (kushen), oxymatrine has been used widely across the world in anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapies. However, the effect in the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and related mechanism(s) are still unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-metastatic effect of oxymatrine on HCC cells. Oxymatrine could also inhibit the protein levels of MMP-2/-9 in a dose-dependent relationship. Moreover, oxymatrine reduces the activity of p38 signaling pathway via inhibiting the phosphorylation of p38. The inhibition effect of oxymatrine on the expression of MMP-2/-9 and the phosphorylated of p38 was also detected in vivo. Combined treatment with p38 signaling pathway inhibitor and oxymatrine may have a synergistic effect on MMP-2/-9 and invasion of HCC cells. Therefore, oxymatrine may have inhibited GBC invasiveness by reducing the expression of MMP-2/-9 via inhibiting the activity of p38 signaling pathway. As a potentially novel therapeutic drug, oxymatrine may play an important role in the treatment of HCC.
