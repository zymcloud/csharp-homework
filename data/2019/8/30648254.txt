Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignant tumor and constitutes a major health threat globally. Intermediate HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging, stage B) encompasses a wide range of patients and is characterized by substantial heterogeneity with varying tumor burdens and liver functions. Therefore, it is paramount to evaluate the patient's overall conditions and to select the most appropriate therapy based on available evidence. Transarterial chemoembolization is the recommended first-line therapy for intermediate HCC patients. However, in clinical practice, other treatment options are also used as alternative therapies, such as hepatic resection, percutaneous thermal ablation, radiotherapy (RT), systemic treatment, immunotherapy, and so forth. In this review, we will introduce current treatment strategies for intermediate HCC, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and propose future directions.
