The expression of HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) plays a major role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the function of HAX-1 in HCC metastasis is unclear. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used to examine HAX-1 expression in HCC cell lines with different metastatic potential, and in tumor tissues with or without intrahepatic metastasis. HCC tissue arrays (n = 144) were used to assess correlations between clinicopathological parameters and HAX-1 expression. We also examined the effect of HAX-1 on promoting HCC cell metastasis in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that the expression levels of HAX-1 were higher in metastatic HCC cell lines than in non-metastatic HCC cell lines. HAX-1 was also significantly upregulated in primary HCC tissues with intrahepatic metastasis compared with those without intrahepatic metastasis. HCC in patients with high HAX-1 expression is more likely to metastasize. HAX-1 expression was associated with malignant progression and poor prognosis, and HAX1 silencing inhibited HCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and decreased HCC cell lung metastasis in vivo, whereas HAX-1 overexpression had the inverse effect. Moreover, HAX-1 increased HCC cell metastasis by promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Finally, we revealed that HAX-1 modulated EMT in HCC cells by increasing NF-κB/p65 nuclear translocation. In conclusion, HAX-1 promotes HCC metastasis by EMT through activating the NF-κB pathway, suggesting that HAX-1 could be a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
