Kidney cancer is the ninth most common malignancy in the United States. Most kidney cancers are clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and arise as solid tumors from kidney parenchyma. In the setting of metastatic disease, a primary renal tumor is usually identified, and metastases are often to lung, bone, liver, and brain. Metastatic RCC without an identifiable solid kidney tumor is exceedingly rare. We report the case of a 52 year old male with a rare cutaneous RCC metastasis without an identifiable primary renal tumor.
