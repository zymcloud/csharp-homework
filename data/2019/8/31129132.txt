A preclinical study using DEN-induced HCC rat model was attempted to evaluate the antitumor potential of zolmitriptan (ZOL). The molecular insights were investigated using ELISA, qRT-PCR and Western blot techniques. The result confirmed that the HCC condition was developed in response to lower expressions of caspase 3 and 9 which, in turn, was due to the upstream regulation of iNOS, Bcl-xl and Bcl-2, and downstream regulation of eNOS, BAX, BAD and Cyt C. The treatment with ZOL caused the significant activation of caspase mediated apoptotic signals that could be responsible for its anti-HCC potential. Later, 1H NMR based serum metabolomics study confirmed that ZOL restored the perturbed metabolites associated with DEN-induced HCC. The antineoplastic potential of ZOL was found comparable or to some degree better than the marketed chemotherapeutics, 5-flurouracil.
