We retrospectively analyzed adverse effects(AEs), overall survival(OS), and progression-free survival(PFS)in 15 consecutive patients treated with FOLFIRINOX as the first-line treatment for recurrent or unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma( PDAC)between February 2014 and December 2017 in our hospital. Eleven patients were treated for unresectable PDAC with distant metastases(UR-M), and 4 were treated for locally advanced unresectable PDAC(UR-LA). The median age was 56(range: 40-75)years. Nine patients were male, and 6 were female. The performance status was 0 or 1 in all patients. Tumors were located in the pancreas head in 8 cases and in the body-tail in 7 cases. Grade 5 AEs were observed in 1 case in which liver abscess causing sepsis resulted in mortality. The response rate was 20.0%, and the disease control rate was 66.7%. Two patients underwent conversion surgery after FOLFIRINOX treatment. Seven patients received a nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine regimen as second-line treatment. The median OS and PFS were 17.0 and 8.4 months, respectively, and the 1-year survival rate was 66.7%. FOLFIRINOX for recurrent and unresectable PDAC showed relatively good tumor control. However, strict attention is required for severe AEs. Conversion surgery might be effective in patients who are good responders even if they have metastatic disease.
