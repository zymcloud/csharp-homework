Primary or acquired resistant mechanisms prevent the employment of individualized therapy with target drugs like the mTOR inhibitor everolimus (EVE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current study evaluated the effect of 1,25(OH)2Vitamin D (VitD) treatment on EVE sensitivity in established models of HCC cell lines resistant to everolimus (EveR). DNA content and colony formation assays, which measure the proliferative index, revealed that VitD pre-treatment re-sensitizes EveR cells to EVE treatment. The evaluation of epithelial and mesenchymal markers by western blot and immunofluorescence showed that VitD restored an epithelial phenotype in EveR cells, in which prolonged EVE treatment induced transition to mesenchymal phenotype. Moreover, VitD treatment prompted hepatic miRNAs regulation, evaluated by liver miRNA finder qPCR array. In particular, miR-375 expression was up-regulated by VitD in EveR cells, in which miR-375 was down-regulated compared to parental cells, with consequent inhibition of oncogenes involved in drug resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as MTDH, YAP-1 and c-MYC. In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrated that VitD can re-sensitize HCC cells resistant to EVE treatment triggering miR-375 up-regulation and consequently down-regulating several oncogenes responsible of EMT and drug resistance.
