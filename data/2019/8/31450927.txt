Background and objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a potential health problem in Egypt because of the high prevalence of HCV infection. Using alpha-fetoprotein for diagnosis is unsatisfactory especially in early stages. Many studies showed that microRNAs (miRNA) expression may be associated with the development and progression of various types of cancer including HCC and it may serve as biomarkers for diagnosis. This study examined two miRNAs which are miRNA-122 and miRNA-224 if it could serve as biomarkers for diagnosis of HCC. Methods: This study included 20 patients with HCV-induced HCC and 20 patients with HCV-induced liver cirrhosis for comparison. As well as 20 healthy volunteers as controls. All participants were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, and determination of serum alpha-fetoprotein. Quantification of plasma miRNA-122 and miRNA-224 was done by real-time quantitative PCR. Results: Our results showed that levels of miRNA-122 were significantly lower in HCC group compared to the cirrhosis group and controls, while levels of miRNA-224 were significantly higher. The levels of both miRNAs have a correlation with tumor size. Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of miRNA-122 (sensitivity 95%, specificity 81%, p-value
