Goals: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported to be the third most common malignant tumor and has the highest rate of mortality. To increase the chemotherapy efficacy of HCC, a drug delivery system featured with desirable active targeting ability, delivery efficiency and immune evasion is in high demand. Methods: We have developed a drug nanocarrier by utilizing a homotypic cancer cell membrane for targeted chemotherapy of HCC. Structurally, the homotypic HepG2 cell membrane was used as the cloak, and a poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle as the core, resulting in the nanocarrier HepM-PLGA. Results: The HepM-PLGA nanoparticles exhibit excellent targeting ability toward HepG2 cells. Doxorubicin (Dox) carried by HepM-PLGA possesses high delivery efficiency and a remarkable in vitro therapeutic effect. In in vivo experiments, HepM-PLGA delivers Dox directly to the tumor lesion of nude mice, and tumor volume decreases by approximately 90% after treatment. Conclusion: We have developed a drug nanocarrier by utilizing a homotypic cancer cell membrane for targeted chemotherapy of HCC with excellent active targeting ability. This biomimetic platform not only effectively treats HCC but also provides a sound strategy for the treatment of other cancers via changes in the corresponding homotypic cancer cell membrane.
