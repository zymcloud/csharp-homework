We aimed to investigate the early changes in ammonia levels and liver function in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with lenvatinib. This retrospective study included 23 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were able to receive lenvatinib continuously for at least 1 week. We compared their ammonia levels (NH3), total bilirubin (Bil), albumin, and prothrombin (PT) activity at before and after 1 week of lenvatinib administration, and additionally, compared the 2 groups which were divided based on the presence/absence of portosystemic collaterals (PSCs). Before administration of lenvatinib the patients with PSCs had significantly worse ammonia levels and liver function than the patients without PSCs (NH3: P = 0.013, Bil: P = 0.004, PT: P = 0.047, respectively). Moreover, the indices were worse in all the patients after 1 week of lenvatinib than before administration (NH3: P = 0.001, Bil: P = 0.025, PT: P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, the changes in ammonia levels were investigated for 4 weeks. The ammonia level increased, to peak at 2 weeks, but decreased after 3 weeks. None of the patients discontinued lenvatinib therapy because of an adverse event. The ammonia levels of the study patients increased from baseline at 1 week after lenvatinib administration, but therapy could be continued for 4 weeks by appropriate management.
