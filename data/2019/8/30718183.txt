Background:The resection margin (RM) status and microscopic vascular invasion (MVI) are known prognostic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An enhanced understanding of their impact on long-term prognosis is required to improve oncological outcomes.Methods:Using multi-institutional data, the different impact of the RM status (narrow, Results:In 801 patients, 306 (38%) had a narrow RM and 352 (44%) had positive MVI. The median OS and RFS were 109.8 and 74.8 months in patients with wide RM & negative MVI, 93.5 and 53.1 months with wide RM & positive MVI, 79.2 and 41.6 months with narrow RM & negative MVI, and 69.2 and 37.5 months with narrow RM & positive MVI (both P Conclusions:Concomitant having narrow RM and positive MVI increases the risks of postoperative death and recurrence by about 2-fold in patients with solitary HCC.
