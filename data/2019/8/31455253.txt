Background:Blood counting and the liver function tests, as the routine examinations, can reflect the immune and nutritional status of the body, our aim is to assess the prognostic significance of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels and AST/ALT in primary hepatic carcinoma.Methods:Clinico-pathological data of 414 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma in the 1st Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical College between January 2007 to January 2014 was analyzed retrospectively in this study. Survival curves were described by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by Log-rank test, univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify the prognostic factors.Results:GGT was positively correlated with the tumor size(P = 0.000), tumor volume (P = 0.000), tumor volume percent (P = 0.004), TNM stage(P = 0.009), 1-year survival rate (P = 0.000), 3- years survival rate (P = 0.000) and 5-years survival rate(P = 0.000). The serum ALT/AST was significantly correlated with age (P = 0.047), tumor size(P = 0.002), tumor volume (P = 0.010), tumor volume percent (P = 0.005), TNM stage(P = 0.006), liver cirrhosis(P = 0.003), 3- years survival rate (P = 0.032) and 5-years survival rate(P = 0.000). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the patients with primary hepatic carcinoma had a longer time in the low GGT group and low AST/ALT group, showing a significant difference (P Conclusions:GGT and AST/ALT were independent factors for predicting overall survival rate of primary hepatic carcinoma patients.
