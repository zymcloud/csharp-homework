Background:Lenvatinib is a newly approved molecular targeted drug for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the high cost associated with this treatment poses a huge financial burden on patients and the entire public health system. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies that enhance the antitumor effect of lenvatinib.Methods:The antitumor effects of chelidonine or/and lenvatinib on HCC cell lines MHCC97-H and LM-3 were examined using the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2- H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. For the in-vivo investigation, the effect on subcutaneous or intrahepatic tumor growth in nude mice was also determined. The mRNA levels of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related factors were examined through quantitative polymerase chain reaction or Western blot.Results:In the present study, we found that treatment with chelidonine enhanced the apoptotic effect of lenvatinib on HCC cells and the in-vivo growth of HCC tumors in nude mice. Mechanistically, treatment with chelidonine increased the expression of epithelial indicator E-cadherin, whereas it decreased the expression of mesenchymal indicators N-cadherin and Vimentin. These findings suggest that chelidonine restricted the EMT in HCC cells.Conclusion:Chelidonine inhibits the process of EMT and enhances the antitumor effect of lenvatinib on HCC cells.
