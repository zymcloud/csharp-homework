The heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin is known to accumulate in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Agrin is important for neoangiogenesis in HCC tissues, and is incorporated into newly formed vasculature, but exactly how agrin contributes to the pathology of HCC remains to be fully defined. We therefore examined the clinical relevance of agrin as it pertains to HCC progression and prognosis using tissue sections from a total of 313 HCC patients. We found that agrin expression was detectable in more HCC samples (25.4% vs. 77.1%; P
