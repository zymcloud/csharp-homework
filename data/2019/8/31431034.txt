Background:The extent of liver resection for gallbladder cancer (GBC) is still debated. We evaluated the post-operative and oncological outcomes of patients with GBC who underwent liver wedge excision.Methods:Patients who underwent an upfront radical cholecystectomy (with a liver wedge excision of 2.5- 3 centimetres) from June 2010 to December 2015 were retrospectively analysed.Results:In total, 558 patients underwent surgery for GBC of which 97 cases of primary GBC who underwent upfront radical cholecystectomy were selected. At a median follow up of 47 months, 57.7% of patients were disease free where as 16.5% were alive with disease. Two (2.1%) patients died in postoperative period, 17 (17.5%) patients died of disease, and 6 (6.2%) died of unrelated causes. Eleven patients had loco-regional recurrence and 22 failed at distant sites. Only one patient recurred in the gall bladder bed. Three-year overall survival (OS) of stage II was 86.1% and of stage III was 59.6%.Conclusions:In our series surgical outcomes of radical cholecystectomy with wedge resection of the liver emphasizes its oncological equivalence compared to formal segment IVb/V excision. Our experience with wedge resection gains significance in the absence of any level I evidence and can prompt a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) in future which may help in standardizing surgery for GBC.
