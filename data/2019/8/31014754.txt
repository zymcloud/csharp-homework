Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to Hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection is a major cause in Asia-Pacific countries. Its early detection is of paramount importance using a marker having both sensitivity and specificity. The present study promises diagnostic and prognostic markers by the identification of site-specific glycoforms on Haptoglobin (Hp) using LC-MS/MS and lectin ELISA in liver diseased conditions in HBV infection.Methods:Three groups of patients: chronic, liver cirrhosis and HCC with HBV infection along with controls were enrolled. Hp was purified using affinity column chromatography and, peptide sequence, N-glycosylation site, glycan composition and glycoforms were identified using mass spectrometry. Quantitative lectin ELISA was used to measure levels of fucosylation on Hp in liver diseases due to HBV.Results:Hp levels were significantly lower in HCC when compared with Non-HCC cases (p Conclusion:Quantitation of fucosylation levels on Hp protein using Lectin ELISA may be useful glycobiomarker either alone or in combination (AFP + DCP + FucHp; AUC = 0.94) in HBV HCC diagnosis in clinical practice.
