Objective:Hepatocellular carcinima is one of the most common tumors in clinic and also one of the leading causes of death from cancer worldwide. Quercetin shows significant effects on blocking the development of various cancers.Methods:We used the human hepatocellular carcinoma LM3 and nude mice tumor model to assess the effects of quercetin in hepatocellular carcinoma and clarify its mechanism of action. We collected LM3 cell line treated with different doses of quercetin at different time periods and determined the vital indexes. The liver tissues of mice were collected and used for western boltting (WB), Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and TUNEL staining.Results:Results indicated that quercetin suppressed the Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth both in vivo and in vitro. Quercetin could disturb LM3 cells proliferation and cell cycle distribution, thus inducing apoptosis. At the same time, quercetin inhibited LM3 cells migration and invasion and promoted HCC autophagy. These effects at least partly depended on the down-regulation of the activation of JAK2 and STAT3 by quercetin.Conclusion:Quercetin inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma progression by modulating cell apoptosis, migration, invasion, and autophagy; and its effects were at least partly related with the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
