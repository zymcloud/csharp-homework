The liver performs a significant role in innate and adaptive immunity. Heat stress causes oxidative stress in liver tissues and reduces the immune responses of laying hens which can cause several diseases affecting poultry-production performance. Hepatic inflammation is a common trigger of liver disease, which is reflected by hepatic tissue damage leading to fibrogenesis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Dietary manipulation of curcumin has been proposed to ameliorate the immune status of chickens under heat stress. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of curcumin supplementation on TLR4 mediated non-specific immune response in liver of laying hens under high-temperature conditions. Experimental groups contained two controls groups (high temperature and thermo-neutral control (HC and NC) fed basal diet) and three high-temperature curcumin treatments groups (HT100, HT200 and HT300). Laying hens in HC and HT groups exposed 6 h/day heat stress (32 ± 1 °C). The results of present study showed that heat stress curcumin treatment group had reduced inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) as compared to HC and NC group. Pathological lesions and DNA damage of immune tissues were decreased in heat stress curcumin supplementation as compared to HC and NC group. Furthermore, PCNA, TLR4 and its downstream gene expression as well as protein expression (TLR4, NF-κB and PCNA) were significantly down regulated in heat stress curcumin supplemented group as compared to HC and NC group. Therefore, it is concluded that heat stressed hens supplemented with dietary curcumin enhance the immunity of laying hens and combat stressful environmental conditions.
