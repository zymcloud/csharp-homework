Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a potentially fatal complication of chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is now the preferred treatment due to good outcomes. We present a unique case of recurrence of HCC at the porta hepatis four years after orthotopic liver transplantation diagnosed via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Our report also highlights that intrahepatic recurrence of HCC can be surgically treated. However, further studies are needed to develop treatment algorithms for intra-hepatic recurrence of HCC post liver transplantation.
