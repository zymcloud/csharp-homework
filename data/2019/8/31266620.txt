Epidemiologic studies suggest that 10% to 15% of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the United States as a result of the shared modality of transmission, but the true prevalence is not known. The progression of liver disease to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is generally faster in patients who are coinfected, and HCV is usually more predominant. Immunosuppression of the host or eradication of hepatitis C can change this paradigm, causing hepatitis B reactivation. This review describes HCV-HBV viral interactions, risks for reactivation, screening, and society guidelines for surveillance and treatment.
