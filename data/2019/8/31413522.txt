Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is as prevalent as ever as a cancer-related mortality, and some would even argue that it is increasing, the pattern of its etiologies has been changing. Specifically, the domination of viral hepatitis C virus is being overcome, partly because of the emergence of the antiviral treatments, and partly because of the significant increase, especially in developed countries, of the combination of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This editorial will explore the interconnection of this group of diseases and how they are linked to HCC. More importantly, it will argue that this shift in HCC etiology essentially means that we have to change how we approach the treatment of HCC, by changing our focus (and resources) to earlier stages of the disease development in order to prevent the appearance and progression of HCC.
