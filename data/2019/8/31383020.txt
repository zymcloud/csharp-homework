Background:Studies focusing on the treatment effectiveness of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided laser ablation (LA) for hepatic tumours or the technical differences from percutaneous ultrasonography (US)-guided LA are lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment response and preliminary efficacy of US- and EUS-guided LA for hepatic tumours.Methods:We performed a prospective analysis of treatment response and preliminary efficacy in 92 consecutive patients who underwent US-LA and EUS-LA from January 2015 to June 2017. The primary endpoint was complete tumour ablation (CTA). The secondary endpoint was 12-month local tumour progression (LTP).Results:Among a total of 120 hepatic lesions, 20 lesions were ablated under the guidance of EUS. The application of the multi-fibre technique (0, 0% vs. 69, 69.0%, p < 0.01), tumours located in the left lobe (18, 90.0% vs. 28, 28.0%, p < 0.01) and multi-session ablation (4, 20.0% vs. 4, 4.0%, p = 0.009) were factors found to be significantly different between the EUS-LA and US-LA groups. The CTA was achieved in 94% of patients in the US-LA group and 100% of patients in the EUS-LA group (p = 0.261). Twelve-month LTP was observed in 8.5% of the patients in the US-LA group and 15.0% of the patients in the EUS-LA group with no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.372). The multivariate analysis identified that the tumour diagnosis (p = 0.004; 95% CI, 0.039-0.547) was the only independent risk factor associated with 12-month LTP.Conclusions:Patients in the EUS-LA and US-LA groups shared as similar treatment response and preliminary efficacy in the treatment of hepatic tumours. A hybrid LA approach to nonsurgical hepatic tumours appeared to be reasonable.
