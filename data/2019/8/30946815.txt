Background:The venous thromboembolism, which may be caused by increased platelet activation, is a risk factor for tumor prognosis. We determined the platelet activation status for diagnosis and predicting postoperative prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We conducted a prospective study of 191 patients diagnosed with HCC at Zhongshan Hospital from April 2016 to July 2016 as well as 99 healthy people. The platelet activation status was assessed by 2 platelet markers, PAC-1 and CD62p, using flow cytometry. The patients were treated with TACE or resection and monitored for â‰¥6 months. The diagnostic value of marker-positive platelets was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve and the postoperative value were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and COX regression model.Results:All the 3 groups with high levels of marker-positive platelets were likely to be diagnosed with HCC and the PAC-1+ percentage had the best efficacy. The univariate analysis showed that the levels of PAC-1+ and CD62p+ platelets was risker factors for poor postoperative prognosis after both TACE and resection. Moreover, the multivariate analysis revealed that the level of PAC-1+ platelets was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis.Conclusions:The PAC-1+ percentage of platelets is a new indicator for diagnosis and predicting postoperative prognosis.
