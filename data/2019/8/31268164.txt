Alternative splicing in tumor cells may be used as a molecular marker for the differential diagnosis of certain tumor types and assessment of prognosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations among alternative splicing events, splicing factors, and the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The alternative splicing event profiles of 371 patients with HCC were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) SpliceSeq data, and the percent‑splice‑in value for each splicing event was calculated. The association between alternative splicing events and overall survival was evaluated. The most significant prognosis‑related splicing events were used to build up a prognostic index (PI). A total of 3,082 survival‑associated alternative splicing events were detected in HCC. The final PI based on all of the most significant candidate alternative splicing events exhibited better performance in distinguishing good or poor survival in patients compared to the PI based on a single type of splicing event. Receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed the high efficiency of the PI in predicting the survival of HCC patients, with an area under the curve of 0.914. The overexpression of 32 prognosis‑related splicing factor genes could also predict poor prognosis in patients with HCC. In conclusion, the constructed computational prognostic model based on HCC‑specific alternative splicing events may be used as a molecular marker for the prognosis of HCC.
