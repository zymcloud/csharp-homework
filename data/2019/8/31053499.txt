Objective:To investigate intestinal endotoxemia (IETM), intestinal permeability (IP) and cytokine activity in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC).Materials and methods:Twenty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 28 with compensated LC, 33 with decompensated LC, 24 with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), 26 with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), and 24 with decompensated LC complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were recruited. Thirty-one healthy people were included as a control group. Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, D-lactate, endotoxin, and claudin-3 levels were assayed. Data were compared using Pearson correlation testing and analysis of variance, with P Results:TNF-α, claudin-3, and endotoxin levels were significantly increased (P Conclusion:Plasma claudin-3, but not D-lactate, was found to be a marker of IP in patients with liver diseases. Elevated plasma TNF-α in such patients was likely to have injured the intestinal barrier, leading to IETM, especially in end-stage LC.
