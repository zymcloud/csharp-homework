Background:Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a documented risk during cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer. Cases of HBV reactivation in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment have been reported; however, the incidence of HBV reactivation in patients treated with EGFR TKIs has not yet been reported.Materials and methods:We enrolled 171 patients who were diagnosed as having NSCLC from 2011 through 2017 and who also had positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). All patients had received EGFR TKIs as anticancer treatment for at least 2 weeks during their treatment course. Reactivation of HBV is defined as one of the following: an increase in HBV DNA by at least 10-fold compared to baseline or an absolute increase to >10ˆ5 IU/mL with abnormal liver function.Results:The median duration of EGFR TKI treatment was 10.5 months (95% conﬁdence interval: 8.2-12.8). Sixteen (9.36%) patients met the criteria of HBV reactivation during EGFR TKI treatment, with an annual incidence of 7.86%. HBV reactivation occurred during erlotinib treatment in 6 patients, followed by 5 patients with gefitinib treatments, 3 patients with osimertinib treatment and 2 with afatinib treatment. No independent risk factor for HBV reactivation was identified.Conclusion:NSCLC patients receiving EGFR TKI treatment may have a clinically meaningful risk of HBV reactivation during the treatment period. Thus, monitoring liver function, HBV viral load and serology of HBV (i.e., HBeAg and anti-HBc) during EGFR TKI therapy is recommended for NSCLC patients with positive HBsAg.
