Background:The role of nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) therapy in intermediate and advanced hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear.Aims:The aim was to evaluate the effect of NAs therapy on survival of intermediate- and advanced-stage HBV-related HCC patients initially treated with chemoembolization.Methods:A total of 1016 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B/C HBV-related HCC patients initially treated with chemoembolization were included. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to decrease heterogeneity between the antiviral and non-antiviral groups. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the effects of NAs therapy on overall survival (OS).Results:Antiviral group (n = 394) significantly prolonged OS compared with non-antiviral group (n = 622) (p = 0.003). NAs therapy (p Conclusion:NAs therapy prolongs OS in intermediate- and advanced-stage HBV-related HCC patients initially treated with chemoembolization. After PSM processing, patients who survived â‰¥ 7 months still benefited from NAs therapy.
