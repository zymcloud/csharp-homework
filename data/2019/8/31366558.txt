Background/aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of preoperative chemotherapy on the healthy, metastasis-free part of the liver in colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis, and the relationship between chemotherapy and postoperative complications.Patients and methods:Our study included 90 cases of colorectal cancer liver metastasis resected after preoperative chemotherapy. The patients were divided into three groups according to the received chemotherapy regimen: 20 cases received mFOLFOX6, 54 cases a combination of mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab, and 16 cases a combination of mFOLFOX6 and cetuximab or panitumumab.Results:The mean numbers of sinusoidal injuries for each chemotherapy type were compared. The group treated with the combination of mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab showed a lower extent of sinusoidal injury relative to other groups; this intergroup difference became increasingly remarkable as the number of chemotherapy cycles increased. Complications of various extents were found in all three groups, but no significant differences were observed between the three groups.Conclusion:In cases where preoperative chemotherapy was extended over a long period, combined use of bevacizumab was thought to be effective because of stabilization of disturbed liver hemodynamics resulting from sinusoidal injury suppression effects, allowing effective distribution of anti-cancer agents to tumors.
