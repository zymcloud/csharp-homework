Background:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular mechanisms underlying HBV-associated HCC pathogenesis is still unclear. Genetic alterations in cancer-related genes have been linked to many human cancers. Here, we aimed to explore genetic alterations in selected cancer-related genes in patients with HBV-associated HCC.Methods:Targeted sequencing was used to analyze six cancer-related genes (PIK3CA, TP53, FAT4, IRF2, HNF4α and ARID1A) in eight pairs of HBV-associated HCC tumors and their adjacent non-tumor tissues. Sanger sequencing, quantitative PCR, Western-blotting and RNAi-mediated gene knockdown were used to further validate findings.Results:Targeted sequencing revealed thirteen non-synonymous mutations, of which 9 (69%) were found in FAT4 and 4 (31%) were found in TP53 genes. Non-synonymous mutations were not found in PIK3CA, IRF2, HNF4α and ARID1A. Among these 13 non-synonymous mutations, 12 (8 in FAT4 and 4 in TP53) were predicted to have deleterious effect on protein function by in silico analysis. For TP53, Y220S, R249S and P250R non-synonymous mutations were solely identified in tumor tissues. Further expression profiling of FAT4 and TP53 on twenty-eight pairs of HCC tumor and non-tumor tissues confirmed significant downregulation of both genes in HCC tumors compared with their non-tumor counterparts (P Conclusions:This study highlights the importance of FAT4 and TP53 in HCC pathogenesis and identifies new genetic variants that may have potentials for development of precise therapy for HCC.
