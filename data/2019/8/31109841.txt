To investigate the feasibility of assessing the ablative margin (AM) of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with 3-D contrast-enhanced ultrasound fusion imaging (3-DCEUS-FI), pre- and post-RFA 3-DCEUS images of 84 patients with HCC were fused for two radiologists to independently assess the AMs. The success rate, duration and influencing factors for registration; inter-observer agreement for AM classification; and local tumor progression (LTP) rate were evaluated. The success rate of the automatic registration (AR), which was completed within 4-12 s, was 57.1% (48/84). The duration and success rate of the interactive registration (IR) were 4.2 ± 1.8 min and 91.7% (77/84) for radiologist A and 4.8 ± 2.1 min and 91.7% (77/84) for radiologist B, respectively. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the pre-RFA image quality, number of vessels (≥3 mm) and presence of acoustic shadow were independent factors for AR (p
