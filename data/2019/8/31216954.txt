Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is a specific form of thromboembolism that occurs at a rate of 1.5% in all patients hospitalized with a deep vein thrombosis. Malignant IVC thrombosis may occur due to compression from a tumor mass or metastasis or may also occur through tumor invasion of the venous vasculature. Obstruction of the IVC can lead to IVC syndrome, marked by ascites, lower extremity edema, and even congestive hepatic failure. We present a case of extensive IVC thrombosis in a 69-year-old female with metastatic adrenal cell carcinoma, presenting with severe bilateral lower extremity edema and ascites. Computed tomography showed IVC compression by the caudate lobe due to a metastatic liver mass and extensive clot burden of the IVC extending from the renal veins to the right atrium (RA). She underwent percutaneous IVC stenting with 4 stents placed in tandem from the IVC to the RA. Her hospital course was complicated by gastrointestinal bleed requiring clipping, acute liver failure, and hypophysitis due to trial therapy. Although her IVC symptoms were partially relieved with percutaneous intervention, her acute liver failure worsened and she was ultimately transitioned to hospice care.
