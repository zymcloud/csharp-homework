Hepatitis B is a widespread disease which affects millions of people worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can lead to significant morbidity and mortality due to complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathophysiology of hepatitis is critical to diagnosing CHB. Deciding which patients with CHB should be treated is an important decision as treatment can often lead to better outcomes in the appropriate patient population. The nucleos(t)ide analog inhibitors entecavir and tenofovir are currently the mainstay of treatment as they are able to successfully suppress the virus and lead to fewer complications. Novel therapies are currently being developed which may offer a potential cure for this disease in the future.
Chronic hepatitis B (CHB); entecavir; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); tenofovir.
