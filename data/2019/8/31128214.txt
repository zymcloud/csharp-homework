Primary liver cancer ranks among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Risk factors are closely linked to inflammation, such as viral hepatitis and alcoholic as well as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Among the pathways involved in the pathogenesis of malignant liver tumors, dysregulation of NF-κB signaling plays a prominent role. It provides a link between inflammation and cancer. To examine the role of NF-κB in a MYC-induced model of hepatocellular carcinoma we deleted NEMO (IKKγ) specifically from hepatocytes. NEMO deletion accelerated tumor development and shortened survival, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function of NF-κB signaling. We observed increased proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis, as well as activation of MAPK and STAT signaling. Importantly, deletion of NEMO modified the tumor phenotype from hepatocellular carcinoma to combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma. The intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tumor component showed increased expression of progenitor markers such as Sox9 and reduced expression of mature hepatic markers such as CPS1. In both cases tumorigenesis was reversible by turning off MYC expression. To our knowledge this is the first mouse model of combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma and may provide insights into the development of this rare malignant tumor.
