Background:microRNA-139 (miR-139) is dysregulated in various types of tumors and plays a key role in carcinogenesis. miR-139 may be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of cancers. However, the data from the literature are not consistent. The present study aimed to verify the prognostic and diagnostic values of miR-139 in solid tumors.Data sources:PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched and publications from January 2011 to August 2017 were included. We used Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to further validate this meta-analysis.Results:Eight individual studies from seven articles were included. Pooled analyses showed that low miR-139 expression was related to worse overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.27; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.74-2.95; P Conclusions:Low miR-139 expression was related to poor prognosis in HCC and GBM, which could be regarded as a potential prognostic biomarker. However, its precise functional role in CRC still need to be further investigated through larger samples and multicenter studies.
