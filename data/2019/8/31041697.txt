Purpose:We address the automatic segmentation of healthy and cancerous liver tissues (parenchyma, active and necrotic parts of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor) on multiphase CT images using a deep learning approach.Methods:We devise a cascaded convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Two strategies for dealing with multiphase information are compared: Single-phase images are concatenated in a multi-dimensional features map on the input layer, or output maps are computed independently for each phase before being merged to produce the final segmentation. Each network of the cascade is specialized in the segmentation of a specific tissue. The performances of these networks taken separately and of the cascaded architecture are assessed on both single-phase and on multiphase images.Results:In terms of Dice coefficients, the proposed method is on par with a state-of-the-art method designed for automatic MR image segmentation and outperforms previously used technique for interactive CT image segmentation. We validate the hypothesis that several cascaded specialized networks have a higher prediction accuracy than a single network addressing all tasks simultaneously. Although the portal venous phase alone seems to provide sufficient contrast for discriminating tumors from healthy parenchyma, the multiphase information brings significant improvement for the segmentation of cancerous tissues (active versus necrotic part).Conclusion:The proposed cascaded multiphase architecture showed promising performances for the automatic segmentation of liver tissues, allowing to reliably estimate the necrosis rate, a valuable imaging biomarker of the clinical outcome.
