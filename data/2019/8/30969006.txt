Aims:The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is still poor. We aimed to evaluate the impact of TACE combined with radiofrequency ablation (TACE+RFA) on the prognosis of HCC patients using decision-tree analysis after propensity score matching.Methods:This was a retrospective study. We enrolled 420 patients with HCC treated with TACE alone (n = 311) or TACE+RFA (n = 109) between 1998 and 2016 (median age, 72 years; male / female, 272/148; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A / B, 215/205). The prognosis of patients who underwent TACE+RFA was compared to patients who underwent TACE alone after propensity score matching. Decision-tree analysis was used to investigate the profile for prognosis of the patients.Results:After propensity score matching, there was no significant difference in age, sex, BCLC stage, or albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score between both groups. The survival rate of the TACE+RFA group was significantly higher than the TACE alone group (median survival time [MST] 57.9 months vs. 33.1 months, P 7 ng/mL and ALBI Conclusion:Decision-tree analysis after propensity score matching showed that TACE+RFA could prolong the survival of HCC patients compared to TACE alone.
