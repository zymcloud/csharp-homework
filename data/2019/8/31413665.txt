Background:CircRNA myosin light chain kinase (circRNA MYLK) has been shown to promote the progression of various tumor diseases. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential molecular mechanism of circMYLK in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expressions of circMYLK, miR-362-3p and Rab23 in HCC tissues and cell lines. Huh7 and Hep3B cells were selected to explore the role of circMYLK in proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells in vitro. The interaction among circMYLK, miR-362-3p and Rab23 was investigated by biological information and dual luciferase gene reporter assay. The effect of circMYLK on HCC tumor growth in vivo was studied in a tumor xenograft model in mice.Results:CircMYLK was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, which was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. In addition, knockdown of circMYLK remarkably inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. MiR-362-3p was a direct target of circMYLK, and Rab23 was a direct target gene of miR-362-3p. Meanwhile, circMYLK was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-362-3p and positively correlated with Rab23 expression. Moreover, either overexpressed miR-362-3p or silencing Rab23 could observably suppress the enhanced proliferation, invasion, and migration induced by circMYLK in Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Finally, knockdown of circMYLK and overexpressed miR-362-3p could suppress the expression of Rab23, thus inhibiting the growth and proliferation of Hep3B cells in vivo.Conclusion:circMYLK promotes the occurrence and development of HCC by regulating the miR-362-3p/Rab23 axis, which provides a novel direction and theoretical basis for the early diagnosis and treatment of HCC.
