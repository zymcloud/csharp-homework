Background:To evaluate the association of liver fibrosis scores with PSA level among U.S. adult men overall and by race/ethnicity.Methods:Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2001-2010, were used. Males ages â‰¥40 years without a prostate cancer diagnosis and who had serum PSA, liver enzymes, albumin, and platelet counts measured as part of NHANES protocol were included. Liver fibrosis was measured using three scores: aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). We assessed overall and race/ethnicity-stratified geometric mean PSA by fibrosis score using predictive margins by linear regression, and the association of abnormal fibrosis scores (APRI > 1, FIB-4 > 2.67, NFS > 0.676) and elevated PSA (>4 ng/mL) by logistic regression.Results:A total of 6,705 men were included. Abnormal liver fibrosis scores were present in 2.1% (APRI), 3.6% (FIB-4), and 5.6% (NFS). Men with higher fibrosis scores had lower geometric mean PSA (all P trend < 0.02). Men with abnormal APRI had a lower odds of PSA > 4 ng/mL [adjusted OR (aOR) = 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.11-0.96]. Compared with men with 0 abnormal scores, those with 2 or 3 abnormal fibrosis scores had a lower odds of PSA > 4 ng/mL (aOR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33-0.91). The patterns were similar by race/ethnicity.Conclusions:Men of all race/ethnicities with higher liver fibrosis scores had lower serum PSA, and men with advanced fibrosis scores had a lower odds of an elevated PSA.Impact:These findings support further research to inform the likelihood of delay in prostate cancer detection in men with abnormal liver function.
