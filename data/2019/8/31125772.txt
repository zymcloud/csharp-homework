Background:Intracranial metastasis is a common complication of systemic malignancy. A rare subset of intracranial masses constitutes tumor-to-tumor metastasis, in which an extracranial neoplasm hematogenously spreads to an existing intracranial lesion.Case description:Here we present the unique case of a 59-year-old man with known hepatocellular carcinoma who presented with acute headaches, double vision, vertigo, and gait instability in the context of 2 years of right-sided hearing loss. Head imaging showed a heterogeneous right cerebellopontine angle mass extending into the porus acousticus with adjacent cerebellar edema. Histopathologic analysis after resection found coexisting hepatocellular carcinoma within a vestibular schwannoma.Conclusions:Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is an important consideration in the diagnostic work-up and treatment of patients with known systemic malignancy who present with a new intracranial lesion. This pathologic entity could be missed if this patient were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery such as Gamma Knife.
