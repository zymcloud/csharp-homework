Background:We aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (3-5 cm) in comparison with surgical resection.Methods:Included in this study were 388 patients with primary and solitary hepatocellular carcinoma, of whom 196 patients underwent surgical resection and the other 192 patients received radiofrequency ablation. Clinicopathological characteristics, prognosis, post-treatment complications, hospital stay, and financial expenditures between the two groups were compared retrospectively.Results:The result of propensity score matching and subgroup analysis showed that the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival were comparable in patients with tumors of 3-4 cm in diameter between surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation groups. However, when the tumor size exceeded 4 cm in diameter, surgical resection exhibited a superior long-term prognosis compared with radiofrequency ablation. Nevertheless, hepatectomy was associated with high occurrences of postoperative complications, long hospital stay, and high hospitalization cost as compared with radiofrequency ablation. Further analysis of the relationship between tumor size and pathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma showed that tumors larger than 4 cm were positively correlated with a high rate of microvascular invasion and satellite nodule formation.Conclusion:For solitary hepatocellular carcinoma of 3-4 cm in diameter, radiofrequency ablation could achieve a comparable prognosis with a low incidence of post-treatment complications and low hospitalization costs, while surgical resection is recommended for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma tumors of 4-5 cm in diameter when long-term prognosis is considered.
