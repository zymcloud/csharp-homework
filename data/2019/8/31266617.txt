The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) differs globally. CHB is responsible for 30% of all deaths from cirrhosis and 40% from hepatocellular carcinoma. The WHO developed guidelines in 2015 on prevention, care, and treatment of chronic HBV infection targeted to program managers in all health care settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Several of the recommendations differ from those of the major Liver Societies, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). This review highlights key differences between the AASLD and WHO guidelines and discusses the impact on management of CHB.
