Background:Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is a predominant compound in Artemisia annua L., and it has been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis.Methods:In this study, the antitumor potential of DHA was investigated in the MHCC97-L hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Cells were treated at various concentrations of DHA, and then the cell cycle, viability, and DNA synthesis were measured to evaluate cell proliferation. Furthermore, the expression of genes and proteins related to proliferation and apoptosis was measured to determine the effects of DHA. Finally, the mechanism was investigated using RNA-sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways, and JNK/NF-κB pathways were evaluated with Western blotting.Results:Cells were treated with a concentration range of DHA from 1 to 100 μM, and cell proliferation was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the genes and proteins involved in typical cellular functions of MHCC97-L cells were significantly inhibited. DHA treatment downregulated the angiogenic gene ANGPTL2 and the cell proliferation genes CCND1, E2F1, PCNA, and BCL2. DHA treatment significantly upregulated the apoptotic genes CASP3, CASP8, CASP9, and TNF. Global gene expression profiles identified 2064 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among them, 744 were upregulated and 1320 were downregulated. Furthermore, MAPK, NF-kappa B, and TNF pathways were enriched based on the DEGs, and the consensus DEG was identified as TNF using a Venn diagram of those pathways. DHA promoted phosphorylation of JNK, inhibited nuclear p65, and then significantly induced TNF-α synthesis.Conclusion:DHA inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells by upregulating TNF expression via JNK/NF-κB pathways.
