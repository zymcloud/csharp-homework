Linc00152, located on chromosome 2p11.2, is a long intergenic non-coding RNA molecule with 828 nucleotides that is highly expressed in many types of human tumor tissues, especially in malignant tumors of the digestive system. Linc00152 promotes the occurrence and development of tumors by increasing tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis. Additionally, linc00152 contributes to the carcinogenesis of several cancers, including gastric cancer, liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, by disturbing various signaling pathways (eg PI3K/AKT, mTOR, IL-1, and NOTCH 1 signaling pathways). High linc00152 expression levels are associated with chemoresistance as well as poor prognosis and shorter survival. Continual advances made in the relevant research have indicated that linc00152 may be useful as a new tumor molecular biomarker, applicable for tumor diagnosis, targeted therapy, and prognosis assessment. This review summarizes the progress in the research into the relationship between linc00152 and the occurrence and development of malignancies based on molecular functions, regulatory mechanisms, and clinical applications.
