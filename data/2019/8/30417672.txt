The ethyl acetate extract of the rhizomes of Luvunga scandens (Roxb.) Buch. - Ham. ex Wight & Arn (Rutaceae) delivered one new acridone alkaloid named Luvungaside A (1) together with three known acridone alkaloids, namely 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (2), arborinine (3) and 1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methyl-9-acridone (4). Compounds were reported for the first time from the species L. scandens applying various chromatography methods. Chemical structures were elucidated by IR, UV, HR-ESI-MS, NMR 1D & 2D experiments and comparison with the literature. The cytotoxicity and hepatoprotective activity of compounds 1-4 in human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was measured by MTT assay. At 10-100 Î¼M, compounds expressed significant hepatoprotective effect with prevention percentage ranging from 81.1% to 194.3%, compared to the positive control quercetin displaying 49.0%.
