Among the primary neoplasias that affect the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent and the third leading cause of death related to cancer. Several risk factors predispose individuals to HCC such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), whose incidence has significantly increased worldwide. β-ionone (βI) isoprenoid is a known chemopreventive of hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the effects of this compound on NAFLD isolated or in association with hepatocarcinogenesis have not yet been evaluated. A high-fat emulsion administered for 6 weeks resulted in NAFLD in male rats, and oral treatment with βI during this period significantly attenuated its development. Moreover, the presence of NAFLD potentiated hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the resistant hepatocyte (RH) model in these animals by increasing the number and percentage of the liver section area occupied by placental glutathione S-transferase (GST-P)-positive persistent preneoplastic lesions (pPNLs), that are thought to evolve into HCC. This indicates that this NAFLD/RH protocol is suitable for studies of the influence of NAFLD on the HCC development. Therefore, here we also investigated the chemopreventive effect of βI under these two associated conditions. In this context, βI reduced the number and percentage of the liver section area occupied by pPNLs, as well as cell proliferation and the number of oval cells, which are considered potential targets for the development of HCC. Thus, βI presents not only a promising inhibitory effect on NAFLD isolated but also chemopreventive activity when it is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis.
