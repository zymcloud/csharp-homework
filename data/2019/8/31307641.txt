Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a disorder with numerous causes that is a result of hepatic outflow obstruction, in the absence of right heart failure or constrictive pericarditis. Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome is uncommon and clinically characterized by ascites, hepatomegaly, and hepatic insufficiency. In the majority of cases, patients present with chronic BCS, showing a dysmorphic liver disease with variable fibrosis deposition. In chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign regenerative nodules (called large regenerative nodules or FNH-like lesions) have been described in the literature. Very few studies have reported magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings about these nodules, using hepatobiliary contrast medium. The aim of our review is to describe the magnetic resonance imaging findings of hepatic regenerative nodules in BCS, with emphasis on the hepatobiliary phase, and to compare the imaging features of benign nodules with those of HCC.
