Our previous study indicated that microRNA 145 (miR-145) and its predicated target, erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (EPH) receptor A4 (EPHA4), was closely associated with ischemic stroke. In this study, we aimed to further explore their function in a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The expression of miR-145 in the blood of 44 patients with ischemic stroke and 37 normal controls was detected by qRT-PCR. After transfection with either the wild- or mutant-type pGL3-promoter EPHA4 3'UTR into the miR-145 mimic and miR-145 inhibitor, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to explore the interaction between miR-145 and EPHA4. qRT-PCR and Western blot were performed to further explore the effects of miR-145 on EPHA4 expression after an miR-145 mimic, an miR-145 inhibitor or LV-sh-EPHA4 was transfected into cerebral cortical neurons. The expression of miR-145 was significantly upregulated in the blood of patients with ischemic stroke compared to that of normal controls. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and Western blot results indicated that miR-145 indeed targets EPHA4 through its 3'-UTR and regulates the expression level of EPHA4 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the OGD model was successfully constructed, and miR-145 exerted a protective effects in cell viability in the OGD model by downregulating EPHA4. The expression of LOC105376244 could be regulated by the miR-145-EPHA4 interaction. MiR-145 exerted a protective effects in cell viability in the OGD model by downregulating EPHA4, which suggested their potential roles in ischemic stroke and requires further research.
