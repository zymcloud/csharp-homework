Purpose:New strategies to restore sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression and function in radioiodine therapy-refractive anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATCs) are urgently required. Recently, we reported the regulatory role of estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) in ATC cell NIS function. Herein, we identified DN200434 as a highly potent (functional IC50 = 0.006 μmol/L), selective, and orally available ERRγ inverse agonist for NIS enhancement in ATC.Experimental design:We sought to identify better ERRγ-targeting ligands and explored the crystal structure of ERRγ in complex with DN200434. After treating ATC cells with DN200434, the change in iodide-handling gene expression, as well as radioiodine avidity was examined. ATC tumor-bearing mice were orally administered with DN200434, followed by 124I-positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT). For radioiodine therapy, ATC tumor-bearing mice treated with DN200434 were administered 131I (beta ray-emitting therapeutic radioiodine) and then bioluminescent imaging was performed to monitor the therapeutic effects. Histologic analysis was performed to evaluate ERRγ expression status in normal tissue and ATC tissue, respectively.Results:DN200434-ERRγ complex crystallographic studies revealed that DN200434 binds to key ERRγ binding pocket residues through four-way interactions. DN200434 effectively upregulated iodide-handling genes and restored radioiodine avidity in ATC tumor lesions, as confirmed by 124I-PET/CT. DN200434 enhanced ATC tumor radioiodine therapy susceptibility, markedly inhibiting tumor growth. Histologic findings of patients with ATC showed higher ERRγ expression in tumors than in normal tissue, supporting ERRγ as a therapeutic target for ATC.Conclusions:DN200434 shows potential clinical applicability for diagnosis and treatment of ATC or other poorly differentiated thyroid cancers.
