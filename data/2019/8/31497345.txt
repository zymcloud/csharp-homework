Heat shock factors (HSFs) are essential for all organisms to survive exposures to acute stress. Recent years have witnessed the progress in uncovering the importance of HSFs in cancer cell oncogenesis, progression and metastasis. However, their roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and the underlying mechanism have seldom been discussed. The present study aims to uncover the two important HSFs members HSF1 and HSF2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset analysis, we investigated the prognosis value of HSF1 and HSF2 in HCC and identified HSF2 as a prediction factor of overall survival of HCC. In vitro cell line studies demonstrated that silencing HSF2 expression could decrease the proliferation in HCC cells. In depth mechanism analysis demonstrated that HSF2 promoted cell proliferation via positive regulation of aerobic glycolysis, and HSF2 interacted with euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2) to epigenetically silence fructose-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), which is a tumor suppressor and negative regulator of aerobic glycolysis in HCC. HSF2 expression indicated unfavorable prognosis of HCC patients and it could regulate aerobic glycolysis by suppression of FBP1 to support uncontrolled proliferation of HCC cells.
