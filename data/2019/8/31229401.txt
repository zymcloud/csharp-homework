Aim:Iron chelators are extensively used to reduce iron overload. Our purpose was to compare effects of deferasirox versus deferasirox and deferoxamine in patients with thalassemia major.Methods:This randomized and double blind trial was performed on 62 patients. Patients were assigned 1:1 to oral 30 mg/kg deferasirox daily or oral 30 mg/kg deferasirox daily plus SC 50 mg/kg deferoxamine for 5 days a week. Treatment continued for 12 months in both groups.Results:Fifty-five patients completed the 1 year of treatment. Mean age was 24.5 years with an excess of females. Combined therapy caused a significant increase in myocardial T2* from 23.1 ± 7.5 ms at baseline to 27.1 ± 7.0 ms at 12 months (P < 0.05). This difference was statistically significant between 2 groups at 12 months (P = 0.01). Combined therapy and monotherapy had no significant effect on liver T2*. At 12 months, serum ferritin levels were reduced in two groups; however, the difference was significant (737 ± 459 μg/ml vs 1085 ± 919 μg/ml, P < 0.01).Conclusion:Our study indicates that combined treatment with deferasirox and deferoxmaine is more effective than deferasirox for reduction of iron over load in patients with thalassemia major.
