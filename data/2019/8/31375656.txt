d_abstr_R Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a group of non-protein-coding RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides, are involved in multiple biological and pathological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and immune escape. Many studies have shown that lncRNAs participate in the complex network of cancer and play vital roles as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes in a variety of cancers. Moreover, recent research has shown that abnormal expression of lncRNAs in malignant tumor cells before and after radiotherapy may participate in the progression of cancers and affect the radiation sensitivity of malignant tumor cells mediated by specific signaling pathways or cell cycle regulation. In this review, we summarize the published studies on lncRNAs in radiotherapy regarding the biological function and mechanism of human cancers, including esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancers, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer.
