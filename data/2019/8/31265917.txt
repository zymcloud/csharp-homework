Background:Rapid growth and invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) largely depends on its vascularity and active angiogenic capacity. That feature was used to control the tumor in the past with some limitations. These deficiencies were addressed in our new procedure by hepatic artery ligation and extrahepatic collaterals division (HALED) of the liver lobe containing large HCC. This study tried to assess the feasibility, safety and the short term effects of HALED.Materials and methods:This is a prospective stage 2a development IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment and Long-term monitoring) case series. It included adult patients with large-sized HCC (diameter > 5 cm) subjected to HALED carried out in our center during five years' trial evaluating one-month postoperative outcomes. Patients will be reported prospectively in a sequential order with explanation of reasons for rejected cases and description of changes to technique or indication as the procedure evolved. This study registry number is NCT03129685 at the ClinicalTrials.gov.Results:The first HALED operation was carried out safely on 2013, followed by nineteen patients by 2018. Patients' mean age (±standard deviation) was 62·45 (±9·27), range 38-76 years. Eleven (55%) patients had tumors diameter > 10 cm 13 (65%) patients were advanced BCLC stage. Seven modifications were made on the technique and indications of the procedure towards stability. According to the modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, 13 patients (65%) attained complete response. Operative mortality was 5% (one patient) and major morbidity was 10% (two patients). Liver infarction and abscess formation were not noticed in this study.Conclusion:Our forerunner study showed that HALED for large HCC is safe and induces tumor necrosis. Further long-term studies are suggested before starting the 2b stage.
