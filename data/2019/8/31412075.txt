Dynamic assessment of preoperative exercise capacity may be a useful predictor of postoperative prognosis. We aimed to clarify whether perioperative exercise capacity was related to long-term survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with chronic liver injury undergoing hepatectomy. One hundred-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent pre- and postoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine their anaerobic threshold, defined as the point between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption per unit of time. Testing involved 35 items including blood biochemistry analysis, in-vivo component analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. We classified patients with anaerobic threshold â‰¥ 90% 6 months postoperatively compared with the preoperative level as the maintenance group (n = 78) and patients with anaerobic threshold
