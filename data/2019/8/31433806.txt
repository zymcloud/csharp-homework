Glycoprotein G (gG) is a conserved protein, and it has been described as a chemokine-binding protein in most members of the alphaherpesviruses. In case of the infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), an alphaherpesvirus that infects chickens, this protein is a virulence factor that plays an immunomodulatory role in the chicken immune response. Nevertheless, the gG production profile during ILTV infection has not yet been studied. In this study, we developed monoclonal antibodies in order to determine the gG production profile during ILTV infection in chicken hepatocellular carcinoma (LMH) cell cultures as well as embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs and SPF chickens using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Despite the fact that inoculated LMH cell cultures showed an increase in both gG production and viral genome copy number up to 96 h after inoculation, we observed that gG production started earlier than the increase in viral genome copy number in ILTV infected embryonated SPF chicken eggs. Likewise, a gG production peak and an increase of viral genome copy number was observed prior to the appearance of clinical signs in infected SPF chickens. According to the production profiles, gG was also produced quite early in eggs and chickens inoculated with ILTV. These findings contribute to the knowledge of the gG role during the ILTV infection as a virulence factor.
