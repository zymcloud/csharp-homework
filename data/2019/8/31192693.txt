Introduction: malnutrition is a frequent finding among cancer patients. Despite its prognostic significance, there are still few studies evaluating the nutritional status of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Objectives: to evaluate the nutritional status of patients with HCC by different methods. Methods: patients with HCC were evaluated in an outpatient clinic at the Hospital Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre. The methods used for the nutritional assessment were body mass index (BMI), tricipital skinfold (TSF), arm circumference (AC), arm muscle circumference (AMC), hand grip strength (HGS), adductor pollicis muscle (APM), patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) and phase angle (PA). Results: forty-three patients with HCC were evaluated; all of them were cirrhotic. The mean age was 64.0 ± 5.8 years and the prevalent gender was male (72.1%). APM, PA, PG-SGA and AMC were the most sensitive methods for the diagnosis of malnutrition. There was a negative correlation between TSF and Child-Pugh score (p = 0.004) and a positive correlation between APM and BCLC stage (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Group) (p = 0.006). Conclusions: there was high variation in the diagnosis of malnutrition among the methods studied. APM, AMC, PA and PG-SGA can be indicated as tools of choice in the nutritional assessment of the HCC patient because they were the most sensitive methods in the diagnosis of malnutrition. TSF and APM correlate with disease severity.
