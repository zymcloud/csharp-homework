Objective: To explore the diagnostic value of single or combined detection of serum tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Î±-fetoprotein (AFP)-L3 and abnormal clotting (PIVKA-II) in the primary hepatic carcinoma. Methods: Serum AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II of 56 cases with primary hepatic carcinoma, 46 cases with cirrhosis, 45 cases with other liver disease and 41 healthy persons (control group) were examined by chemiluminescence method, and the differences in the levels of AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II in each group were compared. Results: Serum level of AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II in patients with primary liver cancer was significantly higher than that of the cirrhosis, other liver disease and control groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the areas under the curve for the diagnosis of primary hepatic carcinoma by AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II were 0.887, 0.846 and 0.885, respectively. The combined use of the three tumor markers for the diagnosis of primary hepatic carcinoma increased the area under the curve to 0.899. Among the single detection, AFP had the highest sensitivity of 91.07% and PIVKA-II had the highest specificity at 88.63%. In the combined detection, AFP/PIVKA-II combination had the highest sensitivity of 94.64 %, while the AFP + AFP-L3 + PIVKA-II combination had the highest specificity at 98.48%. Conclusion: Combined detection of AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II could improve the diagnostic specificity and the sensitivity of primary hepatic carcinoma; thereby make up the deficiency of single detection and improve the early diagnosis rate.
