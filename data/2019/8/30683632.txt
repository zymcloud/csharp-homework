Introduction:HBV and/or HCV infection is the main cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the molecular mechanisms by which HBV promotes HCC are not clear. In 2011, the result of a GWAS revealed a common variant of DEPDC5 affected HCC susceptibility in patient with chronic HCV infection in Japan. This study investigated the correlation between DEPDC5 polymorphism and HBV-related HCC.Materials and methods:1289 samples of Han population were involved in northern China and peripheral blood samples were obtained, including 506 healthy controls, 217 Hepatitis B chronic (CHB) and 258 liver cirrhosis (LC), and 308 HBV-related HCC patients. SNPs in the DEPDC5 rs1012068 were detected by MALDI-TOF-MS.Results:After controlling for the influence of sex, smoking and drinking, this study showed a significant relationship between the polymorphism of DEPDC5 rs1012068 and HBV-related HCC. Healthy participants with CC genotype showed 2.008 (95% CI = 1.145, 3.520; P = 0.015) times more likely to develop HCC; CHB cases with CC genotype showed 2.241 (95% CI = 1.226, 4.461; P = 0.022) times more likely to develop HCC; LC cases with CC genotype showed 2.706 (95% CI = 1.371, 5.340; P = 0.004) times more likely to develop HCC; and individuals with AC genotype showed 1.615 (95% CI = 1.110, 2.352; P = 0.012) times more likely to develop HCC.Conclusions:There was a significant correlation between DEPDC5 rs1012068A/C and HBV-related HCC in the Han Chinese population. A to C mutation increased the risk of the developing of HBV-related HCC.
