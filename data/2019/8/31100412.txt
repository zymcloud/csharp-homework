ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate multidrug resistance and cancer stem cell properties in various model systems. Yet, their biological significance in cancers, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the function of ABCF1 in HCC and explored its potential as a therapeutic target. ABCF1 was highly expressed in fetal mouse livers but not in normal adult livers. ABCF1 expression was upregulated in HCCs. These results demonstrate that ABCF1 functions as a hepatic oncofetal protein. We further demonstrated elevated ABCF1 expression in HCC cells upon acquiring chemoresistance. Suppression of ABCF1 by siRNA sensitized both parental cells and chemoresistant cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Reversely, ABCF1 overexpression promoted chemoresistance and drug efflux. In addition, overexpression of ABCF1 enhanced migration, spheroid and colony formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction. RNA sequencing analysis revealed EMT inducers HIF1Î±/IL8 and Sox4 as potential mediators for the oncogenic effect of ABCF1 in HCC progression. Together, this study illustrates that ABCF1 is a novel potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.
