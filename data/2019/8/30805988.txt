Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played an important role in tumorigenesis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we first demonstrated that lncRNA DLX6 antisense RNA 1 (DLX6-AS1) was upregulated in cancer tissues and cells lines compared with normal adjacent and cell line. Knock-down DLX6-AS1 by transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that cells transfected with siRNA were arrested in G0/G1 phase. Then, we performed dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay to show that DLX6-AS1 could bind with miR-424-5p. And cotransfection inhibitor of miR-424-5p with siRNA of DLX6-AS1 could abolish the inhibitory effect of siRNA of DLX6-AS1 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, we further demonstrated that the oncogene WEE1 G2 checkpoint kinase (WEE1) was the target of miR-424-5p and expression levels of WEE1 were positive correlation with that of DLX6-AS1. Taken together, these results suggested that upregulated DLX6-AS1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC through increasing expression of WEE1 via targeting miR-424-5p.
