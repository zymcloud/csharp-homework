Purpose:To assess major and ancillary parameters that could be correlated with Microvascular Invasion (MIV) and with histologic grade of HCC.Materials and methods:In this retrospective study, we assessed 62 patients (14 women-48 men; mean age, 63 years; range 38-80 years) that underwent hepatic resection for HCC. All patients were subject to Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT); 40 to Magnetic Resonance (MR) study. The radiologist assessed major and ancillary features according to LIRADS (v. 2018) and reported any radiological accessory findings if detected.Results:No major feature showed statistically significant differences and correlation with grading. Mean ADC value was correlated with grading and with MIV status. No major feature was correlated to MIV; progressive contrast enhancement and satellite nodules showed statistically different percentages with respect to the presence of MIV, so as at the monovariate correlation analysis, satellite nodules were correlated with the presence of MIV. At multivariate regression analysis, no factor proved to be strong predictors of grading while progressive contrast enhancement and satellite nodules were significantly associated with the MIV.Conclusion:Mean ADC value is correlated to HCC grading and MIV status. Progressive contrast enhancement and the presence of satellite nodules are correlated to MIV status.
