Human liver cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas and intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas, are often diagnosed late with poor prognosis. A better understanding of cancer initiation could provide potential preventive therapies and increase survival. Models for studying human liver cancer initiation are largely missing. Here, using directly reprogrammed human hepatocytes (hiHeps) and inactivation of p53 and RB, we established organoids possessing liver architecture and function. HiHep organoids were genetically engineered to model the initial alterations in human liver cancers. Bona fide hepatocellular carcinomas were developed by overexpressing c-Myc. Excessive mitochondrion-endoplasmic reticulum coupling induced by c-Myc facilitated hepatocellular carcinoma initiation and seemed to be a target of preventive treatment. Furthermore, through the analysis of human intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma-enriched mutations, we demonstrate that the RAS-induced lineage conversion from hepatocytes to intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells can be prevented by the combined inhibition of Notch and JAK-STAT. Together, hiHep organoids represent a system that can be genetically manipulated to model cancer initiation and identify potential preventive therapies.
