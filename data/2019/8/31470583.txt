Penicillum citreonigrum XT20-134 (MCCC 3A00956) is a fungus with cytotoxic activity, derived from deep-sea sediment. Five new compounds, adeninylpyrenocine (1), 2-hydroxyl-3-pyrenocine-thio propanoic acid (2), ozazino-cyclo-(2,3-dihydroxyl-trp-tyr) (3), 5,5-dichloro-1-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1,4-dihydroxypentan-2-one (4), and 2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl cinnamate (5), together with 19 known compounds (6-24), were isolated from an ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of its fermentation. The structures of the new compounds were comprehensively characterized by high-resolution electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). All isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities. The heteroatom-containing new compounds 2 and 4 showed potent cytotoxicity to the human hepatoma tumor cell Bel7402 with IC50 values of 7.63 ± 1.46, 13.14 ± 1.41 μM and the human fibrosarcoma tumor cell HT1080 with IC50 values of 10.22 ± 1.32, 16.53 ± 1.67 μM, respectively.
