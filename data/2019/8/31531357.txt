Objective:The blood of cancer patients is in a state of hypercoagulability, easily leading to thrombosis. Anemia is also a complication of tumors. Anemia and thrombosis affect the treatment of tumor patients.Methods:Ginsenosides Rb were extracted from the stems and leaves of American ginseng using water-saturated ethanol and ethyl acetate in silica gel column. Tumor mice model was established by injecting H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cells into the axilla of mice. Mice were randomly divided into 6 groups: normal control group, model control group, positive control group, low dose group (7 mg/kg), middle dose group (14 mg/kg), and high dose group (35 mg/kg). After 18 days, the blood was obtained by picking the eyeball of mice. The levels of red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), neutrophils/lymphocytes radio (NLR), platelets (PLT), platelet distribution width (PDW), fibrinogen (FIB), and D-Dimer (D-D) were measured and compared in each group of mice.Results:The content of obtained ginsenosides Rb reached 90.05%. This extraction process was simple and reliable. Middle dose of ginsenosides Rb could significantly increase RBC and HGB levels (PConclusion:ginsenosides Rb could significantly improve anaemia and hypercoagulation of blood in cancer mice. Ginsenosides Rb are a potential anticoagulant and antianemia drug in treating cancer.
