Background and aim:To better predict patient survival, we used automated tumor volume and density measurements to make an objective radiological assessment of the response of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to treatment with sorafenib.Methods:Patients treated with sorafenib were identified retrospectively. Those who were diagnosed with Child-Pugh class A liver function, Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer stage C, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status grade 0/1 were enrolled (n = 22). Reviews of contrast-enhanced computed tomography images were supported by the automated measurement of lesions using computer software. Treatment responses were assessed using volume and density criteria. Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate treatment responses and identify the most significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS).Results:After patients were dichotomized according to volume and density criteria, the median OS for those with an objective response (OR) (complete response + partial response) was 20.4 months and that for those with a non-OR (stable disease + progressive disease) was 9.3 months (P = 0.009). The best multivariate regression model for survival identified volume and density criteria (OR or non-OR) as a significant variable, along with baseline alpha-fetoprotein levels (log-rank test, P = 0.01). No other conventional criteria were identified as significant.Conclusions:Tumor volume and density assessment using automated lesion measurements may be an objective method of evaluating responses of advanced HCC to treatment with sorafenib.
