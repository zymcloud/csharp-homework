Purpose:Late gadolinium hyperintensity (LGH) is sometimes seen in colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) and represents a significant diagnostic pitfall due to overlap with LGH in benign hemangiomas; therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of LGH and the ability of LGH to differentiate between CRLM and benign lesions with intravascular (gadofosveset) vs extracellular contrast agents (gadobutrol).Methods:Patients with known colorectal cancer and suspected liver lesions were prospectively recruited into this institutional review board-approved, single institution study and received magnetic resonance imaging of the liver with gadofosveset and gadobutrol. The prevalence of LGH for CRLMs and solid benign lesions was determined. Receiver operating characteristics curves were determined for the presence of LGH as a predictor of benignity. The utility of LGH to differentiate between CRLM and solid benign lesions using gadofosveset vs gadobutrol was compared using the generalized estimating equation.Results:Twenty-five patients with 131 solid focal liver lesions were recruited. The prevalence of LGH of CRLMs was 11.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5%-21.8%) with gadofosveset vs 63.7% (95% CI: 45.7%-81.7%) with gadobutrol. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the presence of LGH as a predictor of benignity was 0.86 using gadofosveset vs 0.75 using gadobutrol. Both LGH (P = .003) and the interaction of contrast agent and LGH (P = .003) statistically significantly differentiated CRLM from benign lesions.Conclusion:LGH is more common with extracellular than with intravascular contrast agents and is statistically significantly associated with benign lesions rather than metastases.
