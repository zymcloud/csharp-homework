Although adherence to healthy dietary guidelines has been associated with a reduced risk of several health outcomes, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers, little is known about the role of dietary patterns in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We prospectively assessed the associations of three key commonly used a priori dietary patterns-the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-with risk of incident HCC in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) and the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), two large prospective cohort studies. Diet was assessed almost every 4 years using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. During up to 32 years of follow-up, 160 incident HCC cases were identified. After adjustment for most HCC risk factors, participants in the highest tertile of Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010) had a multivariable HR of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.39-0.95; Ptrend = 0.03), compared with those in the lowest tertile. There was a suggestive, but nonsignificant, inverse association for Alternate Mediterranean Diet (AMED; HR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.49-1.15; Ptrend = 0.18) and a null association for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH; HR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.59-1.36; Ptrend = 0.61) in relation to the risk of HCC development. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that better adherence to the AHEI-2010 may decrease the risk of developing HCC among U.S. adults. Future studies are needed to replicate our results, examine these associations in other populations, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
