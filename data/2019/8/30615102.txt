Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We conducted a nested case-control study of 347 HCC cases and 691 matched controls within a prospective cohort of 18 244 Chinese men in Shanghai, China. The concentrations of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2α (8-epi-PGF2α), a biomarker of oxidative stress, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) metabolite (PGE-M), a biomarker of the inflammation mediator PGE2, were determined in baseline urine samples using validated mass spectrometry assays. 8-epi-PGF2α levels were significantly higher in HCC cases than control subjects (geometric means 0.92 versus 0.80 pmol/mg creatinine, P
