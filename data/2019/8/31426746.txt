Background:Prior hepatitis B virus infection (PBI) may increase the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the impact of PBI on clinical outcomes following treatment for HCC remains unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify whether PBI affects clinical outcomes after liver resection for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC by retrospective cohort study.Methods:PBI patients were defined as those negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and positive for anti-hepatitis B core antibody. Surgical outcomes of HCV-related HCC patients with PBI were compared to those without PBI. Survival of patients with non-B non-C HCC with and without PBI were also compared.Results:In the HCV group, the median overall survival of 165 patients with PBI was 4.7 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-5.9), and was significantly shorter compared with 263 patients without PBI (6.6 years [5.3-9.8]; p = 0.015). Conversely, there was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the two groups (1.8 years [95% CI, 1.4-2.0] vs 2.0 years [1.7-2.3]; p = 0.205). On Cox proportional hazards regression model, independent factors for overall survival were PBI (hazard ratio 1.38 [95% CI, 1.02-1.87]; p = 0.033), multiple tumors (p = 0.007), tumor size (p = 0.002), and liver cirrhosis (p Conclusions:PBI and HCV in conjunction with each other affect the survival of patients that have undergone resection for HCC.
