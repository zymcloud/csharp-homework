Objectives:Small cell transformation is a well-recognized mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, yet it remains a poorly-described phenomenon in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.Material and methods:Chart and literature review.Results:We report a case of a patient with ALK-rearranged lung cancer progressing on three-lines of ALK-targeted therapies, with development of acquired resistance to lorlatinib, with both transformation to a neuroendocrine carcinoma, and acquisition of ALK 1196 M.Conclusions:Given the inevitable development of resistance in ALK + NSCLC, if feasible, re-biopsy on progression should be standard over liquid biopsy. Neuroendocrine carcinoma transformation remains an important mechanism of acquired resistance to lorlatinib.
