We present a female patient, 13 years old, with diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma of fibrolamellar type, which was rapidly evolving. The fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma invaded more than 80% of the hepatic parenchyma without surgical possibility or liver transplantation. Measures applied corresponded to chemotherapy of 1 cycle of cisplatin 40 mg/s/5 days + vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/day, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and dexrazoxane. The case presented aggressive evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma, which led to acute liver failure, with hyperammonemia, sepsis, pulmonary focus plus septic shock, grade III-IV encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and ascites with intra-abdominal hypertension. Death occurred due to multiple organ failure, which involved respiratory failure type KDIGO 1 and 2, acute liver failure, severe pneumonia, pericardial effusion, AKIN 2 acute kidney injury, carcinoma, and pulmonary metastasis. This type of ailment is infrequent in children and adolescents, and the first symptoms are crucial to achieve treatment possibilities.
