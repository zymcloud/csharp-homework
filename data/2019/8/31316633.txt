MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are widely expressed in human cells and closely associated with various types of cancer, including breast cancer. miR-876-5p has been indicated to participate in the tumorigenesis of certain types of cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Nevertheless, the roles of miR-876-5p in breast cancer remain unclear. In the present study, it was revealed that miR-876-5p expression levels were decreased in breast cancer cells compared with a normal cell line. miR-876-5p ectopic expression suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation and arrested progression of the cell cycle. In addition, miR-876-5p suppressed breast cancer cell migration and invasion. miR-876-5p was demonstrated to directly target transcription factor AP-2-α (TFAP2A) in breast cancer cells, and restoration of TFAP2A rescinded the suppressive role of miR-876-5p. In summary, the results from the present study provide evidence that miR-876-5p suppresses breast cancer progression by regulating cell proliferation, migration and invasion in a TFAP2A-dependent manner.
