Liver cancer is one of the most frequently occurring types of cancer with high mortality rate. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently metastasizes to lung, portal vein, and portal lymph nodes and most HCCs show strong resistance to conventional anticancer drugs. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be responsible for resistance to therapies. Hence, recent advancements in the use of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are rapidly gaining recognition as an efficient and organized means for developing antitumor agents. We aimed to use a non-target-based high-throughput screening (HTS) approach to specifically target Î±-fetoprotein (AFP)+/cluster of differentiation (CD)133+ HCC present in mixed populations of HCC cells and hepatocytes. Herein, we identified actinomycin D (ActD) as a potential antitumor agent that significantly inhibits activity of LCSCs without affecting the co-cultured hepatocytes. To determine the mechanism of ActD-induced tumor-specificity in LCSC, we applied various cell-based assay models in vitro. In fact, ActD significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and DNA damage in Huh7 HCC cells, but not in Fa2N-4 cells, immortalized hepatocytes. Treatment of spheroid-forming LCSCs with ActD effectively decreased spheroid formation and the CD133+ HCC cell population. Importantly, these ActD-mediated effects are a result of inhibition of cystine/glutamate transporter xCT expression, via attenuation of CD133 synthesis. These results indicate that ActD suppresses stemness and malignant properties in HCC cells through destabilization of xCT, by inhibition of CD133 expression in LCSCs. The effects of ActD on LCSCs provide novel therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem-like cells in liver cancer.
