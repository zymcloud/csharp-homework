The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) implemented a policy that requires patients with hepatocellular carcinoma seeking liver transplantation to wait six months before being granted Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exception points. We investigated the difference in resource utilization between patients who underwent liver transplantation before and after the present policy. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult liver transplants from 2013 to 2018. Patients were classified into prepolicy or postpolicy groups based on 964 days before or after the wait-time policy. We also retrieved national survival outcome data from United Network for Organ Sharing. Differences across compared groups for continuous variables were assessed using the independent sample t test, and the chi-squared test was used for binary variables. We found statistical differences in recipient age (P = 0.005), days on wait-list (P = 0.001), sustained virological response (P < 0.001), and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence one year posttransplant (P = 0.04). There were statistically significant differences in the number of treatment days pretransplant and length of transplant admission stay, indicating an increase in resource utilization in the postpolicy group. No statistically significant differences were found between groups in one-year graft or patient survival despite an observed increase in resource utilization by the hepatocellular carcinoma postpolicy group.
