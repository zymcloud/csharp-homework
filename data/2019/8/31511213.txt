Objective:To construct a decellularized matrix of human fatty liver as the scaffold for three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocarcinoma cells.Methods:Human fatty liver decellularized matrix (hFLM) was prepared by repeated freezingthawing, perfusion with gradient SDS and 1% Triton X-100 through the portal vein and hepatic artery, and repeated agitation with Triton X-100. HepG2 cells were cultured in the prepared hFLM, and the cell survival, morphology, proliferation and cellular expressions of the adhesion molecules were detected.Results:The decellularization procedure shortened the time for scaffold preparation and preserved the 3D ultrastructure and the composition of the extracellular matrix. HepG2 cells cultured in hFLM scaffold maintained proliferation for up to 15 days and showed a growth pattern with a long lag phase and a slow growth rate, which was similar to the growth pattern in vivo. The cultured HepG2 exhibited a low expression of E-cadherin and a high expression of vimentin, which was consistent with the xenograft but opposite to 2D cultured cells. However, the lack of adequate nutrient transport in this hepatocarcinoma cell model led to a slowdown of cell proliferation in the later stage. The PCNA index of HepG2 cells cultured in hFLM was lowered by 29.3% on day 12 as compared with that on day 6.Conclusions:We established a new protocol for preparing hFLM and confirmed the feasibility of constructing hepatocarcinoma cell models using the hFLM scaffold.
