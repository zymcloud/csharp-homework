Background/aim:The aim of this study was to determine the clinical impact of low tie ligation (LT) of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) below the left colic artery versus high tie ligation (HT) at the origin of the IMA in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery.Patients and methods:Between January 2005 and December 2017, all consecutive patients who underwent rectal resection for non-metastatic cancer were retrospectively included. Patients who had LT were compared to those who had HT.Results:Overall, 200 patients were identified (101 HT and 99 LT). Postoperative 30-day mortality rate was nil in both groups. There were significantly higher severe postoperative complications in HT versus LT patients (Clavien-Dindo III-IV) (18.8% vs. 9.1%, p=0.048). Median follow-up was 38.5 months and overall survival at 5 years was 91.5% and there was no difference between the two groups (90.1% vs. 92.9%; HT vs. LT p=0.640).Conclusion:LT ligation of IMA significantly decreased the severe postoperative complication rate without affecting recurrence-free or overall survival.
