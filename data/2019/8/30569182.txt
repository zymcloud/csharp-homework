Objective:To develop a contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) M-score and compare it with LR-M in CEUS Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS).Methods:We retrospectively enrolled 105 consecutive high-risk patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 105 with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The subjects were selected by propensity score matching between November 2003 and December 2017. A CEUS M-score for predicting ICC was constructed based on specific CEUS features by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularised regression. M-score was used to develop a modified CEUS LI-RADS. The diagnostic performance of the modified CEUS LI-RADS using M-score for diagnosing HCC and ICC was compared with American College of Radiology (ACR) CEUS LI-RADS using LR-M.Results:The most useful features for ICC were as follows: poorly circumscribed (69.52%), rim enhancement (63.81%), early washout (92.38%), intratumoural vein (56.19%), obscure boundary of intratumoural non-enhanced area (57.14%), and marked washout (59.05%, all p Conclusions:The modified LI-RADS with M-score had higher sensitivity for diagnosing HCC and higher specificity for diagnosing ICC than ACR LI-RADS.Key points:• For predicting ICC, the M-score had a higher specificity (88.57% vs. 63.81%) with lower sensitivity (89.52% vs. 95.24%) compared with LR-M. • A CEUS M-score for predicting ICC consisted of more detailed CEUS features (poorly circumscribed, rim enhancement, early washout, intratumoural vein, obscure boundary of intratumoural non-enhanced area, and marked washout) was constructed. • For diagnosing HCC, the sensitivity of modified LI-RADS (80.95%) was much higher than that of ACR LI-RADS (57.14%), but the specificity was lower (90.48% vs. 96.19%). The modified positive predictive value (PPV) of ACR LI-RADS and modified LI-RADS were 99.42% and 98.99%, respectively.
