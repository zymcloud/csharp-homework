Aim: To explore clinical factors associated with extent of liver regeneration after hemihepatectomy to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods: Future liver remnant volume (as a percentage of functional liver volume, %FLRV) and remnant liver volume were measured preoperatively and at 1, 5, 9, and 13 weeks postoperatively.Results: After hepatectomy, 1 of 125 patients (0.8%) died within 3 months, 13 (10.4%) experienced liver failure, and 99 (79.2%) experienced complications. %FLRV was able to predict liver failure with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.900, and a cut-off value of 42.7% showed sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 88.6%. Postoperative median growth ratio was 21.3% at 1 week, 30.9% at 5 weeks, 34.6% at 9 weeks, and 37.1% at 13 weeks. Multivariate analysis identified three predictors associated with liver regeneration: FLRV < 601 cm3, %FLRV, and liver cirrhosis. At postoperative weeks (POWs) 1 and 5, liver function indicators were significantly better among patients showing high extent of regeneration than among those showing low extent, but these differences disappeared by POW 9.Conclusions: FLRV, %FLRV, and liver cirrhosis strongly influence extent of liver regeneration after hepatectomy. %FLRV values below 42.7% are associated with greater risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure.
