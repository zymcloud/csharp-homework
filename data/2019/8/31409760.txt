Combination treatment is a promising strategy to improve prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib is a traditional first-line agent approved for the treatment of advanced HCC, though with limited efficacy. Previously, we reported that lonafarnib, an orally bioavailable non-peptide inhibitor targeting farnesyltransferase, synergizes with sorafenib against the growth of HCC cells. In the present study, we aim to clarify the underlying mechanism of this combination strategy. Initially, using in vitro HCC cell model, we confirmed that synergistic treatment of lonafarnib and sorafenib suppressed cell viability and colony formation, and induced cell death. We then found conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II via combination the treatment and observed formation of autophagosomes by electron microscopy. Knockdown of ATG3 inhibited the autophagic flux induced by the combination treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrated that drug-eliciting autophagy selectively promoted the degradation of cyclin D1 in a lysosome-dependent manner and subsequently inhibited DNA synthesis through downregulating the phosphorylation of Rb protein. In conclusion, our results provide a deeper insight into the mechanism for the combination treatment of lonafarnib and sorafenib in HCC therapy.
