Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third deadliest cancer worldwide. Sorafenib is considered a supplementary treatment to surgical or locoregional therapies for improving outcomes. We evaluated the efficacy of sorafenib as a supplementary therapy for HCC.Methods:We conducted a meta-analysis including 11 randomized controlled trials. Patients with HCC and studies in which sorafenib was administered alone and compared with placebo or those in which sorafenib was administered in combination with another treatment and compared with that treatment alone were included. The overall effects (OEs) on overall survival and time to progression were pooled as hazard ratios.Results:The OEs of sorafenib as a first-line therapy versus placebo for unresectable HCC were 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-0.77] and 0.58 (95% CI: 0.47-0.70), respectively. The OEs of sorafenib as a second-line therapy versus placebo for progressive HCC were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.47-1.13) and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.30-0.97), respectively. The OEs of sorafenib as an adjuvant therapy versus placebo for early HCC were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.76-1.30) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.74-1.08), respectively. The OEs of sorafenib combined with transarterial chemoemboliztion (TACE) versus placebo combined with TACE were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.54-1.21) and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.70-1.04), respectively. The OEs of sorafenib as an adjuvant to TACE versus placebo as an adjuvant to TACE for intermediate HCC were 1.06 (95% CI: 0.69-1.64) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.31-1.36), respectively.Conclusions:Sorafenib was effective as a first-line therapy for unresectable HCC, but it was ineffective as a second-line or adjuvant therapy. Sorafenib did not increase the efficacy of TACE.
