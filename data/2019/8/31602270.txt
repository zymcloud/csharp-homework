Background: Hepatitis B virus infection had been identified its relationship with liver diseases, including liver tumors. We aimed to explore diagnostic and prognostic values between the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: We used the GSE14520 dataset to explore diagnostic and prognostic significance between HLA complex and HCC. A nomogram was constructed to predict survival probability of HCC prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis was explored using gene ontologies and metabolic pathways. Validation of prognostic values of the HLA complex was performed in the Kaplan-Meier Plotter website. Results: We found that HLA-C showed the diagnostic value (P <0.0001, area under curve: 0.784, sensitivity: 93.14%, specificity: 62.26%). In addition, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-F showed prognostic values for overall survival, and HLA-A, HLA-C, HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DQA1 showed prognostic values for recurrence-free survival (all P ≤ 0.05, elevated 0.927, 0.992, 1.023, 0.918, 0.937 multiples compared to non-tumor tissues, respectively). Gene set enrichment analysis found that they were involved in antigen processing and toll like receptor signalling pathway, etc. The nomogram was evaluated for survival probability of HCC prognosis. Validation analysis indicated that HLA-C, HLA-DPA1, HLA-E, HLA-F and HLA-G were associated with HCC prognosis of overall survival (all P ≤ 0.05, elevated 0.988 and 0.997 multiples compared to non-tumor tissues, respectively). Conclusion: HLA-C might be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HCC. HLA-DPA1 and HLA-F might be prognostic biomarkers for HCC.
