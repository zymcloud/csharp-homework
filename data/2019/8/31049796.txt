Highly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) is a cancer-associated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which may regulate expression of other genes by working as a competing RNA for microRNAs. In the current study, we assessed transcript levels of this lncRNA in peripheral blood of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and healthy persons to evaluate its possible role in the pathogenesis of this inflammatory disease and its diagnostic power. The results of Multilevel Bayesian showed no significant difference between cases and controls (P = 0.002, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [3.08, 13.3]). However, based on the results of Quantile regression, there was a significant difference in HULC expression between cases and controls after controlling the effects of sex and age (P = 0.002, 95% CI = [3.08, 13.3]) which shows different trends in males and females. HULC expression was inversely correlated with age of male subjects but not female subjects. HULC transcript levels had 91.1% accuracy in diagnosis of MS disease (Specificity: 80%, Sensitivity: 86.6%). The diagnostic power of HULC was higher in male subjects aged less than 50 years (AUC = 0.923, Specificity: 80%, Sensitivity: 100%). The present study shows the possibility of application of transcript levels of HULC as diagnostic marker in MS disease. However, future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to validate our results.
