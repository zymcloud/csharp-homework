Aberrant long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) have been proved to be associated with the many types of malignant tumors (including hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]). In this study, a lncRNAs and mRNAs microarray analysis was performed in three pairs of HCC patitents' tumor. We found lncRNA LIM and SH3 protein 1 antisense (LASP1-AS) and its sense-cognate gene LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) were upregulated in HCC and both are correlated with poorer prognosis and lower survival of HCC patients. Meanwhile, the expression of LASP1-AS correlated positively with LASP1 expression in HCC tissues. LASP1-AS promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of HCC in vitro and vivo by enhancing LASP1 expression. Our study explored lncRNA LASP1-AS as an oncogene in HCC and promoted proliferation and metastasis capabilities of HCC via increasing the expression of its sense-cognate gene LASP1. LncRNA LASP1-AS might be a potential valuable prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target of HCC.
