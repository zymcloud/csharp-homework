Background:This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment after transarterial chemoembolization(TACE) with best supportive care (BSC) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with PVTT.Methods:This retrospective study was conducted on 1,040 patients with HCC with PVTT who were treated either with TACE (n = 675) or BSC (n = 365). BSC did not include sorafenib. The two groups of patients were compared with or without propensity score matching. A subgroup analysis was subsequently performed by stratifying patients according to the stages of PVTT in the Cheng's PVTT classification.Results:In PVTTtypes I-III, TACE was associated with significantly better overall survival (OS) thanBSC (P Conclusion:TACE was associated with better OS than BSC in HCC patients with PVTT types I-III but not type IV. Patients with type IV PVTT showed the worst prognosis, regardless of whether TACE or BSC was used.
Best supportive care; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Portal vein tumor thrombus; Transarterial chemoembolization.
