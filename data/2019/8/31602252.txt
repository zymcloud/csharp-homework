Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are recently discovered as a special novel type of endogenous noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which form a covalently closed continuous loop and are highly represented in the eukaryotic transcriptome. Recent research revealed that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing and transcription, as well as interact with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). In this review, not only the function and mechanism, but also the experimental methods of circRNA are summarized. The summary of the current state of circRNA will help us in the discovery of novel biomarkers, the therapeutic targets and their potential significance in diagnosis and treatment of diseases. CircRNAs might play important roles in cancers especially in hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and colorectal cancer as well as serving as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some diseases and providing new treatments of diseases.
