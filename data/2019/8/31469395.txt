Importance:There are well-documented racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in access to health care among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, there are little data on the association of insurance type with liver transplant (LT) wait-list outcomes for patients with HCC.Objective:To examine LT wait-list outcomes for patients with HCC and public insurance compared with patients with private insurance.Design, setting, and participants:This single-center cohort study included 705 adult patients with HCC who had Model for End-Stage Liver Disease exceptions and were included on a waiting list for LT from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016. Patients with Kaiser Permanente medical insurance, other private medical insurance, or public medical insurance were included. Data analysis was conducted from May 2018 to October 2018.Main outcomes and measures:The main outcome was cumulative incidence of LT waiting list dropout within 2 years of waiting list enrollment (baseline). Secondary outcomes included competing-risks analysis to identify risk factors associated with wait-list outcomes.Results:Among 705 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 61 [57-65] years; 537 [76.2%] men) with HCC on an LT waiting list, 349 patients (49.5%) had Kaiser Permanente insurance, 157 patients (22.3%) had other private insurance, and 199 patients (28.2%) had public insurance. Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 13.2 (7.8-18.7) months. Tumor characteristics were similar among insurance types. The cumulative incidence of dropout owing to tumor progression or death within 2 years of baseline was 21.8% (95% CI, 17.2%-26.7%) among the Kaiser Permanente insurance group, 25.5% (95% CI, 18.6%-33.0%) among the other private insurance group, and 35.5% (95% CI, 28.3%-42.7%) among the public insurance group (P Conclusions and relevance:In this large cohort of patients with HCC on an LT waiting list, patients with public insurance were associated with worse wait-list outcomes compared with patients with Kaiser Permanente insurance or other private insurance, despite similar tumor-related characteristics at baseline. Improved health care coordination and delivery may be options to reduce these disparities.
