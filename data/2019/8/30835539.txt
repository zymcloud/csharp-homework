In the present study, five new ent-kaurane diterpenes including 4α-hydroxy-17,19-dinor-ent-kaurane-16-one (1), 4β-hydroxy-16β-H-18-nor-ent-kaurane-17-oic acid (2), 4β,17-dihydroxy-16α-acetoxy-18-nor-ent-kaurane (3), Annosquamosin Z (4) and 16α-H-ent-kaurane-17,18-dioic acid, 17-methy ester (5) were isolated from Annona squamosa L. pericarp. The compounds were also evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cell lines, among which compound 3 exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC50 value of less than 20 μM.
Annona squamosa Linn; HepG2 cell; SMMC-7721 cell; diterpene; hepatoma.
