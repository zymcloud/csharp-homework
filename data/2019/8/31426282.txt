Though Pyrogallol, one of the natural polyphenols, was known to have anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects in breast and colon cancers, the underlying antitumor mechanisms of Pyrogallol, still remain unclear so far. Here, the antitumor mechanisms of Pyrogallol were elucidated in Hep3B and Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs). Pyrogallol showed significant cytotoxicity and reduced the number of colonies in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Interestingly, Pyrogallol induced S-phase arrest and attenuated the protein expression of CyclinD1, Cyclin E, Cyclin A, c-Myc, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), p-AKT, PI3K, increased the protein expression of p27, and also reduced the fluorescent expression of Cyclin E in Hep3B and Huh7 cells. Furthermore, Pyrogallol disturbed the interaction between Skp2, p27, and c-Myc in Huh7 cells. Notably, Pyrogallol upregulated miRNA levels of miR-134, and conversely, miR-134 inhibition rescued the decreased expression levels of c-Myc, Cyclin E, and Cyclin D1 and increased the expression of p27 by Pyrogallol in Huh7 cells. Taken together, our findings provide insight that Pyrogallol exerts antitumor effects in HCCs via miR-134 activation-mediated S-phase arrest and inhibition of PI3K/AKT/Skp2/cMyc signaling as a potent anticancer candidate.
