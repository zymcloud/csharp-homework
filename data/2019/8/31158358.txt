Background:Hepatitis C viral infection (HCV) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are potential health problems. New directly acting antivirals (DAAs) changed HCV treatment strategies. Selenoprotein P1 (SEPP1) is a hepatokine implicated in HCC pathogenesis. High mobility group box1 (HMGB1), a nuclear DNA-binding protein, involved in immune and inflammatory responses in HCV and HCC. Therefore, the aim of current study was to investigate HMGB1 and SEPP1 levels in HCV and HCV + HCC patients and exploring DAAs effect on them.Methods:15 healthy volunteers, 25 HCV and 25 HCV + HCC patients were included. Liver function tests, alpha fetoprotein (AFP), SEPP1 and HMGB1 serum levels were evaluated. For HCV group blood samples before and after treatment with sofosbuvir/daclatasvir combination were collected.Results:HMGB1 was significantly higher in HCV + HCC group than in control and HCV groups (p Conclusion:HMGB1 and SEPP1 are involved in pathogenesis of HCV and HCV induced HCC. Both of them could serve as predictive biomarkers for HCC in HCV patients.
