Osteosarcoma is the most common bone malignancy and miR-95-3p plays an important role in multiple cancers. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect and potential mechanism of miR-95-3p on the growth of osteosarcoma. In vitro, the osteosarcoma cell lines, SAOS-2 and U2OS cells, were transfected with miR-95-agomir to assess the role of miR-95-3p in proliferation and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. We determined that overexpression of miR-95-3p significantly attenuated cell proliferation but enhanced apoptosis in SAOS-2 and U2OS cells. We also found that overexpression of miR-95-3p in osteosarcoma cells downregulated the expression of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). Next, knockdown of HDGF by siRNA targeting HDGF clearly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in U2OS cells. In vivo, a tumor formation assay in BALB/c nude mice was conducted by injecting the pre-miR-95 or control vector lentivirus-infected U2OS cells to determine the effect of miR-95-3p on the growth of osteosarcoma. Results showed miR-95-3p overexpression inhibited the osteosarcoma growth and downregulated the HDGF expression in xenografted tumor. For mechanism study, we co-transfected HDGF/pcDNA3.1 plasmid and miR-95-agomir to U2OS cells, and we demonstrated that overexpression of HDGF could attenuate the effects of miR-95-3p on U2OS cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration. These findings indicated that miR-95-3p might act as a potential tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma by targeting HDGF. Thus, miR-95-3p may become a potential therapeutic in treatment of osteosarcoma.
