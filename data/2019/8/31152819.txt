Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, represents a health problem in hepatic viruses-eradicating era because obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are considered emerging pathogenic factors. Metabolic disorders underpin mitotic errors that lead to numerical and structural chromosome aberrations in a significant proportion of cell divisions. Here, we review that genomically unstable HCCs show evidence for a paradoxically DNA damage response (DDR) which leads to ongoing chromosome segregation errors. The understanding of DDR induced by defective mitoses is crucial to our ability to develop or improve liver cancer therapeutic strategies.
