Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide and recurrence rate after curative resection remains high. To improve HCC prognosis, novel sensitive biomarkers and targeted molecular therapies are needed. Accumulation of multiple genetic aberrations caused by pathologically derived liver damage results in HCC carcinogenesis. Elucidating the genes associated with tumorigenesis and progression of HCC may lead to the development of early detection and prognosis markers and to the identification of therapeutic targets. Areas covered: We review recently reported (January 2017-March 2019) HCC-associated molecules, including protein-coding genes, microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and methylated gene promoters. Expert opinion: The molecules reviewed have the potential to be clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC. The accumulation and understanding of genetic and epigenetic data are essential to improve the management of HCC patients.
