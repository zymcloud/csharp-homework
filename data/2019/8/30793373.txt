It is unclear whether liver transplantation confers an increase in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) across all dimensions of health. This study aimed to estimate the effect of liver transplantation on HR-QoL. Pre- and post-transplantation patients attending an outpatient clinic were invited to complete the condition-specific 'Short form of liver disease QOL' questionnaire. Mixed-effect linear regression and propensity-score matching (PSM) on pretransplantation characteristics were used to estimate the difference in overall HR-QoL associated with transplantation. Of 454/609 (74.5%) eligible patients who were included in the analysis, 102 (22.5%) patients fall under pretransplantation category, and 352 (77.5%) were under post-transplantation category. Overall HR-QoL post-transplantation significantly increased in patients without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Î² = 16.84, 95% CI: 13.33 to 20.35, P
