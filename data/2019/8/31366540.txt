Background/aim:To evaluate the impact of DEPDC1 expression on patient prognosis after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:We reviewed data from 75 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC between 2004 and 2013. Recurrence at 2 years following resection, which mainly included metastatic recurrence, was defined as late recurrence.Results:DEPDC1 was up-regulated in HCC tissue and in non-tumor tissue of patients with HCC compared to normal liver (pConclusion:High expression of DEPDC1 in tumor tissue appears to be associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.
