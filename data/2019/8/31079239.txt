In this study, the carotenoid astaxanthin was obtained by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) from shrimp by-products (SBP). Its bioactive properties were evaluated in vitro in human normal and cancerous cells lines. The antioxidant activity of the extracted astaxanthin of the SFE fraction (ASTA) was tested in fibroblast cells (HS-68), by inducing oxidative stress and by evaluating the protective effect of the pre-treatment with different levels of ASTA against toxicity. The anti-proliferative activity was evaluated in hepatoma cells (HEP-G2), treated with increased concentrations of ASTA and measuring the effects on vitality and on some biomolecular markers related to oxidative stress, cell cycle, and apoptosis. It was found that pre-treating normal fibroblast cells with ASTA resulted in a marked increase in cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (P
