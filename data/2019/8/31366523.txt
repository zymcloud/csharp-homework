Background/aim:This study aimed to obtain accurate differential diagnosis (DDx) of multicentric carcinogenesis (MC) and intrahepatic metastasis (IM) in recurrent lesions of hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:A total of 79 patients who underwent re-hepatectomy (2000-2013) were examined. PCR was used to analyze 13 chromosomal microsatellite loci by PCR. On the basis of this genetic analysis, the recurrent lesions were diagnosed as IM, MC or not determined (ND). Subsequently, DDx was compared with types of resection and outcome.Results:The recurrent lesions were diagnosed as IM in 33 patients, MC in 44, and ND in 2. The anatomical resection group included 14 IM lesions (28%) and 36 MC lesions (72%), while the non-anatomical resection group included 19 IM lesions (70%) and 8 MC lesions (30%) (pConclusion:Anatomical resection at initial hepatectomy may reduce the likelihood of IM recurrence, leading to a better outcome for patients with HCC.
