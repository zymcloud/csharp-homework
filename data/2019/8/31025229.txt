Background:The frequency and predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within each liver imaging reporting and data system (LI-RADS) category remains unclear. We sought to estimate the cumulative frequency of HCC in LI-RADS observations of high/intermediate category and identify clinical/radiographic features associated with HCC.Methods:Our diagnostic imaging database was searched for computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging reports of patients with evidence of cirrhosis and liver observations. LI-RADS categories were determined by imaging review, while demographic and clinical outcomes were assigned by chart review. A composite outcome of clinical/radiographic confirmation of HCC was used. We used multivariable analysis to identify features associated with HCC, and competing risks regression to estimate the cumulative frequency of HCC in each category.Results:Our search returned 95 patients with 137 observations (LR2 = 4, LR3 = 53, LR4 = 37, and LR5 = 43). On multivariable analysis, increasing age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76 per 10 years, p = 0.049), washout (HR 5.34, p 20 mm, HR 21.69, p Conclusion:The frequency of HCC within each LI-RADS category reflects the intended purpose, intermediate probability for LR3, probable HCC for LR4, and definite HCC for LR5.
