The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of head and neck cancer in living donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients.This is a retrospective cohort study. A case-matched (1:4) comparison between recipients with and without developed head and neck cancer after LDLT was conducted. The differences between 2 groups were analyzed.The incidence of head and neck malignancy in our cohort was 9 of 453 (1.98%). Their cumulative survival rate was below 60% at 24 months after the diagnosis of head and neck cancer, and no recipients lived for more than 2 years after being diagnosed with stage IV cancer. In the case-control study, univariate analysis revealed that alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] = 8.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-49.56) and smoking (OR = 6.71, 95% CI: 1.20- 37.44) were factors associated with the incidence of head and neck cancer after LDLT.In the conclusion, recipients with head and neck cancer after LDLT may have a rather poor prognosis, especially those who are initially diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. Alcohol consumption and smoking may be the predisposing factors to head and neck cancer in LDLT recipients.
