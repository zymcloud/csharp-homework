Background:Presence of inferior vena cava tumor thrombosis (IVCTT) is an unfavorable factor to prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Case presentation:Herein we report a case of HCC with IVC tumor thrombosis extending from the right hepatic vein (RHV) to the IVC, but it had not infiltrated the right atrium. Anterior approach right hepatectomy combined with IVC thrombectomy using trans-diaphragmatic IVC occlusion was performed for this patient. The patient is alive with disease-free at 32 months after treatment. A literature review was also performed. This case was demonstrated with the details and concepts of surgery.Conclusion:This case suggested that surgical resection of HCC involving the IVC, but still outside the right atrium (RA), could offer satisfactory surgical outcomes in selected patients.
