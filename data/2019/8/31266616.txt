Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common chronic viral infection worldwide and remains a significant global health problem. Chronic HBV infection can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Outcome of chronic HBV infections depends on the host, virus, and environmental factors. Although effective prophylactic vaccines and antiviral therapies exist, curative treatment is not yet available. Intense research into a cure for HBV is ongoing and proposed definitions of cure and endpoints for clinical trials evaluating "curative" therapy are discussed.
