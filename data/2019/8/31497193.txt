Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is generally used to treat psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of DMF on hepatocellular carcinoma progression and its mechanism of action. In vitro, cell viability was examined using CCK-8 assay; cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry; angiogenesis was detected using tube formation assay; and autophagic flux assay results were examined using fluorescence microscopy. We also used western blotting to explore the potential mechanisms. In vivo, tumor xenograft experiment was performed with nude mice, and liver function, renal function, and routine blood counts were assessed using biochemical tests. Dimethyl fumarate inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma, both in vitro and in vivo. Dimethyl fumarate decreased autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Treatment with DMF activated SOCS3, which led to repression of JAK1 and STAT3 phosphorylation. DMF inhibited cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and autophagy via activation of the SOCS3/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. This finding may provide a novel approach for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
