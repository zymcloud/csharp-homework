Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a disorder of unknown etiology in which immune-mediated liver damage progresses to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mainstay therapy for AIH is steroids and other immunosuppressive treatments. Currently, there are no validated markers for monitoring immune-mediated hepatic inflammation. Galectin-9 has recently been identified as a potential biomarker in patients with chronic liver disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether Galectin-9 and other serum proteins are associated with active disease in AIH patients.We enrolled 77 Japanese patients with well-documented AIH who were identified from the National Hospital Organization-AIH-liver-network database, as well as 32 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), 27 patients with SLE, and 17 healthy control subjects. Serum levels of galectin-9, and markers of liver injury were measured and compared between groups.Serum levels of galectin-9 were significantly higher in AIH patients than in CHC patients (13.8 ± 4.9 ng/mL vs 8.9 ± 3.0 ng/mL, P
