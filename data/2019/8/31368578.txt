Liver cirrhosis is a scene profitable to the advance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The current work was engrossed to weigh the potential role of Cichorium intybus linn against thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver cirrhosis and their probable underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms. farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) expression, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunoreactivity, and activated AMP protein kinase (pAMPK), sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), and interleukin-6 (IL6) levels were estimated in hepatic tissue by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoassay, respectively. C. intybus linn supplementation caused a significant improvement in serum liver enzymes, albumin, bilirubin levels, tissues redox status and hepatic histological features in addition to decreased IL6 level, hydroxylproline content, and PCNA immunoreactivity. On contrary, increased pAMPK/SIRT1 levels and upregulated FXR gene expression were observed. C. intybus linn could feasibly protect against TAA-induced hepatic damage, fibrosis, and cirrhosis by relieving oxidative stress and by interruption of the inflammatory pathway via AMPK/SIRT1/FXR signaling. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: No specific therapies are available until now to target the underlying mechanisms for protection against liver diseases. Herbal protection is widely available and cheap with no side effect. Cichorium intybus linn, a natural supplement, is proved in this current work to have the potential of being hepatoprotectant, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory agents, thus reducing the risk of hepatic cirrhosis.
