A growing number of studies have suggested that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in human malignant cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the functions of most lncRNAs have not been elucidated in HCC. In the present study, we explored the potential functions of a novel lncRNA LOC105369748 in the HCC progression. We identified that LOC105369748 expression was significantly elevated in HCC tissues compared with normal tissues based on bioinformatics analysis, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and in situ hybridization (ISH) examination. Moreover, we found that the LOC105369748 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Then we measured the effects of LOC105369748 on HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). And our results demonstrated that LOC105369748 exerted oncogenic roles. In terms of mechanism, LOC105369748 was shown to promote MBD2 expression through competitively binding to microRNA(miR)-5095 in HCC. In conclusion, our findings elucidate that the LOC105369748/miR-5095/MBD2 signaling axis regulates the HCC progression and may be a novel therapeutic avenue.
