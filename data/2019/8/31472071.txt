BACKGROUND Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play an important regulatory role in many tumors. This study was designed to investigate the expression of lncRNA ENST00000429227.1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to determine whether the expression of lncRNA ENST00000429227.1 affects the prognosis of HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS lncRNA ENST00000429227.1 showing differences in expression between M1 and M2 was screened by microarray expression measurements. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of lncRNA ENST00000429227.1 in 161 HCC patients. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between the expression of ENST00000429227.1 and clinicopathological parameters. A survival curve was drawn and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression was used for univariate and multivariate analysis to determine whether lncRNA ENST00000429227.1 is an independent factor of the occurrence and prognosis of HCC. RESULTS A total of 3703 differentially expressed lncRNAs were obtained, of which 1777 were upregulated and 1926 were downregulated, with multiple change >1.5. The expression of lncRNA ENST00000429227.1 was upregulated in M2 cells. The expression of lncRNA ENST00000429227.1 in HCC tissues was higher than that in adjacent normal tissues (p
