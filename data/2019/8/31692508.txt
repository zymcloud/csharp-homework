Objective:Emerging evidence has revealed that lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (SNHG3) is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in various tumors. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of SNHG3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still not fully explored.Methods:Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was employed to detect the expression of SNHG3, miR-139-5p, and BMI1. Colony assay and MTT assay were used to detect the proliferation. Transwell assay was introduced to measure the migration and invasion ability. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay were used to confirm the relationship between SNHG3, miR-139-5p, and BMI1. An animal experiment was adopted to detect the function of SNHG3 in vivo.Results:SNHG3 and BMI1 were upregulated in HCC, while miR-139-5p was downregulated. Knockdown of SNHG3 or BMI1 and overexpression of miR-139-5p could inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC. miR-139-5p was a target of SNHG3 and BMI1 was a direct target mRNA of miR-139-5p. Silencing SNHG3 could impair the tumor progression in vivo.Conclusion:The lncRNA SNHG3/miR-139-5p/BMI1 axis plays an important role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC.
