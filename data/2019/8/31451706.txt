The Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA)-reactive fraction of α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) is a well-known cancer biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with very high specificity. Because LCA recognizes only bi-antennary N-glycans with a core fucose, some of fucosylated AFP in HCC patients may not be detected. Then glycan antibodies, which recognize both specific glycan and protein, are desired for glycobiology. Here, we successfully established a novel glycan antibody for fucosylated AFP and demonstrated its potential clinical application. After immunization with a fucosylated AFP peptide, positive screening was performed for fucosylated AFP peptides using solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The newly developed antibody was designated: fucosylated AFP-specific mAb (FasMab). Western blot analysis showed that FasMab reacted with AFP produced by HepG2 cells, but not with AFP produced by α-1,6-fucosyltransferase deficient HepG2 cells. The specific binding of FasMab to fucosylated AFP was confirmed with ELISA as well as western blot analysis. A preliminary high sensitivity chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay kit showed increased levels of fucosylated AFP in the sera of patients with HCC, but not in the sera of normal patients, or patients with chronic liver diseases. Thus, the novel glycan antibody, FasMab, is a promising tool to study fucosylated AFP with clinical and basic research applications.
