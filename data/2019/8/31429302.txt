A series of new 1,3-thiazole derivatives of maleopimaric acid 6a-f, 7a-f were synthesized and evaluated for anticancer, antibacterial and antifungal activities. Evaluation of cytotoxic activity against human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293), human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) and human T-cell lymphoblast-like line (Jurkat), showed that introduction of the aminothiazole fragment at position 6 of the diterpenoid molecule leads to decrease of cell viability. Substance 3 was found to be the most active against all tested cell lines, inhibiting cell viability with IC50 values in the range of 2-24 μM. The structure-activity relationship of these compounds was studied and the results show that the compounds 6c and 7e exhibited in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans and also possessed antibacterial profile against Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris.
