Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major world public health problem. Current guidelines for the prevention and treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) have suggested clinical cure (also known as functional cure) as the ideal therapeutic goal, which is associated with decreased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinical cure is defined as sustained, undetectable serum HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV DNA with or without seroconversion to anti-HBs, but with the persistence of residual cccDNA, accompanied by resolution of liver injury after the completion of a finite course of treatment. Accumulating data from a series of randomized controlled trials as well as clinical practice have confirmed certain clinical benefit of optimal sequential/ combination strategies of direct acting antiviral drugs (DAA) [such as nucleoside analogues (NA)] or immunomodulators (such as pegylated interferon alpha (Peg-IFN)] for appropriately selected CHB patients. This consensus provides an updated and comprehensive analysis of the data supporting the use of combination therapies and summarizes the roadmap towards clinical cure of CHB to guide decision-making in clinical practice.
