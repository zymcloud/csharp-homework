Objective: The efficacy of treatment for many cancers has increased dramatically in recent decades and there is a growing number of cancer survivors who need effective contraception. In this paper, a group of experts from the European Society of Contraception set out to define the most frequent cancers in women and summarise the guidelines, reviews and studies that provide information and guidance on contraception for each cancer. Methods: Epidemiological studies were analysed to determine the frequency of cancers in women of reproductive age. A narrative review was performed for each cancer, collecting data about the treatment of the disease, its impact on fertility, and the efficacy, health risks, possible benefits and contraindications of the contraceptive methods available. The recommendations were then summarised. Results: Owing to the large amount of information the results are presented in two parts. Part 1 includes contraception after breast and gynaecological cancers. Part 2 summarises the findings and recommendations regarding contraception in women with skin, gastrointestinal, haematological and endocrine cancers.
