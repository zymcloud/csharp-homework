Background:We recently reported on long-term comprehensive biocompatibility and biodistribution study of fluorescent nanodiamond particles (NV)-Z-average 800nm (FNDP-(NV)) in rats. FNDP-(NV) primary deposition was found in the liver, yet liver function tests remained normal.Purpose:The present study aimed to gain preliminary insights on discrete localization of FNDP-(NV) in liver cells of the hepatic lobule unit and venous micro-vasculature. Kinetics of FDNP-(NV) uptake into liver cells surrogates in culture was conducted along with cell cytokinesis as markers of cells' viability.Methods:Preserved liver specimens from a pilot consisting of two animals which were stained for cytoskeletal elements (fluorescein-isothiocyanate-phalloidin) were examined for distribution of FNDP-(NV) by fluorescent microscopy (FM) and Confocal-FM (CFM) using near infra-red fluorescence (NIR). Hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG-2) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured with FNDP-(NV) and assayed for particle uptake and location using spectrophotometric technology and microscopy.Results:HepG-2 and HUVEC displayed rapid (Conclusion:The robust presence of FNDP-(NV) throughout the hepatic lobules including those internalized within parenchyma cells and agglomerates in the liver venous micro-circulation were not associated with macro or micro histopathological signs nor vascular lesions. Cells cultures indicated normal cytokinesis in cells containing FNDP-(NV) agglomerates. Liver parenchyma cells and the liver microcirculation remain agnostic to presence of FNDP-(NV) in the sinusoids or internalized in the hepatic cells.
