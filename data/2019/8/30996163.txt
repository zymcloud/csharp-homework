A 62-year-old man initially underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One year after the initial treatment, he developed anemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed irregularly elevated tumors in the lower anterior gastric body, which were diagnosed to be metastasis from HCC. Left gastric artery coil embolization was performed to prevent sustained bleeding, and his anemia partially improved. In addition to direct invasion, hematogenous metastasis to the stomach from HCC is possible and therefore should be considered during treatment. Transcatheter arterial embolization for gastric metastasis is an effective treatment method which achieves a good degree of hemostasis in patients without any surgical indications.
