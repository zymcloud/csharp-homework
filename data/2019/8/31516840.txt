Alternative and complimentary usage of the natural compound has raised hopes of finding curative options for liver hepatocarcinogenesis. In the present study, the curative effect of bee honey against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (50 mg/kg) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (2 mg/Kg)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in male rats in the presence or absence of some chemotherapeutic drugs, Cisplatin (Cis), Cyclophosphamide (CY) and 5- Fluorouracil (5-FU) were investigated. The obtained results demonstrated that treatment with DEN/CCl4 caused oxidative stress as assigned by the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and fall in glutathione (GSH) content. Meantime detraction in the antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was observed. Also, the results showed induction of inflammation as reflected by an increase in the levels of both α- fetoprotein and α- fucosidase in the liver. This was accompanied by changes in the hepatic function biomarkers which characterized by the increased levels of transaminases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-Glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) and decrease in total protein content in the serum. In conclusion, the combination of the selected drugs and bee honey may be an effective chemo- preventive and therapeutic strategy for treating DEN and CCl4-induced HCC.
