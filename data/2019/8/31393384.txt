Rationale:Laparoscopic right donor hepatectomy has been reported sporadically in several experienced centers for selected donors. This report introduced a case of a donor with an independent right posterior segmental portal branching from the main portal vein.Patient concerns:A 47-year-old woman volunteered to donate her right liver to her 48-year-old husband.Diagnoses:The recipient has been diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma meeting the Milan criteria and hepatitis B virus related cirrhosis.Interventions:The parenchymal transection was performed by ultrasonic aspirator and Hem-o-Lok clips. The right hepatic artery, right hepatic duct, and the anterior and posterior branches of right portal vein were meticulously dissected, clamped, and transected. The right hepatic vein was transected by vascular stapler. A Y-graft of the recipient's own portal confluence was reconstructed with the donor's separate right anterior and posterior portal veins.Outcomes:The donor's operation time was 420 minutes and the warm ischemia time was about 9 minutes. Blood loss was less than 600 ml without transfusion. The donor was discharged at the 10th postoperative day without any complications.Lessons:Laparoscopic right hepatectomy for donors with anomalous portal vein branching and subsequent inflow reconstruction for adult living donor liver transplantation is safe and feasible in highly experienced center.
