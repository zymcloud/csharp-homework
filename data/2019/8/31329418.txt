Changes of α-2,3-/α-2,6-linked sialic acids (SAs) in sialylglycans have been found to be closely related with some diseases. However, accurate quantification of sialylglycans at the isomeric level remains challenging due to their instability, structural complexity, and low mass spectrometry (MS) detection sensitivity. Herein, we propose an analytical strategy named "glycoqueuing", which allows sequential chromatographic elution and high-sensitivity MS quantification of various sialylglycan isomers based on isotopic labeling followed by analysis via online reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography coupling with MS (RP-HPLC-MS). The new method was validated by detailed structural identification and quantification of fetal bovine serum (FBS) N-linked sialylglycan isomers, during which many branching isomers were successfully differentiated, and 28 sialylglycan compositions with Neu5Gc residues were analyzed. The method was successfully applied to isomer-specific, quantitative comparison of sialylated N-glycans between bovine and rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the search for serum sialylated N-glycan biomarker candidates of hepatocellular carcinoma, during which a 55% increase of α-2,6-sialylated fucosylated N-glycans was revealed, demonstrating the great applicability and potential clinical usage of the method.
