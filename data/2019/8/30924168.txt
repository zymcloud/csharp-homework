Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to play critical roles in cancer progression. Recently, lncRNA MAGI2-AS3 has been revealed to be a tumor suppressor and inhibit cell growth by targeting the Fas/FasL signalling pathway in breast cancer. However, the role and underlying mechanism of MAGI2-AS3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. In the current study, we found that MAGI2-AS3 expression is downregulated in HCC tissues and closely associated with some clinical characteristics (tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage) and poor overall survival. Overexpression of MAGI2-AS3 inhibits HCC cell proliferation and migration in vitro, while impedes tumor growth in vivo accordantly. In addition, our data suggest that MAGI2-AS3 could function as an endogenous sponge of miR-374b-5p by directly binding to it and suppressing its expression. Furthermore, miR-374b-5p upregulation could restore the inhibitory effect of MAGI2-AS3 on HCC cells processes. Moreover, suppressor with morphogenetic effect on genitalia family member 1 (SMG1) is positively regulated by MAGI2-AS3 via absorbing miR-374b-5p in HCC cells. More important, SMG1 knockdown reverses the suppressive function of MAGI2-AS3 in HCC cell processes. Taken together, we reveal a functional MAGI2-AS3/miR-374b-5p/SMG1 axis that suppresses HCC progression, potently suggesting a new road for HCC treatment.
