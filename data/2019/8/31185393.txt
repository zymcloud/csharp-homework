A new class of 2(1H)-pyrimidinone derivatives was identified as potential EGFR T790M inhibitors against TKI-resistant NSCLC. These novel compounds inhibited the EGFR T790M kinase activity at concentrations in the range of 85.3 to 519.9 nM. In particular, compound 7e exhibited the strongest activity against both EGFRWT (IC50 = 96.9 nM) and EGFRT790M (IC50 = 85.3 nM) kinases in the cells. Compared with inhibitor 7e, compound 7b displayed enhanced antiproliferative activity against gefitinib-resistant H1975 cells harboring the EGFR T790M mutation. In addition, compound 7b also has low toxicity against the normal human liver cells LO2, with an IC50 of 11.1 ÂµM. Moreover, both the AO/EB and DAPI staining assays also demonstrated the inhibitory efficacy of 7b against the resistant H1975 cells. This contribution provides a new scaffold 2(1H)-pyrimidinone as potential EGFR T790M inhibitor against drug-resistant NSCLC.
