Evidence, demonstrating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as critical players in cancer, remains to increase. lncRNA SBF2-AS1 was reported to be involved in several cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of SBF2-AS1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. We showed lncRNA SBF2-AS1 expression was growing in CRC samples, especially in advanced cases. Accordingly, SBF2-AS1 possesses higher expression in CRC cell lines than in normal cell line. Moreover, SBF2-AS1 high expression indicated a low survival rate. Functionally, SBF2-AS1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. In terms of mechanism, SBF2-AS1 upregulation restrained the activity of miR-619-5p and led to overexpression of HDAC3. Importantly, downregulation of miR-619-5p or HDAC3 overexpression reversed SBF2-AS1-silencing-caused suppression on proliferation and metastasis. Summarily, our findings elucidated a crucial role of SBF2-AS1 as a miR-619-5p sponge, shedding novel light on lncRNA-related prognostics.
