Background & aims:To evaluate virological breakthrough (VBT) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving entecavir (ETV) treatment.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary referral hospital and a total of 228 HBeAg-positive CHB patients treated with ETV for more than 48 weeks were enrolled. Clinical outcome measures included HBeAg seroclearance, maintained virological response and the development of HCC.Results:During a median follow-up period of 197 weeks, VBT developed in 26 (11.4%) patients (VBT group), and the other 202 patients without VBT (non-VBT group). The overall cumulative rate of HBeAg seroclearance in the VBT group and non-VBT group were 23.1% and 23.8%, 27.1% and 37.9%, 27.1% and 55.1%, 27.1% and 74.1%, 27.1% and 76.7% from week 48 to 240, respectively(p = 0.013). The cumulative probability of maintained virological responses from week 48 to 240 were 7.69% and 21.78%, 7.69% in the VBT groups and 36.85%, 7.69% and 51.68%, 7.69% and 64.97%, 7.69% and 72.1% in the non-VBT groups, respectively (pConclusions:VBT was associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including a low probability of HBeAg seroclearance, failure to achieve maintained virological responses, and a risk of developing HCC. Patients, particularly with cirrhosis, who had experienced VBT during ETV treatment, more likely developed HCC.
