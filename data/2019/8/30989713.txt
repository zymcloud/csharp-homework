Growing evidence has revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an important impact on tumorigenesis and tumor progression via a mechanism involving competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). However, their use in predicting the survival of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to develop a novel lncRNA expression-based risk score system to accurately predict the survival of patients with HCC. In our study, using expression profiles downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs), lncRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) were explored in patients with HCC and normal liver tissues, and then a ceRNA network constructed. A risk score system was established between lncRNA expression of the ceRNA network and overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS); it was further analyzed for associations with the clinical features of patients with HCC. In HCC, 473 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 63 differentially expressed miRNAs, and 1417 differentially expressed mRNAs were detected. The ceRNA network comprised 41 lncRNA nodes, 12 miRNA nodes, 24 mRNA nodes, and 172 edges. The lncRNA expression-based risk score system for OS was constructed based on six lncRNAs (MYLK-AS1, AL359878.1, PART1, TSPEAR-AS1, C10orf91, and LINC00501), while the risk score system for RFS was based on four lncRNAs (WARS2-IT1, AL359878.1, AL357060.1, and PART1). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses showed the risk score systems for OS or RFS were significant independent factors adjusted for clinical factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the area under the curve for the risk score system was 0.704 for OS, and 0.71 for RFS. Our result revealed a lncRNA expression-based risk score system for OS or RFS can effectively predict the survival of patients with HCC and aid in good clinical decision-making.
