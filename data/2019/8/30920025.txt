It has been observed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) PAPAS regulates rRNA synthesis, but its role in human diseases is unclear. Our study was carried out to investigate the role of PAPAS in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we found that PAPAS was upregulated both in plasma from patients with HCC and tumors compared with plasma from healthy people and tumor-adjacent healthy tissues. Expression levels of PAPAS in tumor tissues and plasma of patients with HCC were significantly and positively correlated. Plasma levels of PAPAS effectively distinguished stage I patients from healthy controls. MicroRNA (miR)-188-5p was downregulated in tumor tissues than in tumor-adjacent healthy tissues of patients with HCC, and was inversely correlated with PAPAS in tumor tissues but not in adjacent healthy tissues. PAPAS and miR-188-5p downregulated each other. PAPAS overexpression promoted, while miR-188-5p overexpression inhibited the HCC cell proliferation. Rescue experiment showed that miR-34a overexpression attenuated the effects of PAPAS overexpression. However, PAPAS overexpression failed to affect significantly cancer cell migration and invasion. Therefore, lncRNA PAPAS promotes HCC by interacting with miR-188-5p.
