Background:Laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy is difficult due to its deep location and being surrounded by gross vessels. Extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle transection method has been proposed by Takasaki during open liver resections. This approach can be successfully performed during laparoscopic anatomic hepatectomy. Here we describe pure laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy using the extrahepatic Glissonean approach.Methods:The patient was a 25-year-old male with a background of hepatitis B. A 1.5 cm√ó1.7 cm mass was detected in liver Spiegel lobe and highly suspected to be an hepatocellular carcinoma. The liver function was normal (Child-pugh 5), and alpha-fetoprotein was within the normal ranges. Laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy using extrahepatic Glissonean approach was proposed. The hilar plate was partly detached from liver parenchyma, and 2 Glissonean pedicles of the Spiegel lobe were dissected, clamped and divided. Liver parenchymal transection was performed using the harmonic scalpel.Results:The operation time was 196 minutes without Pringle's maneuver. Estimated blood loss was Conclusions:Laparoscopic Spiegel lobectomy using the extrahepatic Glissonean approach is safe and feasible.
