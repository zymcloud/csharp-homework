Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an extremely fatal malignancy. Intestinal microRNAs, which can be detected in fecal samples in humans may be involved in the pathological process of HCC. Therefore, screening for functional intestinal microRNAs in fecal samples and investigating their potential roles in the molecular progression of HCC are necessary. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been widely used in microRNA expression studies. However, few genes have been reported as reference genes for intestinal microRNAs in fecal samples. In order to obtain a more accurately analyzed intestinal microRNAs expression, we first searched for reliable reference genes for intestinal microRNAs expression normalization during qRT-PCR, using three software packages (GeNorm, NormFinder, and Bestkeeper). Next we screened and predicted the target genes of the differentially intestinal microRNAs of control and HCC mice through quantitative RT-PCR or miRtarBase. Finally, we also analyzed the mRNA targets for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using the DAVID Bioinformatic Resources database. This study has successfully screened relatively suitable reference genes and we have discovered that the differential intestinal microRNAs play significant roles in the development of HCC. The top reference genes identified in this study could provide a theoretical foundation for the reasonable selection of a suitable reference gene. Furthermore, the detection of intestinal microRNAs expression may serve as a promising therapeutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.
