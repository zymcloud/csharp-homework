MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators in the tumour growth and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Increasing evidence suggests that miR-301b-3p functions as a driver in various types of human cancer. However, the expression pattern of miR-301b-3p and its functional role as well as underlying molecular mechanism in HCC remain poorly known. Our study found that miR-301b-3p expression was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumour tissues. Clinical association analysis revealed that the high level of miR-301b-3p closely correlated with large tumour size and advanced tumour-node-metastasis stages. Importantly, the high miR-301b-3p level predicted a prominent poorer overall survival of HCC patients. Knockdown of miR-301b-3p suppressed cell proliferation, led to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induced apoptosis of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Furthermore, miR-301b-3p knockdown suppressed tumour growth of HCC in mice. Mechanistically, miR-301b-3p directly bond to 3'UTR of vestigial like family member 4 (VGLL4) and negatively regulated its expression. The expression of VGLL4 mRNA was down-regulated and inversely correlated with miR-301b-3p level in HCC tissues. Notably, VGLL4 knockdown markedly repressed cell proliferation, resulted in G2/M phase arrest and promoted apoptosis of HCC cells. Accordingly, VGLL4 silencing rescued miR-301b-3p knockdown attenuated HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance. Collectively, our results suggest that miR-301b-3p is highly expressed in HCC. miR-301b-3p facilitates cell proliferation, promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits apoptosis of HCC cells by repressing VGLL4.
