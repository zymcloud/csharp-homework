Aim:To demonstrate the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-computed tomography (CT) fusion imaging for the assessment of the ablative margin after cryoablation in hepatic malignancies.Materials and methods:This retrospective study analysed 35 patients with 47 liver tumours treated with CT-guided cryoablation. Fusion images of pre-ablation MRI and intraoperative CT data were created on a workstation. Minimal ablative margin (MAM) assessment was categorised into three groups: (I) MAM <0 mm (tumour protruded through the ablation zone), (II) MAM 0-5 mm, and (III) MAM â‰¥5 mm. Local tumour progression (LTP) was assessed during follow-up.Results:MRI-CT fusion imaging was successfully achieved in 46 (97.9%) of 47 lesions. LTP was detected in 67.4% (31/46) of cases. Twenty-four (77.4%) of 31 LTPs occurred in the subcapsular region of the liver. Using fusion images, the MAM was classified as groups I, II, and III in 18, 25, and three tumours, respectively. In group I, LTP was found in 15 (83.3%) of 18 lesions, whereas in group II, LTP was detected in 16 (64%) of 25 lesions. The cumulative LTP rate in group II was significantly lower than that in group I (p=0.012).Conclusion:Pre-ablation MRI and intraoperative CT fusion imaging is feasible and useful for evaluating the MAM of cryoablation in hepatic malignancies.
