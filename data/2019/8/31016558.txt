Purpose:CD147 is a tumor-associated antigen that plays a key regulatory role in tumor invasion and distant metastasis. However, the exact role of CD147 phosphorylation, which is deregulated during cancer progression, is unknown. Here, the effects of CD147 phosphorylation on the malignant behavior of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and its possible underlying mechanisms are explored.Methods:An in situ Duolink-proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to detect CD147 phosphorylation. Tandem mass spectrometry was employed to identify the phosphorylation sites of CD147. The effects of CD147 phosphorylation on the malignant behavior of HCC cells were evaluated using scratch wound healing assays, transwell invasion assays and cell cycle assays. The genes regulated by CD147 phosphorylation were detected by RNA sequencing.Results:We identified phosphorylated serine-246 in the C terminus of CD147 in primary HCC tissues, whereas serine to alanine substitution mutation analysis suggested that CD147 is phosphorylated mainly at serine-252 in HCC-derived Huh-7 cells. Recovery expression of S246A/S252A mutants in CD147 knockout cells revealed significantly increased migration and invasion capacities compared to wildtype CD147 expressing cells. Cyclophilin A (CyPA) treatment decreased the phosphorylation level of CD147, whereas NIMA-related kinase 6 (NEK6) increased the CD147 phosphorylation level. Moreover, the CD147 phosphorylation level was found to be dramatically decreased in HCC tissues in patients with distant metastases, and a low phosphorylation level of CD147 was found to be associated with a high serum AFP level, recurrence and a poor overall survival.Conclusions:From our data we conclude that hypo-phosphorylated CD147 promotes the migration and invasion of HCC cells and correlates with an unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients, indicating that targeting the aberrantly hypo-phosphorylated form of CD147 may be instrumental for the development of novel therapeutic modalities directed against HCC metastasis.
