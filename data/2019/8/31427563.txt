BACKGROUND Early recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) is still a clinical problem. This multicenter study evaluated the Milan, Hangzhou, and AFP model-based criteria for prediction of early recurrence of HCC in patients with cirrhosis who had undergone LT. MATERIAL AND METHODS From the China Liver Transplant Registry (CLTR) database, we analyzed data of 589 HCC patients who had undergone LT between Jan 2015 and Jan 2019. Imaging data and AFP levels were evaluated immediately before LT. Recurrence and overall survival rates at 2 years were tested using the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The Milan criteria, Hangzhou criteria, and AFP model-based criteria were evaluated. RESULTS We found that 62.0%, 91.2%, and 67.6% of patients were within the Milan criteria, Hangzhou criteria, and AFP model-based criteria, respectively. The 2-year recurrence rate was 8.9%, 15.8%, and 11.8% with corresponding overall survival of 85.3%, 82.7%, and 86.5%, respectively. The 2-year recurrence rate was different in patients fulfilling and exceeding the AFP model-based criteria among patients who met either the Milan criteria (7.9% vs. 18.8%, HR=3.83, p=0.006) or Hangzhou criteria (12.0% vs. 27.6%, HR=2.95, p
