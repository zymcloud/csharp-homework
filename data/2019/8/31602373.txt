Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is now the second-highest cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent studies have discovered a wide range of somatic mutations in HCC. These mutations involve various vital signaling pathways such as: Wnt/Î²-Catenin, p53, telome-rase reverse transcriptase (TERT), chromatin remodeling, RAS/MAPK signaling, and oxidative stress. However, fusion transcripts have not been broadly explored in HCC.Methods:To identify novel fusion transcripts in HCC, in the first phase of our study, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (in HCC and paired non-HCC tissues) on 6 patients with a diagnosis of HCC undergoing liver transplantation.Results:As a result of these studies, we discovered the novel fusion transcript, VTI1A-CFAP46. In the second phase of our study, we measured the expression of wild-type VTI1A in 21 HCC specimens, which showed that 10 of 21 exhibited upregulation of wild-type VTI1A in their tumors. VTI1A (Vesicle Transport via Interaction with t-SNARE homolog 1A) is a member of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) gene family, which is essential for membrane trafficking and function in endocytosis, autophagy, and Golgi transport. Notably, it is known that autophagy is involved in HCC.Conclusions:The link between novel fusion transcript VTI1A-CFAP46 and autophagy as a potential therapeutic target in HCC patients deserves further investigation. Moreover, this study shows that fusion transcripts are worthy of additional exploration in HCC.
