Antifungalmycin N2 (3-methyl-3,5-amino-4-vinyl-2-pyrone, C6H7O2N) was a novel metabolite produced from Streptomyces sp. strain N2, and the present study aimed to evaluate its antibacterial and cytotoxic properties. By using Oxford cup method, the obtained results revealed that antifungalmycin N2 exhibited a significant antibacterial activity against the pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus kristinae, especially the Gram-positive S. aureus. Meanwhile, the MTT assay showed that antifungalmycin N2 could exert a marked inhibitory action on tumor cell lines, such as the cell lines of BEL-7402 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), Hela (human cervical carcinoma), HCT116 (human colon cancer), and SW620 (human colon cancer). And the IC50 values antifungalmycin N2 against the above cell lines ranged from 11.23 to 15.37 Î¼g/mL. In conclusion, the antibacterial and cytotoxic activities suggested that the novel antifungalmycin N2 was a promising active structure to be developed as new drug for treating infectious diseases and cancers.
