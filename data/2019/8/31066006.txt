Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality and without effective prognosis. Previous study has been confirmed that the abnormal expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) TGFB2-AS1 was involved in tumorigenesis. However, the biological functions of TGFB2-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unclear.Objective:We comprehensively assess the clinical significance of TGFB2-AS1 and investigate the biological functions of TGFB2-AS1 on HCC HepG2 cells.Methods:We firstly confirmed the expression of TGFB2-AS1 between tumor and normal tissues using public available transcriptome data. We analyzed the clinical significance of TGFB2-AS1 using the TCGA HCC datasets. The biological functions of TGFB2-AS1 on HCC HepG2 cells were explored by multiple in vitro assays.Results:We found that TGFB2-AS1 was remarkably increased in HCC tissues (P = 0.00148) and exhibited a potential predictive marker for HCC, with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.708 (P = 0.0034) using the fifty pairs of matched HCC tissues of TCGA. Besides, higher expression of TGFB2-AS1 in HCC tissues was identified as being positively associated with advanced tumor (P = 0.012) and disease stage (P = 0.009) in 355 HCC cases using independent sample nonparametric test. Downregulation of TGFB2-AS1 expression significantly restrained proliferation (P Conclusion:Taken together, these findings suggested that TGFB2-AS1 might serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
