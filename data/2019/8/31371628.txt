Aims: A large number of studies have suggested that exportins (XPOs) play a pivotal role in human cancers. In the present study, we analyzed XPO mRNA expression in cancer tissues and explored their prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods: Transcriptional and survival data related to XPO expression in HCC patients were obtained through the ONCOMINE and UALCAN databases. Survival analysis plots were drawn with Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). Sequence alteration data for XPOs were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and c-BioPortal. Gene functional enrichment analyses were performed with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID).Results: Compared with normal liver tissues, significant XPO mRNA overexpression was observed in HCC cancer tissues. There was a trend of higher XPO expression in more advanced clinical stages and lower differentiated pathological grades of HCC. In HCC patients, high expression of XPO1, CSE1L, XPOT, XPO4/5/6 was related to poor overall survival (OS), and XPO1, CSE1L and XPO5/6 were correlated with poor disease-free survival (DFS). The main genetic alterations in XPOs involved mRNA up-regulation, DNA amplification and deletion. General XPO mutations were remarkably associated with worse OS and mostly affected the pathways of RNA transport and oocyte meiosis.Conclusion: High expression of XPOs was associated with a poor prognosis in HCC patients. XPOs may be exploited as good prognostic biomarkers for survival in HCC patients.
