Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. Therapeutic outcomes of HCC remain unsatisfactory, and novel treatments are urgently needed. GPC3 (glypican-3) is an emerging target for HCC, given the findings that 1) GPC3 is highly expressed in more than 70% of HCC; (2) elevated GPC3 expression is linked with poor HCC prognosis; and (3) GPC3-specific therapeutics, including immunotoxin, bispecific antibody and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. have shown promising results. Here, we postulate that GPC3 is a potential target of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for treating liver cancer. To determine the payload for ADCs against liver cancer, we screened three large drug libraries (> 9,000 compounds) against HCC cell lines and found that the most potent drugs are DNA-damaging agents. Duocarmycin SA and pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer were chosen as the payloads to construct two GPC3-specific ADCs: hYP7-DC and hYP7-PC. Both ADCs showed potency at picomolar concentrations against a panel of GPC3-positive cancer cell lines, but not GPC3 negative cell lines. To improve potency, we investigated the synergetic effect of hYP7-DC with approved drugs. Gemcitabine showed a synergetic effect with hYP7-DC in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, single treatment of hYP7-PC induced tumor regression in multiple mouse models. Conclusion: We provide an example of an ADC targeting GPC3, suggesting a strategy for liver cancer therapy.
