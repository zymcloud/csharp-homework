Background:The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade is an index that could objectively evaluate liver function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of postoperative ALBI (post-ALBI) grade and ALBI changes (△ALBI) after hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinical and pathological data of 300 patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from January 19, 2009 to December 25, 2014, were analyzed retrospectively. According to the test data, the patients were divided into post-ALBI grade I, post-ALBI grade II, and post-ALBI grade III groups. According to the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), the patients were divided into △ALBI (△ALBI >0.71) high and low groups (△ALBI ≤0.71). Baseline clinical data, recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were compared between the groups.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS rates and OS rates of patients with post-ALBI grade III were significantly reduced in comparison to those with post-ALBI grade II (PConclusions:This study confirmed for the first time that post-ALBI grade and △ALBI could predict the prognosis of patients with HCC after hepatectomy.
