Aim: This study aimed to develop indocyanine green- and doxorubicin-loaded liposomes (DILPs) as theranostic nanoplatform for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and as an efficient chemotherapeutic to enhance microwave ablation. Materials & methods: DILPs were synthesized and thoroughly characterized. Biocompatibility, tumor uptake and accumulation, and synergistic ablation-chemotherapeutic efficiency were systematically explored in them. In addition, human HCC surgical samples were used to test the affinity of DILPs for HCC. Results: The combination of microwave ablation and DILPs enhanced the ablation efficiency of HCC with apparent tumor inhibition. DILPs exhibited excellent diagnostic ability and could detect 2.5-mm HCC lesions via optoacoustic tomography imaging. DILPs had better affinity for human HCC surgical samples compared with normal liver tissue. Conclusion: Theranostic DILPs could serve as promising nanoparticles for treatment and management of HCC in the clinic.
