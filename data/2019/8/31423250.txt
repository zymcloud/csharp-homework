The aim of the present study was to establish a prediction index (PI) model for the 5-year survival rate of patients with hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical resection, and to evaluate the effect of prophylactic transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). A total of 201 patients with hepatitis B-related HCC who had undergone radical hepatic resection at The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University (Xinjiang, China) were enrolled, and the clinical, pathological and complete follow-up data were collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify which clinicopathological factors were considered significant risk factors and the PI model was established based on these factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was generated, and the area under the curve (0.841) and the cut-off value for PI were calculated. A Kaplan-Meier plot was used for survival analysis and the log-rank test was used to determine differences in survival. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that there were seven independent factors that may have affected the 5-year survival of HCC patients: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), maximum size of tumor (MTS), tumor histological grade (HG), positive resection margin (PRM), microvascular invasion (MVI), the amount of tumor (AT), and antivirus therapy (AVT). A PI model on 5-year survival was established based on these factors, which was PI=0.32 × NLR + 0.39 × HG (high=1, medium=2, low=3) + 0.92 × PRM (yes=1, no=0) + 0.87 × MVI (yes=1, no=0) + 0.73 × AT (single=0, many=1) + 0.53 × MTS (≥5 cm=1, 2.75), the cumulative survival rates showed significant differences among patients who had received ≥3 TACE procedues, patients who had received 2.75, if they had received ≥3 prophylactic TACE procedures, they demonstrated a more favorable outcome.
