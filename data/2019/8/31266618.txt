Fatty liver prevalence is increasing and becoming a global health burden. Chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) is one of the most common chronic viral infections. Steatosis in CHB patients increases risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Data from studies on the interaction between CHB and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are not conclusive. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of fatty liver; however, noninvasive diagnostic tests have been developed to diagnose and predict fibrosis in CHB/NAFLD. Treatment guidelines are not clear.
