Aim:To assess the prognostic significance of enhancement rate (ER) measured by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Materials and methods:A total of 253 patients with single primary HCC undergoing preoperative CEUS and RFA were enrolled in this study. The ER were evaluated though pretreatment CEUS. After a mean follow-up of 36.8 ± 10.2 months, the correlation of ER measured by CEUS and survival after RFA was analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. The optimal cutoff ER value to predict survival was determined using receiver-operating characteristic analysis.Results:Mean follow-up period for all 253 patients was 36.8 ± 10.2 months, 31.2% of patients had died at endpoint. The optimal cutoff ER value predicting survival was 2.2 dB/s. Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients with a high ER level had poorer OS (62.8 months vs 48.8 months, P = 0.02) and recurrence-free survival (RFS = 60.2 months vs 47.4 months, P = 0.03) than patients with a low ER level. ER measured by CEUS also been confirmed as independent risk factor for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.21-7.25; P Conclusions:ER measured by CEUS was a significant predictive factor for survival after RFA for HCC.
