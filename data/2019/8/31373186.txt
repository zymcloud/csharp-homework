Background:Performing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is difficult with the occurrence of thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of partial splenic embolization (PSE) combined with TACE in patients with HCC with severe thrombocytopenia related to splenomegaly.Methods:We conducted a case-control study consisting of 18 HCC patients with severe thrombocytopenia (Results:Mean platelet counts at 1 month and 1, 3, and 5 years after concurrent PSE and TACE significantly increased compared with baseline (all P < 0.05), whereas the platelet count did not significantly increase after TACE alone. In addition, the platelet count at several time points after treatment in the PSE group was significantly higher than that in the non-PSE group, although the baseline platelet count in the PSE group was significantly lower than that in the non-PSE group. The platelet increase after PSE significantly reduced the need for platelet transfusions (P = 0.040) and enabled the subsequent TACE procedures in time (P = 0.046). The leukocyte counts and hemoglobin concentrations after concurrent PSE and TACE were also significantly increased, without deterioration of Child-Turcotte-Pugh score and unexpected side effects.Conclusion:PSE combined with TACE is effective in inducing and maintaining long-term thrombocytopenia improvement which reduces the need for the platelet transfusion and helps to perform initial and serial TACE, and is well-tolerated in patients with HCC and thrombocytopenia. PSE may be a promising treatment option for HCC patients with severe thrombocytopenia associated with splenomegaly who will undergo TACE.
