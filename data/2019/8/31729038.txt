Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is related to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the interplay between the virus and host immune response leads to different outcomes of the infection. PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1) and autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5) are involved in immune response and HBV infection. An intergenic region between PRDM1 and ATG5 (PRDM1-ATG5 region) has been identified, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region were shown to be involved in immune regulation. This study investigated the functionally relevant rs548234, rs6937876, and rs6568431 polymorphisms at the PRDM1-ATG5 region in a Han Chinese population (403 patients with chronic HBV infection [171 chronic hepatitis, 119 cirrhosis, and 113 HCC], 70 infection resolvers, and 196 healthy controls). The frequencies of the rs6568431 allele A in HBV patients (P = .005) and genotype CA in infection resolvers (P = .005) were significantly higher than in healthy controls. In the dominant model, HCC patients had significantly higher frequencies of rs548234 genotypes CC + TC than cirrhosis patients (P = .009). Rs548234 was an independent factor for HCC in comparison with either cirrhosis (P = .005) or all chronic HBV infection without HCC (P = .018). Functional annotation showed evidence of the role of the SNPs in gene regulation. In conclusion, through this study it is revealed for the first time that rs6568431 may be associated with susceptibility to HBV infection and that rs548234 may be associated with HCC risk in chronic HBV infection, supporting the presence of HBV-related disease-causing regulatory polymorphisms in the PRDM1-ATG5 intergenic region.
