Purpose: To evaluate the histological findings in both tumor and surrounding non-tumoral liver parenchyma after trans-arterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who subsequently underwent hepatectomy.Material and methods: This study included six patients with an HCC (size 15-61 mm). DEB-TACE was performed using polyvinyl alcohol-based hydrogel microspheres loaded with epirubicin. Radiological tumor response was evaluated after DEB-TACE and before hepatectomy, according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Surgical specimens were histologically evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin, and elastic Van Gieson's staining.Results: Segmental, sub-segmental, or partial hepatectomy were performed 14-58 days after DEB-TACE. There was no remarkable destructive change and minimal to absent inflammatory cell infiltration in the surrounding non-tumoral liver parenchyma. There was no evidence of biliary tract or arterial wall impairment. Complete and partial histological tumor necrosis were found in three cases, respectively, in agreement with the complete and partial responses seen during the radiological evaluation.Conclusion: Histological examination of resected liver specimens after DEB-TACE showed substantial tumor necrosis without any severe inflammatory or destructive changes in the non-tumoral liver parenchyma.
