Environmental pollutants including halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzo[a]pyrene, exert their deleterious effects through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and by the resulting transcription of genes not yet fully identified. Ligand-bound AHR translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus, where it dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein. The AHR/ARNT dimer binds to enhancer regions of responsive genes to activate transcription. AHR also mediates carcinogenesis caused by PAHs, likely via CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1, which are massively induced by activated AHR in many tissues and generate carcinogenic electrophilic derivatives of PAHs. In the current study, we have used the mouse GeCKOv2 genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library to identify novel genes in the AHR pathway by taking advantage of a B[a]P selection assay that we previously used to identify core AHR pathway genes in Hepa-1c1c7 murine hepatoma cells. Besides Ahr, Arnt, and Cyp1a1, we report the identification of multiple additional putative AHR pathway genes including several that we validated. These include cytochrome P450 reductase (Por), which mediates redox regeneration of cytochromes P450, and 5 genes of the heme biosynthesis pathway: delta-aminolevulinate synthase 1 (Alas1), porphobilinogen deaminase (Hmbs), uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Urod), coproporphyrinogen oxidase (Cpox), and ferrochelatase (Fech): heme being an essential prosthetic group of cytochrome P450 proteins. Notably, several of these genes were identified by GeCKO screening, despite not being identifiable by reverse genetics approaches. This indicates the power of high-sensitivity genome-wide genetic screening for identifying genes in the AHR pathway.
