The pleiotropic roles of DEAD-box helicase 3, X-linked (DDX3X), including its functions in transcriptional and translational regulation, chromosome segregation, DNA damage, and cell growth control, have highlighted the association between DDX3X and tumorigenesis. However, mRNA transcripts and protein levels of DDX3X in patient specimens have shown the controversial correlations of DDX3X with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence. In this study, generation of hepatocyte-specific Ddx3x-knockout mice revealed that loss of Ddx3x facilitates liver tumorigenesis. Loss of Ddx3x led to profound ductular reactions, cell apoptosis, and compensatory proliferation in female mutants at 6 weeks of age. The sustained phosphorylation of histone H2AX (Î³H2AX) and significant accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks in liver indicated that the replicative stress occurred in female mutants. Further chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that DDX3X bound to promoter regions and regulated the expression of DNA repair factors, DDB2 and XPA, to maintain genome stability. Loss of Ddx3x led to decreased levels of DNA repair factors, which contributed to an accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage, replication stress, and eventually, spontaneous liver tumors and DEN-induced HCCs in Alb-Cre/+;Ddx3xflox/flox mice. IMPLICATIONS: These data identify an important role of DDX3X in the regulation of DNA damage repair to protect against replication stress in liver and HCC development and progression.
