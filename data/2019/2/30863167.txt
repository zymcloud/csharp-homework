Purpose:This study aimed to investigate the clinical value of a tumor map for assessing the ablative effect after ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (US-PMWA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The medical records of 68 patients (49 male and 19 female, 59.9Â±12.7 years) with HCC who underwent US-PMWA from May 2013 to May 2017 were reviewed. A tumor map was generated from the fusion of three-dimensional (3D) visualization images based on the preoperative target tumor and postoperative ablation area, to evaluate whether the ablation area covering the tumor has reached a 5 mm ablative margin (AM). The lesions were divided into two groups according to the tumor maps: group A (failed to achieve AM) and group B (achieved AM). The cumulative local tumor progression (LTP) rates of both groups were statistically analyzed using the log-rank test.Results:Success rate of tumor map generation was 100% (68/68), and no residual tumors were found. MWA-related 3D images, which included target tumor volume, ablation area volume, and residual liver ratio, were compared between groups A and B (P=0.295, P=0.772, and P=0.527, respectively). Technique effectiveness rate (91.7% vs 100%) was achieved in the two groups, showing no significant statistical differences (P=0.672). The 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month LTP rate was 8.3%, 16.7%, 20.8%, and 34%, respectively, for group A and 0%, 2.8%, 2.8%, and 2.8%, respectively, for group B, showing significant statistical differences (P<0.001) between the two groups.Conclusion:The novel technology of tumor map generated from 3D visualization of image fusion is feasible and useful in evaluating the ablative effect of US-PMWA for HCC.
