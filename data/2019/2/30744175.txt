Background:Most integrated scores for predicting the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) comprise tumor progression factors and liver function variables. The FIB4 index is an indicator of hepatic fibrosis calculated on the basis of age, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and platelet count, but it does not include variables directly related to liver function. We propose a new staging system, referred to as "FIB4-T," comprising the FIB4 index as well as tumor progression factors, and examine its usefulness.Method:Subjects included 3800 cases of HCC registered in multiple research centers. We defined grades 1, 2, and 3 as a Fibrosis-4 (FIB4) index of 6.70 as FIB4, respectively, and calculated the FIB4-T in the same manner in which the JIS (Japan Integrated Staging Score) scores and albumin-bilirubin tumor node metastasis (ALBI-T) were calculated. We compared the prognostic prediction ability of FIB4-T with that of the JIS score and ALBI-T.Results:Mean observation period was 37 months. The 5-year survival rates (%) of JIS score (0/1/2/3/4/5), ALBI-T (0/1/2/3/4/5) and FIB4-T (0/1/2/3/4/5) were 74/60/36/16/0, 82/66/45/22/5/0 and 88/75/65/58/32/10, respectively. Comparisons of the Akaike information criteria among JIS scores, ALBI-T, and FIB4-T indicated that stratification using the FIB4-T system was comparable to those using ALBI-T and JIS score. The risk of mortality significantly increased (1.3‚Åª2.8 times/step) with an increase in FIB4-T, and clear stratification was possible regardless of the treatment.Conclusion:FIB4-T is useful in predicting the prognosis of patients with HCC from a new perspective.
