Background:Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in tumourigenesis and tumour progression. However, the expression profiles and functions of circRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are largely unclear.Methods:The expression profiles of circRNAs in HCC were identified through microarray analysis and were validated through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The circular structure of candidate circRNA was confirmed through Sanger sequencing, divergent primer PCR, and RNase R treatments. Proliferation of HCC cells was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The microRNA (miRNA) sponge mechanism of circRNAs was demonstrated using dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays.Results:CircSETD3 (hsa_circRNA_0000567/hsa_circRNA_101436) was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Low expression of circSETD3 in HCC tissues significantly predicted an unfavourable prognosis and was correlated with larger tumour size and poor differentiation of HCC in patients. In vitro experiments showed that circSETD3 inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells and induced G1/S arrest in HCC cells. In vivo studies revealed that circSETD3 was stably overexpressed in a xenograft mouse model and inhibited the growth of HCC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that circSETD3 acts as a sponge for miR-421 and verified that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)14 is a novel target of miR-421.Conclusion:CircSETD3 is a novel tumour suppressor of HCC and is a valuable prognostic biomarker. Moreover, circSETD3 inhibits the growth of HCC partly through the circSETD3/miR-421/MAPK14 pathway.
