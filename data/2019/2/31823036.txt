Background:Distant metastases from squamous cell cancer of the vulva (VSCC) are encountered rarely and are associated with a poor prognosis. Cerebral metastases have only been described anecdotally.Case history:A 51-year old woman was diagnosed with hepatic metastases due to VSCC. Initial therapy comprised wide local excision of the primary tumor with inguino-femoral lymphadenectomy (LAE) followed by stereotactic radiation of the singular hepatic metastasis while adjuvant chemoradiation of the vulva and lymphatics was declined. 3 years later, she subsequently developed lung and cerebral metastases.Conclusion:The course of metastatic disease in VSCC is poorly understood. Further knowledge of the metastatic patterns in vulvar cancer is required for guidance of future therapeutic interventions.
