Objectives:To determine whether tumour enhancement on preoperative delayed-phase gadoxetate-enhanced MRI can predict long-term survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRCLM) post-hepatectomy.Materials and methods:Sixty-five patients who received a preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI prior to liver resection for CRCLM from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, were included in this retrospective study. Target tumour enhancement (TuEn) was calculated as the mean percentage increase in SNR from precontrast to 10-min or 20-min delayed phase for up to two target lesions. Per-patient TuEn was stratified into weak and strong enhancement based on the cut-off determined by the Youden Index for 3-year survival. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine whether tumour enhancement could predict overall survival independent of potential confounders (clinical risk score).Results:The proportion surviving at 3 years was 85.1% in patients with strong TuEn at 10 min vs. 56.5% in those with weak TuEn at 10 min (p = 0.001). The proportion surviving at 3 years was 79.4% in patients with strong TuEn at 20 min vs. 58.7% in those with weak TuEn at 20 min (p = 0.011). After adjusting for potential confounders, the hazard ratio of death was 0.24 (p = 0.009) in patients who had weak TuEn at 10 min and 0.32 (p = 0.018) in patients who had weak TuEn at 20 min.Conclusions:Strong delayed tumour enhancement seen on gadoxetate-enhanced MRI is associated with overall survival in patients with CRCLM post-hepatectomy and may be useful for preoperative risk stratification.Key points:• Delayed tumour enhancement of colorectal liver metastases on gadoxetate-enhanced MRI is associated with survival post-hepatectomy • Delayed tumour enhancement of colorectal liver metastases on gadoxetate-enhanced MRI can be measured at both 10 min and 20 min post-contrast injection.
