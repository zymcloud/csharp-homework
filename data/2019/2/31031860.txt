Objectives: LncRNA associated with microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (lncRNA MVIH) is a newly discovered long non-coding RNA that aberrantly up-regulates and holds prognostic value in various tumors. The aim of the review and meta-analysis is to assess its prognostic potential and functions in malignant tumors. Materials and methods: PubMed, PMC, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Database were carefully searched for articles published as of Jan. 1, 2018. Hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to demonstrate prognostic value of lncRNA MVIH using Stata 12.0 software. Results: Six original studies including 830 cancer patients were ultimately enrolled in this meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that elevated lncRNA MVIH expression was significantly correlated with unfavorable OS (HR=2.17, 95% CI: 1.58-2.76, p < 0.001) and RFS/DFS/PFS (HR=2.21, 95% CI: 1.54-2.87, p < 0.001) in cancer patients. Additionally, high expression of lncRNA MVIH was related to positive lymph node metastasis (OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.37-6.75, p = 0.006) and advanced clinical stage (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.68-3.79, p < 0.001). Conclusions: LncRNA MVIH over-expression was associated with poor clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types. More studies are warranted to verify and strengthen the clinical value of lncRNA MVIH in human cancers.
