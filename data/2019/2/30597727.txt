Our goal was to explore the function of miR-552 and its potential target AJAP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) oncogenesis and progression. In this study, bioinformatics analysis was performed to detect abnormally expressed miRNAs. The relationship between miR-552 and AJAP1 was validated using luciferase reporter assays. RT-qPCR and Western blot assays were applied to explore the expression level of miR-552, AJAP1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. HCC cell proliferation was examined using CCK8 assays, while migration and invasion were investigated using Transwell assays. Nude mouse tumourigenesis models were established to facilitate observation of HCC progression in vivo. Finally, prognostic analysis was performed to discover how the prognosis of HCC patients correlated with miR-552 and AJAP1 expression. MiR-552 overexpression in HCC cells promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and EMT by targeting/suppressing AJAP1. Poorer prognosis appeared in HCC patients with higher miR-552 expression or lower AJAP1 levels. Our findings suggested that miR-552 promotes HCC oncogenesis and progression by inhibiting AJAP1 expression.
