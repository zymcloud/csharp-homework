Myopathy is an adverse effect of telbivudine. We describe a case of telbivudine-induced myopathy visualized on FDG PET/CT in a 75-year-old man with history of chronic HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. FDG PET/CT images demonstrate no abnormal uptake characteristic of hypermetabolic malignancy. However, intense hypermetabolic activity in muscles of the abdominal wall was noted. Three months after telbivudine withdrawal, a second FDG PET/CT showed normal muscle activity in the abdominal wall.
