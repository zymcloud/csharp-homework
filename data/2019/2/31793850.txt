BackgroundThe performance of PET/MRI in the determination of distant metastases (M stage) in rectal cancer relative to the current practice with contrast material-enhanced CT is largely unknown.PurposeTo compare the staging of clinical M stage rectal cancer with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MRI (including dedicated liver and rectal MRI) to that of chest and abdominopelvic CT and dedicated rectal MRI.Materials and MethodsFrom January 2016 to August 2017, patients with newly diagnosed advanced mid to low rectal cancers were recruited for this prospective study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT0265170). Participants underwent both FDG PET/MRI with dedicated liver and rectal MRI and chest and abdominopelvic CT (the standard-of-care protocol) within 3 weeks of each other. Thereafter, M stage assessment performance was determined by using findings from 6-month clinical follow-up or biopsy as the reference standard. Performance was compared between protocols. Agreement in M stage classification was also assessed. Nonparametric statistical analyses were performed, and P < .05 indicated a significance difference.ResultsSeventy-one participants (28 women; mean age ± standard deviation, 61 years ± 9; age range, 39-79 years) were enrolled. The M stage could not be determined with the standard-of-care protocol in 22 of the 71 participants (31%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.5%, 43.1%) because of indeterminate lesions. However, among these participants, PET/MRI correctly helped identify all 14 (100%; 95% CI: 76.8%, 100%) without metastases and seven of eight (88%; 95% CI: 47.4%, 99.7%) who were later confirmed to have metastases. PET/MRI showed high specificity for ruling out metastatic disease compared with the standard-of-care protocol (98% [54 of 55 participants] vs 72% [40 of 55 participants], respectively; P < .001), without increasing the number of participants with missed metastasis (6% [one of 16 participants] vs 6% [one of 16 participants]; P > .99).ConclusionPET/MRI with dedicated rectal and liver MRI can facilitate the staging work-up of newly diagnosed advanced rectal cancers by helping assess indeterminate lesions, metastases, and incidental findings better than contrast-enhanced CT, obviating for additional imaging work-up.© RSNA, 2019Online supplemental material is available for this article.Clinical trial registration no.
