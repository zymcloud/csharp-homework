Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with stemness features are pivotal for tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, and progression. Long non-coding RNAs have been implicated in the regulation of HCC stemness features; however, their mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we found that Lnc-PDZD7 is a potential oncogene. We systematically analyzed the clinical significance and mechanism of Lnc-PDZD7 in stemness and chemosensitivity regulation.Methods:We analyzed the Lnc-PDZD7 expression levels in liver cancer tissues and cell line by qRT-PCR and In situ hybridization. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted to investigate the biological functions of Lnc-PDZD7 in stemness and chemosensitivity regulation. Bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate that Lnc-PDZD7 competitively regulates EZH2, Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, bisulfite genomic sequencing and Western blot were performed to evaluate the mechanisms of EZH2 repressing ATOH8.Results:Lnc-PDZD7 is frequently upregulated in HCC tissues. Patients with high Lnc-PDZD7 expression had poorer prognoses and a poor response to adjuvant TACE therapy. Lnc-PDZD7 could promote stemness features and suppress the sensitivity of HCC cells to anticancer drugs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, Lnc-PDZD7 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-101, antagonizing its ability to repress EZH2 expression. Subsequently, EZH2 can further inhibit the expression of the stemness regulator ATOH8 via elevating its H3K27 trimethylation and DNA methylation.Conclusion:Lnc-PDZD7 promotes stemness properties and suppresses chemosensitivity though the miR-101/EZH2/ATOH8 pathway, providing new biomarkers for diagnosis and potential drug targets for HCC.
