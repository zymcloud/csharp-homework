A 78-year-old woman with jaundice was referred to our hospital. On admission, serological testing for viral hepatitis was negative and serum levels of AFP and PIVKA-â…¡ were elevated(925 ng/mL and 6,820 mAU/mL, respectively). Computed tomography revealed a main tumor measuring 3 cm in size at segment 1 of the liver and bile duct tumor thrombus extending to the right hepatic duct. A diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma with a bile duct tumor thrombus was made. After endoscopic biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice and transarterial chemoembolization for the lesions, she underwent left hepatectomy, resection of the caudate lobe, extrahepatic bile duct resection, and cholecystectomy. The hepatic side of the extrahepatic bile duct was transected at the confluence of the right anterior and posterior ducts because invasion of the tumor thrombus to the right hepatic duct was suspected on cholangioscopy. Histological examination revealed the tumor to be a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with bile duct tumor thrombus. Surgical margins were negative, and vascular invasion was not found. She remains alive and well with no evidence of disease 64 months after hepatectomy.
