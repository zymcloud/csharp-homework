Heavy metals are released into the environment through both human and natural sources, may have a direct hepatic toxicity and are involved in chronic liver diseases. Modification in the regulation of heavy metals metabolism enhanced hepatitis c virus (HCV) replication which ultimately reduced outcomes of anti-viral therapy in chronic HCV patients. Chelation therapy with new drugs seems to eradicate HCV and may prevent liver complications. The present study was planned to explore the effects of MiADMSA (lipophilic chelating agent) for achieving maximum heavy metals elimination in hepatitis c virus patients with minimum side effects. For this purpose concentration of heavy metal was determined in HCV patients and established correlation of heavy metals between healthy persons and HCV patients. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) was used to explore them. Concentrations of heavy metal in different samples (blood serum, nails and hair) of patients and healthy individuals. Result revealed that heavy metals (Lead, Cobalt, Cadmium, Manganese, Iron and Cooper) concentration were significantly higher in blood of HCV patients as compared to normal persons, but some metals like Ni and Zn were present in normal concentration and in low concentration respectively. After chelation with monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) a significant amount of heavy metals was excreted in the urine in a dose dependent manner. It was generally observed from the results that TDS is a better treatment option than BD for chelation of heavy metals in hepatitis c virus patients. This chelation therapy will be helpful to reverse the HCV related health problems.
