Background:Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a kind of head-neck malignant neoplasm originated from the nasopharyngeal epithelium and is mainly prevalent in Southern China and Southeast Asia countries. KiSS-1 is an inhibitor of tumor metastasis in a range of cancers.Methods:We establish a cell substrain of SUNE-1-5-8F (NPC cell line from humans) that trsnfected with lentiviral vectors carried with KiSS-1 gene and were selected by puromycin. A transplantation tumor animal model in BALB/c-nu mice was successfully established with a substrain that stably overexpressed KiSS-1.Results:Our result showed that the size of transplantation tumor in the nude mice with KiSS-1 overexpression in transplantation tumor was not difference from the size of transplantation tumor in the controlled transplantation tumor mice. We detected metastatic tumor in lung but not in liver. Moreover, we also found that in the nude mice with KiSS-1 overexpression in transplantation tumor showed extremely fewer metastatic tumor in lung compared with the controlled transplantation tumor mice model. In conclusion, KiSS-1 may be beneficial for the inhibition of metastasis of human NPC.Conclusion:This study may throw light on the treatment of NPC and may help improve the prognosis of patients with NPC.
