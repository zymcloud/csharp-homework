Background: Because of the poor health conditions of elderly patients (age >65) with very-early-stage and early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), primary treatment via hepatic resection (HR), or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) must be considered. However, few studies have examined this issue. Methods: A retrospective cohort was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2004 to 2015. Patients were grouped by tumor size (0-20, 21-30, 31-35, and 31-50 mm) and age (>65 and ≤65). Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were assessed. Results: In total, 1912 patients aged >65 and 2,784 patients aged ≤65 were analyzed after propensity score matching (PSM). For patients >65 with tumors ≤20 mm, OS and DSS did not differ significantly between the RFA and HR groups (p = 0.47 and p = 0.76, respectively). For patients with tumors measuring 21-30 mm, the HR group had better OS and a trend toward better DSS compared with the RFA group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.09, respectively). For patients with tumors measuring 31-50 mm, the HR group had better OS and DSS compared with the RFA group (p < 0.001 for both). For patients <65, the HR group had better OS and DSS compared with the RFA group for all tumor sizes. Conclusions: For elderly patients (age >65), RFA is recommended for tumors ≤20 mm. For patients older than 65 with tumors measuring 21-50 mm and for those younger than 65 with tumors of any size, HR is the better choice.
