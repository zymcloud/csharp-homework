Alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AC) contributes up to 50% of the overall cirrhosis burden in the United States. AC is typically a comorbid condition in association with alcohol-use disorder. AC is often coexistent with other conditions. Several noninvasive methods are available to assist in recognizing the presence of AC. The natural history of AC is governed by the patients continued drinking or abstinence. All treatment starts with abstinence. After decompensation, the progression to acute-on-chronic liver failure heralds death. When patients who have deteriorated are declined liver transplant, palliative care should be considered.
