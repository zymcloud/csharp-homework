Hepatitis is the principal cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and decompensated cirrhosis. HCC is amongst the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Current therapeutic options have proven to be unsuccessful in treating this disease due to multifactorial nature of the disease. The present study was designed to investigate the role of IL-22 mediated survival of hepatocytes during cirrhosis and HCC. Resected/explanted liver tissue samples of patients with End Stage Liver Disease were obtained from Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Liver Transplant Unit of Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Qualitative expression of IL-22, SOCS3, and IL-22 induced anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma extra-large (Bcl-xL), were evaluated by Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC). The IHC analysis revealed significantly high expression of IL-22, SOCS3, and Bcl-xL within explanted livers of HCC patients. Overall, the expression of SOCS3 was higher than any other protein, and the expression of all proteins showed significant variation in different group of patients based on clincopathological features. The results of the current study indicated that IL-22 mediated JAK-STAT pathway i.e. liver regeneration and healing is dependent on the disease progression and type of agent responsible for causing the infection in the first place. However, quantitative analysis of these factors in future can provide further evidence of the role of this pathway in HCC for development of anti-HCC therapies.
