Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare variant of chronic cholecystitis, which can involve adjacent organs including liver, colon and duodenum mimicking gallbladder cancer. Preoperative and intraoperative differentiation of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis from gallbladder cancer is often difficult and the final diagnosis is made on histopathology of the resected specimen. We hereby report four cases of xanthogranulomatous chol ec ystitis w hich were misdiagnosed as cases of advanced gallbladder cancer based on presentation and radiological findings and underwent radical resections but the final histopathology was a diagnostic surprise. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is still a diagnostic challenge as no single modality has been helpful to diagnose this entity till date. Radical resection seems justified in patients who present with the features mimicking gallbladder cancer.
