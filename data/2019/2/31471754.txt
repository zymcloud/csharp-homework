Objectives:To investigate the value of preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for tumor staging and recurrence prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after primary liver transplantation (LT).Methods:This multicenter retrospective study included 122 recipients who underwent living donor LT (LDLT) for untreated HCC and pre-transplant gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI from January 2009 to December 2013. Disease-free survival (DFS) was evaluated. Milan criteria, tumor grade, and microvascular invasion (MVI) were analyzed on the pathological examination of the explanted liver.Results:The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year DFS rates were 93.3%, 90.7%, 88.9%, and 86.1%, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, independent predictors of HCC recurrence were "beyond the Milan criteria" (hazard ratio [HR], 3.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-11.12; p = 0.030) and peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) (HR, 18.30; 95% CI, 4.33-77.34; p Conclusions:Pre-transplant gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI may assist in the HCC recurrence risk prediction.Key points:• Lesions beyond the Milan criteria and peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) were independent predictors of HCC recurrence. • Peritumoral hypointensity on HBP significantly associated with a worse tumor grade and microvascular invasion.
