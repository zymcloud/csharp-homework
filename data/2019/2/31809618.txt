Introduction: The global incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not expected to decline significantly over the next 30 years. And although the latest gene sequencing studies have established its genetic map, the potentially targetable drivers of HCC are, so far, difficult to identify. To date, only seven drugs have been approved by the FDA for unresectable HCC treatment; thus, effective therapeutic breakthroughs are still needed urgently.Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss both genetic and epigenetic alterations in HCC and introduce the current progress with some of the representative molecular targeting inhibitors, listing some of the approved drugs for the targets of HCC. The structure-activity relationship of molecules (e.g. thalidomide, bortezomil) used for HCC is also discussed.Expert opinion: Effective therapeutic targets and effective drugs for HCC treatment are an urgent unmet need. Better understanding and characterization of genetic and epigenetic alterations, which are important to hepatocarcinogenesis, may help to understand the molecular pathogenesis of HCC, as well as provide novel therapeutic lead compounds for HCC treatment.
