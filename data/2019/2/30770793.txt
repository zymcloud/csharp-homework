Notwithstanding the researches on biomarkers and targeted therapies in renal cell carcinomas (RCC) have made progress in the last decades, the application of the biomarkers and targeted therapy agents for RCC in clinic are restricted because of their limitation or side effects. Liver X receptors (LXRs) and the NLRP3 inflammasome have been the research hotspots in recent years. In our study, we integrated bioinformatics analysis, molecular biology experiments and biological function experiments to study the roles of LXRα and the NLRP3 inflammasome in RCC. The study demonstrated that the elevated LXRα expression is correlated with a poor prognosis in RCC. Furthermore, our study revealed the expression levels and roles of the NLRP3 inflammasome in RCC for the first time. This research demonstrated that LXRα could promote the metastasis of RCC cells by suppressing the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In Brief, LXRα had the possibility to be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in renal cell cancer and LXRα could regulate the metastasis of renal cell cancer via NLRP3 inflammamsome.
