miR-130b is a microRNA whose expression is particularly elevated within adipose tissue and in the circulation in diabetic states. Hepatic miR-130b expression has been linked to hepatocellular carcinoma and changes in lipid metabolism. Here, we investigated the role of miR-130b in hepatic lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein export. We observed that overexpression of miR-130b-3p or -5p in HepG2 cells markedly enhanced the secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, enhanced the secretion of [3H]glycerol metabolically labeled triglyceride (TG), and significantly increased the number or the average size of lipid droplets (LDs), respectively. Overexpression of miR-130b also altered the expression of key genes involved in lipid metabolism and in particular markedly increased both mRNA and protein expression levels of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Conversely, the miR-130b inhibitor decreased mRNA levels of MTP and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in HepG2 cells. However, dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that MTP is not a direct target of miR-130b-3p. miR-130b overexpression did not alter de novo synthesized TG or the stability and secretion of apolipoprotein B 100. Interestingly, knockdown of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) blocked the upregulation of MTP mRNA induced by miR-130b. Finally, miR-130b-induced stimulation of VLDL secretion was also observed in a second hepatocyte cell culture model, immortalized human hepatocytes, confirming the effects observed in HepG2 cells. Overall, these data suggest a potential role for miR-130b in promoting hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion mediated by marked stimulation of MTP expression and TG mobilization. Thus miR-130b overexpression corrects the defect in VLDL production in HepG2 cells.
