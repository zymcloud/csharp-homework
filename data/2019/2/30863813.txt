The recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can mainly be divided into two phases or types: the intrahepatic recurrence (IHR) and the extrahepatic recurrence (EHR). Generally speaking, the EHR is usually referenced as being the less common of the two types or categories. In a post-hemihepatectomy patient with routine surveillance at 6 months, it was noted that the patient appeared to have an elevated alpha-fetoprotein, and also complained of vague lower abdominal pain. The accompanying computed tomography scan revealed a 6 cm-sized heterogeneous mass located at the pelvis region. Next, during a laparotomy for resection, the tumor was found to be bleeding from the omental deposition. In conclusion, a high index of suspicion and early surgical intervention can help in detecting possible bleeding extrahepatic recurrence in the background of a patient with history of HCC.
