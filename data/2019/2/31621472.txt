Purpose: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is considered as a prognostic factor in some patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This factor has not been extensively examined in young HCC patients. The objective of this study is to assess whether pre-treatment NLR could predict the survival in young HCC patients implemented minimally invasive treatment. Methods: Young HCC patients treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at our institutes from 2008 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The best cutoff value of NLR was determined with time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The associations between overall survival and various potential risk factors, including tumor size, vascular invasion, hepatitis B virus infection, Child-Pugh scores, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and NLR, were analyzed. Results: Data were collected from 47 HCC patients who were <45 years old (range 30-44). In univariate analysis, vascular invasion (p = 0.001), tumor maximum diameter (p = 0.000), BCLC stage (p = 0.001), HBsAg positive (p = 0.025), AST ≥2 × upper limits of normal (ULN) (p = 0.027), and NLR ≥3.09 (p = 0.027) were predictors for poor survival in young HCC patients treated by TACE combined with RFA. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that except NLR (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.720, 95% CI 0.287-1.808, p = 0.485), tumor maximum diameter ≥5 cm (HR = 0.444, 95% CI 0.199-0.991, p = 0.047) and AST ≥2 × ULN (HR = 4.578, 95% CI 1.544-13.575, p = 0.006) were independent indicators for poor prognosis. Conclusion: Pre-treatment NLR ≥3.09 is related to poor prognosis of young HCC patients implemented minimally invasive treatment. However, it is not an independent indicator for prognosis.
