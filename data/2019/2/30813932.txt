Background:The purpose of this study was to explore trends in incidence, incidence-based (IB) mortality, and survival for combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) utilizing a population-based database to attract people's attention to this disease.Methods:The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was utilized to investigate the incidence and IB mortality for cHCC-CC from 2000 to 2014. Trends in age-adjusted incidence and IB mortality were characterized by the Joinpoint Regression program. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were utilized to implement survival analyses. Cox regression was utilized to estimate independent predictors of mortality.Results:The incidence of cHCC-CC was 0.26 per 1,000,000 individuals in 2000 and 0.59 per 1,000,000 individuals in 2014, with an annual percent change (APC) (i.e., the extent of increase in incidence) of 3.84% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-6.1; P 5 cm (20 vs. 9 months; P Conclusions:We identified an overall steady increase in the incidence of cHCC-CC, which indicates that primary prevention strategies for cHCC-CC have not improved much in recent years and that cHCC-CC needs to be taken seriously.
