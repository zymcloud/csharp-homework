Background:The evidence is conflicting regarding the effect of delays from the time of diagnosis to surgery on the survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We sought to investigate the impact of time to surgery on overall survival for patients who underwent curative resection for primary hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent liver resection for primary hepatocellular carcinoma between the years 2000 and 2015. Using 30-, 60-, and 90-day cutoffs, we investigated the effect of time to surgery on survival outcomes by dichotomizing the patients and using inverse probability of treatment weighting to ensure comparability. We also investigated time to surgery in prognostic subgroups by modeling the statistical interaction between time to surgery and the relevant prognostic variable in multivariable Cox models.Results:A total of 863 patients underwent liver resection for primary hepatocellular carcinoma during the study period. Using 30-, 60-, and 90-day cutoffs, time to surgery did not have a significant bearing on overall survival. For elderly patients (>70 years), patients with Child-Pugh B liver disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists status 2/3, tumor size >5cm, tumor size â‰¥10cm and presence of extrahepatic invasion, hazard ratio decreased and overall survival improved as time to surgery increased. However, for patients with liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension, increasing time to surgery was found to portend higher risks of death.Conclusion:Time to surgery does not have a significant bearing on overall survival, and modest delays even appear to be associated with improved survival in specific subsets of patients. The importance of these findings is that patients with hepatocellular carcinoma should be fully optimized before and not rushed to surgery because of concerns of tumor progression and a diminished survival.
