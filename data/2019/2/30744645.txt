Background:Some studies found out that TC/HDL-C ratio is a predictor of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) is related to CVD. And some researches have already studied that Apolipoprotein B to Apolipoprotein A1 ratio (ApoB/ApoA1) and Triglyceride to High-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) were both related with CVD and NAFLD, but few studied the association between TC/HDL-C ratio and NAFLD. So, we suspected the ratio was also related to NAFLD. The research aims to study the predictive value of TC/HDL-C to NAFLD and to help the early detection of NAFLD.Methods:Based on the Jinchang Cohort, the study contained 32,121 participants. We assessed the incidence of NAFLD by the quartiles of TC, HDL-C and TC/HDL-C. Then, the does-response relationship between these indicators and the risk of NAFLD was obtained. Finally, the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was applied to decide the predictive value of TC/HDL-C.Results:Among the study participants, the cumulative incidence of NAFLD was 6.30% and the rate of dyslipidemia was 40.37%. The biochemical indicators of NAFLD had a difference with general population. The incidence of NAFLD raised with the quartiles of TC, TG and LDL-C raising, while decreased with the HDL-C' quartiles raising. After controlling confounding factors, TC and TC/HD-C had a positive relationship with NAFLD, while HDL-C had the opposite. Finally, the ROC analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of TC/HDL-C (0.645) was greater than TC (0.554), HDL-C (0.627) and Apolipoprotein B to Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) (0.613).Conclusions:The TC/HDL-C ratio has significant predictive value to NAFLD.
