Background:The frontiers in liver transplantation are intrinsically expansions of indications, e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma and (perihilar) cholangiocarcinoma, recipients with more severe concomitant diagnoses or "soft" contraindications and technically demanding reconstruction procedures of vascular structures (for portal vein thrombosis or aorto-hepatic conduits). In addition, an extension of the donor pool with suboptimal donor organs (old donors and steatotic livers) is of interest.Methods:This article presents the current situation based on personal experiences in daily practice and an appropriate literature review.Results:A significant reduction of 1‑year patient survival has been reported in Germany. The percentage of so-called marginal donor organs is inversely proportional to the very low donation rate and parallel to the waiting list mortality. Simultaneously, the proportion of inpatients with multiple organ failure is rising.Conclusion:Results-oriented and controlled liver transplantation currently prohibits making inroads into the previously intrinsic frontiers. As long as the current circumstances do not change, a shift in the intrinsic frontiers of that which is surgically feasible will not be possible. The current situation forces the transplant surgeon to apply a more restrictive indications and organ acceptance policy. With this approach we can try to regain the previously excellent short- and long-term results of a 1‑year survival of 90% and a 20-year survival of 50%.
