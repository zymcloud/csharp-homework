Objective:To identify specific ultrasonographic features that differentiate hepatic angiomyolipoma (HAML) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Twelve patients with HAML and 73 patients with HCC, whose diagnosis were pathologically confirmed at a single center in Japan between 2006 and 2016, were included in this study. The HAML and HCC cases were histologically evaluated and their histological growth patterns were compared. Using ultrasonographic data, we evaluated the imaging features representing the distinct histological differences. Ultrasonographic findings, reviewed by two examiners, were compared via interobserver variability analysis. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee at our institute (No. 2017-1004).Results:The enrolled patients were carefully divided into two case sets: discovery case set (6 HAML patients and 37 HCC patients) and validation case set (6 HAML patients and 36 HCC patients). In the discovery case set, half of the HAML cases had intratumoral regions showing a reticular growth pattern. None of the HCC cases appeared as a region with the reticular growth pattern. The regions with the reticular growth pattern present as an intratumoral hyper echoic foci on ultrasound images. The presence of the intratumoral hyper echoic foci was significantly associated with HAML (P Conclusions:Intratumoral hyper echoic foci, representing reticular growth pattern, can be a promising ultrasonographic finding to help differentiate HAML from HCC.
