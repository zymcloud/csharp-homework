Background:The incidence of hepatobiliary cancer is steadily increasing. It is unclear if this rise is related to increasing trends in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and lifestyle changes.Methods:A case-control study was performed using the Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. Cases with a diagnosis of liver, bile duct, and gallbladder cancers were matched in a 1:2 fashion with controls and analyzed for potential associations between hepatobiliary cancer and obesity/metabolic syndrome.Results:Four thousand two hundred and eighty-seven patients (62% male, 38% female) with hepatobiliary cancers were matched with 8574 controls. On univariate analysis, body mass index (BMI), smoking, diabetes, alcohol consumption, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension were associated with hepatobiliary cancer. Statin use and non-smoking status had an inverse association. On multivariate analysis, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and insulin use were associated with the risk of hepatobiliary cancer. Statin use and non-smoking status were protective. On modeling BMI, each of diabetes and hypertension as a single covariate, there was a significant association with hepatobiliary cancer (1.59 [1.49-1.69], p Conclusions:Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with the risk of hepatobiliary cancer. Statin use seems to be protective.
