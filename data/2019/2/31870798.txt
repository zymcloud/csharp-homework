Oxidative stress resistance in cancer cells has contributed to multi-drug resistance, which poses a serious challenge to cancer therapy. To surmount this, combinatorial treatment involving anticancer drugs and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have emerged as a chemotherapeutic option. Yet, HDACi's role in redox states of cancer cells still requires elucidation. In the present study, we hypothesized that HDACi sensitizes cancer cells to oxidative stress and results in G2/M cell cycle arrest. Cell viability and cell cycle were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), respectively. The transcriptomes of cells were investigated by massive analysis of cDNA end (MACE). Expression of mRNA and proteins were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. Intracellular oxidative stress induced by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) reduced cell viability and resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The effects of sorafenib on cell cycle arrest and HCC viability were enhanced through HDACi treatment. MACE revealed that genes related to progression of G2/M cell cycle including Foxm1, Aurka, Plk1, and Ccnb1 were significantly down-regulated in tBHP and HDACi-treated HepG2 cells. Inhibition of FOXM1 with thiostrepton also resulted in reduced cell viability and expression of FOXM1 target genes such as Aurka, Plk1, and Ccnb1. These results indicate that HDACi sensitizes HepG2 cells to oxidative stress and results in G2/M cell cycle arrest via down-regulation of FOXM1, which plays a key role in progression of G2/M cell cycle.
