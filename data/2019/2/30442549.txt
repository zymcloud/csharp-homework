Background:Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare primary liver malignancy. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence available on the long-term outcomes of cHCC-CC patients after either hepatectomy or liver transplantation (LT).Data sources:Relevant studies published between January 2000 and January 2018 were identified by searching PubMed and Embase and reviewed systematically. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.Results:A total of 42 observational studies involving 1691 patients (1390 for partial hepatectomy and 301 for LT) were included in the analysis. The median tumor recurrence and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 65% (range 38%-100%) and 29% (range 0-63%) after hepatectomy versus 54% (range 14%-93%) and 41% (range 16%-73%) after LT, respectively. Meta-analysis found no significant difference in OS and tumor recurrence between LT and hepatectomy groups.Conclusion:Hepatectomy rather than LT should be considered as the prior treatment option for cHCC-CC.
