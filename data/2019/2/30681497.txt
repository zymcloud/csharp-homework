Background:The clinical trials emerged centromere protein E inhibitor GSK923295 as a promising anticancer drug, but its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain needs to be fully elucidated, especially as chemotherapy after hepatectomy for liver tumors. We aimed to describe anti-HCC activities of GSK923295 and compare its antiproliferative effects on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH).Methods:All subjects were randomized to treatment with either vehicle or GSK923295. Antitumor activity of GSK923295 was assessed by xenograft growth assays. The C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 70% PH and the proliferation was calculated by liver coefficient, further confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The proliferation and cell cycle analysis of liver cell AML12 and HCC cells LM3, HUH7, and HepG2 were investigated using the cell counting kit-8 assay and Flow Cytometry. The chromosome misalignment and segregation in AML12 cells were visualized by immunofluorescence.Results:Treatment with GSK923295 induced antiproliferation in HCC cell lines. It also caused delay on HCC tumor growth instead of regression both in a HCC cell line xenograft model and patient-derived tumor xenograft model. With microarray analysis, CENtromere Protein E was gradually increased in mouse liver after PH. Exposure of liver cells to GSK923295 resulted in delay on a cell cycle in mitosis with a phenotype of misaligned chromosomes and chromosomes clustered. In 70% PH mouse model, GSK923295 treatment also remarkably reduced liver regeneration in later stage, in parallel with the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 elevation.Conclusion:The anticancer drug GSK923295 causes a significant delay on HCC tumor growth and liver regeneration after PH in later stage.
