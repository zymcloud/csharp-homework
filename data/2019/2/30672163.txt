Objective:According to the current guidelines, arterial hyperenhancement for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is determined using the arterial phase only. We investigated the optimal definition of arterial hyperenhancement in patients with HCC using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Materials and methods:The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study. The requirement for informed consent was waived. Between January 2011 and September 2013, 147 consecutive patients with surgically proven HCCs with both pre-operative CT and MRI were included. Identification rates of arterial hyperenhancement on CT and magnetic resonance (MR) images using arterial phase only, dual phase (unenhanced and arterial phases), and also subtraction MR images were assessed qualitatively.Results:The identification rates for arterial hyperenhancement on CT were significantly different between arterial phase and dual phase (72.8% vs. 90.5%; p < 0.001), whereas the rates were similar on MRI (91.8% vs. 93.9%; p = 0.257). The identification rate of arterial hyperenhancement in MRI increased to 98.6% using subtraction MR images.Conclusion:Visual comparison of arterial and unenhanced phases could be recommended instead of conventional qualitative arterial phase alone assessment to determine arterial hyperenhancement of HCCs, especially when using CT.
