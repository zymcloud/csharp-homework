Background and aims:This study was performed to evaluate the treatment efficacy of endoscopic variceal obturation (EVO) in patients with gastric variceal bleeding (GVB) according to the type of varices.Patients and methods:All patients who were treated with EVO for bleeding from gastric varices (GVs) were included. Patients with a previous history of endoscopic treatment for GVB and those with accompanying portal vein invasion by hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignancy were excluded.Results:Ninety-one patients with GVB were included. Mean age was 59.4Â±12.4 years and 72 (79.1%) patients were men. The types of varices were gastroesophageal varices (GOV) type 1 (GOV1), GOV2, and isolated gastric varices type 1 (IGV1) in 30 (33.3%), 35 (38.5%), and 26 (28.6%) patients, respectively. Hemostasis and GV obliteration were achieved in 88 (96.7%) and 81 (89.0%) patients, respectively. Among 81 patients with GV obliteration, GV recurred in 26 (32.1%) patients. The GV recurrence rate was significantly lower in patients with GOV1 than in those with GOV2 (P=0.007), while it was comparable between patients with GOV1 and IGV1 (P=0.111) and between patients with GOV2 and IGV1 (P=0.278). Variceal rebleeding occurred in 11 (13.6%) patients. GVB recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with GOV2 than in those with GOV1 (P=0.034) and IGV1 (P=0.018), while it was comparable between patients with GOV1 and IGV1 (P=0.623). Mortality rate was comparable among the three groups.Conclusions:EVO was very effective in patients with GVB. GV recurrence and GV rebleeding were significantly lower in patients with GOV1 than in those with GOV2.
