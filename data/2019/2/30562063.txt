This study aimed to examine the expression level and clinical significance of chemokine-like factor-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing family member 6 (CMTM6) in paired hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent nontumor tissues. The expression of CMTM6 was detected in 75 paired HCC and adjacent nontumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Chi-square test was used to compare the difference of CMTM6 expression between HCC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues. The clinic-pathological features and prognosis of HCC patients were collected to analyze the relationship with CMTM6 expression. The positive expression of CMTM6 in HCC tissues was significantly lower than that of adjacent nontumor tissues. The difference of CMTM6 expression between HCC tissues and paired adjacent nontumor tissues was statistically significant (p
