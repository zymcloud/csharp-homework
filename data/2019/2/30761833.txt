Background/aim:In immunosuppressed patients, strongyloidiasis can be lifethreatening because of hyperinfection or dissemination. Therefore, diagnosis of S. stercoralis is important in immunosuppressed patients with chronic strongyloidiasis. In this study, our objective was to investigate the presence of S. stercoralis antibodies by an ELISA method in immunosuppressed patients.Materials and methods:A total of 100 immunosuppressed patientsâ€™ sera were included in the study. Forty-two of the patients were receiving immunosuppressive therapies for cancer or being treated for hematopoietic malignancies, 38 of the patients were receiving immunosuppressive drugs for rheumatic diseases, 14 were receiving immunosuppressive therapies for liver transplantation. Two of the patients were being treated for HIV infection and 4 were being treated for hypogammaglobulinemia. As control group, 50 individuals without a known disease were included in the study. The presence of IgG antibodies against S. stercoralis was investigated with a commercial ELISA kit.Results:S. stercoralis antibody test was positive in 4 of 100 (4%) sera from immunosuppressed patients. All control patients were negative for S. stercoralis.Conclusions:Strongyloidiasis can be a lifelong chronic infection if not treated. In patients who are going to receive immunosuppressive therapy, it should be tested before treatment, as it can become a disseminated and life-threatening infectious disease.
