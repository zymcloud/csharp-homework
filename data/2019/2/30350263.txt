A lentivirus-mediated doxycycline-inducible pTRIPZ shRNAmir plasmid targeting IGF1R transcript was transfected into two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines to silence IGF1R expression and to assess the effect of its downregulation on cisplatin sensitivity in vitro. In Cal27-regIGF1R and SCC25-regIGF1R cell lines, IGF1R protein expression was reduced by more than 90% after 72 h of incubation with doxycycline. Both basal and IGF-stimulated pIGF1R, pAKT, and pERK were significantly reduced, without influence on total AKT and ERK expression. Downregulation of the IGF1R was associated with decreased proliferation and cell viability in both cell lines. Reduced IGF1R expression was also associated with increased sub-G0/G1-phase and G0/G1-phase populations and decreased S-phase and G2/M-phase populations. IGF1R downregulation enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin with decrease of cisplatin IC50 from 15 to 7.1 in Cal27-regIGF1R cells and from 11 to 6.3 in SCC25-regIGF1R cells. Cisplatin exhibited increased pro-apoptotic activity by annexin V staining and PARP cleavage in both cells lines when cultured in doxycycline. Thus, in two HNSCC cell lines in vitro, reduced IGF1R expression results in reduced growth rate and increased sensitivity to cisplatin. Thus, IGF1R downregulation and/or inhibition may serve as a useful adjunct to platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy.
