Purpose:To investigate the role of early overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) as a clinical marker of prognosis in cirrhosis with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and to assess the relationship between recurrence of OHE and survival after TIPS.Methods:From January 2012 to December 2013, a retrospective study of consecutive patients with cirrhosis and a TIPS was performed at a single institution. A total of 304 patients (196 males; mean age, 52 years) were enrolled during the study period. The mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 11.6. Time-dependent Cox regression was applied to estimate the predictive ability of early OHE (within 3 months after TIPS) and the effect of its frequency on survival.Results:During a median follow-up of 28.3 months, 115 patients experienced OHE after the TIPS procedure; of these, 54 had at least 2 OHE episodes. Long-term survival worsened in patients with early OHE (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.75-4.32; P < .001). When early OHE was further divided into early-recurrent and single OHE, death was more common in patients with early-recurrent OHE (P < .001) than in patients with early-single OHE (P = .24). After adjustment by MELD score, ascites, serum albumin, indication for TIPS, and age, patients with early-recurrent OHE had a lower probability of survival (HR = 2.91; 95% CI: 1.04-4.89; P < .001). Furthermore, landmark and propensity score analyses confirmed the predictive value of early-recurrent OHE.Conclusions:Early recurrence of OHE was associated with an increased risk of mortality for patients with cirrhosis who underwent TIPS.
