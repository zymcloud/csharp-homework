Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant tumors of liver. Rational treatment in early stage of HCC can significantly increase the survival rate of patients. Detection of early-stage liver lesions through diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging, incoherent motion within voxels, magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, or other functional imaging can accurately evaluate grade of malignancy and guide towards the curative effect of different treatment schemes. Volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) with three techniques, namely, CAIPIRINHA, Dixon, and TWIST, i.e., CDT-VIBE sequence can provide multiple sets of arterial phase images in a short time, and detect small foci transient enhancement that cannot be detected by other examinations, and the differences in initial enhancement phase of apparent lesions are of great significance for suggesting hemodynamic characteristics. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging predicts microvascular invasion of HCC, i.e., indirectly predicts HCC lesions recurrence rate, and overall survival time after liver transplantation. This article reviews the current research progress of magnetic resonance imaging technology in HCC.
