The gender disparity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is most striking in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cases. The majority of such HCC cases contain integrated HBV, and some hotspot integrations, such as those in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) promoter, activate gene expression to drive carcinogenesis. As the HBV genome contains both androgen-responsive and estrogen-responsive motifs, we hypothesized that the integrated HBV DNA renders a similar regulation for downstream gene expression and thus contributes to male susceptibility to HCC. To test this hypothesis, the HBV integration sites and the common mutations in the TERT promoter and tumor protein P53 (TP53) coding region were analyzed in 101 HBV-related HCC cases using a capture-next-generation sequencing platform. The results showed that both HBV integration and -124G>A mutation in the TERT promoter region, occurring in a mutually exclusive manner, were more frequent in male than in female patients with HCC (integration: 22/58 male patients with HCC, 6/36 female patients with HCC, P = 0.0285; -124G>A: 17/62 male patients with HCC, 3/39 female patients with HCC, P = 0.0201; in combination, 39/62 male patients with HCC, 9/39 female patients with HCC, P
