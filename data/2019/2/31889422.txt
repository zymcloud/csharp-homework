The purpose of this work was to determine the actual dose received by normal tissues during four-dimensional radiation therapy (4DRT) composed of ten phases of four-dimensional computer tomography (4DCT) images. The analysis was performed by tracking the hepatocellular carcinoma SBRT. Data were acquired from the tracking of each phase with the beam aperture for 28 hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and the data were used to generate a cumulative plan, which was compared to a three-dimensional (3D) plan formed from a merged target volume based on 4DCT images in a radiation treatment planning system (TPS). The change in normal tissue dose was evaluated in the plan using the parameters V5, V10, V15, V20, V25, V30, V35, and V40 (volumes receiving 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 Gy, respectively) in the dose-volume histogram for the liver; the mean dose was analyzed for the following tissues: liver, left kidney, and right kidney. The maximum dose was analyzed for the following tissues: bowel, duodenum, esophagus, stomach, and heart. There was a significant difference in the dose between the 4D planning target volume (PTV) (average 115.71 cm3 ) and ITV (169.86 cm3 ). The planning objective was for 95% of the volume of the PTV to be covered by the prescription dose, but the mean dose for the liver, left kidney and right kidney had an average decrease of 23.13%, 49.51%, and 54.38%, respectively. The maximum dose for the bowel, duodenum, esophagus, stomach, and heart had an average decrease of 16.77%, 28.07%, 24.28%, 4.89%, and 4.45%, respectively. Compared to 3D RT, the radiation volume for the liver V5, V10, V15, V20, V25, V30, V35, and V40 using the 4D plans had a significant decrease (P ï¹¤ 0.05). The 4D method creates plans that permit sparing of the normal tissues more than the commonly used ITV method, which delivers the same dosimetric effects to the target.
