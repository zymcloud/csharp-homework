The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of 128-slice spiral CT combined with virtual colonoscopy in diagnosis of colorectal cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 45 patients of colorectal diseases who underwent definition AS+128-slice spiral CT combined with virtual colonoscopy after bowel preparation and gas injection to evaluate the clinical diagnostic value of this technology. All the patients received electronic colonoscopy and were confirmed by pathology. In total, colorectal cancer was confirmed in 42 cases and inflammation in 3 cases. Diagnostic results shows: there were 17 cases of lump, 10 cases of infiltration, 6 cases of ulcer, 9 cases of mixed type, 4 cases of liver metastases, and 36 cases of lymph node metastasis. There was no significant difference between 128-slice spiral CT combined with virtual colonoscopy and electronic colonoscopy in detection, localization and characterization of colorectal tumors. CT virtual endoscopy has great advantages in observing the invasion around the lesion and the presence or absence of metastasis in distant organs and lymph node metastasis. It is also possible to understand the shape of the lesion in the intestinal lumen and the length of the lesion involving the lumen of the intestine.
