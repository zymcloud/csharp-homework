Purpose:To investigate the efficacy of radiation dose escalation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after incomplete transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:This study evaluated retrospective data of 323 HCC patients who received radiotherapy after incomplete TACE from 2001-2016. Radiation dose in biologically effective dose (BED) (α/β = 10) was categorized as Results:Median follow-up time for patients who were alive at the time of analysis was 47 months (range 18-189 months). Median overall survival after radiotherapy was 14 months. In multivariate analysis, BED ≥72 Gy was an independent predictor of favorable LFFR (hazard ratio [HR] 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14-0.72; P = 0.006) and PFR (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.98; P = 0.04). In the propensity score-matched cohort (62 pairs), 1‑year LFFR (94% vs. 81%; P = 0.002), and 1‑year PFR (49% vs. 42%; P = 0.01) were significantly higher in the high-dose group. Treatment-related toxicities were comparable between the high-dose and low-dose groups (classic radiation-induced liver disease: 5.3% [3/57] vs. 13.8% [29/210], P = 0.08; grade 2-4 gastrointestinal bleeding: 3.2% [2/62] vs. 7.3% [19/261], P = 0.39).Conclusion:Radiation dose with BED ≥72 Gy improved LFFR and PFR without increasing toxicity. In radiotherapy for incomplete TACE of HCC, dose escalation using SIB-IMRT should be actively considered to improve oncologic outcome.
