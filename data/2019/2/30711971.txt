Background:The aim of this study was to verify the significance of high Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with low AFP.Materials and methods:There were 283 patients with low AFP who underwent initial hepatic resection with or without radiofrequency ablation for HCC. Patients were divided into two groups based on AFP-L3 values: >10%: high AFP-L3 (n=24); and ≤10%: low AFP-L3 (n=259). Overall survival (OS) and 2-year recurrence rates were compared, and independent prognostic factors were identified.Results:The OS and 2-year recurrence rates of the high AFP-L3 group were significantly worse than those of the low AFP-L3 group. The independent prognostic factors for poor OS were des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) of >40 mAU/ml, microvascular invasion, and invasive growth, and those for 2-year recurrence were 99mTc-galactosyl human serum albumin uptake ratio of <0.90, DCP of >40 mAU/ml, multiple tumors, microvascular invasion, and poor differentiation. DCP levels increased with AFP-L3, and cases with high DCP and AFP-L3 had worse prognoses and higher 2-year recurrence rates compared to those with elevation of only one of these.Conclusion:Patients with high AFP-L3 but low AFP have poor prognosis and high 2-year recurrence rates. DCP strongly reflects HCC malignancy in patients with low AFP.
