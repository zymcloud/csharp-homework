The coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a tumor suppressor, is vital for the effectiveness of therapies which utilize the adenovirus. However, studies on CAR expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are conflicting and its clinical significance requires exploration. In this study, immunohistochemistry has been carried out on tissue microarrays consisting of 198 pairs of HCC and neighboring healthy tissue specimens from Chinese Han patients to evaluate CAR expression. Relative to normal tissues, decreased CAR expression (56% vs. 57%; P>0.05) was detected in HCC samples. CAR immunopositivity in tumors was not dependent upon sex, age, tumor dimensions, differentiation, TNM stage or metastasis in HCC patients; however, positive expression was observed in 56% of the samples from patients with hepatic metastasis, which was the same as those devoid of metastasis (56%; P=0.042). Furthermore, survival analysis confirmed that the expression of CAR revealed no correlation with the prognosis. It was established that CAR exerted complex effects during liver tumorigenesis, potentially based on the stage of the cancer. Therefore, CAR expression analysis has to be carried out prior to adenoviral oncolytic therapy to stratify the patients.
