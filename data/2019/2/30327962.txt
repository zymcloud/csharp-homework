Background:Traditionally in Asia, hepatitis B (HBV) accounts for the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but increasingly, non-viral or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) etiology may play a more prominent role with current socioeconomic changes. There remains a paucity in data comparing NASH-HCC to HBV-related HCC. In this study, we explored the differences in clinical characteristics between HBV- and cryptogenic-related HCC.Methods:Patients with HCC seen in the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Singapore General Hospital were enrolled in an ongoing database since 1980. Patients with HCC attributed to HBV or cryptogenic etiology were identified. Comparison of clinical characteristics was performed between the two groups.Results:There were 916 HBV-HCC patients and 163 cryptogenic HCC patients, accounting for 70.9% and 12.6% of the total HCC cases (1292 patients), respectively. Out of the total cohort enrolled from 1980 to 2005, the ratio of cryptogenic to HBV patients was 1:6.7, while from 2006 to the current year, the ratio of cryptogenic to HBV patients has increased significantly to 1:3.9. Relative to patients with HBV, cryptogenic HCC patients were older (67.6 vs. 59.4 years old; p Conclusion:Temporal trends suggest that HCC attributed to HBV is on the decline, while cryptogenic- or NASH-related HCC is an emerging clinical entity. A paradigm shift in approach to screening, surveillance, and management of HCC may be required in view of the changing landscape of HCC epidemiology into an increasing non-viral etiology.
