The increasing application of nanomaterials in various fields such as drug delivery, cosmetics, disease detection, cancer treatment, food preservation etc. has resulted in high levels of engineered nanoparticles in the environment, thus leading to higher possibility of direct or indirect interactions between these particles and biological systems. In this study, the toxic effects of three commercially available nanomaterials; copper oxide nanoparticles, copper-iron oxide nanopowders and carbon nanopowders were determined in the human hepatoma HepG2 cells using various toxicological assays which are indicative of cytotoxicity (MTT and neutral red assays), mutagenicity (cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay), oxidative stress (total reactive oxygen species and superoxide anion production) and mitochondrial impairment (cellular oxygen consumption). There was increased cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and mitochondrial impairment in the cells treated with higher concentrations of the nanomaterials, especially the copper oxide nanoparticles. The fold production of reactive oxygen species was similar at the concentrations tested in this study but longer exposure duration resulted in production of more superoxide anions. The results of this study showed that copper oxide nanoparticles are highly toxic to the human HepG2 cells, thus implying that the liver is a target organ in human for copper oxide nanoparticles toxicity.
