Lenvatinib is a type I tyrosine kinase inhibitor exhibiting powerful antiangiogenic activity in cancer therapy. Displaying activity in multiple solid tumors, it has been approved in differentiated thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma as single agent or in combination. In addition, lenvatinib has shown promise in several other tumor types including medullary, anaplastic thyroid, adenoid cystic, and endometrial cancer. Exploring synergy between angiogenic and immune checkpoint inhibitors, the lenvatinib/pembrolizumab combination is poised to become the next pair of active drugs in endometrial, lung, and gastrointestinal malignancies. Despite robust activity, the drug can be difficult to tolerate. Optimization of dose and biomarkers for prediction of efficacy and toxicities will be of great help. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Readers will be presented with an update on U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of lenvatinib and suggestions for off-label use in thyroid cancer and adenoid cystic carcinomas. They will become familiarized with the common side effects, frequency, and predicators of response. In addition, they will learn that different strengths of lenvatinib are prescribed and why. Finally, readers are pointed to the latest efforts to combine lenvatinib and pembrolizumab, as well as to unresolved issues such as long-term side effects/toxicities of this drug.
