Background:Little is known about the value of sequential transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and portal vein embolization compared with portal vein embolization alone before major hepatectomy for large hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to compare early and long-term outcomes of these two strategies.Methods:We included all consecutive patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (â‰¥50 mm) scheduled for sequential transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and portal vein embolization or portal vein embolization alone before major hepatectomy from January 2005 to December 2015. Comparisons were made on an intent-to-treat basis.Results:A total of 55 patients were included as follows: sequential transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and portal vein embolization (n = 27) and portal vein embolization alone (n = 28). Baseline patient and tumor characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. Downstaging after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization changed the initial strategy in 4 patients who finally underwent liver transplant (n = 1) and limited hepatectomy (n = 3). Overall survival and progression-free survival were better in the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization group compared with the portal vein embolization alone group (3-year overall survival of 60% vs 20%; P = .01 and 3-year progression-free survival of 35% vs 0%; P Conclusion:Our results suggest that transcatheter arterial chemoembolization before portal vein embolization increases the degree of hypertrophy of the future remnant liver after portal vein embolization and yields improved oncologic outcomes in patients with large hepatocellular carcinomas planned for major hepatectomy.
