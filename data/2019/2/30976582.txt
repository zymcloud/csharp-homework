Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is notoriously refractory to systemic chemotherapy, mandating an interventional approach. Mortality may be avoided by neutralizing rapidly growing tumors that approach the heart and major vessels. When the risk/benefit ratio of surgery is unacceptable, percutaneous ablation can achieve remarkable results. High volumes of flowing blood adjacent to the treatment area may impact the ability to reliably achieve an adequate ablation margin for modalities that rely on extreme temperatures to destroy malignant cells. Ethanol ablation is safe, efficacious, and unaffected by this "thermal sink" effect. This report describes a juxta-cardiac (JC) HCC in segment 4a measuring 35 × 26 mm, which exhibited rapid growth until it was abutting the pericardium and 7.5 mm from the chamber of the right ventricle (RV).Methods:One 21-gauge needle was inserted using direct CT fluoroscopy into the center of the hepatic mass. In order to confirm the position of the needle, 0.5 mL of diluted Visipaque was injected. Then, under CT fluoroscopy guidance, a mixture of 1 mL of Ethiodol and 10 mL of 98% dehydrated alcohol was slowly injected into the mass.Results:Repeat CT scan 1 month post-ablation demonstrated decreased arterial enhancement and dense Ethiodol throughout the tumor consistent with ablation. Tumor size decreased to 30 × 23 mm with a distance of 12.4 mm from the chamber of the RV.Conclusion:Pericardial involvement or large vessels near the treatment area may limit the use of thermal ablation techniques for JC HCC. Percutaneous, intratumoral ethanol injection provides safe and effective alternative that is not subject to the "thermal sink" effect.
