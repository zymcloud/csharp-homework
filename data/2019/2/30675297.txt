MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve an important regulatory role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Aberrant expression of miR-197-3p has been reported in various human malignancies. However, the role of miR-197-3p in the progression and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The present study demonstrated that miR-197-3p was downregulated in HCC tissues and that the low level of miR-197-3p expression in HCC tumours correlated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics; thus, miR-197-3p may serve as a predictor for poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Additionally, miR-197-3p markedly inhibited the metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis further identified zinc finger protein interacted with K protein 1 (ZIK1) as a novel target of miR-197-3p in HCC cells. These findings suggest that miR-197-3p may regulate the survival of HCC cells, partially through the downregulation of ZIK1. Therefore, the miR-197-3p/ZIK1 axis may serve as a novel therapeutic target in patients with HCC.
