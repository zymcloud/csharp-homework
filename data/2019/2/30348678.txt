Background:We investigated the epidemiologic characteristics of childhood brain tumors (CBT) in Korea, and compared our findings with those from the United States.Methods:We searched the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database of the Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR) from 2005 to 2014, which included all Korean patients with CBT aged 0 to 19 years at diagnosis. The age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) and the 5-year relative survival rate (RSR) were determined. The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) classification and definitions were applied to allow direct comparison with U.S.Results:A total of 6,027 CBTs were identified. The ASR of all CBTs was 5.08 per 100,000 population, which was significantly lower than that in the United States (5.57). However, the ASR of nonmalignant CBTs in Korea (2.48) was significantly higher than that in the United States (2.15). Embryonal tumors (ASR: 0.99 and 0.72 in the 0-4 and 5-9 year age groups, respectively) were the most common CBTs in these respective age groups. Germ cell tumors (0.78) and pituitary tumors (1.63) were the most common CBTs in the 10-14 and 15-19 year age groups, respectively. The 5-year RSR of CBTs was 84% and varied according to histology.Conclusions:High incidences of nonmalignant and germ cell tumors are distinct CBT features in Korean children and adolescents.Impact:To our knowledge, this is the first and largest population-based epidemiologic study of CBTs in Asia. Our findings support the notion that East Asian populations have a higher incidence of central nervous system germ cell tumors than other races.
