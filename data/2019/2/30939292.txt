The PD1 (rs2227982, rs41386349, rs6710479, rs7421861, and rs7565639) and TIM3 (rs11134551, rs11742259, rs246871, rs25855, and rs31223) polymorphisms were examined in 362 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, 91 HBV infection resolvers, and 158 healthy controls. Univariate logistic regression was carried out by SNPstats to detect the associations. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis was performed to explore interactions between PD1 and TIM3 polymorphisms. Associations of polymorphisms with clinical disease were also evaluated. Compared with patients with chronic HBV infection and healthy controls, HBV infection resolvers had a lower frequency of PD1 rs41386349 allele A, higher frequency of PD1 rs6710479 allele C, and higher frequency of TIM3 rs246871 genotypes TC and TC + CC. A best MDR model composed of PD1 rs2227982, rs41386349, and rs7421861, and TIM3 rs11134551, rs11742259, rs246871, rs25855, and rs31223 was observed between patients with chronic HBV infection and HBV infection resolvers (maximum testing balance accuracy, 0.5803; maximum cross-validation consistency, 9/10; P = 0.0010). PD1 rs2227982, rs6710479, and rs7421861 were associated with a higher hepatocellular carcinoma risk. These findings suggest that PD1 rs41386349 and rs6710479 and TIM3 rs246871 and interactions between PD1 and TIM3 polymorphisms may affect the susceptibility of chronic HBV infection and PD1 rs2227982, rs6710479, and rs7421861 may implicate in hepatocarcinogenesis.
