Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease mediated by immunity, and could lead to liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms for breaking hepatic tolerance and driving AIH still remain elusive. We herein reported that the non-specific liver inflammation triggered by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) recruited high numbers of CD4+T, CD8+T and B cells, and elevated the expression of proinflammaitory cytokines in Balb/c mice, further breaking liver tolerance and inducing autoimmune response, AIH inflammation and liver fibrosis in the presence of CYP2D6 antigen mimicry. In contrast, adenovirus infection could not break liver tolerance and induce AIH in Balb/c mice even in the presence of CYP2D6 antigen mimicry. These results suggested that genetic predisposition could determine liver tolerance in Balb/c mice. The chemical induced inflammation in the liver breaks tolerance and might be considered important for the initiation and development of AIH in Balb/c mice.
