Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in adults. Basic leucine zipper and W2 domains 2 (BZW2) is a member of the basic-region leucine zipper (bZIP) superfamily of transcription factors. Here, we found that BZW2 expression was substantially increased in both human HCC tissues and cell lines, which was correlated with the clinical progression of patients with HCC. Silence of BZW2 in HCC cells by infecting with the lentivirus for delivering BZW2 shRNA (short hairpin RNA), prohibits cell progression, as determined by the suppressed cell proliferation, clonality, invasion, and increased cell apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of BZW2 promotes drug resistance of HCC cells, as shown by the attenuated suppression of cell viability and invasion following rapamycin (RAPA) treatment. Mechanistically, overexpression (or silence) of BZW2 in HCC cells significantly stimulates (or decreases) the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is responsible for HCC progression. Thus, increased BZW2 expression in HCC can induce HCC progression and drug resistance via stimulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which may represent a new therapeutic target for HCC.
