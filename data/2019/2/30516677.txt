A 57-year-old man was referred to our institution for F-fluorocholine PET/CT to characterize a pulmonary nodule in a context of hepatocellular carcinoma. F-FDG PET/CT did not show any uptake of the pulmonary nodule. F-fluorocholine PET/CT showed high uptake of the pulmonary nodule, confirming its metastatic origin. Furthermore, liver early dynamic acquisitions allowed better visualization of the hepatocellular carcinoma during the "arterial phase" than at equilibrium.
