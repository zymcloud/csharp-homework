Purpose:Guatemala has the highest mortality and incidence of liver cancer in Central and South America. The aim of this study is to describe the extent of liver cancer in the country from 2012 to 2016 and the associated risk factors.Methods:A secondary analysis was performed using liver cancer mortality and morbidity data and data on risk factors, such as hepatitis B virus infection, cirrhosis, and alcoholism.Results:Analysis revealed that liver cancer causes approximately 20% of cancer deaths in the country, is more frequent in the population older than age 65 years old, and is increasing in those age 30 to 44 years. More than 25% of deaths occurred in the North and West regions. The incidence of major risk factors for development of liver cancer has decreased.Conclusion:The high mortality of liver cancer compared with its incidence indicates that most patients are diagnosed at late stages. To reduce the burden of liver cancer, creation of strategies for earlier detection is needed.
