Background & aims:Long noncoding RNA 91H is transcribed from the H19/IGF2 locus and contributes to the development of breast and oesophagus cancers by regulating the expression of IGF2, but the regulation mechanism remains poorly characterized. Here, we explored the role of 91H in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the mechanism of IGF2 expression regulation by 91H.Methods:Firstly, the expression of 91H was analysed in HCC by quantitative RT-PCR, the association of 91H with survival was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the effect of 91H on the growth and invasion of HCC was investigated by the in vitro and in vivo studies. Then, the association of 91H with the expression of IGF2 was evaluated in HCC tissues, and the effect of 91H on the expression of IGF2 was investigated by 91H knockdown. Finally, the binding of RBBP5 to 91H and the binding of RBBP5, activating H3K4me3 mark and repressive H3K27me3 mark to the P3 and P4 promoters of IGF2 gene were studied by RIP and ChIP respectively.Results:The overexpression of 91H was found in HCC and in association with the growth, metastasis and shorter survival time of HCC. The knockdown of 91H down-regulated the IGF2 expression in HCC, and the mechanism was correlated with the decreased enrichment of RBBP5 and H3K4me3 and increased enrichment of H3K27me3 at the bivalent P3 and P4 promoters.Conclusions:The overexpression of 91H promotes tumour growth and metastasis, and is associated with a poor prognosis of HCC at least partially by positively regulating the expression of IGF2 through bivalent histone modification changes characterized by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at the P3 and P4 promoters.
