Objectives:To explore the noninvasive prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with progenitor phenotype based on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods:This retrospective study included 115 surgery-proven HCCs with preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI from August 2015 to September 2018. Image features were reviewed. Quantitative image analysis was performed using histogram analysis. HCC with progenitor phenotype was defined as positive for either cytokeratin 19 (CK19) or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression. Statistically significant variables for identifying HCCs with progenitor phenotype were determined at multivariate analyses. ROC analyses were used to determined cutoff values and the diagnostic performance of significant variables and combinations. Prediction nomogram was constructed based on multivariate analysis.Results:At multivariate regression analyses, AFP ≥ 155.25 ng/mL (p Conclusions:Noninvasive prediction of HCCs with progenitor phenotype can be achieved with high accuracy by integrated interpretation of biochemical and radiological information, representing a handy tool for precise patient management and the prediction of prognosis.Key points:• Qualitative image features of irregular tumor margin, targetoid appearance, and the absence of mosaic architecture are significant predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma with progenitor phenotype. • Quantitative analyses using whole-lesion histogram analysis provides additional information for the prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma with progenitor phenotype. • Noninvasive prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma with progenitor phenotype can be achieved with high accuracy by integrated interpretation of clinical information and qualitative and quantitative imaging analyses.
