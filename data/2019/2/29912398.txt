Background:Recent advancements have aimed to optimize visualization and minimize insult to healthy cortical and subcortical tissue through the use of tubular-based retractors.Objective:To investigate outcomes following resection of cerebral metastases using an integrated tubular retraction system with an exoscope and neuronavigation.Methods:A multicenter retrospective analysis of surgical outcomes in consecutive patients who underwent resection of a brain metastasis using a tubular retraction system and exoscope was performed.Results:Twenty-five patients were included, with a mean age of 61 yr (24-81 yr). Primary sources included lung (n = 13), breast (n = 3), renal cell (n = 3), and other (n = 6). Locations were frontal (n = 5), parietal (n = 8), cerebellar (n = 8), occipital (n = 3), and splenium (n = 1). Most lesions had a maximum diameter > 3.0 cm (n = 20) and a tumor depth > 4 cm (n = 14). Conversion to open (microscopic) craniotomy was not required in any case. Gross total resection was achieved in 20 cases (80.0%) and subtotal resection in 5 cases (20.0%). Median hospital stay was 2 d (1-12 d). All patients underwent postoperative radiation therapy. Perioperative complications developed in 1 patient (4.0%; hemiparesis and subsequent deep vein thrombosis). At 3-mo follow-up, no mortalities were observed, 19 patients (76.0%) demonstrated neurological improvements, 5 patients (20.0%) had a stable neurological exam, and 1 patient (4.0%) had a neurological decline.Conclusion:Utilization of a channel-based, navigable retractor and exoscope is a feasible option for surgical resection of metastatic brain lesions.
