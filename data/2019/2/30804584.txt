Objective:To determine risk factors affecting development of metachronous liver metastasis in rectal cancer patients after curative surgical resection.Methods:The retrospective cohort study was conducted at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised data of patients with histologically proven rectal carcinoma admitted to the department of surgical oncology from January 2005 to December 2015. Clinical data of all patients, including age, gender, clinical presentation, clinical and pathological tumour-nodes-metastasis classification, neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, pre- and postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, histopathological findings and tumour recurrence were analysed. SPSS 23 was used for data analysis..Results:Of the 434 patients, 26(6%) developed liver metastasis. Of them, 18(69%) were male and 16(61.5%) were aged below 50 years. On clinical staging, 2(7.7%) patients had stage II disease, 22(84.6%) had stage III, and 2(7.7%) patients had stage IV disease. At last follow-up, 2(7.7%) patients were alive without disease, 7(27%) had expired, while 17(65.4%) were alive with disease..Conclusions:Tumour depth, lymph node metastasis, postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, complete tumour response on histopathology were found to beresponsible for metachronous liver metastases in rectal cancer patients following curative resection.
