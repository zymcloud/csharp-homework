In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-122 in hepatocarcinoma progression and explored the mechanism. In hepatocarcinoma tissues and cells, we used qRT-PCR to validate the miR-122 expression level. Next, we used colony formation by crystal violet staining assay to compare cell proliferation ability, and we used scratch test or Transwell assay to compare cell migration or invasion ability. We then conducted bioinformatics or luciferase reporter gene assay to prove the regulation effect of miR-122 on lamin B2 (LMNB2), and the biological function of LMNB2 was analyzed. We used nude mouse tumorigenicity assay to test the inhibition effect of miR-122 ASO therapy against hepatocarcinoma. miR-122 was reduced in hepatocarcinoma tissues compared to the paracarcinoma tissues, which was relatively low or high in hepatocarcinoma cell line SMMC7721 or Hep3B, and overexpressed miR-122 inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in hepatocarcinoma cells. Additionally, some reports showed that LMNB2 was regulated by miR-122, which inhibited the expression of LMNB2. Moreover, LMNB2 functioned to promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We could achieve the inhibition of hepatocarcinoma using miR-122 therapy through decreasing LMNB2 expression in vivo. Our data indicated that miR-122 could inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma cell progression by targeting LMNB2 and as a therapeutic target for hepatocarcinoma treatment.
