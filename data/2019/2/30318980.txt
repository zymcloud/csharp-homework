Background:Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is often disseminated and mainly involves lymph nodes, spleen, liver or bone marrow. Peritonitis due to MAC infection (PMAC) is a very uncommon manifestation.Methods:In this report, after describing the case of the only PMAC infection in our 10-year retrospective study, which occurred in an AIDS patient who was non-adherent to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we performed a systematic literature review of documented bacteriological PMAC.Results:Including our patient, 51 cases of PMAC have been reported. Patients were most often male (sex ratio 2.14), with a median age of 41 years (2.8-72) and an immunodeficiency in all cases, most often AIDS (57%), cirrhosis (20%) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (18%). Ascites was more often chylous (54%) than exudative (46%) and, in this case, lymphocytic (60%), with an inconstantly positive acid-fast bacilli smear (54%). Non-disseminated PMAC patients were more likely to have peritoneal dialysis (39% versus 6.5%, p < .01) or cancer with immunosuppressive therapy (39% versus 0%, p < .0001), while AIDS was the leading underlying disease in disseminated-PMAC patients (83% versus 11%, p < .001). Mortality was high (50%), with no difference between disseminated and non-disseminated PMAC.Conclusions:This report highlights the need to be aware of an atypical presentation of PMAC infection, which is associated with a high rate of mortality even for non-disseminated infection.
