High resolution cross-sectional imaging techniques means that even small, well-differentiated hepatocellular tumors can also be diagnosed with biopsy. In cirrhotic liver tissue, macroregenerative and dysplastic nodules must be discriminated from hepatocellular cancer (HCC). In non-cirrhotic liver tissue the differential diagnosis includes hepatocellular adenoma, macroregeneratory nodules, fibrolamellar carcinoma, as well as primary tumors and metastases. The diagnostic procedure includes matrix diagnosis of the tumor-bearing liver tissue, cyto- and histomorphologic analysis including capillarization of vascular bed, and adapted immunohistological testing with antibodies which underline possible malignancy or hepatocellular differentiation. A flow chart for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinomas and their mimics on liver biopsies is presented.
