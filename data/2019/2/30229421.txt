Purpose:To investigate whether pre-operative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can predict early recurrence after curative resection of single HCC using image features and texture analysis.Materials and methods:179 patients with single HCC and who underwent pre-operative MRI were included. Two reviewers analyzed MR findings, including the tumor margin, peritumoral enhancement, peritumoral hypointensity on the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), diffusion restriction, capsule, tumoral fat, washout, portal-vein thrombus, signal intensity on HBP, and satellite nodule. Texture analysis on the HBP was also quantified. A multivariate analysis was used to identify predictive factors for early recurrence, microvascular invasion (MVI), and the tumor grade.Results:For early recurrence, satellite nodule, peritumoral hypointensity, absence of capsule, and GLCM ASM were predictors (P Conclusion:MR finding, including satellite nodule and peritumoral hypointensity on the HBP, as well as the texture parameters are useful to predict not only early recurrence, but also MVI and higher grade.
