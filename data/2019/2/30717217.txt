A novel series of thiazole-based heterocycles was synthesized using 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions in the presence of chitosan-grafted-poly(vinylpyridine) as an eco-friendly biopolymeric basic catalyst. The molecular structure of the synthesized compounds was illustrated by spectroscopic and elemental analysis. Various in vitro biological assays were performed to explore the potential antitumor, antimicrobial and hepatoprotective activities of the newly synthesized compounds. The cytotoxic activities were assessed against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2), colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines and results revealed that all compounds displayed antitumor activities with the chlorine-containing derivatives, 11c and 6g, being the most potent. The majority of the tested thiazole derivatives exhibited satisfactory antibacterial activity towards the used gram positive and gram-negative bacterial species. Moreover, many derivatives showed weak hepatoprotective activity against CClâ‚„-induced hepatotoxicity.
