The impact of antiviral therapy before tumorigenesis on microvascular invasion (MVI) of Chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown. In this retrospective cohort study 3,276 HCC patients with early-stage who underwent curative resection were included. We investigated the effect of precancer antiviral therapy on the pathology, especially MVI, of CHB-related HCC. MVI occurrence rates of CHB-related HCC stratified by histopathologic inflammation grades of G1, G2, and G3 were 30.4%, 34.7%, and 38.6%, respectively, compared to 19.8% for CHB-negative HCC. Patients who received standard antiviral treatment showed much lower rates of MVI, higher tumor capsule integrity, less frequent satellite micronodules and lower AFP level compared to the no antiviral group. Moreover, precancer antiviral therapy prolonged the disease-free survival (DFS), which are also proved to be independent indicators of DFS. In addition, we show that antivirals may suppress early progression of HCC primarily by inhibition of HBV viral load, and influencing the expression levels of CK18, GPC3, OPN and pERK. Hence, we demonstrate that precancer antivirals significantly reduce the MVI rate of CHB-related HCC, reduce malignancy of early-stage HCC, and improve HCC prognosis. Thus, this study confirms the importance of antiviral therapy for CHB patients.
