Numerous studies suggested that antiviral therapy could reduce the recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatectomy. The impact of nucleotide and nucleoside analogues on prognosis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) related HCC remains to be explored. We aimed to investigate the role of the telbivudine and adefovir dipivoxil on the prognosis of CHB-related HCC patients after hepatectomy.One hundred eighty-eight CHB-related patients who received hepatectomy from February 2010 to February 2017 were divided into telbivudine (LdT) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) groups. The characteristics and survival information of both groups were retrospectively compared and analyzed.One hundred eleven and 77 patients received telbivudine and adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy, respectively. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin level, status of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), serum HBV-DNA level were compared between groups. OS and DFS in ADV-treatment group were significantly better than it in LdT-treatment group (P
