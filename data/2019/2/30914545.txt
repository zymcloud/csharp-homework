Although the first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)is hepatectomy, extreme elderly(80 years or older) patients often tend to have a variety of underlying diseases and decreased cardiopulmonary function, which means that surgery involves a high risk. In this case, we examined the safety and efficacy of hepatectomy performed in an extreme elderly patient with HCC. Of the patients with HCC that underwent initial hepatectomy at Kobe University Hospital(n=348)between 2009 and 2015, 23 patients aged 80 years or older at the time of surgery(Group 1, n=23)and those younger than 80 years at the time(Group 2, n=325)were compared, based on parameters related to safety and prognosis. We did not identify differences between the 2 groups with respect to blood loss and operating time. Intraoperative blood transfusion was more common in Group 1. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to complications of Grade â…¢ or higher. The median survival of Group 2 patients following hepatectomy(42 months)was better than that of Group 1 patients(34 months), but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups(p=0.429). Furthermore, when the same parameters were compared after adjusting for and matching propensity scores, there were no significant differences in complications, hospitalization periods, and prognosis between the 2 groups. Through proper assessment of oncologic factors and patient risk factors, hepatectomy can be performed safely and effectively even for extreme elderly patients with HCC. If there is no other disease regulating the prognosis, we can expect to achieve similar prognosis in non-extreme elderly patients. Hence, treatments should not be limited solely based on a patient being extremely elderly; rather, proactive treatments should be considered.
