Background:Pazopanib can induce liver toxicity in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). We assessed the effect of a TA repeat polymorphism in the UGT1A1 (uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1) gene encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 on liver toxicity, dose reductions, and patient outcomes.Patients and methods:Patients with mRCC treated with first-line pazopanib developing liver toxicity underwent genotyping for the UGT1A1 polymorphism. Liver toxicity was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods.Results:Of 261 patients, 34 (13%) had developed liver toxicity after a median of 29 days (range, 5-155 days). Grade 4, 3, and 2 alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin had increased in 2 (6%), 17 (50%), and 8 (24%) patients, respectively. The UGT1A1 assessment demonstrated that 18 patients (53%) had TA6/TA7, 7 (21%) had TA7/TA7, and 9 (26%) had wild-type TA6/TA6. The UGT1A1 polymorphism was associated with improved median progression-free survival (TA6/TA6, 5.5 months; TA6/TA7, 34.2 months; TA7/TA7, 22.3 months; unknown UGT1A1 status, 9.2 months; UGT1A1 polymorphisms combined vs. unknown status, P = .021). UGT1A1 polymorphism was associated with improved median overall survival (TA6/TA6, 8.1 months, TA6/TA7 or TA7/TA7 not reached, unknown UGT1A1 status, 16.6 months; UGT1A1 polymorphisms combined vs. unknown status, P = .033). Patients with UGT1A1 polymorphism safely resumed pazopanib at ultra-low doses determined by the degree of liver toxicity and UGT1A1 polymorphism.Conclusions:UGT1A1 polymorphisms were associated with improved outcomes, despite pazopanib interruption and dose reductions. UGT1A1 assessment could improve the management of pazopanib-induced liver toxicity in patients with mRCC.
