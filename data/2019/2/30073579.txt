Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important etiology for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1) is linked to specific inflammatory diseases as a novel type of endogenous inflammatory regulator. However, presently, rare information is found about the association between TNIP1 polymorphisms and HBV-induced HCC risk. In this case control study, we genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNIP1 gene in 248 HCC patients and 242 chronic HBV carriers using Sequenom Mass-ARRAY technology. Genetic model and haplotype analysis were performed to evaluate the association between candidate SNPs polymorphisms and HBV-induced HCC susceptibility using Pearson's χ2 test and unconditional logistic regression analysis. Overall, we found two risk alleles in TNIP1 for HBV-induced HCC in patients: the allele "G" of rs7708392 by genotype model ("G/C" vs. "C/C": OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.17-3, P = 0.009) and dominant model ("G/C-G/G" vs. "C/C": OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.08-2.65, P = 0.023), and the allele "C" of rs10036748 by genotype model ("C/T" vs. "T/T": OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.14-2.92, P = 0.012) and dominant model ("C/T-C/C" vs. "T/T": OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.05-2.59, P = 0.03). However, rs3792792 and rs4958881 polymorphisms didn't significantly correlate with the risk of HBV-induced HCC. Haplotype analysis showed no significant association between haplotypes and the HCC risk in HBV carriers. This study provides evidence for HBV-induced HCC susceptibility gene TNIP1 in the Chinese Han population.
