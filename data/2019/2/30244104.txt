To characterize the incidences and outcomes of late acute (LA) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in East Asians according to the 2014 National Institutes of Health criteria, we retrospectively analyzed 506 consecutive Japanese patients who had a first allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) at our center between 2006 and 2013. According to manifestations at onset 91 patients (60%) had LA GVHD and 60 (40%) had chronic GVHD. The cumulative incidences of LA and chronic GVHD were 20% and 17%, respectively, at 48 months after HCT. The involved sites at the onset of LA GVHD included the skin (71%), gut (13%), and liver (8%). The cumulative incidences of relapse, nonrelapse mortality (NRM), transition to chronic GVHD, and discontinued systemic treatment were 11%, 6%, 22%, and 46%, respectively, at 48 months after onset of LA GVHD. Cox models showed that prior acute GVHD was associated with NRM, and HCT from a female donor to a male patient, myeloablative conditioning, and low Karnofsky performance status were associated with a longer duration of systemic treatment after LA GVHD. The most frequently involved sites at the onset of chronic GVHD included the mouth (83%), liver (75%), skin (69%), and eyes (62%). Cox models showed that use of antithymocyte globulin in conditioning regimens was associated with a higher risk of discontinued systemic treatment after the onset of chronic GVHD. The cumulative incidences of relapse, NRM, and discontinued systemic treatment were 16%, 11%, and 41%, respectively, at 48 months after the onset of chronic GVHD. Our results suggested several potential differences between Japanese patients and those of other ethnicities. A direct comparison is needed to formally investigate ethnic differences.
