Background and aims:This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic values of serum miR-331-3p and miR-23b-3p as tumor markers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at early stage.Methods:A total of 191 subjects were enrolled and consisted of 45 healthy controls (HC), 106 hepatitis c virus (HCV)-related chronic liver disease (CLD) patients, and 40 early-stage HCC patients. CLD patients were subdivided according to Metavir fibrosis-scoring. Serum miR-331-3p and miR-23b-3p were measured. The area under curves (AUC) was calculated for each microRNA and compared with that for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the detection of HCC at early stage.Results:Serum miR-331-3p was significantly higher in early-stage HCC than that in CLD and HC respectively, and it decreased significantly after surgery in early-stage HCC. Contrarily, serum miR-23b-3p was significantly lower in early-stage HCC and increased significantly after surgery. Further, receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated AUC was 0.806 (95%CI: 0.728-0.883; sensitivity: 85.85%, specificity: 65.00%) for serum miR-23b-3p in discriminating early-stage HCC from CLD patients, higher than that for AFP (AUC:0.660, 95%CI: 0.556-0.764; sensitivity: 70.00%, specificity: 56.60%). In discrimination early-stage HCC from severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (F3 + F4) patients, both miR-23b-3p (AUC: 0.796, 95%CI: 0.703-0.889; sensitivity: 85.11%, specificity: 65.00%) and miR-331-3p (AUC:0.832, 95%CI: 0.812-0.953; sensitivity: 75.00%, specificity: 85.11%) had better diagnostic performances than AFP (AUC:0.632, 95%CI: 0.512-0.753; sensitivity: 50.00%, specificity: 55.32%). Serum miR-331-3p levels also showed a significant correlation with BCLC stages of HCC.Conclusion:Serum miR-331-3p and miR-23b-3p could be used as novel invasive biomarkers in the early detection of HCC in high-risk patients.
