There is a rising number of evidence indicating the increased risk of cancer development in association with congenital metabolic errors. Although these diseases represent disorders of individual genes, they lead to the disruption of metabolic pathways resulting in metabolite accumulation or their deficiency. Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive sphingolipidosis. It is a rare lysosomal storage disease. A strong correlation between GD and different types of cancers, such as multiple myeloma, leukemia, and hepatocellular carcinoma, has been reported. Common features for all types of GD include spleen and liver enlargement, cytopenia, and a variety of bone defects. Overall, the molecular bases leading to the association of GD and cancers are not clearly understood. Here, we describe the role of ceramides in GD, discuss the potential implications of immune cells activation and show how the disturbances in their metabolism might promote blood cancer development.
