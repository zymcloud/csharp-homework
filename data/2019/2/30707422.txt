High body mass index (BMI) is associated with other multiple comorbidities such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and cardiopulmonary diseases, which can impact the perioperative outcomes following liver resection. We aimed to study the impact of BMI on perioperative outcomes after robotic liver resection. All the patients undergoing robotic liver resection between 2013 and 2017 were prospectively followed. The patients were divided into three groups (BMI < 25, BMI 25-35, BMI > 35 kg/m2) for illustrative purposes. Demographic and perioperative outcome data were compared. Data are presented as median (mean ± SD). Thirty-eight patients underwent robotic hepatectomy, 73% were women, age was 58 (57 ± 17.6) years, and ASA class was 3 (3 ± 0.5). Indications for surgery were neoplastic lesions in 34 patients (89%), hemangioma in two patients (6%), fibrous mass in one patient (2.5%), and focal nodular hyperplasia in one patient (2.5%). 32% of the patients underwent right or left hemihepatectomy, 21% underwent sectionectomy, 5% underwent central hepatectomy and the reminder underwent non-anatomical liver resection. Operative time was 261 (254.6 ± 94.3) min. Estimated blood loss was 175 (276 ± 294.8) ml. Length of hospital stay was 3 (5 ± 4.9) days. By regression analysis of the three BMI groups, estimated blood loss, rate of postoperative complication, rate of conversion, need for transfusion, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay did not have a significant relationship with BMI. A total of five patients (13%) experience complications. Four patients had complications that were nonspecific to liver resection, including acute renal injury, respiratory failure, and enterocutaneous fistula. One patient had bile leak, treated with ERCP stenting. No mortality was seen in this study. Obesity should not dissuade surgeons from utilizing minimally invasive robotic approach for liver resection. Robotic technique is a safe and feasible in patients with high BMI. The impact of BMI on outcomes is insignificant.
