This study describes the comparative expression and purification of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles produced upon infection of human primary hepatocytes and human hepatoma cell lines (HuH-7 and HepG2) with recombinant vaccinia viruses. The highest levels of HBsAg expression were found in HuH-7 hepatoma cells following infection with recombinant vaccinia viruses, which contain the S gene under control of a 7.5 k-promoter. Four different methods for purification of the HBsAg particles were examined: isopycnic ultracentrifugation, sucrose cushion sedimentation, isocratic column gel filtration, and binding to anti-HBs-coated microparticles. The highest degree of purity of HBsAg particles was reached by the method based on anti-HBs-coated microparticles. The resulting product was >98% pure. Biochemical analysis and characterization of purified HBsAg particles were performed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), western blotting, and electron microscopy. The HBsAg, purified from human hepatoma cell lines and from human primary hepatocytes, consisted of both the non-glycosylated (p25) and the glycosylated (gp27) form and assembled into typical 22-nm particles, and thus may be of great interest and importance for research, diagnostics, and medical treatments.
