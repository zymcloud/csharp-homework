Backgrounds/aims:Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is one of the most common benign tumors of the liver. There is still a lack of evidence on surgical indications for FNH. This study intended to analyze the surgical indications for FNH.Methods:We analyzed 48 cases of FNH diagnosed after hepatic resection.Results:Common reasons leading to surgical resection were diagnostic uncertainty (n=31), and persistent symptoms (n=8). None of our patients had a past history of contraceptive use. Percutaneous biopsy was performed in 14 patients and FNH was diagnosed in nine patients, and hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, plasmacytoma, angiosarcoma, and atypical hepatocellular proliferation in one patient each. Minor hepatectomy (n=37) was performed more frequently than major hepatectomy (n=11). Open hepatectomy (n=29) was performed more frequently than laparoscopic hepatectomy (n=19), but laparoscopic and minimally-invasive surgery was frequently performed during the late phase of the study period. Postoperative surgical complications occurred in two patients (4.1%).Conclusions:FNH can be diagnosed by imaging studies, but surgical treatment may be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or persistent symptoms.
