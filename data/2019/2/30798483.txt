Minimally invasive hepatectomy for benign and malignant liver lesions has gained popularity in the past decade due to improved perioperative outcomes when compared to conventional 'open' technique. We aim to investigate our initial experience of robotic hepatectomy undertaken in our hepatobiliary program. All patients undergoing robotic hepatectomy between 2013 and 2018 were prospectively followed. Data are presented as median (mean ± SD). A total of 80 patients underwent robotic hepatectomy within the study period. 60% of the patients were women, age of 63 (62.4 ± 14.1), body mass index of 28 (29.6 ± 9.4), ASA class of 2.5 (2.5 ± 0.6), and MELD score of 7 (8.2 ± 2.8). Size of resected lesion was 3.9 (4.6 ± 3) cm. Indications for resection were metastatic lesions (30%), hepatocellular carcinoma (28%), cholangiocarcinoma (7%), gallbladder cancer (5%), neuroendocrine tumors (4%), and benign lesions (26%). Formal hepatectomy (right or left) was performed in 30% of the patients. Operative time was 233 (267.2 ± 109.6) minutes, and estimated blood loss was 150 (265.7 ± 319.9) ml. Length of hospital stay was 3 (5.0 ± 4.6) days. One patient was converted to 'open' approach. 10 patients experienced postoperative complications. Readmissions within 30 days of hospital discharge were seen in eight patients. Our data support that robotic hepatectomy is safe and feasible, with favorable short-term outcomes and low conversion rate. Robotic technology extends the application of minimally invasive techniques in the field of hepatobiliary surgery.
