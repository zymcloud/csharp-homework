Background:MET amplification is associated with acquired resistance to first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the therapeutic strategy in these patients is undefined. Herein we report the clinical outcomes of patients with c-MET amplification resistance to EGFR-TKIs treated with crizotinib.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed advanced NSCLC patients from five sites who were diagnosed with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and received EGFR-TKI treatment. After disease progression, these patients were confirmed to have a MET-to-centromere ratio (MET:CEN) â‰¥ 1.8 based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) examination and without a T790M mutation. We assessed the efficacy and safety of crizotinib to overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR-activating mutations NSCLC with acquired MET amplification.Results:Amplification of the acquired MET gene was identified in 18 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Fourteen patients received crizotinib treatment after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Among the 14 patients, 6 (42.9%) received crizotinib plus EGFR-TKI and 8 (57.1%) received crizotinib monotherapy. The overall objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 50.0% (7/14) and 85.7% (12/14), respectively. The median PFS (mPFS) of patients receiving crizotinib monotherapy and crizotinib plus EGFR-TKI was 6.0 and 12.6 months, respectively (P = 0.315). Notably, treatment efficacy was more pronounced in patients with crizotinib than patients with chemotherapy (24.0 months vs. 12.0 months, P = 0.046). The mOS for 8 of 14 patients receiving crizotinib monotherapy and 6 of 14 patients receiving crizotinib plus EGFR-TKI was 17.2 and 24.0 months, respectively (P = 0.862). Among the 14 patients, 1 who received crizotinib monotherapy (grade 3 nausea) and 2 who received crizotinib plus EGFR-TKI (grade 3 elevated liver aminotransferase levels) received reduced doses of crizotinib (200 mg twice daily) to better tolerate the dose.Conclusions:We observed the clinical evidence of efficacy generated by combination of crizotinib and previous EGFR-TKIs after the resistance to first-generation EGFR-TKIs. These results might increase evidence of more effective therapeutic strategies for NSCLC treatment. Combination therapy did not increase the frequency of adverse reactions.
