Purpose:The percutaneous ablation of subcapsular hepatocellular carcinoma (S-HCC) may involve a risk of complications such as hemorrhage and tumor seeding, mainly linked to the direct tumor puncture often inevitable with mono-applicator ablation devices. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of no-touch multi-bipolar radiofrequency ablation (NTMBP-RFA) for the treatment of S-HCC ≤ 5 cm not puncturable via the non-tumorous liver parenchyma.Materials and methods:Between September 2007 and December 2014, 58 consecutive patients (median age: 63 years [46-86], nine females) with 59 S-HCC ≤ 5 cm (median diameter: 25 mm [10-50 mm]), not puncturable via the non-tumorous liver parenchyma, were treated with NTMBP-RFA. Response and follow-up were assessed by CT or MRI. Complications were graded using the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe classification. Overall local tumor progression (OLTP)-free survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional model evaluated the factors associated with OLTP. Signs of peritoneal or parietal tumor seeding were noted during follow-up imaging studies.Results:A complete ablation was achieved in 57/58 patients (98.3%) after one (n = 51) or two (n = 6) procedures. Three patients (5.2%) experienced complications (sepsis, cirrhosis decompensation; CIRSE grade 2 or 3). After a median follow-up period of 30.5 months [1-97], no patients had tumor seeding. The 1, 2 and 3-year OLTP-free survival rates were 98%, 94% and 91%, respectively. No factors were associated with OLTP.Conclusion:NTMBP-RFA is a safe and effective treatment for S-HCC not puncturable via the non-tumorous liver parenchyma.
