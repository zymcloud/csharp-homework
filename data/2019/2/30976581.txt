Background and aims:Matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) is involved in tumor invasiveness and metastasis and significantly overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of blood mRNA MMP-12 overexpression in patients with HCC.Patients and methods:From January 2017 to June 2017, 100 patients with HCC (HCV-related cirrhosis) and 100 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis (without HCC) were included in this study. All patients were subjected to triphasic CT abdomen when indicated, liver profile, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and molecular characterization of metalloproteinase-12 expression.Results:There were no statistically significant differences between both groups regarding CBC parameters and liver profile (p value > 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between patients with and without HCC regarding blood mRNA MMP-12 overexpression (p value < 0.01), blood mRNA MMP-12, and/or AFP (sensitivity 84.0%, specificity 60.0%, PPV 51.2%, and NPP 88.2%). The accuracy of mRNA MMP-12 and/or AFP in detection of HCC was 68.0%.Conclusion:Blood mRNA MMP-12 has a good sensitivity and a bad specificity but is accurate in HCC diagnosis. Adding blood mRNA MMP-12 to AFP optimizes the current screening program to improve early diagnosis of HCC and hence better prognosis.
