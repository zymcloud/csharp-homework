Liver cancer is a kind of high mortality cancer due to the difficulty of early diagnosis. And according to the reports, the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was higher in cancer cells than normal cells. Therefore, developing an effective fluorescent probe for hepatoma-selective imaging of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which is one of the vital ROS is of great importance for understanding the role of HOCl in liver cancer pathogenesis. However, the cell-selective fluorescent probe still remains a difficult task among current reports. Herein, a galactose-appended naphthalimide (Gal-NPA) with p-aminophenylether as a new receptor and galactose moiety as hepatoma targeting unit was synthesized and employed to detect endogenous HOCl in living HepG2 cells. This probe was proved to possess good water solubility and could respond specifically to HOCl. In addition, probe Gal-NPA could completely react to HOCl within 3 s meanwhile accompanied by tremendous fluorescence enhancement. The quantitative linear range between fluorescence intensities and the HOCl concentrations was 0 to 1 Î¼M (detection limit = 0.46 nM). More importantly, fluorescence confocal imaging experiments showed that probe Gal-NPA could discriminate hepatoma cells over other cancer cells and simultaneously trace endogenous HOCl levels in living HepG2 cells. And we thus anticipate that probe Gal-NPA has the potential application for revealing the functions of HOCl in hepatoma cells.
