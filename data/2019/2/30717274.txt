Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of hepatic abnormalities worldwide. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is part of the spectrum of NAFLD and leads to progressive liver disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In NASH patient, fibrosis represents the major predictor of liver-related mortality; therefore, it is important to have an early and accurate diagnosis of NASH. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of NASH is still liver biopsy. The development of biomarkers able to predict disease severity, prognosis, as well as response to therapy without the need for a biopsy is the focus of most up-to-date genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research. In the future, patients might be diagnosed and treated according to their molecular signatures. In this short review, we discuss how information from genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics contribute to the understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis.
