Vitamin E improves liver histology in adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) but not diabetes, but its impact on long-term patient outcomes is unknown. We evaluated whether vitamin E treatment improves clinical outcomes of NASH patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. Two hundred and thirty-six patients with biopsy-proven NASH and bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis seen at Indiana University Medical Center between October 2004 and January 2016 were included. Ninety of them took 800 international units/day of vitamin E for â‰¥2 years (vitamin E users) and were propensity-matched to 90 adults who did not take vitamin E (controls) after adjusting for fibrosis severity, age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities and their treatment, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, liver biochemistries, and length of follow-up on vitamin E. Covariate-adjusted Cox and competing risk regression models were assessed to evaluate the association between vitamin E treatment and patient outcomes. The median follow-up was 5.62 (interquartile range [IQR], 4.3-7.5) and 5.6 (IQR, 4-6.9) years for vitamin E users and controls, respectively. Vitamin E users had higher adjusted transplant-free survival (78% versus 49%, P
