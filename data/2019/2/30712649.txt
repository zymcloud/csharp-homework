Purpose:To investigate the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on the biological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and the associated changes in G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) expression.Methods:The mean serum levels of Ang II and TNF-α in normal subjects and patients with benign liver tumors (BLTs) and HCC were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and liver samples from the patients with HCC and HCC mice were used to assess the protein levels of both cytokines, their major receptors and GRK2. In addition, the dynamics of Bel-7402 cells were determined with cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell experiments, while the levels of the primary cytokine receptors Ang II type-1 receptor (AT1R) and type-2 receptor (AT2R) as well as TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). The effects of Ang II and TNF-α on the GRK2 levels in Bel-7402 cells and on the dynamics of GRK2-knockdown HCC cells were also investigated.Results:Both cytokines independently enhanced Bel-7402 cell growth, migration and invasion by decreasing the GRK2 level. In contrast, down-regulating the GRK2 level in Bel-7402 cells suppressed these effects. No synergistic effects were discovered when Ang II and TNF-α were administered together. Furthermore, increased AT1R and TNFR1 levels stimulated HCC initiation and progression, whereas AT2R overexpression produced the opposite effect.Conclusions:The present results suggested that Ang II and TNF-α promote Bel-7402 cell growth, migration and invasion by down-regulating GRK2 expression, and that the associated receptors AT1R, AT2R and TNFR1 participate in HCC initiation and progression.
