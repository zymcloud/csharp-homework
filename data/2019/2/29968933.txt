Background and aim:Noninvasive fibrosis indices can predict the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Modified FIB-4 (mFIB-4) is a promising noninvasive index for predicting liver fibrosis. To investigate the predictive accuracy of several extant noninvasive fibrosis indices, including mFIB-4, for HCC incidence in CHB patients receiving long-term entecavir therapy.Methods:We enrolled 1325 nucleos(t)ide analogue-na√Øve CHB patients (noncirrhotic 844; cirrhotic 481) treated with entecavir. Baseline clinical features and fibrosis indices were collected and evaluated for predicting HCC risk through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.Results:Of the 1325 patients, 105 (7.9%) developed HCC during a median follow-up period of 4.1 years. Age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.039; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.020-1.059; P Conclusions:The mFIB-4 index alone or in combination with DM is the optimal noninvasive predictor of HCC risk in CHB patients receiving entecavir therapy.
