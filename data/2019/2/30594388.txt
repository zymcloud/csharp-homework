Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are extensively involved in multiple malignancies including colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present study, we found a novel lncRNA, long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 483 (LINC00483), which was upregulated in CRC. We also illustrated that upregulated LINC00483 was correlated with poor clinicopathological features of patients with CRC. Functionally, we displayed that a knockdown of LINC00483 suppressed LOVO and HT29 cells proliferation and metastatic ability. We further illustrated that miR-204-3p was involved in LINC00483 induced proliferation and metastasis. An overexpression of miR-204-3p could attenuate the facilitative effect which LINC00483 presented. Through a luciferase assay, we showed the direct binding effect between LINC00483 and miR-204-3p. Even further, we revealed that LINC00483 and formin like 2 (FMNL2) shared a similar miR-204-3p response elements (MREs-204-3p). FMNL2 was a direct target of miR-204-3p. FMNL2 was a downstream gene of LINC00483 and participated in LINC00483 mediated proliferation and metastasis. Lastly, we proved that LINC00483 promoted proliferation and metastasis via modulating of FMNL2 in LOVO and HT29 cells. In summary, the outcomes of this study illustrated that LINC00483 promoted CRC cells proliferation and metastasis via modulating of FMNL2 by acting as a ceRNA of miR-204-3p. LINC00483/miR-204-3p/FMNL2 axial might be a novel target in molecular treatment of CRC.
