Background:The purpose of this study is to compare the survival time of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with different organ metastasis. Among all cancers, the morbidity and mortality of lung cancer is the highest worldwide, which may caused by local recurrence and distant metastasis, and the location of metastasis may predict the prognosis of patients.Methods:A total of 117,542 patients with NSCLC diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 were enrolled from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) databases, and the relationship between distant metastasis and survival time was retrospectively analyzed.Results:Of all the 117,542 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, 42,071 (35.8%) patients had different degrees of distant metastasis during their medical history, including 26,932 single organ metastases and 15,139 multiple organ metastases, accounting for 64.0% and 36.0% of the metastatic patients respectively. Compared with patients with no metastasis, whose median survival time was 21 months, the median survival time of patients with metastases was 7 months (lung), 6 months (brain), 5 months (bone), 4 months (liver), and 3 months (multiple organ) respectively, and the difference was significant (P<0.001, except liver vs multiple organ P=0.650); Most patients with NSCLC (88.4%) eventually died of lung cancer.Conclusions:Distant metastasis of NSCLC patients indicates poor prognosis. In NSCLC patients with single organ metastasis, the prognosis of lung metastasis is the best, and liver metastasis is the worst, and multiple organ metastasis is worse than single organ metastasis.
