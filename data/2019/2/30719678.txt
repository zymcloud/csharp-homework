Background:Chronic viral hepatitis remains a major etiology of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation has been considered an effective treatment for this condition. This study aims to analyze living donor liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and its relationship with hepatitis virus status.Methods:A retrospective analysis of 268 patients who received living donor liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma was performed. Patients were analyzed according to their serologic status of hepatitis virus; clinicopathologic features, operative parameters, and outcomes were also assessed and compared.Results:Twenty-three patients (8.6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence following liver transplantation; the most common pattern of recurrence was systemic spreading (n = 10). Hepatitis B virus relapse was encountered in 41 out of 188 patients (21.8%) with hepatitis B virus-positive, and hepatitis C virus reactivation was noted in 48 (60.8%) patients among 79 hepatitis C virus-positive patients. Incidence of hepatitis C virus reactivation was significantly higher than that of hepatitis B virus relapse (p Conclusion:Living donor liver transplantation based on expanded hepatocellular carcinoma criteria achieved a satisfactory result, but reinfection of hepatic virus remains a great concern particularly in patient with hepatitis C. Moreover, hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence accompanied with reinfection of hepatic virus after liver transplantation is associated with inferior outcomes.
