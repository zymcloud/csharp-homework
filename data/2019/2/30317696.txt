The principal advancements in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the use of new systemic treatments, such as lenvatinib in first-line treatment and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab in second-line treatment, because of their benefits in terms of overall survival. In addition, nivolumab as a second-line agent was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 based on improved radiological response data. Physicians and patients alike will greatly benefit from this expanded arsenal of treatments once all these new drugs for the treatment of HCC finally become available. Unfortunately, in our review of the available data, we found a conspicuous lack of approved systemic treatments for HCC in the distinct setting of after liver transplantation (LT). Careful evaluation of the clinical trials for approved systemic treatments of HCC is crucial when considering the best options for those with HCC recurrence after LT. Although several first-line or second-line treatments have been shown to be effective for HCC, each of these trials was composed of its own specific populations, and those with HCC recurrence after LT were excluded. We have also summarized from a critical and clinical point of view the issues involved in the management of patients who are candidates for systemic treatment in this era of multiple drugs for the same indication.
