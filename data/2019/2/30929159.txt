MicroRNAs are involved in each stage of tumor development. Activation of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met axis facilitates the proliferation and migration of cancer cells, and the HGF/c-MET pathway provides potential targets for anticancer treatment. However, the interaction between HGF and miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that miR-101 is downregulated in various types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor, but the role of miR-101 in HCC has not yet been well defined. Here, we show that HGF is upregulated while microRNA-101-3p is significantly downregulated in the tumor tissues of HCC. By combining bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated that HGF is a direct target of miR-101. In vitro experiments indicated that miR-101 inhibits the migration and proliferation of HCC cells by targeting the HGF/c-MET axis, and in vivo studies showed that overexpressed miR-101 dramatically suppresses tumor growth. Therefore, the present study identifies miR-101 as a negative regulator of HGF/c-MET and suggests that miRNAs can be used as targeted drugs for the clinical treatment of HCC.
