Objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with major vascular invasion is an advanced stage disease with an extremely poor prognosis and low survival rate. Our study evaluated the survival benefit of radiotherapy (RT) in HCC patients with major vascular invasion through Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.Methods:We analyzed 3181 HCC patients with major vascular invasion cases diagnosed from 2004 to 2013. Patients (N = 308) who underwent RT and patients (N = 2873) who did not receive RT were compared. We successfully analyzed patients using propensity score matching (PSM). Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses were applied to assess prognosis.Results:The median survival time in radiation-treated group was longer compared to the control group (7 months vs 3 months; P Conclusions:Radiotherapy provides improves survival in HCC patients with major vascular invasion, especially for tumor(s) confined to one lobe and not on surface of liver.
