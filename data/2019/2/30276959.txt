Background & aims:Diabetes mellitus is known to negatively impact the outcome of liver transplant; however, data are scarce regarding risk of waitlist dropout and tumour recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We examined the impact of diabetes mellitus on the outcomes of candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma on an intention-to-treat basis.Methods:Our study included 15 776 candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis on the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database from 2008 to 2015 to evaluate the risk of waitlist dropout, hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence and overall survival.Results:There were more patients dropped out from the waiting list owing to patient disease deterioration or tumour progression in the diabetes mellitus group (15.1% vs 13.7%, P = 0.024). The mean waiting time was similar in the two groups (233 days vs 230 days, P = 0.631). The recurrence rate was higher in the diabetes mellitus group (9.0% vs 6.2%, P 400 ng/mL were independent predictive factors for recurrence. On an intention-to-treat basis, diabetes mellitus was also an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival; however, the overall survival was comparable with tumours beyond Milan criteria.Conclusions:Diabetes mellitus was associated with poor survival outcomes and an increased risk of waitlist dropout and tumour recurrence rates in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Those patients should be paid more attention to cardiovascular and oncological examination when determining waitlist and post-transplant surveillance strategies.
