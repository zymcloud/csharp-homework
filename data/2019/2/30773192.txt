Background and purpose:To evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods and materials:Patients treated for HCC between 2012 and 2016 were reviewed. Among these, 668 patients who underwent RFA of 736 tumors and 105 patients who underwent SBRT of 114 tumors were included. Using propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust for clinical factors, 95 tumors were selected from each treatment arm. Freedom from local progression (the primary endpoint, FFLP) was compared before and after adjustment with PSM.Results:At baseline, SBRT-treated tumors were more advanced, larger (median, 2.4 vs. 1.6 cm), and more frequently located in the subphrenic region than RFA-treated tumors (P 2.0 cm) were also independent predictors of local progression.Conclusion:SBRT appears to be an effective alternative treatment for HCC when RFA is not feasible due to tumor location or size.
