Objective:To investigate expression profiles of survivin and endoglin in patients with hepatic carcinoma.Materials and methods:Cancerous tissues (hepatic carcinoma group) of 48 patients with hepatic carcinoma and adjacent noncancerous hepatic tissues (control group) were used as objects of study. Histopathological staining [hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining] was used to study the pathological differences in hepatic tissues between hepatic carcinoma group and control group. Moreover, survivin and endoglin protein expressions in hepatic tissues in hepatic carcinoma group and control group were detected via western blotting. Finally, Statistical Product and Service Solutions 17.0 statistical software was used to analyze the differences in survivin and endoglin expressions in hepatic tissues between hepatic carcinoma group and control group.Results:H&E staining showed that histopathological features in hepatic carcinoma group were significantly different from those in control group. Compared with those in control group, the cell structure in hepatic carcinoma group was damaged, karyopyknosis was obvious, and the hepatic injury was serious. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that survivin and endoglin mRNA expression levels in hepatic carcinoma group were significantly increased compared with those in control group. Besides, immunofluorescence method and western blotting revealed the low expressions of survivin and endoglin proteins in tissues in control group, which were obviously lower than those in hepatic tissues in hepatic carcinoma group. Results of analyses of variance showed that the expressions of survivin and endoglin in normal hepatic tissues and cancerous tissues had statistically significant differences (p Conclusion:Elevated expressions of survivin and endoglin are associated with histological grade, tumor size, and TNM stage in patients with hepatic carcinoma, indicating that survivin and endoglin might be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic carcinoma and therapeutic targeting them might be a novel approach for the treatment of hepatic carcinoma.
