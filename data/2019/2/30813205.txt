Background:Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a very critical threat to public health worldwide, and is the primary cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yinchenhao decoction (YCHD) is a classic prescription of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of jaundice. Despite the satisfactory clinical efficacy of YCHD in the treatment of CHB, the safety of YCHD is still uncertain. Therefore, we will provide a systematic review of YCHD in CHB treatments.Methods:The purpose of this review is to retrieve relevant literature on YCHD therapy for CHB in the electrical databases, including 4 Chinese databases (e.g., Wanfang database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical database (CBM), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical database (VIP)) and 3 English databases (e.g., PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE). The literatures involved are from the establishment of the databases to January 2019. The primary outcomes are HBV-DNA, HBeAg, and ALT. We will calculate the data synthesis for meta-analysis using RevMan V.5.3 software if the results are suitable.Results:This study will offer a high-quality composite of existing evidence for YCHD in CHB treatment according to HBV-DNA quantitative detection, HBeAg qualitative detection, ALT levels, TCM syndrome evaluation criteria, status changes in quality of life assessment participants, and adverse events.Conclusion:This systematic review will provide evidence to assess the clinical efficacy of YCHD in the treatment of patients with CHB.Prospero registration number:PROSPERO CRD42019119720.
