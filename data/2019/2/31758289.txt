To determine the location patterns of distant metastases at initial staging and outcomes of ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancer patients. Data were obtained from the SEER database from 2010 to 2015. Analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazard methods. Of 3035 patients (median age: 63, range: 17-95) with stage IV gynecologic cancer, ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers were present in 42%, 40%, and 18% of the cohort. The proportion of lung, liver, bone and brain metastases were identified in 38%, 57%, 4%, and 1% of ovarian cancer patients, 62%, 22%, 13%, and 3% of uterine cancer patients, and 59%, 16%, 23%, and 2% of cervical cancer patients, respectively. The 5-year disease-specific survival for all patients was 19%. Those with liver metastases had survival rates of 26% compared to 15% for lung, 13% for bone, and 6% for brain (p < 0.0001). Patients with ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers had survival rates of 28%, 12%, and 12%, respectively (p < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, brain metastasis (HR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.21-2.22, p < 0.01), uterine (HR = 1.77, 95 CI 1.56-2.02, p < 0.0001) and cervical (HR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.63, p < 0.01) cancers, and lack of insurance (HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.16-1.73, p < 0.001) were independent predictors for poorer survival. Age, year, region, and race did not affect prognosis. Stage IV ovarian cancer most frequently metastasizes to the liver, whereas uterine and cervical cancers spread more to the lung. Overall, these patients have poor prognosis, particularly those with uterine or cervical primary disease or brain metastases.
