Trametes robiniophila Murr. (Huaier) is a mushroom with a long history of use as a medicinal ingredient in China and exhibits good clinical efficacy in cancer management. However, the antitumor components of Huaier and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated a proteoglycan with a molecular mass of ∼5.59 × 104 Da from Huaier aqueous extract. We named this proteoglycan TPG-1, and using FTIR and additional biochemical analyses, we determined that its total carbohydrate and protein compositions are 43.9 and 41.2%, respectively. Using biochemical assays and immunoblotting, we found that exposing murine RAW264.7 macrophages to TPG-1 promotes the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Of note, the TPG-1 treatment significantly inhibited the tumorigenesis of human hepatoma HepG2 cells likely at least in part by increasing serum levels of TNFα and promoting leukocyte infiltration into tumors in nude mice. TPG-1 also exhibited good antitumor activity in hepatoma H22-bearing mice and had no obvious adverse effects in these mice. We conclude that TPG-1 exerts antitumor activity partially through an immune-potentiating effect due to activation of the TLR4-NF-κB/MAPK signaling cassette. Therefore, TPG-1 may be a promising candidate drug for cancer immunotherapy. This study has identified the TPG-1 proteoglycan as an antitumor agent and provided insights into TPG-1's molecular mechanism, suggesting a potential utility for applying this agent in cancer therapy.
