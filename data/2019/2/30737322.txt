A 30-year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain and abdominal distension. CT demonstrated two intra-abdominal masses, one involving the left lateral segment of the liver and the other adjacent to the duodenum. Initial biopsies were consistent with focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver and non-specific lymphocytic infiltrate in the paraduodenal mass. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the paraduodenal mass. Final pathology was consistent with an inflammatory pseudotumour and the patient's symptoms subsequently resolved.
