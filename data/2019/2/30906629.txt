For decades, E2F1 has been recognized as a retinoblastoma protein (RB) binding transcription factor that regulates the cell cycle. E2F1 binds preferentially to RB and accelerates the cell cycle in most cancer cells. However, it is thought that E2F1 modulates cell proliferation in other ways as well. Herein, it has been discovered that in pathological tissues derived from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, E2F1 correlates positively with IQGAP3 and that both of these factors are highly expressed (N = 164, R = 0.6716). In addition, a high level of E2F1 or IQGAP3 predicted poor survival in HCC patients. Further study determined that E2F1 transactivates IQGAP3, the GTPase binding protein in MHCC-97H cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that IQGAP3 interacts with PKCδ and competitively inhibits the interaction between PKCδ and PKCα, resulting in phosphorylation of PKCα activation and promotion of cell proliferation. This study reveals that highly expressed E2F1 not only transactivates cell-cycle-related factors but also promotes HCC proliferation by activating the phosphorylation of PKCα.
