Background:To compare the efficacy and safety of surgical resection plus radiofrequency ablation (SR-RFA) with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan criteria.Methods:From 2009 to 2015, a total of 469 consecutive patients with multifocal HCC beyond the Milan criteria (â‰¤5 nodules) treated with SR-RFA (n=59) or TACE (n=410) were analyzed. Their overall survival (OS) rate was compared through propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at a ratio of 1:2, and 141 patients were identified (SR-RFA, n=47; TACE, n=94). Subgroup analysis was conducted according to factors associated with treatment options.Results:Before PSM, the 1-, 2- and 3-year OS rates were 81.5%, 68.3% and 64.3% in the SR-RFA group and 58.7%, 35.5% and 24.4% in the TACE group, respectively (all PConclusions:SR-RFA provides better a long-term survival rate than TACE for patients with multifocal HCC beyond the Milan criteria. SR-RFA may serve as an alternative treatment for patients with multifocal HCC in a selected patient population.
