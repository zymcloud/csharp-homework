As a major cellular component in tumor microenvironment, the distribution, frequency, and prognostic significance of infiltrating B cell subsets in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain controversial. Using tyramide signal amplification (TSA) based fluorescent multiplexed immunohistochemistry in situ, we evaluated the distribution and frequency of B cell subsets in two independent HCC cohorts (n = 619). The results were further confirmed by flow cytometry. Correlations of B cell subsets with clinicopathologic features and patient prognosis were analyzed. Five B cell subsets were defined by multiplexed immunohistochemistry and each subset was clearly separated by t-SNE dimension reduction analysis. Notably, the densities of all B cell subsets were significantly decreased in the tumor. The frequency of plasma cells within B cells was most abundant in the tumor. In training cohort (n = 258), high densities of tumor-infiltrating CD20+ B cells, naive B cells, IgM+ memory B cells, CD27- isotype-switched memory B cells, and plasma cells were associated with superior survival. Multivariate analysis further identified CD20+ B cells, naive B cells, and CD27- isotype-switched memory B cells as independent prognosticators for survival. Unsupervised cluster analysis confirmed increased B cell subsets harbored superior survival. In addition, high density of B cells was correlated with smaller tumor size and well differentiation. The results were validated in the independent cohort of 361 HCC patients. Intratumor infiltration of B cells is significantly impaired during HCC progression. High densities of tumor-infiltrating B cells imply a better clinical outcome. Therapies designed to target B cells may be a novel strategy in HCC.
