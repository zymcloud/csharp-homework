Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent liver malignancy that can be developed from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Numerous pathophysiological alterations, including insulin resistance, specific cytokine release, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial damage, are involved in the transition of NAFLD to cirrhosis and HCC. MicroRNAs, as post-transcriptional modulators, play a critical role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD-related HCC by regulating lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and differentiation. This review summarizes the current progress of microRNAs in the risk and prognosis of NAFLD-related HCC. Anat Rec, 302:193-200, 2019. Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
