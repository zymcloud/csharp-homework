The present study aimed to assess the suppressive effect of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence following curative treatment, particularly compared with interferon (IFN)-based therapy. Among 117 curative cases of HCV-related initial HCC between 2006 and 2017 at Gifu University Hospital, 13 and 14 cases achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) by DAA- (DAA group) or IFN-based therapies (IFN group), and 64 cases were not treated with any antiviral therapy (non-treatment group). Recurrence-free survival (RFS) following curative treatment in each group was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the factors that affected RFS. Age was significantly lower and serum alanine aminotransferase level was significantly higher in the IFN group than in both the DAA and non-treatment groups. There was a significant difference in RFS between the non-treatment group and antiviral therapy groups, including the DAA (P=0.014) and IFN groups (P=0.009); however, no significant difference was identified in RFS between the DAA and IFN groups (P=0.564). SVR achieved by DAA [P=0.011; hazard ratio (HR), 0.222; 95% CI, 0.069-0.758] or IFN therapy (P=0.007; HR, 0.327; 95% CI, 0.145-0.742) was an independent factor for the prevention of HCC recurrence. SVR by DAA therapy exhibited an anti-liver tumorigenesis effect equal to that of IFN-based therapy and reduced the risk of HCC recurrence.
