Interpreting disease-causing variants, especially in noncoding regions by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), has become one of the most challenging and demanding tasks. We hypothesized that functional lncRNAs variants in GWAS-identified loci might alter expression level of genes associated with persistent HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Integrated bioinformatics approaches were used to prioritize potentially functional variants and a two-stage case-control study (2473 HBV positive HCC patients, 2248 persistent HBV carriers and 2294 spontaneously recovered subjects) was performed to assess the roles of these variants. The rs2844512 G > C variant in LINC01149 was identified to facilitate HBV spontaneous recovery (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.77-0.92) but increase the risk of HCC (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.11-1.32) in combined samples. Subsequent biological assays indicated this variant created a binding site for miR-128-3p and upregulated MICA expression by serving as a miRNA sponge, which might recruit NK-cells to lyse infected cells, but release highly soluble MICA by shedding to induce NK-cells exhaustion and tumor immune evasion. These findings highlight a regulatory circuit between LINC01149 and MICA, mediating by miR-128-3p, and the important role of upregulated MICA in conferring susceptibility to persistent HBV infection and HCC.
