A white nodule was detected in the liver of a wild female sika deer. The nodule was histologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and it transitioned into a hyperplastic and chronically inflamed intrahepatic bile duct showing Fasciola infection. Therefore, the tumor was demonstrated to have originated from the biliary epithelium of the intrahepatic bile duct. Hyperplastic and chronic inflammatory changes of the biliary epithelium might have contributed the carcinogenesis of the present case, as proposed in human primary intrahepatic SCC cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of primary intrahepatic SCC in an animal.
