Purpose:To evaluate the capability of T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to monitor electrolytic ablation-induced cell death in real time.Materials and methods:Agarose phantoms arranged as an electrolytic cell were exposed to varying quantities of electric charge under constant current to create a pH series. The pH phantoms were subjected to T2-weighted imaging with region of interest quantitation of the acquired signal intensity. Subsequently, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells encapsulated in an agarose gel matrix were subjected to 10 V of electrolytic ablation for variable lengths of time with and without concurrent T2-weighted MR imaging. Cellular death was confirmed by a fluorescent reporter. Finally, to confirm that real-time MR images corresponded to ablation zones, 10 V electrolytic ablations were performed followed by the addition of pH-neutralizing 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer.Results:Analysis of MR imaging from agarose gel pH phantoms demonstrated a relationship between signal intensity and pH at the anodes and cathodes. The steep negative phase of the anode model (pH 2 = 0.916; P < .0001). The addition of HEPES buffer to the hydrogel resulted in complete obliteration of MR imaging-observed ablation zones, confirming that change in pH directly caused the observed signal intensity attenuation of the ablation zone.Conclusions:T2-weighted MR imaging enabled the real-time detection of electrolytic ablation zones, demonstrating a strong correlation with histologic cell death.
