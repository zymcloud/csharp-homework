Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is considered as a major public health problem that, worldwide, chronically affects 170 million people. Elderly patients are more likely than younger patients to have increased duration of infection, increased rate of disease progression, and subsequently increased incidence of advanced liver disease. Natural history models predicted that the prevalence of HCV infection and its chronic sequelae as well as extrahepatic manifestations will eventually increase through the next decade and will mostly affect those who are greater than 60 years of age. Moreover, polytherapy and polypharmacy are frequent in elderly patients due to associated comorbidities. As advanced age is associated with increasing risk of development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, elderly patients are in special need of safe and effective antiviral therapies. Achievement of sustained viral responses (SVR) is associated with reduced liver-related complications and overall mortality in such patients with the advanced liver disease. With the recent introduction of interferon-free direct-acting antivirals, successful treatment for chronic HCV infection had dramatically improved, with overall cure rates that exceed 90% SVR. In our study, we aimed to study the efficacy and safety of combined sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, with or without ribavirin, in management of chronically infected HCV elderly patients who are more than 60 years old.
