Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of water channel transmembrane proteins that play a key role in transcellular water movement and transport. Recent studies have reported that AQPs are involved in cancer biology and can be a novel biomarker for predicting prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify clinical significance and prognostic impact of AQP5 in surgically resected hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). We analyzed the association between the expression of AQP5, Ki-67, and E-cadherin. Immunohistochemical stains for AQP5, KI-67, and E-cadherin were performed on 72 surgically resected HCCs. As a result, 46 patients (63.9%) showed AQP5 expression, 46 patients (63.9%) revealed high expression of Ki-67, and E-cadherin loss was identified in 8 patients (11.1%). No significant relationship among the three markers was found (all P > 0.05). AQP5 expression was associated with tumor multiplicity (P = 0.039), microvascular invasion (P = 0.040), and major vessel invasion (P = 0.044). High expression of Ki-67 was related to high serum AFP level (P = 0.006), tumor grade (P = 0.002), and microvascular invasion (P = 0.040). AQP5 expression tended to be associated with worse overall survival (OS) (P = 0.093) in the univariate analysis, but no significance was found in the multivariate survival analysis. High expression of Ki-67 was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) in both univariate (P = 0.012) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.020). In conclusion, AQP5 might be a prognostic marker in HCC based on its association with tumor multiplicity, microvascular invasion, and major vessel invasion; and Ki-67 is an independent prognostic factor in HCC.
