Background:Mutant KRAS tumors are purported to metastasize differently than wild-type KRAS tumors. The biological heterogeneity of tumors from different parts of the colon are also reported to affect metastasis. This study aims to characterize the metastatic profile by evaluating these factors in unison.Methods:Retrospective analysis of 899 patients with metastatic colorectal cancers treated from January 2010 to December 2014 was conducted. KRAS mutation status and primary tumors location were correlated with single-site metastasis (liver, lung, and peritoneum) and dual-site metastases (liver-peritoneum, liver-lung, and lung-peritoneum). Patients without KRAS analyses were excluded.Results:Right-sided tumors had highest frequency of peritoneal metastasis as compared to left-sided or rectal tumors (34.7% versus 15.8% versus 8.8%, P = 0.00) regardless of KRAS status (32.6% versus 38.5%, P = 0.62). Left-sided tumors with wild-type KRAS had greater proportion of liver metastasis (78.6% versus 53.5%, P = 0.00), whereas those with mutant KRAS had greater proportion of lung metastasis (23.3% versus 8.7%, P = 0.02). Rectal tumors with wild-type KRAS tend to spread to the liver (81.4% versus 48.0%, P = 0.00) and not to the peritoneum (2.3% versus 20.0%, P = 0.01). In dual-site metastases, left-sided tumors with wild-type KRAS had more liver-peritoneal metastases (75.0% versus 29.4%, P = 0.00), whereas mutant KRAS had greater lung-liver metastases (64.7% versus 20.8%, P = 0.01). Rectal tumors had the predilection for lung-liver metastases as compared to right-sided and left-sided tumors (92.3% versus 40.0% versus 39.0%, P = 0.00) regardless of KRAS status (100% versus 75%, P = 0.12).Conclusions:Our results may streamline surveillance programs based on primary tumor location and KRAS mutational status.
