DHX15 is an outstanding member of the DEAH-box RNA helicase family. A few studies suggest that DHX15 contributes to carcinogenesis in several tumor cell lines. However, whether DHX15 acts as an oncogene or tumor suppressor and its association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis are still poorly understood. To address this question, we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate DHX15 expression patterns and their association with clinicopathological factors and the prognosis of patients with HCC. Our results showed that DHX15 expression was significantly higher in cancerous tissues than that in nontumor tissues (P
