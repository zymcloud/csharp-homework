Background:The survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly variable due to heterogeneous tumoral characteristics. We proposed and validated an albumin-bilirubin (ALBI)-based model for HCC beyond Milan criteria, the ALBI-HOME, for these patients.Methods:A total of 2186 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the derivation cohort (n = 1093) and validation cohort (n = 1093). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine significant prognostic factors in the derivation cohort. The performance of ALBI-HOME was evaluated in the validation cohort.Results:In the Cox model, six factors were identified as independent predictors of poor survival: ALBI grade 2 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.848, 95% confidence incidence (CI) 1.556-2.195, p 3 (HR 1.503, 95% CI 1.294-1.746, p < 0.001), ascites (HR 1.400, 95% CI 1.187-1.561, p < 0.001), performance status 0-1 (HR 1.756, 95% CI 1.485-2.076 p < 0.001), and vascular invasion or metastasis (HR 2.110, 95% CI 1.809-2.0, p < 0.001). The ALBI-HOME is based on these six parameters, and the score ranges from 0 to 7. This model was associated with the best prognostic ability among different HCC staging systems to predict survival in patients beyond Milan criteria; its ability remained consistently stable in different treatment subgroups and viral etiologies.Conclusions:The proposed ALBI-HOME is a simple and feasible predictive model for HCC beyond Milan criteria. It demonstrates superior prognostic performance among the currently used staging systems and may help identify at-risk patients to undergo more aggressive treatments.
