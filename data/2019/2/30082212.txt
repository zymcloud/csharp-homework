Background:Serum prealbumin is a sensitive and stable marker for nutritional status and liver function. Whether preoperative prealbumin level is associated with long-term prognosis in patients undergoing liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear.Methods:Patients who underwent liver resection for HCC between 2001 and 2014 at six institutions were enrolled. These patients were divided into the low and normal prealbumin groups using a cut-off value of 170 mg/L for preoperative prealbumin level. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between them.Results:In 1483 patients, 437 (29%) had a low prealbumin level. The 3- and 5-year OS and RFS rates of patients in the low-prealbumin group were 57 and 31%, and 40 and 20%, respectively, which were significantly poorer than those in the normal-prealbumin group (76 and 43%, and 56 and 28%, respectively, both p Conclusions:Preoperative prealbumin level could be used in predicting long-term prognosis for patients undergoing liver resection for HCC.
