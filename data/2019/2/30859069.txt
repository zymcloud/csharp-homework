The present study investigated the individual and combined impact of organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and manganese (Mn), a naturally occurring trace metal, on hepatorenal function in adult rats. The four experimental groups namely control, CPF alone (5 mg/kg), Mn alone (10 mg/kg) and the co-exposure group consisted of eight rats which were orally gavage for 14 consecutive days. Following sacrifice, the biomarkers of hepatorenal damage, antioxidant enzyme activities, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity as well as levels of nitric oxide, reactive oxygen and nitrogen (RONS) species and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were analysed spectrophotometrically. Further, the concentration of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and caspase-3 activity were assessed using ELISA. Results showed that the CPF-induced increase in biomarkers of hepatorenal toxicity were significantly (p < 0.05) alleviated in rats co-expose to CPF and Mn. Moreover, the decrease in antioxidant status as well as the elevation in RONS and LPO were significantly assuaged in rats co-treated with CPF and Mn. In addition, CPF mediated increase in TNF-α, IL-1β and caspase-3 activity were significantly diminished in the liver and kidney of rats co-exposed to CPF and Mn. Light microscopic examination evidenced that the severity of histopathological lesions induced by CPF were alleviated in rats co-exposed to CPF and Mn. In conclusion, the results highlight that co-exposure to CPF and Mn in rats assuaged CPF-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and caspase-3 activation in the liver and kidney of the rats.
