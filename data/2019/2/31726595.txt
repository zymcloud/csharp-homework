We performed a transcriptome-based bioassay (TSB assay) using human hepatoma HepG2 cells to evaluate the potential toxicity of whole wastewater effluents from two membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and a conventional activated sludge process (AS). The biologically active agent(s) in the wastewater effluents were characterized based on expression of the marker genes (i.e., CYP1A1, AKR1B10, GCLM and GPX2) selected by DNA microarray analysis, after the wastewater effluent samples were concentrated by a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane and further fractionated by various manipulations. The qPCR assay of marker genes demonstrated that the induction of CYP1A1 and GPX2 was mitigated after passing through C18 and chelate columns. In addition, clear induction of CYP1A1 was observed in the smallest size fraction with 1 k Da or smaller organic molecules in all the tested effluents. These results together with the water quality data of the fractionated samples suggested that responsible constituents for potentially adverse and abnormal transcriptomic responses in HepG2 could have hydrophobic nature and act with metal-dissolved organic matter (DOM) complexes in 1 k Da or smaller size fraction. Although DOM is known to play two contradictory roles as a protector and an inducer of toxicants, our present study indicated the DOM in wastewater effluent, particularly humic substances with acidic nature, functioned as a toxicity inducer of residual chemicals in the effluents. This study provided a new insight into the nature of "toxic unknowns" in the wastewater effluents, which should be monitored whole through the reclamation process and prioritized for removal.
