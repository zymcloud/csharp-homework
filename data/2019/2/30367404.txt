Important regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently found, and reported as useful biomarkers in cancer. To identify a potential expression of the new discovered lncRNA (ARA), during promotes cell proliferation, apoptosis inhibit, migration and cell cycle arrest, we firstly evaluate its expression in two cancer tissues (breast cancer and liver cancer) and then compared its variability expression in tumor versus non-tumor samples. Expression profile of ARA lncRNA was evaluated using qRT-PCR in paired tumor and marginal non-tumor samples collected from patients who had been referred to the Shiraz General. After RNA extraction from tissue samples, cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR method were performed according to the protocols. ARA lncRNA expression level was calculated using 2-ΔΔCt method. Principal-component analysis followed by receiver operating characteristic curve analyses was performed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of selected lncRNA. Our data revealed a significant upregulation (P < 0.001) of ARA in breast and liver tumor tissues, in comparison to same patients non-tumor marginal samples. Also, there was a significant difference between the expression of ARA lncRNA in breast cancer and liver cancer patients (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results of our study suggest a possible role of ARA lncRNA in proliferation of breast and liver tissues, as well as its potential usefulness as a novel diagnostic biomarker for breast and liver tumors.
