Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal oncogenic disorder with few therapeutic options. Novel therapeutic strategy with combination of a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PAL) with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib (SOR) is reported to impair tumour growth and significantly increased survival in various preclinical models of HCC. In the current work a sensitive and rapid UHPLC-QTOF-MS method was established for the concurrent quantification of PAL and SOR in rat plasma using ibrutinib as internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was carried out on an Agilent Poroshell EC C18 (50 mm × 3 mm, 2.7 μm) using gradient mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile. Flow rate of 0. 45 mL/min with a run time of 5 min was used for separation. A simple sample preparation approach of protein precipitation was used in the current study. The mass spectrometric analysis of selective ions at [M + H]+m/z 448.2455 for PAL, m/z 465.0936 for SOR and m/z 441.2034 for IS was monitored with extracted ion chromatography. The LC-MS method meets the regulatory bio-analytical guidelines, exhibited good sensitivity and linearity over the range of 1.0-2000.0 ng/mL for PAL and SOR. The pharmacokinetic parameters of PAL remained unchanged when SOR was co-administered with PAL. The study pointed out that the co-intake of PAL with SOR resulted in a slight increment of Cmax (11.21%) and AUC (7.95%) levels of SOR when co-administered with PAL when compared to individual oral intake in SD rats. The current method provides a modern rapid and sensitive tool for pharmacokinetic studies of PAL and SOR in a pre-clinical set up.
