Purpose:Chronic hepatitis C infection and its treatment can considerably affect patients' health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). This study aimed to identify and summarise the current evidence base for health state utility values (HSUVs) in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, generated using the EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire.Methods:MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and EconLit were searched from database inception through 31 August 2017. Eligible studies reported HSUVs elicited using the EQ-5D questionnaire in adults with chronic hepatitis C infection. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed.Results:Of 1480 records identified, 26 studies were included. The most commonly defined health states described different stages of chronic hepatitis C infection and specific liver-related disease states, including METAVIR score, compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. Patients with higher METAVIR scores tended to have lower EQ-5D scores compared to patients with lower METAVIR scores. Patients that achieved sustained virologic responses tended to have higher EQ-5D scores compared to those that did not. A meta-analysis conducted on three studies confirmed that patients with decompensated cirrhosis have significantly lower HSUVs than patients with compensated cirrhosis [mean difference - 0.11 (95% CI - 0.19 to - 0.04)], implying worse HRQoL. However, there was not sufficient evidence to compare how different treatments for chronic hepatitis C infection affect EQ-5D scores.Conclusions:This study provides a summary of EQ-5D HSUVs for patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, and demonstrates that clinically important disease stages associated with treatment decisions are associated with differences in HRQoL.
