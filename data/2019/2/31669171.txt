Visfain has been extensively studied in mammals and has been shown to play an important role in obesity and insulin resistance. However, there is a paucity of information on visfatin regulation in non-mammalian species. After characterization of chicken visfatin gene, we undertook this study to determine its hormonal regulation in avian (non-mammalian) liver cells. Addition of 5 ng/mL TNFα, 100 ng/mL leptin, 1, 3, 10 or 100 ng/mL T3 for 24 h upregulated visfatin gene expression by 1.2, 1.8, 1.95, 1.75, 1.80, and 2.45 folds (P < .05), respectively, compared to untreated LMH cells. Administration of 10 ng/mL of orexin A significantly down regulated visfatin gene expression by 1.35 folds compared to control cells. In contrast, treatment with IL-6 or orexin B for 24 h did not influence visfatin mRNA abundance. These pro-inflammatory cytokines and obesity-related hormones modulate the expression of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptors. Hepatic CRP gene expression was significantly upregulated by IL-6, TNFα, orexin B, and T3 and down regulated by leptin and orexin A. LXR mRNA abundances were increased by orexin A, decreased by orexin B, and T3, and did not affected by IL6, TNFα, or leptin. The expression of FXR gene was induced by IL-6, leptin, and T3, but it was not influenced by TNFα, orexin A or B. CXR gene expression was up regulated by TNFα, leptin, orexin B, and T3, down regulated by 5 ng/mL orexin A, and did not affected by IL-6. INSIG2 mRNA levels were increased by TNFα (5 ng/mL), leptin (100 ng/mL), and T3 (1, 3, 10, and 100 ng/mL), decreased by orexin A, and remained unchanged with IL-6 or orexin B treatment. Together, this is the first report showing hormonal regulation of visfatin in avian hepatocyte cells and suggesting a potential role of CRP, INSIG2, and nuclear orphan receptor LXR, FXR, and CXR in mediating these hormonal effects.
