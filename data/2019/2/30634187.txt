The Child-Pugh classification is one of the commonest and oldest bedside tools utilized in estimating prognosis in patients with cirrhosis. However, its usage as a risk prediction tool or indeed a decision-making tool should be revisited. In this review, we discuss some inherent issues with the Child-Pugh classification and present a few contexts in which the current usage of Child-Pugh warrants reassessment, elaborating on its utility in acute variceal bleeding, specifically its role in decision-making on early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, as well as its use in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma and drug development and dose adjustment.
