Phosphoinositide membrane signaling is critical for normal physiology, playing well-known roles in diverse human pathologies. The basic mechanisms governing phosphoinositide signaling within the nucleus, however, have remained deeply enigmatic owing to their presence outside the nuclear membranes. Over 40% of nuclear phosphoinositides can exist in this non-membrane state, held soluble in the nucleoplasm by nuclear proteins that remain largely unidentified. Recently, two nuclear proteins responsible for solubilizing phosphoinositides were identified, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1; NR5A1) and liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2), along with two enzymes that directly remodel these phosphoinositide/protein complexes, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; MMAC) and inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK; ipk2). These new footholds now permit the assignment of physiological functions for nuclear phosphoinositides in human diseases, such as endometriosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/steatohepatitis, glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The unique nature of nuclear phosphoinositide signaling affords extraordinary clinical opportunities for new biomarkers, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Thus, phosphoinositide biology within the nucleus may represent the next generation of low-hanging fruit for new drugs, not unlike what has occurred for membrane phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase drug development. This review connects recent basic science discoveries in nuclear phosphoinositide signaling to clinical pathologies, with the hope of inspiring development of new therapies.
