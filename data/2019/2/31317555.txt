In the last decade, circular RNAs (circRNAs) emerge as important regulators in multiple biological processes. Lately, it is reported hsa_circRNA_103809 could play vital parts in several types of cancers. Based on the analysis of GEO data (GSE97332), hsa_circRNA_103809 was found to be dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the biological function and underlying regulatory mechanisms of hsa_circRNA_103809 in HCC remain unclear. Our results suggested that hsa_circRNA_103809 was overexpressed in HCC patients, and hsa_circRNA_103809 knockdown remarkably inhibited the proliferation, cycle progression, and migration of HCC cells. The investigations of molecular showed that hsa_circRNA_103809 could elevate the protein expression of a miR-377-3p target, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), through interacting with miR-377-3p and decreasing its expression level. Additionally, in vivo assays revealed hsa_circRNA_103809 short hairpin RNA served as a tumor suppressor through downregulating FGFR1 in HCC. This study systematically investigated novel regulatory signaling of hsa_circRNA_103809/miR-377-3p/FGFR1 axis, providing insights into hepatocellular carcinoma treatment from bench to clinic.
