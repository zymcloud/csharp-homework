Since antiquity, numerous macrofungi are being worshiped as food and natural medicine especially in Asian tribal communities. Recent investigation has correlated these medicinal properties with bioactive components including phenols and flavonoids. However, research on mushrooms is not satisfactory; as several traditionally prized members remain undiscovered or poorly explored yet. This backdrop tempted us to unveil secondary metabolites empowered with therapeutics from an ethnic delicacy, Russula alatoreticula that was justified as a novel macrofungus in our previous publication. Accordingly, methanol extract was prepared from dried basidiocarps that was found to be enriched with phenolic compounds (pyrogallol > cinnamic acid > p-coumaric acid) and ascorbic acid. As a result, the fraction exhibited strong antioxidant activity evident by the ability of quenching free radicals, chelating Fe2+ ion and reducing components with EC50 of 263-2382 µg/ml. Besides, effective antibacterial potential against six investigated microbes was also noticed where MIC value ranged from 99 to 2673.74 µg/ml. Furthermore, the extract revealed promising anticancer property as it induced apoptosis of Hep3B cell (IC50 358.57 µg/ml) by imparting morphological changes, interfering cell cycle, depleting MMP and alleviating ROS through Bax, Bcl2, caspases 9 and 3 intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Overall study implied that the immense bioactive potential of R. alatoreticula could possibly be utilized as a good source of natural supplement to combat against free radicals, pathogenic bacteria and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as in food safety industry.
