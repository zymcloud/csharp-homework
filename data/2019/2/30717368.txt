Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prime public health concern that accounts for most of the primary liver malignancies in humans. The most common etiological factor of HCC is hepatitis B virus (HBV). Despite recent advances in treatment strategies, there has been little success in improving the survival of HCC patients. To develop a novel therapeutic approach, evaluation of a working hypothesis based on different viewpoints might be important. Long interspersed element 1 (L1) retrotransposons have been suggested to play a role in HCC. However, the molecular machineries that can modulate L1 biology in HBV-related HCC have not been well-evaluated. Here, we summarize the profiles of expression and/or activation status of L1-related genes in HBV-related HCC, and HBV- and HCC-related genes that may impact L1-mediated tumorigenesis. L1 restriction factors appear to be suppressed by HBV infection. Since some of the L1 restriction factors also limit HBV, these factors may be exhausted in HBV-infected cells, which causes de-suppression of L1. Several HBV- and HCC-related genes that interact with L1 can affect oncogenic processes. Thus, L1 may be a novel prime therapeutic target for HBV-related HCC. Studies in this area will provide insights into HCC and other types of cancers.
