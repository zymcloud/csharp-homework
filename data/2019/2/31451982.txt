Background:Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is progressive and can cause end-stage liver disease necessitating a liver transplant (LT). PBC patients may be disadvantaged on LT waitlist due to MELD-based priority listing or other factors.Aim:The aim was to assess waitlist duration, waitlist mortality, and post-LT outcomes of PBC patients.Methods:The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data for 1994-2016 was utilized. Adult patients with PBC without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were selected. Their clinico-demographic parameters and waitlist and post-transplant outcomes were compared to those of patients with hepatitis C (HCV) without HCC.Results:Out of 223,391 listings for LT in 1994-2016, 8133 (3.6%) was for PBC without HCC. Mean age was 55.5 years, 76.9% white, 86.2% female, mean MELD score 21, 6.6% retransplants. There were 52,017 patients with hepatitis C included for comparison. The mean waitlist mortality was 17.9% for PBC and 17.6% for HCV (p > 0.05). The average transplantation rate was 57.7% for PBC and 53.3% for HCV (p 0.05). There was no significant difference in median waiting duration till transplantation between PBC patients and HCV after 2002 (103 vs. 95 days, p > 0.05). Post-LT mortality and graft loss rates were significantly lower in PBC than in HCV patients (all p Conclusions:Despite no evidence of impaired waitlist outcomes and favorable post-transplant survival in patients with PBC, there is still a high waitlist dropout rate suggesting the presence of an unmet need for effective treatment.
