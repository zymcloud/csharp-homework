H1 histamine receptor (H1HR) belongs to the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors. Recent studies have shown that H1HR expression is increased in several types of cancer. However, its functional roles in tumor progression remain largely unknown, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that H1HR is frequently unregulated in HCC, which is significantly associated with both recurrence-free survival and overall survival in HCC patients. Functional experiments revealed that H1HR promoted both the growth and metastasis of HCC cells by inducing cell cycle progression, formation of lamellipodia, production of matrix metalloproteinase 2, and suppression of cell apoptosis. Activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A was found to be involved in H1HR-mediated HCC cell growth and metastasis. In addition, we found that overexpression of H1HR was mainly due to the downregulation of miR-940 in HCC cells. Moreover, the H1HR inhibitor terfenadine significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in an HCC xenograft nude mice model. Our findings demonstrate that H1HR plays a critical role in the growth and metastasis of HCC cells, which provides experimental evidence supporting H1HR as a potential drug target for the treatment of HCC.
