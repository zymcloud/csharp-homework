Alcohol-related liver disease is the most prevalent type of chronic liver disease worldwide, accounting for 30% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases and HCC-specific deaths. Alcohol has been associated with an increased risk of several malignancies, this risk starting at doses as low as 10 g/1 unit/day. The carcinogenic process includes direct acetaldehyde toxicity through the formation of protein and DNA adducts, an increased production of reactive oxygen species, changes to lipid peroxidation and metabolism, inflammation and an impaired immune response and modifications to DNA methylation. A high annual incidence of HCC has been observed in large European cohorts of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, reaching 2.9%, with numerous host factors modulating this risk (age, gender, liver failure, genetic polymorphisms affecting oncogenic pathways). Because of impaired surveillance and poor patient compliance, HCC is often detected late in patients with chronic liver disease of alcoholic aetiology. This delay in detection, which is frequently made in the context of advanced liver cirrhosis rather than in surveillance programmes, results in more advanced HCC that is less amenable to curative treatment. Consequently, patients with alcohol-related HCC generally have a worse prognosis than those with non-alcoholic HCC.
