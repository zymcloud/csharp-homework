MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in tumorigenesis, progression, recurrence and drug resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, few miRNAs have been identified and entered clinical practice. Herein, we report that miR-29a is downregulated in tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) and has an important function in liver T-ICs. Functional studies revealed that miR-29a knockdown promotes liver T-ICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Conversely, a forced miR-29a expression inhibits liver T-ICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, we find that miR-29a downregulates Bcl-2 via binding its mRNA 3'UTR in liver T-ICs. The correlation between miR-29a and Bcl-2 is validated in human HCC tissues. Furthermore, the miR-29a expression determines the responses of hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment. Analysis of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) further demonstrated that the miR-29a high patients are more sensitive to sorafenib treatment. In conclusion, our findings revealed the crucial role of the miR-29a in liver T-ICs expansion and sorafenib response, rendering miR-29a as an optimal target for the prevention and intervention of HCC.
