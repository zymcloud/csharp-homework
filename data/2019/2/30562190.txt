Hepatocellular carcinoma rarely involves the major bile duct. Here, we reported a 46-year-old man with liver cancer who underwent FDG PET/CT for staging. The images showed abnormal FDG uptake in the left lobe and hilum of the liver, which was confirmed as hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic portal bile duct tumor thrombus, respectively, by the pathology.
