Aim:To analyse incidence, treatment and outcomes of paediatric liver malignancies in Finland during 1987-2017.Methods:Medical records and national cancer registry data of 47 children with liver malignancies were reviewed. Survival was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:During follow-up, liver malignancy incidence remained stable at 1.1:106 . Altogether, 42 patients with hepatoblastoma (n = 24), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 11) and undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (n = 7) underwent surgery at median age 4.6 (interquartile range, 2.0-9.6) years and were followed up for 13 (7.0-19) years. Cumulative 5-year survival was 86% for hepatoblastoma, 41% for hepatocellular carcinoma and 67% for undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma. Five-year survival was decreased among hepatoblastoma patients aged â‰¥ 2.4 years (73% versus 100%, P = .040), with PRETreatment EXTent of disease IV (PRETEXT, 60% vs 100%, P = .004), and with recurrent disease (67% vs 88%, P = .029). Recurrent/residual disease associated with decreased 5-year survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (0% vs 83%, P = .028). Survival was similar among 19 transplanted and 23 resected patients. In total, 14 deaths occurred either for the underlying malignancy (n = 8), adverse effects of chemotherapy (n = 5) or unrelated reasons (n = 1).Conclusion:Outcomes for PRETEXT I-III hepatoblastoma and un-metastasized hepatocellular carcinoma were encouraging. Adverse effects of chemotherapy significantly contributed to mortality.
