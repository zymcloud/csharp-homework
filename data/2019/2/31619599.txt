We herein report a 48-year-old healthy woman who visited our hospital to investigate a 25-mm space-occupying lesion in the liver. The tumor was irregularly shaped and exhibited heterogeneous enhancement on dynamic computed tomography (CT). Whole-body positron emission tomography-CT showed an abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the liver tumor, with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.82. During the ensuing three months, the tumor grew rapidly and the serum alpha-fetoprotein levels also rose; partial hepatectomy was therefore performed. Microscopic findings revealed a moderately-to-poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma in the normal liver.
alpha-fetoprotein; normal liver; poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma; risk factors.
