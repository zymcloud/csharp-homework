Background: Clinical studies evaluating direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment show sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR12) rates >90%. However, there are few elderly patients included in these studies; thus, generalizability of high success rates to patients >70 years old cannot be assumed. Objective: To identify treatment differences between elderly and nonelderly patients. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients who were treated with DAAs between June 2014 and September 2016 at our institution. Patients were divided into 2 groups: elderly, age â‰¥70 years at the time of initiation of DAAs, and nonelderly, <70 years. The primary outcome was achievement of SVR12. Results: Among the 551 patients, 60 with age range 70 to 86 years comprised the elderly group. SVR12 rates were significantly lower in the elderly population, especially in those with liver cirrhosis. SVR12 was achieved in 81% of the elderly group as compared with 95% in the nonelderly group. Among cirrhotic patients, 69.4% in the elderly group, and 94.1% in the nonelderly group achieved SVR12. Binary logistic regression modeling showed age >70 years to be the strongest predictor of treatment failure (odds ratio = 3.4), along with diagnosis of cirrhosis (odds ratio = 2.4), when corrected for gender, race, prior treatment experience, genotype, and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion and Relevance: Lower SVR12 was seen in elderly cirrhotic patients (69.4%), who are at higher risk of complications related to advanced liver disease and untreated HCV infection, highlighting the need to treat patients before cirrhosis develops.
