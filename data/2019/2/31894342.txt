In recent years, the important role of long non‑​coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development of liver cancer has received increasing attention. The abnormal expression level of long non‑coding RNAs has been associated with the occurrence and development of liver cancer. However, the role and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in the development and progression of liver cancer are not fully understood. The present study aimed to clarify the function and molecular mechanism of lncRNA brain cytoplasmic 200 (BC200) in liver cancer. In the present study, it was found that BC200 expression level was higher in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues than that in adjacent tissues. Cell function was examined by constructing BC200 knockout (KO) and BC200‑overexpression in vitro models. It was found that BC200 affected the proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells. Interestingly, it was found that BC200 affected the expression of c‑Myc protein but did not affect the mRNA expression level of c‑MYC. BC200 KO cells exhibited a reduced protein expression level of Bax protein and an increased protein expression level of Bcl‑xL. Conversely, BC200 overexpression reduced the expression of Bcl‑xL protein and increased the expression of Bax protein. Importantly, it was found that BC200 affected the formation of subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. In conclusion, the present results suggested that lncRNA BC200 may play an important role in liver cancer.
