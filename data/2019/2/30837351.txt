Hepatocellular adenomas (HA) are benign naturally occurring masses that are rarely reported, and rarely reaching tumor size up to 30 cm. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and usually caused by cirrhosis and more commonly reported tumors in males. It has been reported that presentations may occur with masses that are often less than 5 cm or rarely more than 10 cm. We aimed to present a case of hepatocellular carcinoma 72-years old man with fatigue and pain spread on the right upper quadrant; a histopathologic image similar to both telangiectatic variant hepatic adenoma and false diagnosis as "cavernous hemangioma" in the first biopsy specimen. KEY WORDS: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Liver Adenoma.
