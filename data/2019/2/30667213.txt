Orlistat has been proved to be an effective fatty acid synthase inhibitor that is able to inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis in many cancer cell types. However, the anticancer effects of orlistat on hepatocellular carcinoma are undefined. We found that orlistat inhibited cell growth and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest with increased cyclin D, cyclin E, and p21 expression in human hepatoma Hep3B cells. Furthermore, protein expression of cyclin A, cyclin B, Cdk1, Cdk2, and Cdk4 was reduced by orlistat. This study investigated the role of lipid metabolism on orlistat-induced human hepatoma Hep3B cell death. The decrease in the expression of key enzymes in fatty acid metabolism, including FASN, ACOT8, PPT1, FABP1, CPT1 and CPT2, was observed after orlistat treatment. We also demonstrated that peroxisomal activity was involved in the orlistat-induced Hep3B cell death. In this study, we established an in vitro model to investigate the effect of orlistat on lipid accumulation. We found that orlistat significantly inhibited the cellular lipid content when administered in fatty acid overload conditions in Hep3B cells. Combination treatment of orlistat and paclitaxel was able to induce a synergistic effect on growth inhibition and cell apoptosis in Hep3B cells. Our data suggested that orlistat displays antitumor activity and enhances the efficacy of paclitaxel in Hep3B cells.
