FAM122A is a highly conserved protein in mammals, however its function is still largely unknown so far. In this study, we investigated the potential role of FAM122A in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By analyzing HCC patient cohorts from RNA sequencing datasets, we found the expression level of FAM122A mRNA is significantly upregulated in HCC patients. Moreover, this abnormally higher expression pattern of FAM122A protein was also found in partial HCC tumor tissues, compared with the normal parts. Further, we demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FAM122A knockout significantly inhibits the growth, clonogenic potential and xenografts of HCC cells, induces cell cycle arrest and reduces the expression of proliferation-related genes. Interestingly, FAM122A deletion significantly enhances the cytotoxicity effect of Doxorubicin (Dox), a drug used in standard chemotherapy in HCC patients. In contrary, overexpression of FAM122A not only promotes HCC cell growth, but also inhibits Dox-induced DNA damage and cell death. Considering that FAM122A is previously identified as an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A, we asked whether FAM122A regulating HCC cell growth is associated with PP2A. The results showed FAM122A can also modulate PP2A activity in HCC cells although the modulated effect is relatively slight, however, treatment with a PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid did not rescue the inhibitory effects of cell growth and proliferation in FAM122A deletion cells, indicating that FAM122A may support HCC cell growth independent of its ability to modulate PP2A. Collectively, these results suggest that FAM122A is required for maintaining HCC cell growth, and its elimination combined with chemotherapy may represent a potential novel therapeutic strategy for HCC patients.
