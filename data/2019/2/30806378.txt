BACKGROUND The right area and posterior area of the liver are considered relatively unfavorable portions for laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) due to the limited gross inspection and poor tactile feedback. Fusion indocyanine green fluorescence fusion imaging (ICGFI) may be a reliable real-time navigation tool for LH. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of ICGFI for laparoscopic non-anatomical hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma at the right area and posterior area. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective comparison of surgical and perioperative outcomes for 21 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who had undergone LH with fusion ICGFI guidance and 21 matched patients who underwent the procedure without the guidance of ICGFI between November 2017 to August 2018. RESULTS Preoperative characteristics were comparable between the groups. Tumor fluorescence images were clearly displayed in all 21 ICGFI patients, providing precise information about tumor location. Laparoscopic parenchymal transection could be performed safely and quickly through tracing the fusion ICGFI on the cutting surface. Operation time was significantly reduced in the ICGFI group. Postoperative complications were comparable between the groups. There was no positive margin in either group. CONCLUSIONS These preliminary data suggest that fusion ICGFI may be a useful tool that provides real-time navigation for non-anatomical LH. It may assist in the safe and accurate completion of LH for tumors located at the right posterior areas. Further studies are needed to fully clarify the advantages and disadvantages of ICGFI in LH, including short-term perioperative outcomes and long-term prognosis.
