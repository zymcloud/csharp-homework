Background:Chronic Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection results in the most severe form of viral hepatitis with a rapid progression to cirrhosis. However, non-invasive fibrosis tests that can accurately predict cirrhosis have not been adequately validated. We aimed to develop a clinically useful non-invasive score that can accurately detect cirrhosis.Material and methods:Patients with chronic HDV diagnosed by liver histology or serum PCR were evaluated. Data regarding demographics, laboratory, imaging, vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), and liver biopsy were collected. The total cohort was randomized into a training and validation cohort. The training cohort was used to develop a novel score, the Delta-4 fibrosis score (D4FS) which was then compared to other non-invasive tests in the validation cohort by area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROC).Results:77 patients with chronic HDV were evaluated: mean age 42.6 (SD:11.1) years, 59.7% male, and 57.1% Asian. The total cohort was then separated into a training (n = 45) and validation (n = 32) cohort with no significant differences in terms of clinical characteristics between the two. From the training cohort, the D4FS was derived from variables of statistical and clinical interest (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), platelet count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and liver stiffness measurement (LSM)). The D4FS demonstrated the best AUROC in the validation cohort (0.94) followed by VCTE (0.90), FIB-4 (0.86), APRI (0.81), and AAR (0.71).Discussion:The D4FS is a clinically useful non-invasive fibrosis score that can accurately detect cirrhosis in patients with chronic HDV infection. Further studies should be performed to further validate clinical utility.
