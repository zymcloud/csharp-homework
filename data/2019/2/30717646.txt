Background:Although in silico drug discovery is necessary for drug development, two major strategies, a structure-based and ligand-based approach, have not been completely successful. Currently, the third approach, inference of drug candidates from gene expression profiles obtained from the cells treated with the compounds under study requires the use of a training dataset. Here, the purpose was to develop a new approach that does not require any pre-existing knowledge about the drug-protein interactions, but these interactions can be inferred by means of an integrated approach using gene expression profiles obtained from the cells treated with the analysed compounds and the existing data describing gene-gene interactions.Results:In the present study, using tensor decomposition-based unsupervised feature extraction, which represents an extension of the recently proposed principal-component analysis-based feature extraction, gene sets and compounds with a significant dose-dependent activity were screened without any training datasets. Next, after these results were combined with the data showing perturbations in single-gene expression profiles, genes targeted by the analysed compounds were inferred. The set of target genes thus identified was shown to significantly overlap with known target genes of the compounds under study.Conclusions:The method is specifically designed for large-scale datasets (including hundreds of treatments with compounds), not for conventional small-scale datasets. The obtained results indicate that two compounds that have not been extensively studied, WZ-3105 and CGP-60474, represent promising drug candidates targeting multiple cancers, including melanoma, adenocarcinoma, liver carcinoma, and breast, colon, and prostate cancers, which were analysed in this in silico study.
