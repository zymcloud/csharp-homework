miR-15b-5p has frequently been reported to function as a biomarker in some malignancies; however, the function of miR-15b-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its molecular mechanism are still not well understood. The present study was designed to confirm the clinical value of miR-15b-5p and further explore its underlying molecular mechanism. A comprehensive investigation of the clinical value of miR-15b-5p in HCC was investigated by data mining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets as well as literature. In addition, intersected target genes of miR-15b-5p were predicted using the miRWalk database and differentially expressed genes of HCC from TCGA. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were carried out. Then, a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed to reveal the interactions between some hub target genes of miR-15b-5p. The miR-15b-5p expression level in HCC was predominantly overexpressed compared with non-HCC tissues samples (SMD=0.618, 95% CI: 0.207, 1.029; P
