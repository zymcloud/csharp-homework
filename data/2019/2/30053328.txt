Mitochondria lie at the heart of innate immunity, and aberrant mitochondrial activity contributes to immune activation and chronic inflammatory diseases, including liver cancers. Mitophagy is a selective process for removing dysfunctional mitochondria. The link between mitophagy and inflammation in tumorigenesis remains largely unexplored. We observed that FUN14 domain-containing 1 (FUNDC1), a previously characterized mitophagy receptor, accumulates in most human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and we thus explored the role of FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy in HCC initiation and progression in a mouse model in which HCC is induced by the chemical carcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN). We showed that specific knockout of FUNDC1 in hepatocytes promotes the initiation and progression of DEN-induced HCC, whereas FUNDC1 transgenic hepatocytes protect against development of HCC. Hepatocyte-specific FUNDC1 ablation results in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and triggers a cascade of events involving inflammasome activation and hyperactivation of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. Specifically, cytosolic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release and caspase-1 activation are increased in FUNDC1-depleted hepatocytes. This subsequently results in the elevated release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL1β) and hyperproliferation of hepatocytes. Conclusion: Our results suggest that FUNDC1 suppresses HCC initiation by reducing inflammasome activation and inflammatory responses in hepatocytes, whereas up-regulation of FUNDC1 expression at the late stage of tumor development may benefit tumor growth. Our study thus describes a mechanistic link between mitophagic modulation of inflammatory response and tumorigenesis, and further implies that FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy and its related inflammatory response may represent a therapeutic target for liver cancer.
