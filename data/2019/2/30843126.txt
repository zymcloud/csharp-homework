A quick access tool for the one-pot, chromatography-free synthesis of the diversified dihydrospiro[indeno[1,2-b]pyridine-4,3'-indoline or acenaphthylene-1,4'-indeno[1,2-b]pyridine spiro-analogous via sustainable microwave condition in minimal 1:1 (v/v) aqueous ethanol without any metal catalyst is demonstrated here. This permutated spiro-casing was designed as fluorescence probe at physiological pH for selective detection of Zn2+, even in the presence of other competitive ions and showed a fluorescent enhancement with 1:1 metal/ligand complex. Moreover, this spiro sensor was successfully applied as an effective intracellular Zn2+ imaging agent in the biomedical study of human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) due to its cell permeability property. A quick access technique for the permutated dihydrospiro-pyridine via chromatography-free sustainable microwave condition and its applications as organic fluorescence probe at physiological pH for selective detection of Zn2+ and effective intracellular Zn2+ imaging in HepG2 cells.
