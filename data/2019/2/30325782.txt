Objective:To assess the performance of ultrasound surveillance for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HIV-infected patients.Methods:The GEHEP-002 cohort recruits HCC cases diagnosed in HIV-infected patients from 32 centers across Spain. The proportion of 'ultrasound lack of detection', defined as HCC diagnosed within the first 3 months after a normal surveillance ultrasound, and the proportion of 'surveillance failure', defined as cases in which surveillance failed to detect HCC at early stage, were assessed. To assess the impact of HIV, a control population of 104 HCC cases diagnosed in hepatitis C virus-monoinfected patients during the study period was used.Results:A total of 186 (54%) out of 346 HCC cases in HIV-infected patients were diagnosed within an ultrasound surveillance program. Ultrasound lack of detection occurred in 16 (8.6%) of them. Ultrasound surveillance failure occurred in 107 (57%) out of 186 cases diagnosed by screening, whereas this occurred in 18 (29%) out of 62 diagnosed in the control group (P Conclusion:The performance of ultrasound surveillance of HCC in HIV-infected patients is very poor and worse than that shown outside HIV infection. A HCC surveillance policy based on ultrasound examinations every 6 months might be insufficient in HIV-infected patients with cirrhosis.
