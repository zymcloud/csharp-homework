Introduction:Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a rare type of high-grade pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor. The study objective is to investigate its survival outcomes, incidence of brain metastases, and patterns of recurrence.Methods:This is a single center study of patients with pathologic diagnosis of pulmonary LCNEC. Patient data were collected retrospectively and analyzed, including survival, incidence of brain metastases, and patterns of recurrence.Results:Of 87 patients (stages I: 24, II: 14, III: 23, IV: 26), 52 were managed curatively and 35 palliatively. The median follow-up time was 17.3 months (range 0.6-89.5) for those treated with curative intent and 7.0 months (range 0.1-28.6) for those treated palliatively. The 2- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates are 48.4% and 25.5% for the curative group, with a median OS of 13.5 months. In the palliative group, the OS are 30.8% at 1 year and 6.8% at 2 years, with a median OS of 7.0 months. Thirty-eight of 52 (73%) patients treated with curative intent had disease relapse, with the common sites being regional lymph nodes (20), brain (18), bones (11), and liver (9). The incidence of brain recurrence among those managed curatively are 21.4% and 41.3%, respectively at 1 and 2 years. Of 18 patients experiencing brain metastases, 14 developed them as part of a first relapse.Conclusions:LCNEC's survival outcomes are poor. The incidence of brain metastases is higher than what is observed for other types of nonsmall cell lung cancers. Prophylactic cranial irradiation should be investigated as a means of improving outcomes.
