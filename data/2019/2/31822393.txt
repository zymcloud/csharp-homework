Background:Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEH) is a rare tumor of vascular origin with an unknown etiology, a low incidence, and a variable natural course. We evaluated the management and prognosis of HEH from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program and changes in treatment modalities of HEH over 30 years.Methods:From 1973 to 2014 in the SEER database, we selected patients diagnosed with HEH. We analyzed the clinical characteristics, patterns of management, and clinical outcomes of patients with HEH.Results:We identified 79 patients with HEH (median age: 54.0 years; male to female ratio: 1:2.6). The initial extent of disease was local in 22 (27.8%) patients, regional metastasis in 22 (27.8%), distant metastasis in 31 (39.2%) and unknown in 4 (5.1%). The median size of primary tumor was 3.85 cm (interquartile range, 2.50-7.93 cm). Among 74 patients with available management data, the most common management was no treatment (29/74, 39.2%), followed by chemotherapy only (22/74, 29.7%), liver resection-based (13/74, 17.6%), and transplantation-based therapy (6/74, 8.1%). The 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was 57.8%. Patients who underwent surgical treatment had significantly higher survival than those who underwent non-surgical treatment (5-year survival; 88% vs. 49%, P = 0.019). Multivariate analysis revealed that surgical therapy was the only independent prognostic factor for survival (hazard ratio: 0.20, P = 0.040).Conclusions:Resection or liver transplantation is worth considering for treatment of patients with HEH.
