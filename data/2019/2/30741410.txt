Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a family of master regulated dimeric transcription factors, signaling transduction pathways are active players in the cell signaling that control vital cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, morphogenesis, angiogenesis, and immune responses. Nevertheless, aberrant regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathways has been associated with a significant number of human cancers. In fact, NF-κB acts as a double-edged sword in the vital cellular processes and carcinogenesis. This review provides an overview on the modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathways by proteins of hepatitis B and C viruses. One of the major NF-κB events that are modulated by these viruses is the induction of hepatocellular carcinoma. Given the central function of NF-κB in carcinogenesis, it has turned out to be a considerable therapeutic target for cancer therapy.
