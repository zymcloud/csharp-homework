Background:Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors because it has excellent contrast resolution. DWI using short tau inversion recovery (STIR) can improve tumor-to-liver contrast after gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) administration that shortens the T1 relaxation of liver parenchyma.Purpose:To quantitatively and qualitatively compare the conspicuity of malignant liver tumors on DWI after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration between STIR and chemical shift selective (CHESS) sequences.Study type:Single-institution retrospective study.Subjects:Fifty-seven patients with histologically confirmed malignant liver tumors were evaluated.Field strength/sequence:Low b-value DWIs with STIR and CHESS sequences 18-20 minutes after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration were acquired at 1.5T.Assessment:Tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and visual grade of tumor conspicuity on DWI between STIR and CHESS sequences were compared.Statistical tests:Paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank-test were applied. P Results:The mean tumor CNR and visual grade of tumor conspicuity on DWI were significantly higher for STIR than for CHESS (both P Data conclusion:DWI using STIR may be more helpful for depicting malignant liver tumors after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration compared with DWI using CHESS.Level of evidence:3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.
