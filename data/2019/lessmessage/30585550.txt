Background:Obesity is characterized by increased long chain fatty acids (LCFA) uptake and impaired lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. Consequently, an enhanced intracellular lipid content, including sphingolipids, may lead to lipotoxicity. It is believed that resveratrol (RSV), one of the most extensively studied plant-derived polyphenols, and its interaction with sphingolipid metabolism may constitute one of the major therapeutic targets for cancer and metabolic diseases treatment.Objective:The aim of this study was to ascertain, whether resveratrol may affect sphingolipid metabolic pathways, enzymes and transporters in a lipid overload state.Methods:The experiments were conducted on hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) incubated with RSV and/or Palmitic Acid (PA) at the concentration of 0.5 mM and 50 ÂµM, respectively for 16h. Intra- and extracellular sphingolipid concentrations were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas liquid chromatography. Moreover, the expression of caspase 3, selected fatty acid transporters and sphingolipid metabolism pathway proteins were estimated by Western Blot.Results:RSV alone and together with PA significantly increased the intracellular concentration of ceramide, sphinganine and sphingosine as well as the expression of enzymes related to de novo ceramide synthesis pathway. Moreover, in our study, we observed augmented ceramide and sphingomyelin efflux into the incubation media in these groups. In addition, RSV substantially reduced intracellular triacylglycerols accumulation in lipid overload conditions.Conclusion:The above-mentioned findings suggest that RSV, at least partially, demonstrates a potential protective effect on HepG2 cells in a lipid overload state.
