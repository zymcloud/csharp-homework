Objectives:The more surgical effort and performing extensive upper abdominal surgery (UAS) are often required to accomplish the highest rates of optimally cytoreduction in patients with ovarian cancer. Nonetheless, the rate of complications increases with extensive surgery. We have studied the upper abdominal surgery complications by Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) and analyzed parameters affecting post-operative severe complications classified through Clavien-Dindo.Material and methods:A retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer from January 1st 2009 to April 30th 2016 was evaluated. Patients who underwent at least one UAS procedure with or without optimal cytoreduction for epithelial ovarian cancer (stage IIIC-IV or recurrent) were included. Postoperative complications were recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification.Results:In total, 58 patients were included. There were 120 UAS procedures performed on the 58 patients. Diaphragm peritonectomy was the most performed surgery (50%, 29/58), and then the other UAS procedures were liver surgery (39.7%, 23/58), cholecystectomy (24.1%, 14/58), splenic surgery (24.1%, 14/58), full-thickness diaphragm resection (22.4%, 13/58), pancreatic surgery (19%, 11/58), resection of tumor from porta hepatis (17.2%, 10/58), celiac lymph node excision (8.6%, 5/58), partial gastrectomy (1.7%, 1/58), respectively. Thirteen patients (22.4%) had post-operative grade 3-5 complications according to CDC within 30 days after surgery.Conclusions:This current study demonstrated that the addition of extensive upper abdominal surgery procedures were not associated with increased postoperative severe complications in patients with recurrent or advanced ovarian cancer. These procedures are safe and feasible for patients in need and also can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity.
