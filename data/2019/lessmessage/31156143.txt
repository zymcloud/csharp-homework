Purpose:To evaluate micro-flow imaging (MFI) in depicting the vascular architecture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other focal liver lesions.Materials and methods:A total of 81 hepatic lesions were enrolled in this study. Each patient underwent CDFI, MFI, and CEUS examinations. The blood flow was first graded into three types (grade 1, 2 and 3) based on its richness with Adeler classification method. The differences in the grade of blood flow in liver tumors were compared between CDFI and MFI. With respect to the presented morphology, the blood flow was further classified into five types (Type I, II, III, IV and V). The morphological differences in blood flow shown by MFI between malignant and benign hepatic tumors were then analyzed.Results:For the total 81 lesions, MFI detected 61 lesion cases (75.31%) with blood flow grade 2 and 3, which obviously outperformed CDFI which detected 28 cases (34.57%) of grade 2 and 3 (χ2 = 35.27, P = 0.000). The MFI also showed that the most common blood flow morphology of HCC is Type-III (21/48, 43.75%) while the hepatic hemangioma (HEM) is mostly presented as Type V (5/10, 50%). Moreover, the grade of blood flow in MFI varied with different pathological subtypes of HCC (χ2 = 5.610, P = 0.018).Conclusions:Compared with traditional CDFI, MFI reveals more blood vessels in liver lesions with clearer view of blood flow distribution. Besides, MFI technology can demonstrate grade of blood flow for various differentiation stages of malignant liver tumors.
