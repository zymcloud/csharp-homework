The microbiome research is going through an evolutionary transition from focusing on the characterization of reference microbiomes associated with different environments/hosts to the translational applications, including using microbiome for disease diagnosis, improving the effcacy of cancer treatments, and prevention of diseases (e.g., using probiotics). Microbial markers have been identified from microbiome data derived from cohorts of patients with different diseases, treatment responsiveness, etc, and often predictors based on these markers were built for predicting host phenotype given a microbiome dataset (e.g., to predict if a person has type 2 diabetes given his or her microbiome data). Unfortunately, these microbial markers and predictors are often not published so are not reusable by others. In this paper, we report the curation of a repository of microbial marker genes and predictors built from these markers for microbiome-based prediction of host phenotype, and a computational pipeline called Mi2P (from Microbiome to Phenotype) for using the repository. As an initial effort, we focus on microbial marker genes related to two diseases, type 2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis, and immunotherapy efficacy for two types of cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We characterized the marker genes from metagenomic data using our recently developed subtractive assembly approach. We showed that predictors built from these microbial marker genes can provide fast and reasonably accurate prediction of host phenotype given microbiome data. As understanding and making use of microbiome data (our second genome) is becoming vital as we move forward in this age of precision health and precision medicine, we believe that such a repository will be useful for enabling translational applications of microbiome data.
