Although 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most extensively used tracer in oncological positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) studies, various physiological as well as benign pathological conditions are known to cause false-positive results. This report describes 18F-FDG PET/CT done in an elderly man with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, revealing a metastasis mimicking lesion in the left inguinal canal, which was identified as the herniated portion of the urinary bladder. Though rare, bladder herniation, especially with a narrow neck, can be a pitfall in the evaluation for metastatic disease. The study also highlights the utility of delayed imaging in the evaluation of pelvic pathology.
