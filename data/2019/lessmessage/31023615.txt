Introduction and aim:A pro-oncogenic intestinal microbiome was observed in murine models; however, no specific microbiome in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported. We aimed to compare the gut microbiome found in cirrhotic patients with or without HCC.Materials and methods:From 407 patients with Child Pugh A/B cirrhosis prospectively followed, 25 with HCC (cases) were matched with 25 without HCC (wo-HCC) in a 1:1 ratio according to age, gender, etiology, Child Pugh and severity of portal hypertension. In addition, results were also compared with 25 healthy subjects. Fecal stool samples were sequenced for the V3-V4 region of the microbial 16S rRNA (Illumina MiSeq Platform). Plasma cytokines were quantified including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α).Results:We found a differential abundance in family members of Firmicutes with a 3-fold increase of Erysipelotrichaceae and a 5-fold decrease in family Leuconostocaceae in HCC when compared to wo-HCC controls. Genus Fusobacterium was found to be 5-fold decreased in HCC vs wo-HCC. The ratio bacteriodes/prevotella was increased in HCC. Three operational taxonomic units (OTUs), genus Odoribacter and Butyricimonas were more abundant in HCC, whereas a decreased abundance in Lachnospiraceae family genus Dorea was observed in HCC patients. A Random Forest model trained with differential abundant taxa correctly classified HCC individuals. This pattern was associated with an inflammatory milieu with a putative increased activation of NOD-like receptor pathways.Conclusion:We found a pattern of microbiome linked to inflammation that could be potentially useful as HCC biomarker after follow-up validation studies.
