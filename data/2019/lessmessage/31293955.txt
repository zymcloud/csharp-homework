Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of salivary gland. Majority of the salivary gland tumors arise in parotid gland with maximum being of benign nature. Although Mucoepidermoid carcinoma accounts for less than 10% of all tumors of the salivary gland, it constitutes approximately 30% of all malignant tumors of the salivary gland. It is characterized by a mixed pattern of the two main cell types: epidermoid and mucus-producing cells. Metastasis from salivary gland malignancy is infrequent and predominantly found in bone, lung, liver and lymph nodes. We are presenting a rare case of metastasis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of parotid gland to the contralateral mandible.
