Purpose:Survivin expression is a potential prognostic indicator in various carcinomas. The prognostic value of Survivin for survival in hepatocellular carcinoma, (HCC) however, remains controversial. The aim of the study is to examine the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis Survivin in HCC and investigate the correlation with the clinic-pathologic characteristics and overall survival (OS) following surgical resection.Methods:Specimens from patients with resected HCC were examined by Immunohistochemical staining for Survivin and BCL-2expression. Clinical and histopathological data were retrieved from medical and pathology records, while OS was determined by reviewing records from the department of Oncology and personal communication with survivors. Bivariate analysis was performed using the Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests, while survival was estimated by Kaplan Meier method and compared with log-rank test.Results:Sixty patients were included in the study. Survivin was expressed in 26 patients (43.3%). Survivin expression was significantly correlated to OS (p=0.014). A statistically significant negative correlation between Survivin and BCL-2 was also noted (pConclusions:Survivin expression reflects aggressive histological and clinical behavior of HCC and correlates with poorer OS. Further studies are required to confirm if Survivin can be used as a predictive biomarker to evaluate prognosis and target treatments for HCC.
