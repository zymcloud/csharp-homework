Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is swiftly increasing in prevalence globally with a high mortality rate. The progression of HCC in patients is induced with advanced fibrosis, mainly cirrhosis, and hepatitis. The absence of proper preventive or curative treatment methods encouraged extensive research against HCC to develop new therapeutic strategies. The Food and Drug Administration-approved Nexavar (sorafenib) is used in the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC. In 2017, Stivarga (regorafenib) and Opdivo (nivolumab) got approved for patients with HCC after being treated with sorafenib, and in 2018, Lenvima (lenvatinib) got approved for patients with unresectable HCC. But, owing to the rapid drug resistance development and toxicities, these treatment options are not completely satisfactory. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new systemic combination therapies that target different signaling mechanisms, thereby decreasing the prospect of cancer cells developing resistance to treatment. In this review, HCC etiology and new therapeutic strategies that include currently approved drugs and other potential candidates of HCC such as Milciclib, palbociclib, galunisertib, ipafricept, and ramucirumab are evaluated.
