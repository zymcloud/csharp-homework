Context:Tilorone dihydrochloride is a therapeutic agent with a different mechanism in cancer. The species of Lactobacillus have an important role in cytotoxic effect.Aims:Because of unknown effects of tilorone and culture supernatants from Lactobacillus reuteri on hepatoma, the aim of this study is to evaluate apoptotic, cytotoxic, and therapeutic effects of tilorone on mouse hepatoma cell line with and without culture supernatants from L. reuteri.Materials and methods:To do so, after cell line culture, cells were divided into different groups such as negative control, treatment with four doses of tilorone, positive control of supernatant (single dose), and combination therapy groups of different doses of tilorone with supernatant (constant doses), for 48 h. All groups were studied with pathologic tests, biochemical study, tetrazolium dye (3-(4, 5- dimethylthiazol -2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide [MTT]) assay, and absolute real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were done to assess Bax and Bcl-2 genes expression, as molecular studies.Results:MTT assay results revealed that the tilorone tissue culture IC50 (TCIC50) on the Hepa1-6 cell line was 50 Î¼g/ml. RT-PCR analysis showed that tilorone dihydrochloride induced upregulation and downregulation in expression of Bax and Bcl-2, respectively. Simultaneous, antioxidant effect has also seen in a way that prevented necrosis, in biochemical analysis. These results were dose dependent and statistically significant compared to the control group.Conclusions:Based on these results, it appeared that this agent could be a good candidate for further evaluation as effective chemotherapy acting through the induction of apoptosis in hepatoma. The cell death caused through bacterial supernatant was rather necrosis than apoptosis.
