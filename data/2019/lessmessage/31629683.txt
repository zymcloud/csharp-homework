The detection of malignant liver tumours is recently increasing. These lesions have frequently arterial vascularization which differs from healthy parenchyma with main portal flow making them especially susceptible to transarterial therapies. Transarterial Radioembolization (TARE) is an emerging treatment for the management of different liver tumours. Significant improvements in the procedure have been made so it is considered a safe and effective treatment. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary because of the complexity of the procedure. An optimal selection of the patients and good planning arteriography are essential to obtain benefit and reduce complication rate. Although TARE has been used mostly in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases, indications are currently in expansion as the only treatment or in combination.
