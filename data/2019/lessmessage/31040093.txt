Introduction and aim:Previous studies have identified treatment disparities in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on insurance status and provider. Recent studies have shown more Americans have healthcare insurance; therefore we aim to determine if treatment disparities based on insurance providers continue to exist.Materials and methods:A retrospective database analysis using the NIS was performed between 2010 and 2013 including adult patients with a primary diagnosis of HCC determined by ICD-9 codes. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to analyze differences in treatment, mortality, features of decompensation, and metastatic disease based on the patient's primary payer.Results:This study included 62,368 patients. Medicare represented 44% of the total patients followed by private insurance (27%), Medicaid (19%), and other payers (10%). Patients with Medicare, Medicaid, and other payer were less likely to undergo liver transplantation [(OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.84), (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15-0.33), (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.45)] and surgical resection [(OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.87), (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.32-0.51), (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.54)] than patients with private insurance. Medicaid patients were less likely to undergo ablation then patients with private insurance (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40-0.68). Patients with other forms of insurance were less likely to undergo transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) compared to private insurance (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.96).Conclusion:Insurance status impacts treatment for HCC. Patients with private insurance are more likely to undergo curative therapies of liver transplantation and surgical resection compared to patients with government funded insurance.
