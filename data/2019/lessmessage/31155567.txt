Two new triterpene glycosides (1 and 2), together with nine known triterpene glycosides (3-11), were isolated from the seeds of Dolichos lablab (Leguminosae). The structures of the new compounds were determined by spectroscopic analysis, including two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, and chromatographic analysis of the hydrolyzed products. The isolated compounds did not show cytotoxicity against HL-60 human leukemia cells and HepG2 human hepatoma cells at sample concentrations of 20 ÂµM.
