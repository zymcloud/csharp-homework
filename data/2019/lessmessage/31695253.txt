Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6th most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. There are currently no universally accepted practice guidelines for the diagnosis of HCC on imaging owing to the regional differences in epidemiology, target population, diagnostic imaging modalities, and staging and transplant eligibility. Currently available regional and national guidelines include those from the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver, the Japan Society of Hepatology, the Korean Liver Cancer Study Group, Hong Kong, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network in the United States. India with its large population and a diverse health infrastructure faces challenges unique to its population in diagnosing HCC. Recently, American Association have introduced a Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LIRADS, version 2017, 2018) as an attempt to standardize the acquisition, interpretation, and reporting of liver lesions on imaging and hence improve the coherence between radiologists and clinicians and provide guidance for the management of HCC. The aim of the present consensus was to find a common ground in reporting and interpreting liver lesions pertaining to HCC on imaging keeping LIRADSv2018 in mind.
