We report a case of a 67-year-old man with pazopanib-resistant metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who showed an exceptional response to everolimus. Furthermore, this patient had TSC1 and TSC2 mutations. Only a subset of patients with mRCC respond to mTOR inhibitors and emerging evidences indicate that TSC1 and TSC2 mutations could be markers of response to mTOR inhibition. The current case study supports these accruing evidences.
Everolimus; TSC1/2 mutations; mTOR inhibitors; metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
