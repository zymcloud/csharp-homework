Aim:This paper aimed to assess and follow up the course of resolved HBV (hepatitis B virus) during and after treatment with direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs).Background:Co-infection with hepatitis B and hepatitis C is increasingly recognized in patients with chronic hepatitis. Resolved HBV in patients with chronic HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection has been investigated during interferon therapy, and the investigators suggest a possible correlation with a lower response to anti-viral treatment, higher grades of liver histological changes, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Three hundred and thirteen patients were included in our observational and prospective study; two hundred and fifty-three patients had chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (group I), and sixty patients had both CHC and resolved HBV-infection (group II). They all were eligible for treatment with DAAs therapy for chronic HCV in our hepatology unit, Internal Medicine Department, Zagazig University Hospitals from December 2017 to September 2018. They were subjected to thorough history taking, full clinical examination, routine laboratory investigations, HCV antibody, HCV RNA, HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) HBV core antibody (anti-HBc), and HBV-DNA quantitative levels. All patients were followed up at baseline, at the end of week 4 of anti-viral therapy, at the end of treatment and 12 weeks after treatment.Results:Assessment at 28 days showed significant decreases in ALT and AST levels in both groups, with stabilization of these levels on follow-up at 12 and 24 weeks. The efficacy of treatment was comparable in both groups. No case of ALT flare was observed in either group. Similar outcomes regarding AST and ALT levels were found in patients with diseases associated with immune derangement.Conclusion:The risk of resolved HBV reactivation during or after treatment with DAAs is low.
