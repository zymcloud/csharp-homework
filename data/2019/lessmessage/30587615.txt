Background/aim:The number of elderly patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been increasing. But there is no proper management based on age stratification in elderly patients. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly HCC patients more than 75 years old in South Korea.Patients and methods:Five hundred and fifty elderly patients with HCC were enrolled and divided into the oldest-old (age â‰¥85 years), middle-old (age between 80 and 85 years), and young-old groups (age between 75 and 80 years).Results:Fifty-one, 153, and 346 patients were included in the oldest-old (mean age: 87 years), middle-old (mean age: 82 years), and young-old groups (mean age: 77 years), respectively. There was a significantly lower rate of alcohol-related and hepatitis B virus-related diseases in the oldest-old group than in the other groups, whereas there was no significant difference in other characteristics. With increasing age, conservative treatment was predominantly performed. Transarterial chemoembolization was the main modality of active treatment in all groups. In multivariate analysis, the performance score, model for end-stage liver disease score, modified Union for International Cancer Control staging, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging, presence of portal vein tumor thrombosis, ruptured HCC, and active treatment were risk factors of overall survival.Conclusion:When the therapeutic approach is used in elderly patients with HCC, the patient's performance status, liver function, and stage of cancer should be considered, and its use should not be restricted to those of advanced age.
