Background/aim:Establishment of mouse xenograft models is necessary for oncological research and depends on the characteristics of the cell lines and the immune system of the host. In this study, we describe the development of mouse xenograft models using human gastric cancer (GC) cell lines.Materials and methods:MKN1 stably-expressing luciferase (MKN1-Luc), N87, KATO III, MKN45 stably-expressing luciferase (MKN45-Luc), NUGC4, and OCUM-1 human GC cell lines were injected intraperitoneally into mice to establish peritoneal metastasis models. MKN45-Luc were injected into subcutaneously implanted spleen, and MKN1-Luc and MKN45-Luc were injected directly into the portal veins of mice for the establishment of hepatic metastasis models.Results:Peritoneal metastasis was formed after implantation of MKN1-Luc, N87, KATO III, MKN45-Luc, and NUGC4 in nude mice, but not formed in OCUM-1 even in NOD/SCID mice. After intrasplenic injection of MKN45-Luc, we found no hepatic metastasis formation. We identified hepatic metastasis formation after direct injection of MKN45-Luc and MKN1-Luc into the portal veins of NOD/SCID mice.Conclusion:Peritoneal and hepatic metastasis mouse xenograft models were successfully established using several human GC cell lines.
