Aim:This study investigated early tumor marker response and treatment response in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with lenvatinib.Methods:Twenty patients with advanced HCC who received lenvatinib were enrolled in this retrospective study. α-Fetoprotein (AFP) and des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) levels were measured before treatment as well as 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. The objective response rate was evaluated by mRECIST at 6 weeks.Results:The response rate was 30% (complete response/partial response/stable disease/progressive disease: n = 0/6/6/8 cases) by mRECIST. At 4 weeks, the AFP levels of 12 patients (80%) were lower than at baseline. The AFP levels of 9 patients (60%) continued decreasing from 2 weeks to 4 weeks (sustained-reduction group). In this group, the response rate was 67%. The median AFP change rate was -39% at 4 weeks. In imaging responders, the AFP change rate significantly decreased (p = 0.02). The DCP change rate had no significant correlation with imaging response. The AFP-sustained-reduction group had significantly higher adherence to lenvatinib than the non-sustained-reduction group (p = 0.02).Conclusion:With lenvatinib therapy for HCC, the AFP levels of most patients had declined at 2 weeks, and at 4 weeks the AFP-sustained-reduction group demonstrated a higher objective response.
