Background/aim:Low-grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (LG-PNETs) behave unpredictably. The aim of the study was to identify biomarkers that predict PNET metastasis to improve treatment selection.Patients and methods:Five patients with primary non-metastatic LG-PNETs, six with primary LG-PNETs with synchronous or metachronous metastases (M-PNETs), and six metastatic to liver LG-PNETs (ML-PNETs) from the group of six M-PNET patients were selected. RNA data were normalized using iterative rank-order normalization. Student's t-test identified differentially-expressed genes in LG-PNETs versus M-PNETs. A 2-fold difference in expression was considered to be significant. Results were validated with an independent dataset of LG-PNETs and metastatic LG-PNETs.Results:Overall, 195 genes had a >2-fold change (in either direction). A total of 29 genes were differentially overexpressed in M-PNETs. Erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 5 (EPB41L5) had a 2.07-fold change increase in M-PNETs and the smallest p-value. EPB41L5 was not statistically different between M-PNETs and ML-PNETs. EPB41L5 differential expression between primary and metastatic LG-PNETs was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.Conclusion:These results support further investigation into whether EPB41L5 is a biomarker of PNETs with high risk for metastases.
