Background:Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a common complication of endstage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of Homocysteine (Hcy) in HCC patient with PVT. Hcy is a sulphur amino-acid involved in two pathways, trans-sulphuration and remethylation, that involve vitamins B6, B12 and folates.Methods:We recruited 54 patients with HCC and PVT, 60 patients with HCC and without PVT and 60 control subjects. We measured serum levels of Hcy, folate, vitamins B6 and B12.Results:The comparison between HCC patients with PVT versus HCC without PVT was shown that mean values of Hcy were 6.4 nmol/L (pConclusion:High serum levels of Hcy are an established thrombotic risk factor in the general population. We found significantly higher levels of Hcy in HCC patients with PVT versus both HCC patients without PVT and controls.
