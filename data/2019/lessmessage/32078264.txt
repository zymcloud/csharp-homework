Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs primarily in patients who have sustained years of chronic liver injury. Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease when potentially curative surgical resection or liver transplant is no longer a therapeutic option and medical treatments for HCC are largely ineffective. Consequently, the average 5-year survival for HCC is less than 15%. The global burden of HCC is expected to increase in the coming decades as a result of an increasing population and the global rise of obesity and fatty liver disease as emerging HCC etiologies. Given this context, prevention efforts for HCC are urgently needed to reduce the incidence of this deadly disease. Primary prevention involves avoidance of exposure to risk factors for chronic liver disease, including toxins such as ethanol and certain chemicals, viral hepatitis through vaccination, and overweight or metabolic syndromes via lifestyle modification. National neonatal hepatitis B vaccination and reduced aflatoxin exposure have successfully reduced HCC incidence in traditionally endemic regions such as East Asia. Secondary prevention encompasses mitigation of risk factors in patients with baseline chronic liver disease. Multiple dietary and pharmaceutical agents have been suggested to have preventative potential in retrospective analyses, though few clinical trials have been performed. Finally, tertiary prevention represents interventions to reduce the risk of de novo HCC recurrence after curative resection of primary HCC tumor. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive overview of chemopreventive strategies and discuss future directions.
