Objective:To investigate the effects of high intensity focused ultrasound on liver function, tumor markers and survival rate of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.Methods:Ninety six cases with primary liver cancer patients, consisting of 66 males and 30 females, were enrolled in this study and treated with high intensity focused ultrasound combined with stereotactic segmentation dose radiation, low frequency for 10 times, followed by analysis of KPS score of liver cancer, Child-Pugh, grading and staging of liver cancer, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year of clinical symptom remission rate, tumor markers, liver function, survival rate, as well as the change of immune related cytokines.Results:Three months after high intensity focused ultrasound treatment, abdominal distension abdominal pain, jaundice symptoms, anorexia and ascites were significantly relieved compared with before treatment (PConclusion:High intensity focused ultrasound can effectively improve liver function, increase the survival rate and enhance immune function of patients with liver cancer.
