Purposes:This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of ultrasound (US)-, computed tomography (CT)-, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This retrospective study included 141 patients with HCC who were treated with US-guided (n = 29), CT-guided (n = 50), or MRI-guided RFA (n = 62). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), technique success (TS), and technique efficacy (TE). Cox model and logistic regression were used to determine the risk factors for tumor recurrence and TE.Results:The US, CT, and MRI groups did not show a significant difference in terms of baseline variables. The three groups did not differ significantly in PFS rate (P = 0.072) and OS rate (P = 0.231). The PFS rates at 3 years for the US, CT, and MRI groups were 40.90%, not reached, and 14.80%, respectively. The OS rates at 3 years were 94.70%, 97.50%, and 85.50% for US, CT, and MRI groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the three groups in terms of TS rate (P = 0.113) and TE rate (P = 0.682). In multivariate analysis, liver cirrhosis (P = 0.001), level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP, P = 0.004), and number of tumors (P = 0.012) were independent risk factors for PFS. For TE, the level of AFP (P = 0.018) was an independent factor.Conclusion:US-, CT-, and MRI-guided RFA was effective for treating HCC patients. Liver cirrhosis, AFP level, and tumor number were associated with tumor recurrence, and the level of AFP was an independent risk factor affecting TE.
