Purpose:To assess the postprocedure findings after percutaneous irreversible electroporation (IRE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).Materials and methods:Percutaneous IRE was performed in a total of 22 patients with 24 HCC tumours following interdisciplinary tumour board review. The lesions were documented using CEUS before, immediately and within 24 hours after IRE. During follow-up CEUS was performed at 6 weeks and 3, 9, and 12 months after ablation. Two experienced radiologists evaluated the acquired CEUS image date in a consensus reading.Results:Median tumour size before treatment was 13.7±4.8 mm (short axis) and 16.0±5.2 mm (long axis). All HCC lesions showed arterial hyperenhancement in CEUS. Median size of the ablation defect after ablation was 29.3±5.2 mm (short axis) and 31.6±5.6 mm (long axis). After IRE all tumours showed complete devascularization. The size of the ablation defects showed significant shrinkage and reduced peripheral enhancement in the course of follow-up. At 12 months follow-up the ablation defect size decreased to 16.7±4.3 mm (short axis) and 18.3±4.1 mm (long axis).Conclusion:CEUS showed a complete devascularization of HCC tumours after IRE. Post-intervetional peripheral enhancement returned to normal during follow-up and may represent zones of reversible damage of cellular integrity through electroporation. A significant shrinkage of the ablation defects during 12 month of follow-up was seen in all cases.
