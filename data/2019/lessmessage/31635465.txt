Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global public health problem with changing epidemiology due to several factors predominantly vaccination policy and migration. Chronic hepatitis B means the duration of HBV infection for more than 6 months. It is a dynamic process reflecting the interaction between HBV replication and the host immune response and not all patients with chronic HBV infection have chronic hepatitis B. All patients with chronic HBV infection are in increased risk of progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The long-term administration of potent nucleos(t)ide analogue with high barrier of resistance (tenofovir, entecavir) represents the treatment of choice. Pegylated interferon- can also be considered in mid to moderate chronic hepatitis B patients.
