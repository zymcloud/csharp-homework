Introduction and objectives:The hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) variations suggested having some effects on infection outcome. Due to some controversial issues, the aim of this study was to compare the pattern of HBsAg variation between asymptomatic carriers and HCC/cirrhosis patients.Materials and methods:In this cross-sectional study, 19 HCC/cirrhotic and 26 asymptomatic patients were enrolled. After viral DNA extraction, HBs gene was amplified using an in-house nested-PCR. Then, PCR products were introduced into bi-directional Sanger sequencing. The retrieved sequences were compared with references, to investigate the variation of immunologic sites, major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg as well as reverse transcriptase (RT), and also to determine genotype/subtype.Results:The analysis of MHR and epitopes on HBsAg showed dozens of substitution, which occurred more prevalently in I110, P120, Y134, G159, S193, Y206, S207, I208, L213 and P214 positions. However, Y134N/F/L (P=0.04) and P120T/S (P=0.009) were significantly detected in MHR and B-cell epitope of HCC/Cirrhotic group. A number of truncation-related mutations were higher in HCC/Cirrhotic group (P>0.001), albeit only C69* stop codon was statistically significant (P=0.003). In RT, some potentially resistant substitutions such as Q215S, V191I and V214A, were revealed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of isolates belonged to genotype D, and the major serotype was ayw1.Conclusion:The higher frequency of substitutions in MHR and immune epitopes at positions such as Y134 and P120 as well as stop codons such as C69* in HCC/cirrhotic group might candidate them as predictive factors for infection outcome.
