A 65-year-old Caucasian female presented with abdominal symptoms and obstructive jaundice. She reported a significant pancreatic cancer history in her family. Her CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed 3.9 Ã— 3.5 cm centrally necrotic mass within the pancreatic head, occluding the superior mesenteric and splenic veins; peripancreatic lymph nodes were enlarged, and there were many hepatic lesions. She underwent biopsy of the hepatic lesions showing metastatic tumor cells, arranged in the form of nests, with enlarged and hyperchromatic irregular nuclei with some nucleoli and moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining on cancer cells was positive for CK7, P40, GATA3. These findings were concerning for poorly differentiated metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). PET-CT showed no other hypermetabolic lesions, suggestive of another primary except pancreatic head with SUV of 17.8, hepatic metastasis and 1 cm right retroperitoneal lymph node. The patient was diagnosed with metastatic SCC of the pancreas. Contrary to the well-known genetic mutations of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the data on pancreatic SCC-related mutations is limited; however, one such mutation is BRCA-2 exon 15 germline mutation reported in a locally advanced SCC of the pancreas. The index patient is one of those rare cases in which a significant family history of pancreatic cancer was reported. We believe that some familial mutation could be responsible for this finding, i.e., occurrence of pancreatic cancer in multiple family members. Further research is necessary to explore such association.
