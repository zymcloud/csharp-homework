We report the case of a 55-year-old-male with a large cell metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma treated for 14 months with lanreotide autogel having a stable disease (SD) and not responding to chemotherapy. The somatostatin analogues (SSA) were introduced after an episode of diarrhea and controlled the disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by Computerized Tomography (CT) scans was obtained for 14 months. After more than a year, the patient's health state deteriorated along with progressive disease. The capecitabine-temozolomide regimen was challenged, but after three cycles, a rapid clinical decline was noted.Conclusion:This unexpected event (diarrhea) in the course of the disease could represent the beginning of carcinoid syndrome. While the lanreotide autogel helped the episode of diarrhea pass, it also helped gain control over the disease itself.
