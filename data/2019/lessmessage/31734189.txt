Tumor thrombus is an intravascular malign tumor extension that may occur in various types of cancer. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) are common causes of malign thrombus. The presence of a malign thrombus due to HCC has a dismal prognosis, which affects treatment choices. We present three cases of tumor thrombi due to advanced HCC detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT.
