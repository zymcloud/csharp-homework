Aim/background:In HCC patients with multiple tumors in separate segments, monotherapy with surgical resection is often difficult when the estimated residual liver volume after surgery is thought to be inadequate. We evaluated the usefulness of resection combined with low invasive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treatment of such cases.Materials/methods:We analyzed 115 HCC patients with countable multiple tumors (≤5) without vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic metastasis, and treated solely with resection (SR group: n = 82), or with both resection and RFA (Comb group: n = 33) from January 2000 to December 2017. Clinical characteristics, overall survival rate (OSR), and disease-free survival rate (DFSR) were analyzed in a retrospective manner.Results:There were 88 males (76.5%) and the average age of all patients was 67.8 ± 8.9 years. The average number of tumors and average maximum tumor size were 2.4 ± 0.7 and 4.1 ± 2.1 cm, respectively. Forty-two (36.5%) patients were classified as beyond up-to-7 criteria. The 3- and 5-year OSRs in the SR group were 82.0 and 67.0%, respectively, and in the Comb group were 75.2 and 65.6%, respectively (p = 0.244), while the 3- and 5-year DFSRs in the SR group were 45.2 and 28.0%, respectively, and those in the Comb group were 37.3 and 23.3%, respectively (p = 0.257).Conclusion:The combination of surgical resection and complementary RFA may be an effective strategy for treating HCC patients with countable multiple tumors, who are otherwise difficult to treat with surgical resection or RFA alone.
