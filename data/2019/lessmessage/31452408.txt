Purpose: To compare the predictive value of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, platelet-ALBI (PALBI) grade and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with microwave ablation (TACE-MWA). Methods: A total of 349 consecutive HCC patients (89.1% male; mean [± SD] age 53.4 ± 12.27 years) from three medical centers, who underwent TACE-MWA for up to 3 HCCs with maximum diameters of 5.1-8.0 cm between January 2000 and June 2018, were investigated. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. The prognostic performances of ALBI grade, PALBI grade and CTP class were compared. Results: TACE procedures were performed using lobaplatin (20-50 mg), epirubicin (30-60 mg), lipiodol (5-25 mL) and gelatin sponge particles (350-560 μm). The end point of the TACE procedure was stasis of blood flow in the feeder artery. The median follow-up duration was 28.0 months, the median OS was 28.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 23.55-32.45 months), and the median PFS was 4.8 months (95% CI 4.26-5.34 months). Patients with a ablation margin size of 11-15 mm experienced better PFS than those with a margin size of 6-10 or 0-5 mm (median, 6.5 versus [vs] 4.0 vs 2.3 months; p < .001). PALBI grade demonstrated significantly greater area under the curve values than ALBI grade or CTP class in predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year OS. Conclusions: PALBI grade provided better predictive value than ALBI grade or CTP class in patients with large HCCs after TACE-MWA.
