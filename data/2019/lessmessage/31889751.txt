Background:Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is an established treatment for patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within Milan criteria. Acceptable outcomes have been demonstrated in patients fulfilling extended criteria. Here, we share our experience with LDLT for patients with HCC within and beyond Milan criteria, with emphasis on poor prognostic factors.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent LDLT between 2012 and 2017 and had HCC proven on explant liver histopathology. A total of 117 patients were included. Patients who died early after transplant (in 600, (2) poor differentiation, and (3) the presence of lymphovascular invasion. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was determined using Kaplan-Meier curves.Results:Median age was 53 (30-73) years. Median follow-up was 20.3 (1-63.2) months. Median model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score was 19 (9-34). Of a total of 117 patients, 74 (63.2%) patients met Milan criteria. Recurrence rate was 12/117 (10.3%). Actuarial 5-year RFS was 88% and 82% (P = 0.3) in patients within and outside Milan criteria. There was no difference in 3-year RFS in patients with 0, 1, or 2 poor prognostic factors within Milan criteria (92%, 87%, and 75%, respectively; P = 0.3). However, a significant difference in RFS was seen in patients outside Milan criteria (92%, 93%, and 53%; P = 0.03).Conclusions:Patients within Milan criteria have acceptable RFS even in the presence of poor prognostic factors. However, the presence of two or more poor prognostic variables significantly impacts RFS of patients outside Milan criteria.
