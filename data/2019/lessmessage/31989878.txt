Background:Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC) and Combined Hepatocellular- Cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) are rare primary liver tumours, which are related to different clinical settings. In both tumours, correlation with clinical data and laboratory tests are extremely important.Discussion:Typically, FLC is diagnosed in young patients without any chronic disease and with normal biochemical tests, whereas CHC arises in cirrhotic patients with elevated tumour markers: AFP and/or CA 19-9. The review describes epidemiology, aetiology, pathogenesis, radiological features and treatment of these tumours. Imaging features typical for FLC are: The presence of central scar, calcifications, the large size, heterogeneous and early contrast-enhancement.Conclusion:The diagnosis of CHC may be suggested in case of elevation of both AFP and CA 19- 9 or inconsistency between elevated tumour markers and imaging findings (i.e., elevated CA 19-9 and radiological features of HCC, or elevated AFP with imaging findings characteristic of ICC).
