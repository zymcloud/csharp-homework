Objective:PTTG3P, which maps to chromosome 8q13.1, is a novel long noncoding RNA with oncogenic properties in cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic value of PTTG3P in terms of overall survival and recurrence-free survival and its potential regulatory network and transcription pattern in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Patients and methods:An in silico analysis was performed using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Results:Results showed that the high PTTG3P expression group was consistently associated with shorter overall survival and recurrence-free survival, regardless of pathological stages or tumor grade. High PTTG3P expression was an independent indicator of shorter overall survival (hazard ratio: 2.177, 95% confidence interval: 1.519-3.121, P < .001) and recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio: 2.222, 95% confidence interval: 1.503-3.283, P < .001). The genes strongly coexpressed with PTTG3P are enriched in several KEGG pathways that are closely associated with carcinogenesis and malignant transformation of hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:Based on the findings, we infer that PTTG3P expression might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker in primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
