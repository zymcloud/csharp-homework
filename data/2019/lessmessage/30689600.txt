Contrast-enhanced multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) is commonly used in the diagnosis of complex malignant tumours. This technology provides comprehensive and accurate information about tumour size and shape in relation to solid tumours and the affected adjacent organs and tissues. This case report demonstrates the benefit of using MSCT 3D imaging for preoperative planning in a patient with late-stage (T4) sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma, a rare renal malignant tumour. The surgical margin on the liver was negative, and no metastases to veins, lungs or other organs were detected by abdominal and chest contrast-enhanced CT. Although sarcomatoid histology is considered to be a poor prognostic factor, the patient is alive and well 17 months after surgery. The MSCT imaging modality enables 3D rendering of an area of interest, which assists surgical decision-making in cases of advanced renal tumours. In this case, as a result of MSCT 3D reconstruction, the patient received justified surgical treatment without compromising oncological principles.
