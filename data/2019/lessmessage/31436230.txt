Background/aim:Percutaneous thermal ablation combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) becomes a treatment option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of percutaneous thermal ablation combined with simultaneous TACE for patients with HCC ≤ 5 cm.Materials and methods:From June 2010 to February 2017, a total of 280 patients with HCC ≤ 5 cm who underwent percutaneous thermal ablation combined with simultaneous TACE were included in our study. Their clinical data were collected and analyzed.Results:Major complications occurred in five cases (1.8%). The complete necrosis rate was 91.9%. The median overall survival (OS) was 66.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 57.7-75.2). The OS rates in 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year were 96.7%, 76.0%, 59.7%, and 31.1%, respectively. Tumor size (hazard ratio = 1.826; 95% CI = 1.131-2.947; P = 0.014) was considered as independent prognostic factors of long-term survival.Conclusion:Percutaneous thermal ablation combined with simultaneous TACE is a safe and effective treatment for HCC ≤ 5 cm.
