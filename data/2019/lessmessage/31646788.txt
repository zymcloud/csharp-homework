Purpose:To evaluate the application value of conventional ultrasound (US) and 64-slice spiral computed tomography (CT) examinations in the clinical diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the liver.Methods:A total of 85 patients diagnosed with space-occupying liver diseases via needle biopsy or pathological examination underwent conventional US and CT examinations. The detection of tumor in different sizes was compared, and imaging characteristics were analyzed.Results:Under the CT enhancement scan, HCC lesions displayed the "fast-in and fast-out" features and the blood flow in the tumor could be clearly showed, while FNH displayed the low/uniform density and significant enhancement. The accuracy of conventional US and CT in the diagnosis of benign liver lesion was 86.00% (43/50) and 94.00% (47/50), respectively, showing no significant difference (p>0.05). However, the accuracy of CT in the diagnosis of malignant HCC was 94.29% (33/35), which was higher than that of US [74.29% (26/35)]. The accuracy of CT in the diagnosis of lesion with a diameter ≤1 cm was 84.00% (21/25), which was higher than that of US [56.00% (14/25)].Conclusions:The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of HCC and FNH via 64-slice spiral CT are superior to those of conventional US, and the diagnostic effect of CT on tiny lesion with a diameter ≤1 cm is significant.
