Aim:To define the patterns of disease presentation, treatment strategies, and outcomes for patients with colon cancer at a tertiary referral center in India over 1 year period.Materials and methods:This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database. All consecutive patients with proven or suspected colonic adenocarcinoma between July 2013 and July 2014 were evaluated in a dedicated analysed multidisciplinary clinic at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. The demography, treatment plan, pathology, stage, and survival data were examined.Results:The median age of presentation was 49 years with 60.1% male patients. In total, 151 cases (57.4%) underwent treatment with curative intent consisting of surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy as indicated. The rest were offered either palliative chemotherapy (36.9%) or best supportive care (5.7%). Approximately, 70% patients had advanced stage disease (Stage III/IV) at presentation and 41.8% presented with metastatic disease with the liver being the most common site of disease dissemination. With a median follow-up of 29 months, the estimated 3-year disease free survival for patients treated with curative intent was 67.1%. The median progression free survival was 12.3 months for patients treated with palliative intent. The estimated 3-year overall survival was 89.7%, 65.5%, and 22.8% for Stage I/II, Stage III, and Stage IV, respectively.Conclusion:Indian patients with colon cancer, at a tertiary referral center, tend to present at more advanced stages of the disease as compared to the West. However, curative treatment with surgery and chemotherapy offers similar survival outcomes when compared stage for stage.
