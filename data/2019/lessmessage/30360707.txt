Human insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis affects the molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially in the abnormality of hepatic IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) or IGF-II expression as a key molecule in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the over-expression of hepatic IGFIR is associated with HCC progression with largely unknown mechanisms. The IGF-IR as one key molecule of the IGF signal pathway plays an important role in the hepatocyte malignant transformation. Attaching importance to IGF-IR might improve the prognostic or the therapeutic technique of HCC. This article reviews IGF-IR alteration during HCC development, and the effects of silencing IGF-IR gene by specific short hairpin RNA on the inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro or HCC xenograft growth in vivo to elucidate it as a novel molecular-targeted therapy for HCC.
