Purpose:This study aimed to report the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) of the pancreas including diffusion-weighted MRI findings.Materials and methods:The MRI examinations of five patients (3 men, 2 women; median age, 61years) with histopathologically proven ACC of the pancreas were retrospectively reviewed. MR images were analyzed qualitatively (location, shape, homogeneity, signal intensity, vascular involvement and extrapancreatic extent of ACC) and quantitatively (tumor size, apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] and normalized ADC of ACC).Results:All ACC were visible on MRI, presenting as an oval pancreatic mass (5/5; 100%), with moderate and heterogeneous enhancement (5/5; 100%), with a median transverse diameter of 43mm (Q1, 35; Q3, 82mm; range: 30-91mm). Tumor capsule was visible in 4/5 ACC (80%) and Wirsung duct enlargement in 2/5 ACC (40%). On diffusion-weighted MRI, all ACC (5/5; 100%) were hyperintense on the 3 b value images. Median ADC value of ACC was 1.061×10-3mm2/s (Q1, 0.870×10-3mm2/s; Q3, 1.138×10-3mm2/s; range: 0.834-1.195×10-3mm2/s). Median normalized ADC ratio of ACC was 1.127 (Q1, 1.071; Q3, 1.237; range: 1.054-1.244).Conclusions:On MRI, ACC of the pancreas presents as a large, oval pancreatic mass with moderate and heterogeneous enhancement after intravenous administration of a gadolinium chelate, with restricted diffusion and a median ADC value of 1.061×10-3mm2/s on diffusion-weighted MRI. Further studies however are needed to confirm our findings obtained in a limited number of patients.
