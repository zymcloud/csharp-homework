Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) of the skin is a rare but aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine-derived malignancy that predominantly affects elderly white males. The presence of distant nodal metastases significantly impacts survival. Typical metastatic sites of MCC are liver, bone, brain and skin. Gastrointestinal metastases are uncommon and small bowel is the most common site followed by stomach. We report a case of symptomatic MCC jejunal metastasis.
