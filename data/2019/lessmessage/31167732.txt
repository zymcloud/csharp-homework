Introduction and objectives:The fibrosis score 4 (FIB-4) has been identified as a biochemical surrogate for histological fibrogenesis and fibrosis in cirrhosis. This study investigates the impact of preoperative FIB-4 on postoperative liver failure of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Data from 205 patients who underwent curative resection for HCC were retrospectively analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cutoff value of the FIB-4. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were performed to identify risk factors for postoperative liver failure. The clinical outcomes were compared between patients with high FIB-4 and low FIB-4.Results:The optimal cutoff value of the FIB-4 was set at 5.92 for postoperative liver failure according to ROC curve. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the number of resected segments, FIB-4, and model for end-stage liver disease score were identified as independent risk factors for postoperative liver failure. Patients with preoperative FIB-4>5.92 had poorer liver function and higher occurrence of postoperative liver failure.Conclusions:Preoperative FIB-4 was associated with postoperative liver failure. Patients with preoperative FIB-4>5.92 carry a high risk of postoperative liver failure.
