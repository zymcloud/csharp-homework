Objective:To study the frequency of occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis C virus patients treated with direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents.Methods:This hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted in Mayo Hospital, Lahore from June, 2016 to January, 2018. Total 300 patients with HCV genotype 3, selected via Non-Probability Purposive Sampling technique, without prior or concurrent history of HCC, were given DAA agents and were followed up for 6 months after completion of therapy. Results were based on Quantitative PCR to assess Sustained Virological Response (SVR) and Ultrasound Abdomen to look for the appearance of any new lesion. Data was presented as mean ±SD, frequency and percentages and was analyzed using SPSS Version 24.0.Results:Out of 300 patients, 179 (59.7%) were males and 121(40.3%) were females. Mean age of the patients was 55.08 ± 5.602 years. 214(71.3%) patients had compensated cirrhosis at the start of treatment and 86(28.7%) had decompensated cirrhosis. SVR was achieved in 200(93.4%) out of 214 patients with compensated cirrhosis and in 76(88.3%) out of 86 patients with decompensated cirrhosis. At six months post- treatment, 10(3.33%) patients developed HCC,2(0.7%) in the compensated group and 8(2.7%) in the decompensated group, out of which 5(6.6%) patients had achieved SVR.Conclusion:The frequency of HCC following DAA agents is significant (3.3%) even after achieving SVR. Caution must be exercised in prescribing DAA agents to HCV patients keeping this complication of HCC in mind.
