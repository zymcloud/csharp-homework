Objective:To evaluate the inhibitory role of a novel oncolytic adenovirus (OA), GP73-SphK1sR-Ad5, on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:GP73-SphK1sR-Ad5 was constructed by integrating Golgi protein 73 (GP73) promoter and sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1)-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5), and transfecting into HCC Huh7 cells and normal human liver HL-7702 cells. The expression of SphK1 and adenovirus early region 1 (E1A) was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot, respectively. Cell viability was detected by methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and apoptotic rate was determined by flow cytometry. An Huh7 xenograft model was established in mice injected intratumorally with GP73-SphK1sR-Ad5. Twenty days after injection, the tumor volume and weight, and the survival time of the mice were recorded. The histopathological changes in tumor tissues were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Results:Transfection of GP73-SphK1sR-Ad5 significantly upregulated E1A and downregulated SphK1 in Huh7 cells, but not in HL7702 cells. GP73-SphK1sR-Ad5 transfection significantly decreased the viability and increased the apoptotic rate of Huh7 cells, but had no effect on HL7702 cells. Intratumoral injection of GP73-SphK1sR-Ad5 into the Huh7 xenograft mouse model significantly decreased tumor volume and weight, and prolonged survival time. It also significantly decreased the tumor infiltration area and blood vessel density, and increased the percentages of cells with nucleus deformation and cells with condensed chromatin in tumor tissues.Conclusions:GP73-SphK1sR-Ad5 serves as a novel OA and can inhibit HCC progression with high specificity and efficacy.
