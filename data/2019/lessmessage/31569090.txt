Background:The combination of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and apatinib has been used in the treatment of intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its effectiveness and safety are also argued.Methods:Eligible studies were collected from a computer search of literatures published from the database establishment to May 2019 in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Ovid, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and China Biology Medicine Disc. The objective response rate (ORR), the disease control rate (DCR), survival rate (SR), and the incidences of treatment-related adverse effects (AEs) were collected as the relevant outcomes. Data were analyzed through fixed/random effects of meta-analysis models with RevMan 5.3 software.Results:Eight randomized controlled clinical trials comprising 528 patients and 4 cohort studies comprising 226 patients were eventually included. Compared to the control group treated with TACE solely, combination therapy group, in which intermediate or advanced HCC patients were treated with TACE and apatinib, significantly enhanced ORR (relative risk [RR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.63-2.61, p 0.05).Conclusions:The combination therapy of TACE and apatinib can enhance the clinical effectiveness better than TACE solely in patients with intermediate or advanced HCC, while increase in the AEs is usually tolerable.
