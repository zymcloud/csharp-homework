Introduction:Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is uncommon. In particular, HCC with duodenal invasion is known to be a rare condition. In such cases, surgical indication has been generally negative except in few reported cases. To our knowledge, this report describes the first case of HCC with duodenal invasion, resected by hepatectomy accompanied by pancreas-preserving partial duodenectomy (HPPD) following multimodal therapies including systemic sorafenib administration.Case presentation:A 65-year-old man had been repeatedly treated for multiple HCCs by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib. However, the main tumor formerly ruptured began to involve his duodenum, causing GI bleeding. The collateral vessels from the pancreatic and omental branches entered the tumor and nullified the transarterial hemostatic embolization. Hence, HPPD was performed to preserve the major Vater papilla. Histopathological examination revealed poorly-to -moderately differentiated HCC cells invading the duodenum.Discussion and conclusion:HPPD treatment successfully removed HCC with duodenal invasion achieving viable tumor clearance status (R0). We underline the importance of achieving viable tumor clearance status at any time during the treatment course of patients with advanced HCC as this approach may be the only approach to enable HCC patients with duodenal invasion to resume a healthy life.
