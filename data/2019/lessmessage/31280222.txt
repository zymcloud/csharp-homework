Background/aim:We investigated the impact of Beppu's nomogram on colorectal liver metastasis in patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy.Patients and methods:This study included 43 patients who underwent primary hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis at the Kanagawa Cancer Center from June 2006 to March 2011. The patients were classified as having a Beppu's nomogram score ≤9 (low-risk group) or ≥10 (high-risk group). The risk factors for the disease-free survival (DFS) were identified.Results:The respective DFS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery were 72.0%, 43.3%, and 17.3% in the low-risk group and 27.8%, 16.7%, and 8.3% in the high-risk group, the difference being significant (p=0.009). The multivariate analysis showed that Beppu's nomogram score ≥10 was a significant independent risk factor for the DFS.Conclusion:Beppu's nomogram score was an independent prognostic factor for colorectal liver metastasis in patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy. Thus, Beppu's nomogram might be a useful tool for predicting the risk of recurrence after hepatectomy, even in the era of newly-developed chemotherapy.
