Purpose:To investigate the effect of puerarin on the apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells induced by hydrogen peroxide and its mechanism.Methods:Experiments were divided into control group, model group, and puerarin group. Normal saline (200 μmol/L) was used in the control group, 200 μmol/L H2O2 was used to induce oxidative stress in the model group, and 25 μmol/L, 50 μmol/L, and 100 μmol/L puerarin were used in the puerarin group to treat hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells for 24 h on the basis of 200 μmol/L H2O2, respectively. Contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in SMMC-7721 cells were determined by colorimetry. Apoptotic rate of SMMC-7721 cells was determined by flow cytometry.Results:Compared with the control group, MDA content in the H2O2 group increased significantly, and SOD activity and GSH content decreased significantly Compared with the control group, SOD activity and GSH content in SMMC-7721 cells of puerarin group decreased significantly (pConclusion:Puerarin has protective effect on hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells under oxidative stress. It is suggested that puerarin should be carefully used when the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells results in the production of large amounts of ROS.
