Purpose of review:This review summarizes recent data on chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) epidemiology, issues in special populations undergoing immunosuppressive and hepatitis C virus (HCV) direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, and describes care delivery, adherence to guideline-recommended care, and barriers to access to care and high-quality care for chronic HBV.Recent findings:Chronic HBV is present in up to 1% of veterans and is more than in the general US population. HBV associated with more advanced liver disease in HCV, HIV, and delta hepatitis co-infection. Recent data on HBV reactivation show a substantial risk of reactivation with anti-CD20 antibodies, no documented cases of reactivation with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy, and a low risk of reactivation with HCV DAA therapy. Adherence to guideline-recommended care for HBV is suboptimal for many quality indicators.Summary:Important studies in HBV epidemiology, long-term outcomes and care delivery practices have been conducted in the VA. Future studies should prospectively investigate how to improve guideline-recommended care for HBV.
