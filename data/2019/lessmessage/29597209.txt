Background:Whether repeat hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases should be performed after chemotherapy or observation is unclear.Methods:We selected patients with resectable hepatic recurrence after their first hepatectomies performed between 2000 and 2015. They were classified according to the further treatment: Group A, prompt repeat hepatectomy; Group B, observation; and Group C, â‰¤6 months of chemotherapy. In Group B/C, patients who later underwent hepatectomy and those who did not due to disease progression were classified as B1/C1 and B2/C2, respectively. Predictors of B2/C2 were evaluated.Results:Groups A, B, and C consisted of 81, 36, and 17 patients, respectively. Recurrence-free interval was longer in Group A (median months; Group A, 10.3; Group B, 5.7; Group C, 3.5; p < 0.01). Group B1/C1 and B2/C2 included 34 and 19 patients, respectively. Five-year survival after recurrence of Group B1/C1 was 56%, which was comparable with Group A (56%, p = 0.77) and better than Group B2/C2 (0%, p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed synchronous colorectal liver metastases (OR 7.23) and recurrent hepatic tumor number (OR 4.04) were predictors of tumor progression.Conclusion:Selecting patients optimally either for prompt or delayed repeat hepatectomy following chemotherapy or observation is a feasible strategy.
