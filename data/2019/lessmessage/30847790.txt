Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is a strong separation technique for the highly efficient and selective analysis of polar and charged metabolites in biological samples. The CE approach is especially suited for the analysis of limited sample amounts due to its nanoliter injections from only a few microliters of material in the sample injection vial. In this protocol, a CE-MS strategy is outlined for the profiling of cationic metabolites in biomass-limited samples using a small amount of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells as a model system. By employing a sheathless interfacing design for coupling CE to MS, it is shown that information-rich profiles for cationic metabolites can be obtained when working with a starting amount of 10,000 HepG2 cells and even lower. Overall, the proposed CE-MS-based analytical workflow may be considered a useful tool for biomass-limited metabolomics studies.
