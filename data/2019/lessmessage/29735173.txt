Aims:To identify pretransplant predictors of early mortality (90 days after transplantation) and evaluate their discriminating capacity in adult liver transplant recipients (LTR).Design:An observational, retrospective, nested cases-controls study from a consecutive cohort of LTRs was carried out.Setting:University hospital.Patients:All consecutive LTR between January 2003 and December 2016 were eligible for inclusion. Patients with acute liver failure, previous graft dysfunction, simultaneous multiple organ transplantation, non-heart beating donors, and those needing urgent retransplantation during the study period were excluded. The analysis comprised 471 patients.Main variables of interest:Pretransplant characteristics were the main variables of interest. The LTR were grouped according to the dependent variable (early mortality). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of early mortality. The discriminating capacity of the models obtained was evaluated by comparing ROC curves (models versus MELD-Na).Results:The MELD-Na score (OR = 1.069, 95% CI = 1.014-1.127), age > 60 years (OR = 2.479, 95% CI = 1.226-5.015), and LTR height Conclusions:In LTR due to decompensated cirrhosis, the MELD-Na score, age > 60 years, and height
