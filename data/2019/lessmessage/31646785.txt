Purpose:To investigate the therapeutic effect of 125I seed implantation combined with chemotherapy and antiviral therapy on hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cancer.Methods:A total of 126 patients with HBV-related liver cancer were selected and divided into observation group (n=63) and control group (n=63). The patients in the control group were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and antiviral therapy, while those in the observation group were treated with 125I seed implantation combined with TACE and antiviral therapy. The therapeutic effect, liver function, serum HBV DNA and tumor marker levels, and changes in Child-Pugh score and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score before and after treatment were compared between the two groups.Results:After treatment in the observation group, the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HBV DNA, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels and Child-Pugh score were lower than those in the control group, while the KPS score was significantly higher than in the control group (p0.05). The remission rate in the observation group was obviously higher than in the control group (pConclusion:125I seed implantation combined with chemotherapy and antiviral therapy can effectively eliminate HBV DNA, improve liver function, increase quality of life and enhance the therapeutic effect in patients with HBV-related liver cancer, so it is worthy of clinical popularization.
