Background:The treatment of oligometastatic disease is challenging and few data exist to guide treatment decisions. The objective of this study was to improve the data on the prevalence and treatment of patients with oligometastatic disease.Methods:We conducted a prospective single-center analysis that included all consecutive patients discussed in multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDT) between February and July 2017. Patients with oligometastatic disease were identified and treatment strategies were evaluated.Results:1,673 patients were included in this study, 609 (36.4%) presented with metastatic disease, 151 (9%) had oligometastatic disease. Common metastatic sites were brain, liver, and lung. Lung cancer patients were the largest cohort (20.5%) among all patients with oligometastatic disease compared with other tumor entities. The majority of oligometastatic patients (68.9%) received local treatment with or without additional chemotherapy, 17.9% were recommended systemic therapy alone. MDT recommended watchful waiting for 4.6% of the patients.Conclusion:Patients with oligometastatic disease represent a considerable proportion of all patients in MDT. In this study, 68.9% of patients with oligometastatic disease received regional treatment. This shows a possible treatment shift from palliative to potentially curative intent. These data may be used to design prospective clinical trials to optimize the treatment of oligometastatic disease.
