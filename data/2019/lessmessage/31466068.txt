Background/aim:Lenvatinib (LEN) has been developed for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (u-HCC). We aimed to elucidate the relative change in hepatic reserve function early following LEN treatment in affected patients.Materials/methods:From March 2018 to April 2019, 123 u-HCC patients (median age 71 years; male:female ratio 95:28; Child-Pugh score 5:6:7 = 65:50:8; modified albumin-bilirubin [mALBI] grade 1:2a:2b:3 = 44:28:50:1, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A:B:C = 1:49:73) were enrolled. Relative changes in hepatic reserve function at 2 and 4 weeks after starting LEN were retrospectively evaluated.Results:The median survival was 11.3 months. The Child-Pugh score declined from the start to 4 weeks after commencing LEN (score 5:6:7:8:9:≥10 = 65:50:8:0:0:0 vs. 50:39:22:8:0:4, p Conclusion:Decline in hepatic function is common in the early stage (≤4 weeks, especially within 2 weeks) after introducing LEN. It is important to introduce molecular targeting agent drugs for u-HCC in patients with better hepatic function, who show transarterial catheter chemoembolization failure, as much as possible, along with consideration of the negative influence of LEN on the early response of hepatic function.
