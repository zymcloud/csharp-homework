Annual dermatologic examination is required in all transplant recipients because of the high risk of skin cancers. Nevertheless, if the transplant recipient is merely advised to have a dermatologic consultation, the adherence usually appears to be poor. We analyzed our population of liver transplant recipients in 2 periods: in 2014 (group 1) and in 2016 (group 2), when we had organized the presence of a dermatologist at scheduled intervals to annually examine the entire liver transplant population we actively follow-up. The adherence to dermatologic screening during period 1 was significantly lower (50/179; 28% of patients) than during period 2 (198/200; 99% of patients) (P < .0001). In group 1 and 2, respectively, we found cutaneous lesions in 3 of 50 (6%) and in 13 of 198 (7%) examined patients and in 3 of 179 (1.7%) and in 13 of 200 (6.5%) of the whole groups of patients in follow-up (P = .02). The type of neoplastic lesions found at dermatologic visits were similar in group 1 (1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 basal cell carcinoma) and group 2 (2 squamous cell carcinoma, 3 basal cell carcinoma) (P = .45), but with this intensive protocol of surveillance we discovered more preneoplastic lesions (1 leukoplakia in group 1 vs 7 actinic keratosis and 1 dysplastic nevus in group 2; P = .03). These results suggest that the planned presence of a dermatologist is mandatory among the many aspects of a well-organized transplant follow-up team.
