Introduction:Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade has been recently used in evaluation of liver function and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, in Vietnam, the utility of ALBI grade in clinical setting has not been adequately investigated.Methods:This is a retrospective study of 110 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib from January 2010 to November 2018 at 2 tertiary hospitals in Vietnam. Prognostic value of ALBI grade was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional regression model.Results:Results showed that the majority of ALBI grade 1 were Child-Pugh level A (97.5%); ALBI grade 2 was seen in all Child-Pugh score groups of 5, 6, 7, ≥8, whereas ALBI grade 3 was mostly reported in Child-Pugh score ≥8 group (83.3%). Compared with ALBI grade 3, ALBI grade 1 reduced 66.4% risk of death (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.336, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.115-0.981; P = .046). Compared with ALBI grade 3, ALBI grade 2 reduced 67.3% risk of death (HR = 0.327, 95% CI: 0.122-0.875; P = .026). Albumin-bilirubin grade was an independent predictor of survival outcome.Conclusion:Baseline ALBI grade is a simple and objective approach in assessing liver functions of patients with HCC. Baseline ALBI grade is an independent predictor of survival in patients treated with sorafenib.
