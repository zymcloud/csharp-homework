Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has low prevalence rates, but is endemic in some regions of the world. It is usually a chronic asymptomatic infection, but it can be associated with serious neurologic and urinary conditions. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is broadly spread out worldwide. The majority of these infections have a chronic course that may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Objectives:To compare sociodemographic and mental health (risk behaviors, depression, and suicide) aspects, and quality of life among patients with HCV or HTLV-1.Methods:Observational, comparative and cross-sectional study involving outpatients with HCV or HLTV-1 infection. Sociodemographic characteristics, risk behaviors and quality of life were assessed through the questionnaires Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview - MINI Plus (depression and suicide) and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (quality of life). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses (hierarchical logistic regression) were conducted.Results:143 individuals with HCV and 113 individuals with HTLV-1 infection were included. Males were predominant in the HCV group (68.8%) and females in the HTLV-1 group (71.7%). The frequency of risk behaviors (sexual and drug use) was greater in those with HCV (p Conclusions:Risk behaviors are frequent among those infected with HCV. Additionally, despite HTLV-1 being considered an infection with low morbidity, issues related to mental health (depressive episode) and decreased quality of life are relevant.
