Objective:The clinical significance of coexistence of HBsAg/anti-HBs in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients remains controversial. This study was aimed to assess the association of this serological pattern with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with CHB.Methods:In this cross-section study, 206 CHB patients with coexistence of HBsAg/anti-HBs and 206 CHB patients with HBsAg alone were included to evaluate the risk of HCC development by logistic regression analysis. In addition, a retrospective cohort of 260 patients with CHB was recruited to estimate the cumulative incidence of HCC by Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:The serological pattern of coexistence of HBsAg/anti-HBs, with high levels of ("High") HBsAg/low levels of ("Low") anti-HBs, were considered as independent risk factors for HCC. In particular, patients with "High" HBsAg/"High" anti-HBs [odds ratio (OR), 4.295; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.104-16.699; p = 0.035] and "Low" HBsAg/ "High" anti-HBs (OR, 3.207; 95%CI, 1.299-7.919; p = 0.012) exhibited significantly higher risk for HCC development. However, only "Low" HBsAg /"High" anti-HBs might increase risk of HCC in CHB patients with high HBV load (logrank p Conclusion:The coexistence of "Low" HBsAg /"High" anti-HBs might increase the risk of HCC development in CHB patients with high HBV load, which reflected that the long-term interaction between immune response and virus might lead to the development of HCC. The identification of the patients with poor prognosis will help clinicians to refine the therapeutic decisions and individualize follow-up strategies.
