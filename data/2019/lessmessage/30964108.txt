Purpose:The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of percutaneous transauricular artery access for hepatic artery catheterization using a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) device and hepatic artery catheterization through auricular approach.Methods:Ten New Zealand White rabbits were used to establish a VX2 liver tumor model. Hepatic artery angiography and embolization were performed 3 weeks after inoculation. The rabbits were restrained in supine position under anesthesia. Intra-arterial access was accomplished with percutaneous Seldinger technique through the auricular artery using a PICC device. The hepatic artery catheterization was performed with a microcatheter and guide wire. The rate of technical success and procedure time was investigated.Results:Two rabbits failed initial percutaneous transauricular arterial access, with success in a contralateral attempt. Thus, percutaneous transauricular arterial access was achieved in 10 of 12 auricular arteries, with a technical success rate of 83.3%. The time needed to obtain intra-auricular access was 7.2 Â± 3.1 min. Hepatic artery catheterization, angiography, and embolization were accomplished through the auricular approach in all 10 rabbits.Conclusion:Arterial access in rabbits can be achieved through the auricular artery. Hepatic artery catheterization, angiography, and embolization can be performed through auricular arterial access.
