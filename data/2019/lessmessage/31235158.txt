Aims:Glucose tolerance abnormalities are frequently observed in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Insulin resistance (IR) has been suggested to be a major factor responsible for these abnormalities in CLD. However studies relating IR with severity of CLD are scarce in Nigeria. This study assessed insulin resistance and glucose tolerance abnormalities in CLD and their relationship with the severity of CLD in a tertiary hospital in South-West, Nigeria.Methods:This cross sectional study involved 100 subjects with CLD. Ethical clearance was obtained and informed consent was granted by participants. Participants were interviewed using a structured proforma; physical examination and relevant investigations were performed. Insulin resistance was measured using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) Data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0 and p value of Results:Mean age of the study participants was 51.9 ± 11.9 years, and mean duration of CLD was 15.9 ± 5.8 months. Glucose tolerance abnormalities were present in 66 subjects (66%) and increased from 16.1% in Child Pugh's class A to 90.0% in class C. HOMA-IR positively correlated with age, body mass index, serum blood glucose, duration and severity of CLD. Increasing age, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, Child Pugh's class B and class C were associated with glucose tolerance abnormalities.Conclusion:Glucose tolerance abnormalities and insulin resistance were highly prevalent among chronic liver disease subjects studied and seemed to parallel the severity of CLD, determined by the Child Pugh's score.
