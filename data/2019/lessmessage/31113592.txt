Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon tumor primarily occurring in the salivary glands and is relatively rare in other sites. In the liver, only one primary adenoid cystic carcinoma has been reported in the English literature. Here we presented a primary hepatic adenoid cystic carcinoma in a 44 years old male. We described its histopathologic features and its immunohistochemical profile, and reviewed the literature. The surgical treatment and patient follow up information was also presented.
