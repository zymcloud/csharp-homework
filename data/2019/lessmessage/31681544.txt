Background:Hepatitis B viral infection is the most common cause of hepatitis, and it leads to serious liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Aim:The aim of the study is to differentiate acute hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) among patients seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).Materials and methods:This study was carried out in the Department of Microbiology, Chettinad Hospital and Research Institute, Kelambakkam, Tamil Nadu, India, for a period of 6 months (January 2018-June 2018). Blood samples were collected from 87 patients for the detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) serological markers. HBsAg, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBc total, anti-HBc IgM, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen were screened using the ELISA method. Detailed demographic profile including history of previous hepatitis infection, previous blood transfusion, and other related details were collected and documented using a structured questionnaire.Results:A total of 87 patients were HBsAg seropositive; among them, 55 (63.2%) were male and 32 (36.9%) were female. Based on the serological markers tested, 24 and 63 were suffering from acute and chronic HBV infections, respectively. Among the acute hepatitis B patients, all samples were seropositive for HBsAg, anti-HBc total, and anti-HBc IgM. HBeAg seromarker was found in 15 patients (62.5%). Among the CHB patients, all samples were seropositive for HBsAg and anti-HBc total. HBeAg seromarker was found in 28 patients with 44.4%. Alcohol consumption was the major risk factor for the transmission of HBV infection.Conclusion:An increased sample size and detailed study of high-risk behavior will provide an alarming awareness of their association.
Acute hepatitis B virus infection; chronic hepatitis B infection; hepatitis B virus; serological markers.
