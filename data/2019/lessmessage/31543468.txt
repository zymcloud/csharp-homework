Introduction and objectives:Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) indication of liver transplant (LT) has increased recently, whereas alcoholic cirrhosis remains a major indication for LT. To characterize NASH-related cases and to compare the post-transplant outcome of these two conditions represents our major objective.Material and methods:Patients undergoing LT for NASH between 1997 and 2016 were retrieved. Those transplanted between 1997 and 2006 were compared to an "age and LT date" matched group of patients transplanted for alcoholic cirrhosis (ratio 1:2). Baseline features and medium-term outcome measures were compared.Results:Of 1986 LT performed between 1997 and 2016, 40 (2%) were labeled as NASH-related indications. NASH-related cases increased initially (from 0.8% in 1997-2001 to 2.7% in 2002-2006) but remained stable in subsequent years (2.3%). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prevalence was greater in NASH-vs alcohol-related cirrhosis (40% vs 3%, p=0.001). The incidence of overweight, obesity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hyperuricemia, renal insufficiency and cardiovascular (CV) disease was similar in both groups at 5 years post-LT. Five-year survival was higher in NASH but without reaching statistical significance (83% vs 72%, p=0.21). The main cause of mortality in NASH-LT patients was HCC recurrence.Conclusion:Most previously considered cryptogenic cases are actually NASH-cirrhosis. While the incidence of this indication is increasing in many countries, it has remained relatively stable in our Unit, the largest LT center in Spain. HCC is common in these patients and represents a main cause of post-transplant mortality. Metabolic complications, CV-related disease and 5-yr survival do not differ in patients transplanted for NASH vs alcohol.
