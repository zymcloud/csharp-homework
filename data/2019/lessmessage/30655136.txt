Liver transplantation has evolved from an experimental treatment to be considered as the most effective therapy for end-stage liver disease and selected cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Transplant hepatologists must have specific knowledge and abilities to treat those patients who receive a liver transplant. In Spain, approximately 1100 liver transplants are performed each year, and most centers assume both postoperative care and long-term follow-up, which has led to a significant work load in liver transplant units. Despite previous attempts to establish an official training program in hepatology, the Spanish health system does not presently have a specific liver transplant training program to guarantee that future needs of physicians are covered. Collaboration between health authorities and scientific societies is required to guarantee adequate assistance to liver transplant recipients in the future.
