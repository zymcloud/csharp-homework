Introduction:New imaging studies have appeared in recent years for the diagnosis and follow-up of metastatic urological tumours.Material and methods:A total of 41 patients were reviewed with suspected recurrence of a urothelial or kidney tumour, analysing the diagnostic performance of PET-CT scans undertaken between 2013 and 2016.Results:We collected 17 urothelial tumours and 24 renal tumours, with a median follow-up of 30 months. A total of 39.3% of the urothelial tumours were high grade and 29.3% of the kidney tumours were clear cell Fuhrman II. As a whole, the imaging studies detected recurrences in 34 patients. CT was positive in 83% of the patients, while the PET scan was positive in 75.6%, CT/PET coincidence was 50%. The PET scan detected further disease in 41% of the cases compared to 5% by CT. This resulted in a change of therapeutic strategy in 40% of the patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the CT and the PET scans were 92% and 92%, 57% and 100%, 92% and 100%, and 57% and 70% respectively.Conclusion:The PET scan showed similar sensitivity for urological tumours to the standard imaging techniques but with higher specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. This led to a change in treatment strategy for 40% of the patients in our series. The PET scan will probably become the standard test in the extension and follow-up studies of most urological tumours.
