Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignant tumor and second most common cause of tumor-related deaths worldwide. Activated platelets play a prominent role in tumor. Platelet distribution width (PDW) indicates platelets activation and is altered in malignancies. The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic value of PDW for overall survival (OS) in HCC patients.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 273 HCC patients at a single institution from 2010 to 2014. The relationship between PDW and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship of PDW with OS.Results:Low PDW levels were observed in 127 (46.5%) out of 273 patients. A significant correlation was found between PDW and liver cirrhosis. Median follow-up was 36 months, survival curves revealed that the patients with increased PDW had significantly shorter survival time than those with normal PDW (p= 0.001). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that PDW was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.464; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.402-4.330, p= 0.001).Conclusion:PDW is significantly associated with OS in HCC. This result suggests activated platelet may affect clinical outcome and warrant continued investigation.
