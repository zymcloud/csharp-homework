Purpose:The present study explored the potential of microwaves on membrane fluidity changes in diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in vivo.Methods:Rats were segregated into four groups: normal control, DEN-treated, microwave-treated, DEN+microwave-treated. Brush border membranes (BBM) were isolated from the rats and, using the membrane extrinsic fluorophore pyrene, we assessed the viscosities as well as fluidity parameters.Results:DEN treatment resulted in a significant rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO). Reduced glutathione levels (GSH) and the activities of glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were found to be significantly decreased following DEN treatment. On the other hand, microwave treatment in DEN-treated rats resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of lipid peroxidation but caused a significant rise in the levels of GSH as well in the activities of GR, GST, SOD, CAT and GPx. The results further demonstrated a marked decrease in membrane microviscosity following DEN treatment. On the other hand, a significant increase was observed in the excimer/monomer ratio and fluidity parameter of DEN-treated rats when compared to normal control rats. However, the alterations in membrane microviscosity and the fluidity parameters were significantly restored after microwave treatment.Conclusion:The study, therefore, concludes that microwave proved quite useful in the modulation of membrane stability parameters following DEN-induced hepatic cancer.
