Background/aim:If both distant metastases and the primary tumour of colorectal cancer (CRC) are resectable, resection of the distant metastases is considered. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the efficacy of curative resection of both primary and metastatic lesions in organs other than liver or lung in CRC patients.Patients and methods:The medical records of 23 CRC patients who received R0 resection for primary and metastatic regions between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The 3-year overall survival (OS) in all 23 cases was 80.0%. There was no clinicopathological factor associated with OS on univariate analysis.Conclusion:Curative surgical resection appears to be useful for distant CRC metastases to organs other than liver or lung.
