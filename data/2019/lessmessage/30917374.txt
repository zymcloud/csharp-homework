Background:Despite improvements in therapy of colorectal cancer, some patients will present occurrence of recurrence either locally or distantly. Tumor metastasis constitutes the major cause of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality. Nectin-1 belongs to the family of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules that contribute to the formation of cell-cell adhesions and regulate a series of cellular activities including cell polarization, differentiation, movement, proliferation, and survival. Expression of Nectin-1 in malignant tumors has been associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes.Objectives:The aim of the present study was to assess Nectin-1 expression patterns in colorectal cancer and to investigate its clinical significance.Methods:Nectin-1 expression was assessed via immunohistochemistry in surgical specimens of a cohort comprised of 111 patients with primary resectable colorectal cancer. Results were correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survival data. Progression-free survival was defined as the primary outcome of the present study.Results:Nectin-1 was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of colorectal cancer cells. High Nectin-1 expression was associated with advanced stage of disease (p = 0.012) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.007). Progression-free survival of patients exhibiting high expression of Nectin-1 in the first 36 months after surgery was significantly worse compared to patients with low expression of Nectin-1 (55.7%, 95% CI = 47-70, vs. 82.1%, 95% CI = 69-93, p = 0.014) and independent of other clinicopathological characteristics (HR = 0.389, 95% CI = 0.156-0.972, p = 0.043).Conclusion:Nectin-1 expression in colorectal cancer is associated with a significantly worse 3-year progression-free survival identifying therefore a group of patients with high risk for early disease recurrence.
