Background:Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core biopsy (CB) are used to diagnose liver lesions. Rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE) can improve the adequacy of the procedures and help triage diagnostic material appropriately. There are very few studies evaluating the role of ROSE for CB and FNA of mass lesions of the liver.Methods:Liver cases with ROSE material from 2007 to 2017 were retrieved and reviewed. The ROSE material was re-evaluated by 2 cytopathologists who were blinded to the final diagnosis. Data including age, number of lesions, number of passes, adequacy assessed at time of procedure, and diagnosis made by cytopathologist on ROSE material at time of re-review was compiled.Results:A total of 82 cases were identified; 33 were primary lesions (group A) and 49 were metastatic lesions (group B). ROSE done by cytotechnologist at time of procedure showed an adequacy rate of 84%. During re-review of ROSE material by cytopathologists, the overall adequacy rates were similar, although the adequacy rates in group B increased (to 100% from 92%) and it dropped in group A (from 73% to 52%). The overall accuracy rate was 90%. Hepatocellular adenoma, regenerative nodules, well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and angiosarcoma were not possible to diagnose on smears alone during ROSE.Conclusions:ROSE for liver lesions is useful for assessing adequacy. Certain lesions cannot be accurately diagnosed on ROSE alone. ROSE material when assessed by cytopathologist can improve adequacy rate and possibly decrease number of nondiagnostic specimens in group A, though the cost effectiveness needs to be assessed.
