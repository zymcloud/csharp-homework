Background/objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a multistep process starting from chronic hepatitis (CH) that progress through cirrhosis to HCC. The expression level of microRNA (miRNA) was found to be deregulated in HCC. The study was designed to find out whether the expression level of miR-21 and miR-122 was deregulated in HCC compared to controls without HCC.Methods:Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to find out the miRNA expression level using Ct value followed by statistical analysis where P value â‰¤ 0.05 was considered as significant.Results:Overexpression of miR-21 and miR-122 in HCC was detected. All changes in the expression level of miR-21 and miR-122 were due to HCC compared with healthy control, CH, and liver cirrhosis. Hence miR-21 and miR-122 are suitable to differentiate HCC with an efficient diagnostic power of sensitivity, specificity, and expression level, but they might not have any role in patients' survival.Conclusion:miR-21 and miR-122 could be considered as potential markers of HCC screening molecule in addition to other approved markers. However the current study is limited to expression levels of miRNAs from serum; therefore, it needs further validated study in a large group of population to fulfill all the criteria of a biomarker.
