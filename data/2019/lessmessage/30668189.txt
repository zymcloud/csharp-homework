Objective:To compare efficacy and safety of microbubble contrast agent (SonoVue) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:According to our inclusion criteria, we retrospectively reviewed 52 patients with HCCs, and divided them into SonoVue group and TACE group. Tumors were examined by enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Change of lesions, alpha-fetoprotein values, hepatic and renal function were measured pre- and postoperatively. Then, adverse events were observed and clinical follow-up was performed.Results:Clinical efficacy and the majority of treatment parameters were similar, except for time and energy required for the first massive grey-scale changes in SonoVue group, which were significantly lower than those in TACE group (p Conclusion:Using microbubble (SonoVue) in HIFU procedure has a similar therapeutic effect compared with TACE, and does not increase the risk of treatment. It might present a new strategy in clinical treatment, especially for patients with a smaller diameter of HCC.
