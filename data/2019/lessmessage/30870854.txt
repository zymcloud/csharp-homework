Objectives:We aimed to evaluate the associations between body iron stores and the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a Chinese population and explore whether this effect may be modified by other factors.Methods:A 1: 1 frequency-matched case-control study was conducted, including 482 NAFLD cases and 490 gender- and age-matched controls. Serum levels of ferritin, hepcidin, and C-reactive protein were measured.Results:Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hepcidin was not associated with NAFLD risk; however, elevated serum ferritin was significantly associated with increased risk of NAFLD (adjusted OR 1.619, 95% CI 1.158-2.267), and hepcidin:ferritin ratio was significantly associated with decreased risk of NAFLD -(OR-adjusted 0.702, 95% CI 0.501-0.984). When stratified by gender, a significant association was found between elevated serum ferritin and hepcidin:ferritin ratio and NAFLD only for women (ORadjusted 2.131, 95% CI 1.151-3.944 and ORadjusted 0.414, 95% CI 0.219-0.781, respectively). A significant multiplicative interaction between central obesity and elevated serum hepcidin was observed (p < 0.05).Conclusions:Elevated serum ferritin and hepcidin:ferritin ratio are associated with NAFLD in a Chinese population. Although serum hepcidin is not associated with NAFLD, it may augment the risk effect of central obesity on NAFLD.
