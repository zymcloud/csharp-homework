Background:Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C, including transplant recipients with an advanced fibrosis stage. Our aim in this study was to assess the clinical and functional benefits and improvement in liver fibrosis after treatment with DAAs in liver transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis C virus who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR).Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 42 patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT) at our institution and were treated with DAAs from June 2014 to December 2015. Two patients died, so we ultimately included 40 transplant patients with chronic hepatitis C who received DAAs and achieved SVR. We assessed liver function, fibrosis stage, and clinical features at the start of the treatment, and then at 6 and 12 months after SVR. The indication for LT was hepatocellular carcinoma in 8 patients (20%) and Child-Pugh score B/C in 32 patients (80%).Results:The DAAs regimens were sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir (45.0%), simeprevir plus sofosbuvir (42.5%), sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (7.5%), and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (5%). The mean Modified End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score pretreatment was 10.78, and was 8.46 at 1 year after treatment (P Conclusion:DAAs were used successfully in the treatment of hepatitis C after orthotopic liver transplantation and resulted in significant improvement in liver function as measured by MELD score, fibrosis level, and cirrhotic clinical condition, even in patients with very advanced disease.
