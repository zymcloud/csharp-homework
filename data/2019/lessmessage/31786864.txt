Purpose:To investigate the effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and antiviral therapy on the prognosis and quality of life in primary chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cancer.Methods:A total of 80 hepatitis B patients complicated with hepatocellular carcinoma treated in our hospital from March 2016 to February 2018 were selected and divided into the control group (n=40) and the observation group (n=40) using a random number table. The patients in the control group were treated with RFA combined with TACE, while those in the observation group were additionally treated with entecavir. The HBV-DNA load and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level during intervention and the liver function before and after intervention were compared between the two groups. The patients were followed up for 2 years after treatment, the clinical therapeutic effects in both groups were recorded, and the correlations of HBV-DNA load, AFP level and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level with the survival time of patients were analyzed.Results:At 1 and 3 months after intervention, the HBV-DNA load in the observation group was significantly lower than that before intervention (pConclusions:The RFA combined with TACE and regular antiviral therapy for HBV-related liver cancer is of significance in reducing the HBV-DNA load and tumor markers, improving the liver function, promoting the overall clinical therapeutic effect and prolonging the survival of patients.
