Background:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The objective of this study was to predict the impact of EBR/GZR on the incidence of liver and kidney related complications compared with no treatment (NoTx) and pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) in patients with CKD stage 4/5 in Vietnam.Methods:We developed a mathematical model of the natural history of chronic HCV, CKD, and liver disease. Efficacy of EBR/GZR and pegIFN/RBV were derived from the C-SURFER trial and a meta-analysis, respectively. We calculated lifetime cumulative morbidity and mortality rates, including incidence of decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and life expectancy.Results:Estimated lifetime incidence of DC was significantly reduced in patients receiving EBR/GZR (3.47%) compared to NoTx (18.14%) and pegIFN/RBV (9.01%). Estimated incidence of HCC was 1.02%, 21.64%, and 8.90%, and 1.02% in patients receiving EBR/GZR, NoTx, and pegIFN/RBV. EBR/GZR was estimated to extend life expectancy by 4.2 and 2.0 years compared with NoTx and pegIFN/RBV.Conclusions:Our model predicted that EBR/GZR will significantly reduce the incidence of liver-related complications and prolong life in patients with chronic HCV GT1 infection and CKD compared with NoTx or pegIFN/RBV.
