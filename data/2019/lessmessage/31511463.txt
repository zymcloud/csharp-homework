A 77-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in segment 8 of the liver. Necrosis was confirmed radiologically. After 19 months, recurrent HCC in segment 6 was treated with TACE and RFA. There was no recurrence. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy 24 months after the initial procedure led to a sustained virologic response. AFP-L3 markedly increased 11 months after DAA therapy, and MRI 6 months after that showed a solitary lymph node near the common bile duct. Because no intrahepatic recurrence or other lymph nodes were seen, the solitary node was excised. Histopathology showed metastatic HCC. There has been no subsequent recurrence over 13 months of follow-up.
