Purpose of review:The supplementation of dietary additives into processed foods has exponentially increased in the past few decades. Similarly, the incidence rates of various diseases, including metabolic syndrome, gut dysbiosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, have been elevating. Current research reveals that there is a positive association between food additives and these pathophysiological diseases. This review highlights the research published within the past 5 years that elucidate and update the effects of dietary supplements on liver and intestinal health.Recent findings:Some of the key findings include: enterocyte dysfunction of fructose clearance causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); non-caloric sweeteners are hepatotoxic; dietary emulsifiers instigate gut dysbiosis and hepatocarcinogenesis; and certain prebiotics can induce cholestatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in gut dysbiotic mice. Overall, multiple reports suggest that the administration of purified, dietary supplements could cause functional damage to both the liver and gut.Summary:The extraction of bioactive components from natural resources was considered a brilliant method to modulate human health. However, current research highlights that such purified components may negatively affect individuals with microbiotal dysbiosis, resulting in a deeper break of the symbiotic relationship between the host and gut microbiota, which can lead to repercussions on gut and liver health. Therefore, ingestion of these dietary additives should not go without some caution!
