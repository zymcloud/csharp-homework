Background/aim:The outcome of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor and therapeutic options, including sorafenib, the first anti-cancer drug proved to prolong survival in patients with advanced HCC, are limited. However, no clinically useful predictive biomarker for sorafenib has been reported.Materials and methods:We exploited two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry to find de-regulated proteins by using conditioning of a sorafenib-resistant HCC cell line, Huh7. Tumor samples from 60 patients with HCC treated with sorafenib were analyzed and correlated with survival outcome.Results:Comparative proteomics indicated three proteins including, 78 kDa glucose related protein (GRP78), 14-3-3ε, and heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β). The three proteins were over-expressed in sorafenib-resistant Huh7 cells. In HCC tumor samples from patients treated with sorafenib, 73% of tumor samples had a high expression of GRP78, 18% had high 14-3-3ε expression and 85% had high HSP90β expression. Among these, GRP78 was associated with the shortest progression-free survival of HCC patients treated with sorafenib.Conclusion:GRP78 can be a predictive biomarker in HCC patients treated with sorafenib. Strategies designed to inhibit the GRP78-related pathway may overcome sorafenib resistance.
