Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major public health issue, being associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Previous studies have demonstrated that reduction andâˆ•or absence of E-cadherin expression is correlated with a potential for invasion and low survival rate in patients with HCC.Patients, materials and methods:We assessed the immunohistochemical expression of E-cadherin in 32 HCCs and peritumoral hepatic tissues using monoclonal anti-E-cadherin antibody (clone EP700Y), at 1:50 dilution, followed by incubation with Labeled Streptavidin-Biotin 2 (LSAB2) for 20 minutes, visualization of the reaction with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstaining with Mayer's Hematoxylin.Results:The results we obtained show: an aberrant E-cadherin expression more frequent in dysplastic nodules (p=0.285) and in 81.25% of HCC cases, as compared to normal hepatic tissue (pConclusions:Reduced E-cadherin expression indicates a poor prognosis for patients with HCC and can be considered a potential predictive marker for the prognosis of these patients.
