Purpose:To compare the short-term efficacy and safety of laparoscopic precise hepatectomy and conventional open hepatectomy in the treatment of primary hepatocellular cancer.Methods:90 patients with primary hepatocellular cancer admitted to our hospital from September 2015 to September 2017 were collected and divided into the laparoscopic precise hepatectomy group (experimental group, n=45) and conventional open hepatectomy group (control group, n=45). The differences in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative time with drainage tubes, perioperative blood transfusion, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative liver function indicators, postoperative complications and 1-year tumor recurrence rate and survival rate after operation between the two groups were compared.Results:The general clinical features of the two groups of patients were comparable, and there was no perioperative death. The operation time in the experimental group was longer than that in the control group (106.5±26.4 min vs. 95.2±21.3 min, p=0.028). The intraoperative blood loss in the experimental group was less than that in the control group (204.3±34.9 mL vs. 285.2±39.9 mL, pConclusion:Laparoscopic precise hepatectomy for the treatment of primary hepatocellular cancer significantly reduces intraoperative blood loss, shortens hospital stay, causes less trauma to patients and liver function damage, improves the 1-year survival rate, and has a lower incidence rate of complications than the traditional laparotomy, so it is worthy of clinical promotion.
