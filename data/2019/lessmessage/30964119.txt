Objective:The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound (US)-guided interventional treatments in local tumor control (LTC) for thoracoabdominal wall seeding tumor (TAWST) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and explore the survival outcomes of the patients underwent surgical resection (SR) and microwave ablation (MWA) for intrahepatic tumor.Materials and methods:A total of 40 patients with 47 TAWST from HCC were recruited from April 2007 to May 2018. LTC was evaluated by contrast-enchanced image. Long-time survival outcomes were compared. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local seeding progress-free survival (LSPFS) were analyzed.Results:One-year LTC rate was 65.2% in all patients; 72%, 0%, 50%, and 0% in the patients who underwent MWA, high-intensity focused US, iodine-125 (125I) brachytherapy and MWA combined with 125I brachytherapy, respectively. The 3-year OS, DFS rates and LSPFS rates were 51.8% and 28.6%, 12.0% and 23.8%, and 10.0% and 10.0% after MWA and SR, respectively. Univariate analysis results showed that age (P = 0.049), Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) (P = 0.002), and chemoradiation (P = 0.032); and multivariate analysis results showed that age (P = 0.045) and KPS (P = 0.010) might be predictors for LCT. While univariate analysis results showed that KPS (P = 0.032), intrahepatic tumor size (P = 0.006), chemoradiation (P = 0.003), preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level (P = 0.007), metastasis (P = 0.049), and albumin-bilirubin grade (P = 0.002), and multivariate analysis results showed that comorbidities (P = 0.004), KPS (P = 0.007), and metastasis (P = 0.009) might be predictors for OS. The pain degree of patients was improved obviously after treatments.Conclusions:US-guided interventional treatments were an effective option in LTC for TAWST from HCC, and MWA could achieve comparable long-time survival outcomes with SR for HCC patients with TAWST.
