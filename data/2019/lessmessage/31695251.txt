Diabetes mellitus is a rising epidemic in most part of the world and is often associated with multiple organ disorders such as kidney, liver, and cardiovascular diseases. Liver is a major metabolic hub, and the metabolic disorders associated with diabetes result in liver dysfunctions culminating in spectrum of liver diseases such as fatty liver disorders, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The intervention strategies to prevent diabetes-associated liver injury require an overall understanding of the key factors and molecular pathways which can be strategically targeted. The present review focuses on some of the key aspects of fatty acid metabolism, fetuin-A regulation, inflammatory pathways, and genetic factors associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and so on involved in the nexus between diabetes and liver injury. Further recent interventions, pharmacological target, and newer therapeutic agents are discussed briefly for the better clinical management of diabetes-associated hepatic disorders.
