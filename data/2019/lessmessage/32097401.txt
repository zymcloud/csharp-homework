Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathie characterized by proximal skeletal muscle weakness, typical skin manifestations and muscle inflammation. This disease has been associated with malignancies as a paraneoplastic syndrome. We present a patient of thirty-three years diagnosed with hepatitis B, chronic inactive HBV who presents papular, pruritic and desquamative lesions on the face, hands, inguinal area and feet. At the physical examination is evidentiated Gottron's papules, heliotrope sign and proximal symmetric muscular weakness. Findings compatible with DM were found in a skin biopsy. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a liver tumor whereby a biopsy was performed and the result was a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Subsequently, a segmentectomy has been made and consequently the DM symptoms decreased. This case is of great interest and rare reason why we decided to reported it.
