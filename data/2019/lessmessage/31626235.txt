Objective:To analyze clinical course and the results of salvage liver transplantation in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver resection.Material and methods:A 54-year-old man with HCV-infection and HCC and 22-year-old woman with fibrolamellar variant of HCC underwent resection of the right and left liver lobe, respectively. The first patient experienced recurrent HCC four times with an interval of 3-6 months within 2 years after surgery. Repeated liver resection was made in first three cases, right liver lobe transplantation - after the fourth recurrence. In the second patient, HCC recurred in 4 months after resection and was accompanied by subtotal portal vein thrombosis. Therefore, repeated liver resection was excluded and patient underwent right liver lobe transplantation.Results:Patients are alive in 5 and 3.5 years after liver resection and in 2.5 and 3 years after transplantation, respectively. There are currently no signs of recurrent HCC in the graft.
