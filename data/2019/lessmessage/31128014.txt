Purpose:To explore the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the combination treatment of dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killers (DC-CIK) and sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients diagnosed with advanced HCC and treated with DC-CIK and/or sorafenib in the Affiliated Changzhou No.2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from January 2015 to January 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. HCC patients were divided into (A): control group (oral administration of sorafenib) and (B): observation group (oral administration of sorafenib combined with DC-CIK). Patients were followed up every 4-8 weeks. Overall survival and adverse events of each patient were recorded. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using the modified RECIST criteria.Results:After treatment, ALT and TBIL were remarkably elevated in the control group and decreased in the observation group. No significant change in AFP level was seen in the control group after treatment, whereas it was remarkably decreased in the observation group. The efficacy rate was 16.7% and 51.4% in the control and observation group, respectively. Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 41.9% and 88.6% in the control group and observation group, respectively. The median survival time of the control and observation group was 13.8 and 18.6 months, respectively. In the observation group there was a significant difference in the survival time between patients with Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B, respectively.Conclusions:DC-CIK combined with sorafenib could improve the tumor response rate and prolong overall survival of advanced HCC without increasing the incidence of adverse events. HCC patients achieve a more stable disease condition and longer overall survival with DC-CIK combined with sorafenib than those with individual sorafenib treatment.
