Hepatocellular carcinoma is a devastating tumor which accounts for death mortality rate 94% globally, and about 780,000 new cases each year. Tumor suppressor miRNAs represent a class of noncoding RNAs, which exhibit decreased or inhibited expression in the case of carcinogenesis. Therefore, the replacement of these molecules leads to post-transcriptional regulation of tens to hundreds of oncogenic targets and limiting the tumor. Interestingly, there is a group of tumor silencer miRNAs that have been highlighted in HCC and herein, our review will discuss the prominent examples of these miRs in terms of their efficient delivery using vectors, nano-delivery systems, their successful models either in vitro or in vivo and pre-clinical trials. Collectively, tumor suppressor miRNAs can act as novel therapeutics for HCC and more studies should be directed towards these promising therapeutics.
