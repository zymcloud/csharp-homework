Background:The superiority of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) compared to SBRT alone as the first-line therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. We conducted this meta-analysis to compare the efficiency and safety of SBRT combined with TACE (ST group) and SBRT alone (SA group).Methods:We searched PubMed, Ovid Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) for related studies. We analyzed overall survival (OS), local control survival (LCS), progression-free survival (PFS), the response rate and adverse effects (AEs) between the 2 groups.Results:Ten articles were included, with a total of 980 patients. The results showed that the ST (SBRT + TACE) group had a longer OS (95% CIs 0.60-0.85, p = 0.0002), a higher 5-year OS rate (95% CI 1.01-2.04, p = 0.04), a higher rate of complete response (95% CI 1.08-1.90, p = 0.01), and a higher disease control rate (95% CI 1.02-1.16, p = 0.02) than the SA (SBRT alone) group. No significant difference was found in LCS, PFS and total AEs of all grades and grades 3-5 AEs between the 2 groups. In the subgroup analysis, the patients with HCC + PVTT or treated with SBRT followed by TACE in the ST group had the same OS as those in the SA group, and the patients in the ST group had a higher incidence rate of leukopenia and fever than those in the SA group.Conclusion:SBRT + TACE appears to be more effective than SBRT alone in treating unresectable HCC. However, its higher incidence rate of leukopenia and fever need to be monitored.
