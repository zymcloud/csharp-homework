Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a rare inherited syndrome characterized by classical mucocutaneous features and the presence of other clinical features including bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and a predisposition to cancer. The symptoms develop at various ages and may manifest over time. Gene mutations associated with DC, such as DC1, TERC, TERT, TINF2, NHP2, NOP10, ACD, CTC1, NAF1, PARN, POT1, RTEL1, STN1, and WRAP53, have been identified in about 70% of patients. Since the number of patients with DC is small and the effect of genetic pathogenic variant may affect the phenotype, we wanted to present the clinical features and course of illness in a patient with NHP2 gene mutation (compound heterozygote for the NHP2 mutations c.376G>A/c.460T>A; amino acid substitutions: p.Val126Met and p.X154Arg) that occurred as a compound heterozygous state.
