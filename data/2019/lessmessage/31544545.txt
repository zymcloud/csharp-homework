Purpose: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and survival outcomes of computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation for adrenal metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: This long-term retrospective study included 27 male patients (median age, 50 years; range, 34-77 years) with 29 adrenal metastatic tumors associated with HCC who underwent ablation between January 2004 and December 2015. The technical success rate, effectiveness rate, complications, and survival were recorded. Complications were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox regression model was used for the evaluation of factors predicting survival. Results: A total of 33 ablation sessions were performed for the 29 tumors. No ablation-related death was observed, and the incidence of complications was 87.9%. Grade 1-2 complications occurred in 23 of the 33 sessions (69.7%), and grade 3 hypertension was the only major complication, occurring in eight sessions (24.2%). The technical success and effectiveness rates were 93.1% (27 of 29 tumors) and 92.6% (25 of 27 patients), respectively. The median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) durations for the 27 patients were 6.9 months and 16.8 months, respectively. The median OS duration was longer for patients with adrenal oligometastases (21.8 months) than for those with (12.8 months) multiple metastases (p = .037). Adrenal oligometastases were the only significant predictor of OS (p = .043). Conclusions: CT-guided ablation is a feasible and safe procedure for adrenal metastases from HCC, and it may be more beneficial for patients with adrenal oligometastases.
