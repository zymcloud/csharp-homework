A Japanese male in his 70s with chronic hepatitis C was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and achieved and maintained complete remission following treatment with eight cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisolone). Seven years later, he received the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b. Although the patient achieved sustained virological response immediately after the initial treatment period, laboratory data showed elevation of LD and soluble IL-2R. Computer tomography showed diffuse intraabdominal lymph node swelling and splenomegaly. Lymph node biopsy revealed the relapse of lymphoma. The lymphoma cells were resistant to chemotherapy, and the patient died five months later. Several studies reported early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after HCV treatment using DAAs. However, the relationship between DAAs and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence remains unclear. Nonetheless, possible cancer recurrence should be considered in patients with a history of lymphoma who are prescribed DAAs to treat HCV.
