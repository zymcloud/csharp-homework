Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, rapidly growing, aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer that generally arises on sun-exposed areas of body such as head, neck, upper limbs, and shoulders of people with light complexity. Typically, MCC presents as shiny, flesh-colored or bluish-red, intracutaneous nodule, possibly with ulceration or crusting. In most of the cases, there is an association with Merkel cell polyomavirus. Even though these are very aggressive tumors, early detection and treatment has always given favorable outcome. There seems to be no consensus in definite prognostic markers, and advanced stages have the worst outcome even with treatment. There has been a recent trend in using PD-I/PD-L1 target therapy rather than chemotherapy in these cancers and have shown to improve survival by many months. In this article, we report a very unusual presentation of MCC first found on left frontoparietal skull as an 8-cm diameter fixed, subcutaneous mass without any typical features of MCC and was found to have metastatic spread to lung and liver. The patient was treated with palliative radiotherapy to brain and chemotherapy with cisplatin/etoposide with addition of immunotherapy later.
