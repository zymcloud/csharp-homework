Purpose:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is widely accepted as a curative treatment for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, insufficient RFA (IRFA) can lead to rapid local recurrence. The underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the role and regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in the recurrence of HCC after IRFA.Materials and methods:SMMC7721 and Huh7 cells were exposed to sublethal heat stress to stimulate the transition zone of IRFA treatment. The levels of autophagy were measured by western blot, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Functional assays, such as CCK-8, EdU incorporation and flow cytometry, were performed to determine the role of heat-induced autophagy. The involved signaling pathways were explored by western blot. Finally, the antitumor effects of chloroquine (CQ) on heat-treated HCC cells were evaluated via an in vivo xenograft tumor model.Results:Sublethal heat stress induced autophagy in a temperature- and time-dependent manner in HCC cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of autophagy by CQ or siRNA targeting the autophagy-related genes Beclin-1 and Atg5 enhanced heat-induced apoptosis. The combination of CQ and heat treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we reported for the first time that the ATP-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway was involved in heat-induced autophagy.Conclusions:Heat stress induced protective autophagy against heat-induced apoptosis in HCC via the ATP-AMPK-mTOR axis, suggesting that targeting autophagy may be a promising strategy for improving the efficacy of RFA treatment for HCC.
