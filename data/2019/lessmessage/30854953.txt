Background:Nanotechnology-based therapies are emerging as a promising new anticancer approach. Early clinical studies suggest that nanoparticle-based therapeutics can show enhanced efficacy while reducing side effects minimal, owing to targeted delivery and active intracellular uptake.Methods:To overcome the problems of gene and drug delivery, nanotechnology based delivery system gained interest in the last two decades. Encouraging results from Nano formulation based drug delivery systems revealed that these emerging restoratives can efficiently lead to more effective, targeted, selective and efficacious delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the affected target cells.Results:Nanotechnology not only inhibits targeted gene products in patients with cancer, but also taught us valuable lessons regarding appropriate dosages and route of administrations. Besides, nanotechnology based therapeutics holds remarkable potential as an effective drug delivery system. We critically highlight the recent findings on nanotechnology mediated therapeutics strategies to combat hepatocellular carcinoma and discuss how nanotechnology platform can have enhanced anticancer effects compared with the parent therapeutic agents they contain.Conclusion:In this review, we discussed the key challenges, recent findings and future perspective in the development of effective nanotechnology-based cancer therapeutics. The emphasis here is focused on nanotechnology-based therapies that are likely to affect clinical investigations and their implications for advancing the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
