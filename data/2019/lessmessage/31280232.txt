Background/aim:The aim of this retrospective study was to identify, using logistic analysis, the factors associated with distant metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer patients carrying mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor.Patients and methods:Patients who were diagnosed with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis up to their death and during the period from April 2009 to March 2019, were included in this study. Clinical charts and imaging studies were reviewed.Results:A total of 64 patients during the research period. The factors associated with pleural metastasis were "female" and "no bone metastasis". The factor associated with brain metastasis was "lung metastasis". The factors associated with liver metastasis were "age under 70" and "Exon 19 deletion".Conclusion:Knowing the factors associated with distant metastasis will provide useful information to conduct targeted and efficient imaging studies.
