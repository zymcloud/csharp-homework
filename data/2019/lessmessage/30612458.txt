Endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays an important role in the acceleration of hepatic inflammation. Natural medicinal plants that can prevent inflammation by targeting LPS have potential therapeutic clinical application. The aim of the study is to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of lotus seedpod extract (LSE), used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine with hemostasis function and for eliminating bruise, on the LPS-induced hepatic inflammation and its underlying molecular mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, LSE and its purified compound (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) dose-dependently inhibited the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- , interleukin (IL)-6, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), without affecting cell viability in LPS-stimulated human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Molecular studies showed the anti-LPS effect of HLP or EGC might be mediated via downregulation of Toll-like receptor 4. (TLR4)-mediated both NF- B and p38 signaling, as demonstrated by the usage of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific NF- B inhibitor. In vivo, LPS-induced hepatic inflammation was significantly ameliorated in LSE-fed mice as gauged by dose-dependent inhibition of serum levels of biochemical markers of liver damage, the changes of hepatic lobular architecture and the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, as well as induction of anti-oxidant enzymes. As a result, our data presented the first evidence of EGC-enriched LSE as an anti-inflammatory agent in LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells and mice, and these findings may open interesting perspectives to the strategy in treatment for hepatic inflammation.
