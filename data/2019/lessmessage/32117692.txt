Background:Although there are thousands of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Bangladesh, almost there is no nationwide recommendations for therapeutic maneuver for HCC patients. As most of the HCC patients of Bangladesh are diagnosed late, patients with advanced HCC with large and multiple HCC nodules represent the usual presentation of HCC. The study is presented here to assess the effects of a combined therapy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib in advanced HCC patients.Materials and methods:A total of 77 patients with advanced HCC were enrolled in this study. All of them had advanced HCC with variable etiologies and clinical conditions. All patients were treated by TACE and also given systemic sorafenib at the same time. The patients were checked 1 and 3 months after therapy commencement.Results:Out of 77 patients, 18 patients died within 1 month and additional 15 patients died within 3 months after therapy commencement. Thus, there remains 44 surviving patients after 3 months. When different parameters of dead patients and survived patients were compared, no specific parameters dictated the factors about overall survival of more than 3 months.Discussion:This is the first approach to initiate an invasive and a systemic therapy for treatment of advanced HCC in Bangladesh. Further follow-up of patients and their long-term overall survival may cast some lights about the role of these therapies in Bangladeshi HCC patients.How to cite this article:Al Mahtab, M, Rahim MA, Noor-E-Alam SM, et al.
