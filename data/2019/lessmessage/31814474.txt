Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of 1.5-T MRI-guided and monitored microwave ablation in patients with hepatic malignant tumors.Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Thirty-five patients (32 men, three women) with 48 lesions (maximum diameter < 3 cm) underwent microwave ablation under the guidance and monitoring of a 1.5-T MRI. The MRI-compatible microwave generator was appended with a magnetic shield case, and the cable was combined with a choke coil for shielding the Larmor processing frequency. The average age of the patients was 56.51 ± 11.36 years (31-77 years). Twenty-eight patients (37 lesions) displayed hepatocellular carcinoma and seven patients (11 lesions) had metastatic liver carcinoma. The mean maximum tumor diameter was 12.31 ± 4.72 mm (range 5.0-25.7 mm).Results: MRI scans were performed simultaneously without electromagnetic interference during ablation. The average maximum diameter of the hypointense zone of the last monitored T2WI sequence, hypointense zone of post-procedure T2WI sequence, and hyperintense zone of post-procedure T1WI were 28.82 ± 7.58 mm, 29.79 ± 7.91 mm, and 28.28 ± 8.37 mm, respectively, with no observed statistical difference (F = 0.434, p = .649). The technical success rate was 100%. The average follow-up duration was 11.43 ± 5.29 (4-33) months. The technique efficacy rate was 100%.Conclusion: MRI-guided and monitored microwave ablation of hepatic malignant tumors is feasible and potentially safe and effective.Key pointsMRI-guided microwave ablation of hepatic malignant tumors is feasible.The MRI monitoring scan could accurately reflect the scope of ablation lesion.On T1WI, the ablation lesions of liver showed the 'target sign'.
