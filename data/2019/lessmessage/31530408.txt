Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of the liver is an unusual benign lesion of unknown pathogenesis. The largest reported series to date includes only 7 cases. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia can be radiologically confused with malignant tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma or metastases. Histological differential diagnosis should be chiefly made with lymphomas, Castleman disease and primary biliary cirrhosis. We report the clinicopathological findings in a 54-year-old woman with an incidental hepatic lesion when she consulted for hematuria. After histological, immunohistochemical and molecular studies, the diagnosis of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia was made.
