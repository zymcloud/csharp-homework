Purpose:To evaluate the effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) under the guidance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One hundred and sixty patients with HCC admitted to Cangzhou Central Hospital from April 2015 to April 2017 were enrolled. The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-five patients who underwent TACE according to CEUS results were selected as the observation group. The remaining 85 cases that underwent digital subtraction augiography (DSA) angiography-guided TACE were selected as the control group and were intravenously infused with 15 mg of Endostar+500 mL of normal saline once a day for 3 consecutive days (Endostar 30 mg was reperfused during the operation). Both groups were re-contrasted at 1 month (T2) and 3 months (T3) to determine whether TACE was performed again. The numbers of TACEs re-performed were recorded. Color Doppler energy imaging was used to observe the neovascularization of the tumor. The changes of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CRP levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results:There were significant differences in the number of TACEs re-performed between the observation group and the control group (pConclusion:CEUS-guided TACE treatment of HCC can effectively inhibit tumor angiogenesis, control tumor progression, and prolong the survival of patients, which is conducive to the prognosis of patients.
