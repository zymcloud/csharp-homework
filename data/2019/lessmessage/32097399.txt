Transarterial hepatic chemoembolization is one of the treatments of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in which associated ischemic lesions have been described infrequently. When unusual upper gastrointestinal symptoms or exceeding the so-called post-chemoembolization syndrome after the procedure, the performance of a gastroscopy should be assessed to rule out the occurrence of these complications. The anatomical variants with common origin of gastric and hepatic arteries can favor the migration of the microspheres into gastric territory, forcing the possible modification of the technique to prevent it.
