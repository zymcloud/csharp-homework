An 85-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital for further examination of a liver tumor. Imaging examination revealed a 90-mm tumor in segment 4/8 and 30-mm tumor in segment 6 of the liver. Histopathological examination revealed that the tumor in segment 4/8 was cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CLC) and the tumor in segment 6 was hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This case shows that although the frequency of CLC is very low, recent studies have indicated the novel knowledge of CLC. Herein, we report a surgical case of CLC and HCC in the background of resolved hepatitis B virus infection.
