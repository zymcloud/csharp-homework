Aim:To evaluate the expression of the growth arrest-specific 8 (GAS8) and its antisense (GAS8-AS1) in gastric cancer.Background:GAS8 exists in a genomic region that is recurrently deleted in breast and prostate cancer. This gene contains a long non-coding RNA, namely GAS8-AS1 whose roles in the regulation of GAS8 has been reported in hepatocytes. GAS8-AS1 has also been regarded as a putative tumor suppressor gene in papillary thyroid cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:In the present study, we evaluated expression levels of GAS8 and GAS8-AS1 in 30 gastric cancer tissues and their corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs).Results:GAS8 was significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues compared to ANCTs (Expression ratio=0.29, pConclusion:The current study underscores the roles of GAS8 and GAS8-AS1 in gastric carcinogenesis and warrants future functional studies to unravel the underlying mechanism of such contribution.
