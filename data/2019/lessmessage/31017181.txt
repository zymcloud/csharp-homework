Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent primary malignancy of liver and accounts for as many as one million deaths worldwide in a year.Objectives:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-cancerous efficiency of Bergenia ciliata rhizome against diethylnitrosoamine induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Balb C mice.Methods:One percent diethylnitrosoamine was prepared by using 99 ml of normal saline NaCl (0.9 percent) solution to which was added 1 ml of concentrated diethylnitrosoamine (DEN) solution (0.01 μg/μl). Extract of Bergenia ciliata was prepared by maceration technique. Mice were classified into four groups as follows: Group 1 a control group (N=7) received saline solution (3.5 μl/mg), group 2 (N=14) received diethylnitrosoamine (3.5 μl/mg) intraperitoneally once in a week for eight consecutive weeks, group 3 (N=7) received plant extract (150 mg/kg (Body weight)) once in a week, while group 4 (N=7) was given combination of diethylnitrosoamine (3.5 μl/mg) and plant extract (150 mg/kg (Body weight)). After eight weeks of DEN induction group 2 mice were divided into two subgroups containing seven mice each, subgroup 1 was sacrificed while subgroup 2 was treated with plant extract (150 mg/kg (Body weight)) once in a week for eight consecutive weeks.Results:The model of DEN injected hepatocellular carcinomic (HCC) mice elicited significant decline in levels of albumin with concomitant significant elevations in tumor markers aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alpha feto protein (AFP), gamma glutamyl transferase (Y-GT), 5 nucleotidase (5NT), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and bilirubin. The intraperitoneal administration of B. ciliata as a protective agent, produced significant increase in albumin levels with significant decrease in the levels of tumor markers aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alpha feto protein (AFP), gamma glutamyl transferase (Y-GT), 5 nucleotidase (5NT), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and bilirubin.Conclusion:Bergenia ciliata has potent antioxidant activity, radical scavenging capacity and anticancerous properties. Bergenia ciliata extracts may provide a basis for development of anti-cancerous drug.
