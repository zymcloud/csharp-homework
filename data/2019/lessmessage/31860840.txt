Chronic infection with hepatitis virus C affects more than 70 million individuals worldwide. Hepatitis C infection is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and multiple extrahepatic manifestations associated with immune system disorders and chronic inflammation. In the era of interferon-free anti-HCV regimens, clinical care for patients with HCV-related liver disease and extrahepatic complications has advanced significantly because of improvements in therapy and prevention. The antiviral capacity of a new generation of direct-acting agents provide high rates of sustained virological response, and it is expected to improve clinical outcomes in these patient populations. The article aims to review published data on the treatment strategy of hepatitis C, including the EASL (European Association for the Study of the Liver) recommendations.
