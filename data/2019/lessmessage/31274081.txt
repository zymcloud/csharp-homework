Polyploidy (alias whole genome amplification) refers to organisms containing more than two basic sets of chromosomes. Polyploidy was first observed in plants more than a century ago, and it is known that such processes occur in many eukaryotes under a variety of circumstances. In mammals, the development of polyploid cells can contribute to tissue differentiation and therefore possibly a gain of function. Alternately, it can be associated with development of disease such as cancer. Polyploidy can occur because of cell fusion or abnormal cell division. Polyploidy is a common characteristic of the mammalian liver. Polyploidization occurs notably during liver development, but also in adults because of cellular stress. Recent progresses have unraveled the mechanisms and functional consequences of hepatocytes polyploidization during normal and pathological liver growth.
