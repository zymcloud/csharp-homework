Hepatic dendritic cells represent a unique and multifaceted subset of antigen-presenting leukocytes that orchestrate specified immune responses in the liver. They are constantly exposed to antigens and signals derived not only from the hepatic microenvironment and the systemic circulation but also from the portal vein draining the gut and conveying food antigens as well as microbial compounds. Modulated by these various factors they shape intrahepatic immune responses during acute and chronic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma and allograft tolerance as well as systemic responses to gut-derived components. Hence, hepatic DC are central targets to decipher and fine-tune innate and adaptive hepatic immune responses as well as tolerance. This review focuses on the origin of hepatic DC, the different DC subsets present in the liver and their functionality during different acute and chronic liver diseases in mice and men and will discuss potential DC directed therapeutic interventions in liver disease.
