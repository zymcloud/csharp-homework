Background/aim:Little evidence is currently available on significant determinants of post-recurrence survival for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate factors influencing post-recurrence survival in HR+/HER2-breast cancer.Patients and methods:A cohort of 236 patients with recurrent HR+/HER2- breast cancer was retrospectively analyzed to identify significant factors correlating with prognosis after recurrence.Results:Multivariate analysis revealed independent prognostic factors of poor survival as follows: short intervals between recurrence and the end of adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET; p=0.046); short disease-free intervals (p=0.019); liver metastasis (p=0.007) or multiple metastases (p<0.001) at recurrence; and a poor response to first-line treatment (p<0.001). A poor first-line treatment response was significantly associated with a shorter response to a subsequent treatment line (p=0.007). Logistic regression analysis indicated that liver metastasis significantly increased the risk of a poor first-line-ET response (p=0.009).Conclusion:The first-line treatment response was the key to post-recurrence survival in patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Particularly poor responses led to subsequent unfavorable prognostic outcomes.
