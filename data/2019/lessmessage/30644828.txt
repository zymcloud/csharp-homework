Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. Metastases to the soft tissues of the oral cavity are extremely uncommon. This report describes a rare case of an oral metastatic HCC, located completely within the oral mucosa overlying the alveolar ridge, in a patient who was unware of his primary disease. A 64-year-old man was referred for evaluation of a nodular mass on the edentulous mandibular ridge underneath an implant-supported overdenture. According to the patient, he was successfully treated for hepatitis C infection 7 years previously, and he reported that his Î±-fetoprotein levels were monitored at semiannual intervals. The results of his current blood tests were within the reference range. A biopsy was performed, and analysis of the specimen revealed a malignant neoplasm suggestive of metastatic HCC. Because the patient was unaware of any underlying disease, he was referred to an oncologist for further evaluation. However, signs of hepatic decompensation appeared immediately after the biopsy results were obtained, and the patient was hospitalized. The overall medical examination disclosed an HCC with metastases to the lungs and oral cavity, and the patient died 8 days after hospitalization. This case reinforces the important potential for dentists to identify neoplastic diseases that are unknown to their patients.
