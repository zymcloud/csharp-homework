Background and aims:A striking difference has been observed in structure and functional properties between plasma and platelet von Willebrand factor (VWF). While the existing evidence has revealed a clinical relevance of plasma VWF-Ag in liver regeneration (LR) and different cancers, this study was designed to explore the properties of intra-platelet (IP) and serum VWF-Ag in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing partial hepatectomy.Methods:A total of 40 patients undergoing partial hepatectomy were prospectively recruited from 3 institutions. VWF-Ag concentrations were evaluated mainly in serum and platelet extracts. Patients were followed-up for postoperative liver dysfunction and HCC recurrence.Results:We observed a post-resection increase in the concentration of VWF-Ag in serum and platelet. Patients with postoperative liver dysfunction had substantially reduced serum and IP VWF-Ag concentrations. After a 2-year follow-up, patients with higher post-resection serum and IP VWF-Ag concentrations were found to develop early HCC recurrence. Likewise, IP VWF-Ag was able to independently predict post-resection early HCC recurrence.Conclusion:This multicenter, prospective, pilot study demonstrates a bivalent property of IP VWF in LR and oncological outcome; low preoperative VWF appeared to have a negative association on post-resection liver dysfunction, whereas, patients with higher post-resection VWF-Ag concentrations were found to have early HCC recurrence.
