Background:To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters in estimation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) grading.Materials and methods:Twenty-nine patients with histopathologically diagnosed as 42 HCC at explant were included in this retrospective study. All patients were examined by 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging with the use of 4-channel phased array body coil. In addition to routine pre- and postcontrast sequences, IVIM (16 different b factors varying from 0 to 1300 s/mm2) and conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (3 different b factors of 50, 400, 800 s/mm2) were obtained with single-shot echo planar spin echo sequence. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IVIM parameters including mean D (true diffusion coefficient), D* (pseudo-diffusion coefficient associated with blood flow), and f (perfusion fraction) values were calculated. Histopathologically, HCC was classified as low (grade 1, 2) and high (grade 3, 4) grade in accordance with the Edmondson-Steiner score. Quantitatively, ADC, D, D*, and f values were compared between the low- and high-grade groups by Student t test. The relationship between the parameters and histologic grade was analyzed using the Spearman's correlation test. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the parameters, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed.Results:High-grade HCCs had significantly lower ADC and D values than low grade groups (P = .005 and P = .026, retrospectively); ADC and D values were inversely correlated with tumor grade (r = -0.519, P = .011, r = -0.510, P = .026, respectively). High-grade HCCs had significantly higher f values when compared with the low-grade group (P = .005). The f values were positively correlated with tumor grade (r = 0.548, P = .007). The best discriminative parameter was f value. Cut-off value of 32% of f values showed sensitivity of 75.6% and a specificity of 73.5%.Conclusion:ADC values and IVIM parameters such as f values appear to reflect the grade of HCCs.
