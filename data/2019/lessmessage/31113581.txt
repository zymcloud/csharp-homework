Introduction and aim:Studies carried out mainly in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), have shown the prognostic significance of albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade. Recently, another predictive score incorporating platelet count into ALBI, PALBI grade, was introduced in patients with HCC.Aim:We evaluated the ability of ALBI and PALBI grades in predicting the outcome (mortality / liver transplantation) of patients with stable decompensated cirrhosis with various etiology of liver diseases.Material and methods:We prospectively studied 325 patients with stable decompensated cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation. Their clinical and laboratory characteristics were recorded including albumin, bilirubin levels, platelets. We estimated ALBI and PALBI grades for every patient. Conventional prognostic scores were also evaluated; Child-Pugh (CTP), Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD). We followed them up and recorded their outcome.Results:Beyond MELD and CTP, ALBI and PALBI grades proved significant factors associated with the outcome (HR: 2.13, 95%CI [1.59, 2.85], p
