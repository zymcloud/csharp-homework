Background:Traditional cancer treatments such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy destroy both cancer and normal cells, which limit their clinical application. It is difficult to achieve the best results for any liver cancer patients using any single treatment method. Gene therapy for HCC demands non-invasive, efficient, targeted and safe gene transfection strategies.Objective:In this study, a nonviral shRNA gene delivery system utilizing a combination of PEI, US, and NBs was developed for targeting survivin in liver Cancer.Methods and results:The PEI-shRNA-NBs cumulated in the tumor tissue because of the EPR effect. By exposure to the US, micelles shRNA may be released from PEI-shRNA-NBs in tumor tissues and the shRNA then transmitted efficiently to cancer cells. Considerably enhanced therapeutic outcome was obtained with the gene silencing effect enhanced.Conclusions:PEI-shRNA-NBs possess the potential to become promising tools intended for shRNA delivery.
