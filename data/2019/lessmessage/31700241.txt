Background:The existence of reliable prognostic indices is of paramount importance in the management of cirrhosis. Both the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the older Child-Pugh (CP) scores are widely used. The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, initially used in hepatocellular carcinoma, has not been thoroughly investigated in cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic accuracy of ALBI, MELD, MELD with sodium (MELD-Na), CP, and the corrected for creatinine CP scores in a genetically homogeneous Cretan cirrhotic population.Methods:One hundred ninety-five outpatients or hospitalized cirrhotics (127 male, median age 66 years) were studied over a period of 2 years and ALBI, platelet-albumin-bilirubin, MELD, MELD-Na, CP score, and 2 types of modified CP score (CP-I and CP-II) with serum creatinine were calculated and correlated with survival.Results:ALBI had an optimum balance between sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve 0.704, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.630-0.778) compared to the other scores. In the multivariate analysis, the only factors independently associated with death were the ALBI score (hazard ratio [HR] 2.51, 95%CI 1.69-3.73; PConclusion:ALBI score might be a better prognostic indicator of mortality in cirrhosis and given its simplicity could substitute for the CP, MELD, and MELD-Na scores.
