Background:The risk factors associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify such risk factors in NAFLD patients who developed HCC.Methods:Between April 2000 and -December 2016, a total of 182 patients with NAFLD were enrolled in this study; of these, only 22 patients had HCC. To identify risk factors, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. To identify risk factors other than the degree of fibrosis, propensity matched analysis adjusted by the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) was carried out on 44 patients. Multivariate and survival analyses were also performed in HCC patients.Results:In 182 patients, multivariate analysis highlighted the NFS (OR 2.275; p Conclusions:Diabetic retinopathy as well as liver fibrosis is a risk factor that associates with the development of HCC in NAFLD patients. Therefore, NAFLD patients with diabetic retinopathy should undergo careful screening for HCC.
