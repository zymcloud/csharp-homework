Introduction:Cholelithiasis is most common disease of the gallbladder and cholecystectomy is the one of the most performed surgical procedure worldwide.Aim:To assess the relationship between the demographic, biochemical, and histopathological variables of patients who underwent cholecystectomy.Material and methods:Demographic, biochemical, and histopathological data of 5077 patients undergoing cholecystectomy were compared in terms of two different aspects: open cholecystectomy (OC group; n = 2090) versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC group; n = 2987), and an elective group (n = 4814) versus an emergency group (n = 263).Results:A total of 5077 patients aged between 13 and 97 years were included in the study. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, mean platelet volume, and prevalence of acute/chronic cholecystitis were significantly higher in the LC group than in the OC group. On the other hand, age, direct bilirubin level, thrombocyte count, and prevalence of gallbladder cancer/gangrenous cholecystitis were significantly higher in the OC group than in the LC group. Levels of AST, ALT, white blood cells, neutrophils, and some prevalence of acute/chronic active cholecystitis were higher in the emergency group than in the elective group. On the other hand, the lymphocyte count and prevalence of chronic cholecystitis/hyperplastic polyps were higher in the elective group than in the emergency group. Histopathological analysis identified 32 patients with malignant gallbladder cancer as follows: adenocarcinoma (n = 21), mucinous adenocarcinoma (n = 3), papillary adenocarcinoma (n = 3), adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 1), clear cell adenocarcinoma (n = 2), squamous carcinoma (n = 1), and hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis (n = 1).Conclusions:Even when the appearance of gallbladder specimens is normal, histopathological assessment allows for early diagnosis of many unusual findings such as gallbladder cancer.
