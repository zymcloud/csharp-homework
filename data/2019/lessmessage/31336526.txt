Background and aim:The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, obesity and polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS).Methods:In a cross-sectional study, 333 patients who had one of the certain diagnosis of DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity or PCOS were enrolled. Information about demographics, anthropometric, nutritional habitude, smoking history, medical history and physical activity were recorded. Liver ultrasound examination and routine biochemistry analysis were performed.Results:Among 333 patients with one of the four above-mentioned diseases. 199 patients (59.8%) had NAFLD. Male were more likely to have NAFLD than female (72.8% vs. 50.8% respectively, P < 0.001). About, 80.7% of patients through 41-50 years age had NAFLD. The frequency of abnormal fasting blood glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride, and total cholesterol were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD (P < 0.05). Subjects with NAFLD had a higher body mass index than non-NAFLD (33.6 ± 7.9 kg/m2 vs. 31.1 ± 5.0 kg/m2 respectively, P = 0.002). Patients with DM, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism were more likely to have NAFLD (P < 0.05). Patients with consumption of supper, high-fat diet, enjoy of eating and smoking were more likely to have NAFLD and patients with fruit and vegetable uptake and physical activity were less likely to have NAFLD (P < 0.05).Conclusions:As most patients with NAFLD are asymptomatic, employed individuals with higher education levels, with a history of smoking and unhealthy diet along with DM, hyperlipidemia, PCOS and obesity seriously have to be followed and educated for lifestyle modification.
