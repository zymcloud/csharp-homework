Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), one of the most common chronic liver diseases (CLD), is getting the most important cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Iron is an essential micronutrient for organisms. Once excess iron is accumulated in vital organs, dysfunctions of these organs can occur via the generation of reactive oxygen species. Hepatic iron overload is often seen in CLD patients. In NASH patients, iron accumulation in the liver is positively correlated with histological severity. Thus iron overload can contribute to progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to NASH. In a rat model of NASH, feeding of high-fat and high-iron diet increases hepatic inflammation with increased hepatic cytokine expression compared with feeding of high-fat diet only. In this model, iron is intensely accumulated in Kupffer cells/macrophages within the lesion, raising the possibility that iron-laden Kupffer cells/macrophages can play a key role in the enhancement of hepatic inflammation in NASH condition. On the other hand, in a rat model of liver cirrhosis, dietary iron overload clearly abrogates the development and progression of liver cirrhosis induced by repeated administration of thioacetamide (TAA). These findings suggest that iron overload can promote or suppress chronic liver diseases depending on the tissue microenvironment. Here we review and introduce the recent findings on the pathological roles of iron overload in the development and progression of NAFLD/NASH.
