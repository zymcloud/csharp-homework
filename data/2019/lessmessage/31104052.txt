Background:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a high prevalence in obesity and its presence should be screened. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is an effective treatment for obesity, but its effects on NAFLD are still to be firmly established. The diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is currently performed by liver biopsy, a costly and invasive procedure. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen-IgM (SCCA-IgM) is a biomarker of viral hepatitis to hepatocellular carcinoma development and its role in NAFLD to NASH progression has not yet been investigated.Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate SCCA-IgM as a non-invasive biomarker of NAFLD/NASH in patients with different degrees of metabolic-complicated obesity before and after LSG.Method:Fifty-six patients with obesity were studied before and 12 months after LSG; anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, and imaging data were collected.Results:At baseline steatosis was strongly associated with the glycaemic profile (p = 0.016) and was already present in prediabetic patients with obesity (82%). Only 3 patients had an SCCA-IgM level above the normal cut-off. SCCA-IgM titre did not change according to glycaemic profile or steatosis. Metabolic and inflammatory factors and transaminases significantly reduced after LSG-induced weight loss, except for SCCA-IgM. The ALT/AST ratio decreased post-LSG correlated with BMI (r = 0.297, p = 0.031), insulin (r = 0.354, p = 0.014), and triglycerides (r = 0.355, p = 0.009) reduction.Conclusions:Our results confirm the tight link between NAFLD and metabolic complications, suggesting prediabetes as a new risk factor of steatosis. SCCA-IgM does not seem to have a role in the identification and prognosis of NAFLD.
