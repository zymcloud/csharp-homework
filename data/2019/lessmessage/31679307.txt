UNCI 19 expression has been reported to be significantly higher in hepatic cancer cells (HCC). However, the clinical significance of modulating UNC119 expression in HCC is not well understood. The study described here aimed to explore the potential of curcumin in modulation of UNC119 expression in HCC by assessment with quantitative real-time PCR, western blot, and immune-histochemical analyses in HCC cell lines and tissues. The biological functions of UNC119 in the proliferation, growth, and cycle of tumor cells were analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. UNC119 expression was upregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues as indicated by comparison with normal liver cells and tissues. Cellular function assays showed that higher levels of UNC119 not only promoted proliferation but also enhanced HCC cell migration and invasion. UNC119 promoted progression of the cell cycle and significantly promoted HCC cell growth through the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway, and enhanced tumor migration and invasion by the TGF-β/EMT pathway. Curcumin efficiently inhibited HCC cell proliferation by blocking the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and inhabited migration and invasion by blocking the TGF-p/EMT signal pathway. Curcumin not only was beneficial for tumor remission but also contributed to the long-term survival of HCC-bearing mice. UNC119 was significantly upregulated and promoted cell growth in hepatic cancer cells and tissues by the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway and migration by TGF-β/EMT signal pathway. Curcumin treatment inhibited cell proliferation, growth, migration, and invasion by inhibition of those pathways.
