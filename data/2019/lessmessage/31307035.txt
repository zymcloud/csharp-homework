Background/aim:We evaluated clinical factors related to improved prognosis of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients (u-HCC), who were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sequential therapy, including lenvatinib (LEN).Materials/methods:We enrolled 84 u-HCC cases treated with TKIs including LEN from March 2018 to January 2019 (median age 71 years, 63 males, Child-Pugh score (CPS) 5/6/7 = 62/21/1, tumor-node-metastasis stage of Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan 6th (TNM-LCSGJ) II/III/IVa/IVb = 12/30/5/37, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B/C = 33:51). Clinical findings at introduction of the initial TKI were retrospectively evaluated.Results:The median albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score at introduction of the initial TKI (sorafenib [SOR]/LEN = 80/4) was -2.56, and the past number of transarterial catheter chemoembolization was 3 (IQR: 2-5) (second-line: regorafenib [REG]/LEN/SOR = 31/49/4, third-line: LEN/REG = 31:1). The total period of administration with TKIs showed a good relationship with overall survival (OS) (r = 0.946, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.918-0.965, p -2.27) was the only significant factor at the start of the initial TKI for poor prognosis (hazard ratio 2.319, 95% CI: 1.064-5.052, p = 0.034), while CPS (â‰¥6) was not. Although there was no significant difference in TNM-LCSGJ (p = 0.213), the prognosis of patients with mALBI 1/2a (n = 66) showed better prognosis as compared to those with mALBI 2b (n = 18) (1-year/2-year/3-year OSR = 89.1/69.8/66% vs. 82.4/47.1/23.5%, p = 0.029).Conclusion:Good hepatic function (mALBI 1/2a) at introduction of the initial TKI is a requirement for improved prognosis of u-HCC undergoing TKI sequential therapy.
