Introduction and aim:Viral hepatitis is a serious public health problem. The risk of progression to chronic hepatitis in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection occurs in 5-10% of adults and is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may have coinfection with HBV. The existence of unvaccinated groups represents a significant risk not only individually but also at the community level. The aim of this study was to evaluate HBV vaccine response in adults with HIV infection.Materials and methods:A retrospective, descriptive study of the cross-sectional type was carried out in an outpatient HIV referral center in southern Brazil. All medical records of adult HIV patients seen during January 2006 to December 2015 were selected. In statistical analysis, a significance level of 5% was used.Results:Of the 201 patients evaluated with a complete vaccination scheme, 55.72% were males, with a mean age of 43.86Â±12.68 years. Vaccine response occurred in 80.10% (161/201) of the patients, and it did not correlate with age, CD4+ cell count or viral load.Conclusion:HBV vaccine response in a HIV population was satisfactory, highlighting the importance of vaccination for prevention, cost reduction and better prognosis in preventing HBV/HIV coinfection.
