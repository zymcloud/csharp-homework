Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate the role of intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) and contrast-enhanced IOUS (CE-IOUS) for the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing hepatic resection (HR).Methods:Twenty-one consecutive patients who had undergone HR for HCC were included in this study. The patients were subject to preoperative imaging modalities including preoperative ultrasonography (Pre-US) and preoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (Pre-CEUS). All the patients then underwent intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) and contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasonography (CE-IOUS) during surgery. The visualization of primary HCC and additional lesions of all patients were analyzed.Results:Twenty-one HCCs were detected during Pre-US and the remaining six lesions (28.6%) were detected during IOUS and CE-IOUS. Thus the treatment plan was changed in 28.6% of patients. Twenty-one HCCs (diameter, 0.6-3.0 cm; mean±SD, 1.98±0.85 cm) were measured on Pre-US and remeasured on IOUS (diameter, 0.9-3.3 cm; mean±SD, 2.19±0.84 cm) (p Conclusions:IOUS detects more lesions and the treatment plan is changed in 28.6% of patients. HCCs were larger on IOUS than on Pre-US. The typical imaging features of HCCs were better depicted on IOUS in comparison with Pre-US. CE-IOUS can catch the details of microcirculation perfusion of HCCs more sensitively than CEUS. Both IOUS and CE-IOUS were able to provide more decision information during surgery.
