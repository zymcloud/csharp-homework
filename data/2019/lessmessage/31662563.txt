Background/aim:Recent studies have investigated a novel inflammation-based prognostic system using the combination of platelet count and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (COP-NLR). As platelet count decreases with liver damage, we hypothesized that COP-NLR could indicate both inflammation and hepatic reserve in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was conducted to clarify the prognostic significance of preoperative COP-NLR in patients with HCC.Patients and methods:We enrolled 176 patients with histologically-proven HCC who underwent initial curative hepatectomy. Patients were assigned one point each for low platelet count (4/μl) or for high NLR (≥2.0), for hepatic-COP-NLR scores (h-COP-NLR) of 0, 1 or 2.Results:Five-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 74.5±9%, and 62.2%±9.3% for score 0, 63.6±5.4% and 50.3%±5.6% for score 1, and 45.2±8.8% and 40.6±8.7% for score 2, respectively, and significantly differed (OS: p=0.01; RFS: p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, h-COP-NLR was an independent risk factor for tumor recurrence (HR=1.39, p=0.03) and death (HR=1.71, p=0.02).Conclusion:h-COP-NLR was an independent predictor for prognosis of HCC patients after hepatic resection.
