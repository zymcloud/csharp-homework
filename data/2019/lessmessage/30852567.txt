Tissue biopsies and cytological samples were taken. Pathologic examination was consistent with LCUC.Conclusion:LCUC of the ureter is an aggressive tumor with a high proliferation index. Patients might be diagnosed at an advanced stage. LCUC must be considered in the differential diagnosis of urinary tract pathologies.
