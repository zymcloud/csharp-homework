Background:The advantages of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) over hepatectomy as a treatment for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include reduced morbidity and more rapid recovery. Although minimally invasive surgery provides similar benefits, few studies have compared the long-term oncological outcomes of these techniques. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of minimally invasive hepatectomy (MIH) and RFA.Methods:Patients who underwent MIH or RFA for HCC between January 2005 and January 2015 were included in a propensity score matching analysis. Only patients who underwent minimally invasive procedures for small HCC were included. Baseline clinical and laboratory parameters were retrieved from the hospital database and analyzed.Results:Two hundred and twenty-five patients underwent MIH or RFA for HCC during the study period. Propensity score matching yielded 59 patient-pairs. The complication rates did not differ statistically between the 2 groups (p = 0.309). However, MIH provided significantly better overall (p = 0.005) and disease-free survival outcomes (p Conclusions:Compared with RFA, MIH provided better long-term survival outcomes in patients with early-stage HCC, with no increase in the incidence of complications. When feasible, MIH should be considered a first-line treatment for this patient population.
