Hepatitis C virus (HCV) pseudoparticles (HCVpp) are generated by cotransfection of HCV envelope (E1 and E2) genes along with a retroviral packaging/reporter construct into HEK293T cells. Enveloped particles bearing HCV E1E2 proteins on their surface are released through a retroviral budding process into the supernatant. Viral E1E2 glycoproteins facilitate a single round of receptor-mediated entry of HCVpp into hepatoma cells, which can be quantified by reporter gene expression. These HCVpp have been employed to study mechanisms of HCV entry into hepatoma cells, as well as HCV neutralization by immune sera or HCV-specific monoclonal antibodies.
