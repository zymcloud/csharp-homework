Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary hepatic malignancy and is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It has a very aggressive clinical course, with a mean survival rate of much less than a year if left untreated. Here, we present a case of a 68-year-old male with progressively enlarging painful right facial swelling, involving the ramus and condyle of mandible on contrast-enhanced computed tomography mimicking an osteosarcoma. Eventually, the final diagnosis of HCC metastatic to the right parotid gland was made. We report a case of a rare metastasis of HCC to the parotid gland. Furthermore, the present case demonstrates the importance of tissue biopsy and immunohistochemistry for obtaining an accurate final diagnosis.
