Background/aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the altered profile of adipocytokine and genetic fingerprint in NAFLD-associated metabolic syndrome "cluster" represents synergistic risk factors predicting onset of liver colorectal cancer metastases.Materials and methods:A total of 165 colorectal cancer patients were enrolled, 56,3% were with metabolic syndrome/NAFLD. Serum samples were assayed for ADIPOQ, leptin and TNF-a levels by ELISA. ADIPOQ rs266729 C/G and TNF-308 A/G genotypes were analyzed in DNA isolated from whole blood.Results:Reduction in adiponectin levels and increase in leptin and TNF-α was shown in patients with liver metastases. This trend was influenced by BMI, MetS/NAFLD, and insulin resistance. ADIPOQ G rs266729 and TNF- 308 A allele are associated with obesity, MetS/NAFLD and insulin resistance. ADIPOQ CG/GG and GA/AA TNF-alpha genotypes confer susceptibility to liver metastases.Conclusion:Obesity and hepatic steatosis significantly favor the development of colorectal cancer liver metastases and the individual adipocytokines genetic profile may play an important predictive role.
