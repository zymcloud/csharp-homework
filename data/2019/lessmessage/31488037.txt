The honey mushroom, Armillaria mellea, is known to have medicinal qualities and has been used in recent years as a health food and dietary supplement worldwide. In Asia, it is commonly consumed as an herbal medicine, being a key component of the Chinese preparation "Tien-ma". Here, we examined the antitumor effects of armillaridin, a bioactive compound isolated from A. mellea, on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Armillaridin inhibited the growth of human Huh7, HepG2, and HA22T HCC cells, and its cytotoxicity was confirmed by observations of its induction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential collapse. However, armillaridin treatment did not result in large numbers of cells with fragmented chromosomal DNA, suggesting that apoptosis was not responsible for these effects. We therefore tested for signs of autophagic cell death following armillaridin administration. Armillaridin induced LC3 aggregation in green fluorescent protein-LC3-overexpressing cells. Moreover, flow cytometry and immunoblotting revealed that it increased the number of acridine orange-positive cells and upregulated autophagy-related proteins, respectively. Furthermore, armillaridin cytotoxicity was suppressed by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. In summary, our results indicated that armillaridin induces HCC cell death by autophagy, and demonstrated the potential of armillaridin as an antihepatoma agent.
