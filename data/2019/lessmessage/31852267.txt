Purpose: To evaluate the clinical value of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with microwave ablation (MWA) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods: Eligible studies were identified using PubMed, MedLine, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, investigating the synergistic effect of TACE + MWA in the treatment of advanced HCC. Endpoints were the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates, local control rate (LCR), objective remission rate (ORR), and adverse event (AE). Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to determine the effect size.Results: Nine studies including 351 patients in the TACE + MWA group and 653 patients in the TACE group were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were in favor of TACE + MWA (OR = 3.29, 95% CI 2.26-4.79; OR = 2.82, 95% CI 2.01-3.95; OR = 4.50, 95% CI 2.96-6.86; respectively). The pooled OR for the ORR and LCR were also in favor of TACE + MWA (OR = 4.64, 95%CI 3.11-6.91; OR = 3.93, 95% CI 2.64-5.87; respectively). No significant difference in the incidence of severe AE was observed between TACE + MWA group and TACE group (p > .05). However, subgroup analysis showed that patients with tumor size >5 cm were more likely to be benefited from TACE + MWA, rather than patients with tumor size ≤5 cm.Conclusion: With the current data, we concluded that combination TACE and MWA was safe, and should be strongly recommended to unresectable patients with tumor size >5 cm, but TACE alone was enough for unresectable patients with tumor size ≤5 cm. However, the conclusion needs further validation.
