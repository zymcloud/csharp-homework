Liver cirrhosis in the outcome of hepatitis C is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the world. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of HCC are important for reducing mortality and increasing life expectancy of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. To assess the risk of HCC, the definition of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood is most widely used, but low sensitivity limits its diagnostic value. In 2012, a new HCC biomarker - osteopontin (OPN), which is a secreted phosphoprotein that has a high affinity for integrins was proposed. The level of acute renal failure begins to rise in the early stages of malignancy, before the period of HCC detection by imaging methods, and has significantly better sensitivity than AFP. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the combined determination of alpha-fetoprotein and osteopontin in prospective monitoring of patients with chronic hepatitis C in the advanced phase of liver fibrosis. Monitoring of 588 patients with hepatitis C was carried out from February 2013 to February 2019. HCC was detected in 55 of them (2.6% per year). The combination of 2 biomarkers showed better diagnostic efficacy than alpha-fetoprotein and osteopontin separately: AUC 0.85 (95% CI 0.80-0.90) versus AUC 0.63 (95% CI 0.57-0, 70) and AUC 0.82 (95% CI 0.77-0.88), respectively. This combination showed a sensitivity of 85.5% and made it possible to diagnose HCC with a prognostic level of a positive result of 72.3% at 19,4Â±0,8 weeks before the diagnosis was confirmed by instrumental imaging methods (ultrasound, MRI, CT). In the combined variant, ARF made the greatest contribution to the increase in diagnostic efficacy (AUC). At an early and very early stage of HCC development, isolated HCC elevations were found in only 5.4% of patients. Conclusion: the combined use of alphafetoprotein and osteopontin as a diagnostic panel can be recommended for monitoring patients with liver cirrhosis in the outcome of hepatitis C and predicting HCC at an early stage of development.
