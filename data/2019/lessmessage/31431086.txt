Purpose: To evaluate whether local tumor progression (LTP) would be further reduced when contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-CT/MR fusion imaging was used as intraprocedural assessment method in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) thermal ablation compared with routine CEUS. Materials and methods: This prospective non-randomized study was conducted from December 2010 to July 2012. CEUS-CT/MR fusion imaging and routine CEUS were used for treatment response assessment in the ablation procedure of 146 HCCs and 122 HCCs, respectively. Supplementary ablations were performed immediately if necessary. The primary technique efficacy rate, LTP rate and overall survival (OS) rate were calculated. Results: For CEUS-CT/MR fusion imaging and routine CEUS, the technical success rate, technique efficacy rate and supplementary ablation rate were 86.3% (126/146) and 98.4% (120/122) (p = .000), 99.2% (125/126) and 94.2% (113/120) (p = .032), and 14.3% (18/126) and 4.2% (5/120) (p = .006), respectively. The cumulative LTP rate and OS rate were not significantly different between fusion imaging group and routine CEUS group. However, for lesions that were larger than 3 cm or close to major vessels (41 lesions in fusion imaging group and 44 lesions in routine CEUS group, who received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization before ablation), the cumulative LTP rate was significantly lower in fusion imaging group than in routine CEUS group (p = .032). Conclusion: Although intraprocedural CEUS-CT/MR fusion imaging has certain limitations in application, it might provide a potential more efficient method compared with routine CEUS in reducing LTP in HCC thermal ablation, especially for difficult ablation lesions.
