Introduction and objective:MiR-122 has been regarded as a tumor suppressor. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been found to be closely related to metastasis and immune escape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the study, we sought to investigate the effect of miR-122 on HCC and the expression of TLR4.Patients or materials and methods:Real-time PCR and Western blot were performed to detect the expressions of target factors. CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis were employed to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was used to determine whether miR-122 could directly regulate the expression of TLR4. Enzyme-linked Immuno Sorbent Assay was adopted to detect the secretion of inflammatory cytokines.Results:Both down-regulation of miR-122 and up-regulation of TLR4 were found to be correlated with low overall survival rate of HCC patients. TLR4 may be a direct target gene of miR-122. Over-expression of miR-122 induced apoptosis and inhibited cell viability of HCC by down-regulating TLR4, enhanced the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and suppressed the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. MiR-122 inhibited expressions and activities of inflammatory cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin 6 (IL-6), cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and also reduced the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9). Furthermore, activities of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), Akt and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) were suppressed by miR-122.Conclusions:Down-regulation of miR-122 facilitated the immune escape of HCC by targeting TLR4, which was related to PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathways. Our study may provide a possible strategy for the treatment of HCC.
