A 63-year-old female patient with recent diagnosis of hepatitis C and cirrhosis and no other comorbidities, on no medications, was found to have Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C hepatocellular carcinoma and began systemic therapy with sorafenib 400mg twice daily. Five days after starting treatment, the patient went to an emergency department with pruritic, target-shaped, erythematous papules compatible with erythema multiforme, painful oral aphthous ulcers, and fever. Sorafenib was suspended and the patient underwent oral corticosteroid treatment for 5 days, showing significant improvement of the lesions. One month after discharge, the patient was reassessed at an outpatient clinic. As she was asymptomatic and had no skin lesions, sorafenib was resumed at a lower dose (200mg daily). Three hours after ingesting a single dose of sorafenib, the patient experienced chills, fever, rash, angioedema and stridor. She immediately sought the emergency department and was diagnosed with anaphylaxis. The patient received intravenous corticosteroid therapy, which improved her respiratory and cutaneous symptoms in 72h. Sorafenib was permanently suspended, and regorafenib could not be prescribed as second-line therapy. This is the first description of anaphylaxis to sorafenib.
Anaphylaxis; Cirrhosis; Erythema multiforme; Hepatocelullar carcinoma; Sorafenib.
