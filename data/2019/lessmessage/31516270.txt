Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORis) are immunosuppression agents that are commonly used in solid organ transplantation. Available mTORis include sirolimus and everolimus. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is an uncommon side effect of mTORis in liver transplantation. A high index of suspicion is needed, and timely intervention can reverse the disease. We present a case of sirolimus-induced ILD that improved after discontinuation of sirolimus.
