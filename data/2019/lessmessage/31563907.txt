Background:In patients with suspected or proven lung cancer, assessment of regional nodal and distant metastases is key before treatment planning. By introducing the endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided scope into the esophagus and stomach (EUS-B), liver lesions and celiac nodes can be visualized. To date, the utility of EUS-B in diagnosing liver lesions and retroperitoneal lymph nodes is unknown.Objectives:To assess the feasibility, safety, and diagnostic yield of sampling of liver lesions and retroperitoneal nodes by EUS-B fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in a lung cancer staging setting.Method:Consecutive patients suspected of lung cancer in 2 Danish centers between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017 were included retrospectively when a lesion in the liver or a retroperitoneal lymph node was visualized and biopsied with EUS-B-FNA.Results:23 left liver lobe lesions and 19 retroperitoneal lymph nodes were sampled by EUS-B-FNA. Sensitivity and diagnostic yield of sampled liver lesions were 86 and 83%, respectively. In 19/23 patients, there was a cytopathological diagnosis of malignancy. Sensitivity and diagnostic yield from retroperitoneal lymph node samples were 83 and 63%, respectively. In 10/19 patients, the diagnosis was malignancy. No complications were observed.Conclusion:EUS-B-FNA enables safe sampling of left liver lobe lesions and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. EUS-B should be considered as a minimally invasive technique to provide tissue proof of distant metastases lung cancer patients.
