Lenvatinib (LEN) is a multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic properties recently approved in radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma in combination with everolimus. LEN-treated patients frequently have adverse events (AEs) that generally require such dose modifications, including drug discontinuation. Hypertension, diarrhea, weight loss, proteinuria, fatigue, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia are reported among the most frequent AEs, often leading to discontinuations or dose modifications. This paper reports a case series focusing on the role of the immediate multidisciplinary approach to manage AEs.
