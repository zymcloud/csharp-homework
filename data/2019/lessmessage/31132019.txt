The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of hematopoietic-substrate-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) on liver cancer cells. Information on HAX-1 from liver cancer patients was analyzed by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program. Cell migration and invasion abilities were respectively tested by scratch assay and transwell assay. Tube formation assay was applied to detect angiogenesis protein and mRNA was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. We found that the median month survival of HAX-1 overexpressing liver cancer patients was shorter than that of HAX-1 normal liver cancer patients. HAX-1 was overexpressed in liver cancer tissues and cells, and HAX-1 overexpression promoted the liver cancer cells growth, migration, and invasion, whereas silencing HAX-1 produced the opposite results. Inhibition of Akt by LY294002 reversed the migration and invasion abilities of liver cancer cells, and inhibited the ability of cells growth and angiogenesis. Silencing PIK3CA enhanced the inhibitory effects of HAX-1 silencing on the viability, migration, and invasion of liver cancer cells. HAX-1 affected liver cancer cells metastasis and angiogenesis by affecting Akt phosphorylation and FOXO3A expression.
