Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy and most frequently develops in patients with cirrhosis. Surveillance strategies are recommended in high-risk groups because early detection of small lesions improves the likelihood of curative treatment. This study investigated the prospective clinical significance of serum levels of anti-Ku86 and plasma levels of lamin B1and vimentin as early markers of HCC.Methods:We recruited 74 patients at Assiut University Hospital-37 with HCC and 37 with chronic liver disease (liver cirrhosis patients)-and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Lamin B1 and vimentin mRNA expression levels were evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and serum levels of anti-Ku86 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results:Compared with liver disease patients and controls, HCC patients showed higher levels of lamin B1 mRNA (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 65%), vimentin mRNA (sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 92%), and anti-Ku86 (sensitivity, 94%; specificity, 80%). LaminB1 levels were significantly higher in patients with a tumor size 5cm in size. Lamin B1 had significant positive correlations with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (P=0.034) and anti-Ku86 (P=0.002). Receiver operating characteristic curves for differentiating HCCfrom liver cirrhosis revealed a higher area under the curve(AUC).for vimentin than for AFP, lamin B1, and anti-Ku86 for the diagnosis of HCC (PConclusion:Circulating levels of anti-Ku86, lamin B1,and vimentin might be potential surrogate markers of HCC, either alone or in combination with AFP. However, independent and discriminative serological biomarkers with higher sensitivity and specificity are still needed for the early detection of HCC.
