Recent studies report a significant age-specific increase in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development among persons over 75 years old. Therefore, there is an urgent need to determine the optimal treatment strategy in elderly patients with HCC. This systemic review examines the clinical characteristics, efficacy, and safety of first-line treatment modalities. The literature was searched regarding epidemiology and clinical outcomes in elderly patients (age â‰¥75 years) undergoing first-line treatment for HCC. Causative or comorbid conditions of HCC in elderly patients differed from those in younger patients. Radiofrequency ablation may be effective and safe in early stages. Surgical resection may also be feasible in the early stages for selected patients. Transarterial chemoembolization may be safe and effective for intermediate HCC, and sorafenib may be feasible in elderly patients with advanced HCC. Prospective randomized trials are needed to establish the treatment strategy for elderly patients with HCC.
