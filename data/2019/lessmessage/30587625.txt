Background:Removal of an isolated portal vein (PV) thrombus is still a difficult problem in liver surgery. In this report, we present technical details of the ultrasonography (US)-guided suction thrombectomy for an isolated PV thrombus in a case with PV tumor thrombus extending into the main PV trunk of a patient undergoing right hemi-hepatectomy and tumor thrombectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Three cases were treated with US-guided suction thrombectomy for an isolated PV thrombus in liver surgeries. All three patients had HCC; however, two cases had a blood clot PV thrombus, and one case had an isolated PV tumor thrombus.Results:In all three cases, the isolated PV thrombus was successfully removed by suction thrombectomy without intraoperative and postoperative problems.Conclusion:US-guided suction thrombectomy is a promising method for removal of an isolated PV thrombus in liver surgery.
