Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been rated 10th among the killer diseases. Occult HBV infection goes undetected with the widely used HBsAg screening in most hospital thereby encouraging progression into complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This work therefore aimed at evaluating HBV serological profiles among the population of apparently healthy hospital attendees and their proportion of susceptibility to HBV infection. 239 participants were recruited for this study. Their blood samples were screened for the HBV markers - HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HBc. In conclusion, this work depicted various serological patterns of HBV infection among apparently healthy hospital attendees suggesting there are occult HBV infection and immune escape mutant in our population. It also showed that a huge number of the study population were susceptible to HBV infection.
