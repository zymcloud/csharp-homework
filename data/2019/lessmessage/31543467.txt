Obesity prevalence is rapidly increasing worldwide. It is associated with huge economic and health costs due to its clinical consequences, which includes increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and development of different malignancies. In particular, obesity is an independent risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Indeed, obesity is highly prevalent in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that is becoming one of the most frequent causes of liver disease worldwide. NAFLD-related HCC is the most rapidly growing indication for liver transplantation in many countries. The higher mortality rates found in obese HCC patients might be related not only to a worse outcome after HCC treatments, but also to a delayed diagnosis related to a low frequency and a poorer quality of abdominal ultrasonography surveillance that is the test universally used for HCC screening. Given its diffusion, obesity is frequently present in patients with chronic liver diseases related to different etiologies, and in these cases it may increase the HCC risk, acting as an additional co-factor. Indeed, growing evidence demonstrates that a healthy diet and regular physical activity may have an impact in reducing the overall HCC risk. Finally, an impact of obesity in the development of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has been postulated, but more extensive studies are needed to definitively confirm this association.
