Aim:We aimed at determining the prognostic value of the albumin-bilirubin grade (ALBI) in patients undergoing transarterial Chemoembolization for unresectable Hepatocellular carcinoma.Background:Various noninvasive liver reserve markers are used to predict the severity of liver injury. The role and probability of these markers in predicting the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown.Methods:Patients who underwent TACE from 2013 to 2017 were included. Patient's age, gender, cause of cirrhosis, ALBI Grade along with the site, size and number of tumors were recorded. Radiological response to TACE was assessed by CT scan at 1 and 3 months after the procedure, respectively. Survival assessment was performed and all patients were assessed for survival until the last follow-up.Results:A total of 71 patients were included. Majority of them were male (80.3 %). The mean tumor size of 6 ± 3.9 cm. Majority of patients (54.9 %) had a single lesion and it was mostly localized to the right lobe (60.5 %). The most common cause of chronic liver disease was HCV (65.3%). Median Child class score (CTP) and MELD score were 7 and 10, respectively. Ascites was treated prior to TACE in 12 patients (16.9 %).Mean ALBI score in the study population was -1.59 ± 0.69, with the majority (49. 2 %) falling in grade 2. The mean duration of survival at the last follow up was of 12.1 ± 12.14 months (1- 49).Univariate analysis showed serum albumin (p = 0.003), serum bilirubin (p = 0.018), CTP score (p = 0.019), ALBI grade (p = 0.001) and presence of varices (p = 0.04) to be the main predictors of 6 months survival after TACE. On Cox analysis, only ALBI score (p = 0.038) showed statistical significant association.Conclusion:ALBI grade may serve as a surrogate marker in predicting the prognosis of HCC patients undergoing Transarterial Chemoembolization.
