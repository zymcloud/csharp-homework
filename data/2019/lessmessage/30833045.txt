Introduction:Incidence, mortality, survival and prevalence are key indicators to assess public health policies and estimate the needs of the population for cancer management. The aim of this article is to provide the more current estimates of these indicators, in line with the fifteenth operational objective of the 2014-2019 Cancer Plan "Collect data/Support Public Health".Methods:Incidence and survival data came from cancer registries. Mortality data came from the French epidemiology center on medical causes of death. Prevalence was estimated by using incidence and survival estimates.Results:In metropolitan France in 2017, the estimated number of new cancer cases and cancer deaths was respectively 399,500 and 150,000. The most frequent cancers (breast, prostate) had highest net survivals: 78 and 84% at 10 years. Several cancers (including lung, liver and pancreatic cancers) had worse prognosis (5-year survival≤33%). In 2017, 1,396,000 men and 1,359,000 women had cancer in the previous 15 years, representing respectively 5.4% and 4.8% of the population aged 15 and over.Discussion:Despite the decrease of cancer mortality, the prognosis of some cancers remains poor and the cancer prevalence is high. These results highlight the need for intensifying the efforts already made in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and justify the interest in the post-cancer period.
