Sarcomas are rare lesions of the liver and represent <1% of primary liver tumors. Embryonic sarcoma (undifferentiated) of the liver is a rare and aggressive malignant tumor that usually occurs in children with a peak incidence between 6 and 10 years. In adults, it is extremely rare with only 13 cases described in patients older than 40 years and 68 cases reported in patients older than 15 years. There is a slight predominance of females in adults. With an emphasis on morphological and immunohistochemical features, as well as on clinical data and imaging studies, we present this case report, in addition to extensive literature review on the topic.
