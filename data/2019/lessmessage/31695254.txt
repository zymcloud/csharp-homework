Familial cirrhosis is a condition that is associated with the presence of liver disease with genetic linkage among multiple family members in a generation or in multiple generations. With cirrhosis, most of these disease pathogeneses are related to a defect of an enzyme/transport protein leading to a deranged metabolic pathway with variable prevalence. Many studies and high-quality metanalyses have shed light on genetic linkage associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis such as the PNPLA3, MBOAT7, and TM6SF2 variants. In this report, we shed light on a novel missense mutation associated with cirrhosis in a family of brothers associated with phosphoinositide-3-kinase adapter protein 1 gene through high-output whole exosome gene sequencing methodology.
