Introduction and aim:The American Association for the Study of the Liver (AASLD) recommends contrast computerized tomography (CT-scan) and magnetic resonance (MRI) to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising in cirrhotic patients under semiannual surveillance with abdominal ultrasound (US). A US guided fine needle biopsy (FNB) serves the same purpose in radiologically undiagnosed tumors and incidentally detected nodules in cirrhotics outside surveillance. In this population, we evaluated the performance of radiological diagnosis of HCC according to 2010 AASLD recommendations.Materials and methods:All cirrhotic patients with a liver nodule incidentally detected by US were prospectively investigated with a sequential application of CT-scan/MRI examination and a FNB.Results:Between 2011 and 2015, 94 patients (mean age 67 years) had a liver nodule (total 120) detected by US in the context of histologically confirmed cirrhosis. Mean nodules diameter was 40 (10-160) mm, 87 (73%) 200ng/mL was 12% (IC95%: 6-23%).Conclusion:A single contrast imaging technique showing a typical contrast pattern confidently identifies HCC also in cirrhotic patients with an incidental liver nodule, thereby reducing the need for FNB examinations.
