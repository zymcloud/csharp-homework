Background:Conflicting data have been published about the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). We investigated the incidence of HCC occurrence/recurrence after DAAs therapy.Patients and methods:Retrospectively, we analyzed data of 392 patients with F3-4 fibrosis and cirrhosis treated by DAAs during the period from August 2015 to May 2018. In HCC-experienced patients, HCC treatment modality, and the duration between HCC management and DAAs initiation were recorded. In all patients, pretreatment clinicolaboratory evaluation, and imaging before, during and after DAAs were done.Results:De novo HCC occurred in 7.6% of na√Øve patients, while recurrence appeared in 28% of patients with previous HCC. Pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein was an independent predictor of HCC occurrence, while the time between HCC ablation and the beginning of DAAs was the only predictor of HCC recurrence (p Conclusions:Although HCC occurrence after DAAs was not high, recurrence was apparently high. Pretreatment alpha-fetoprotein is a predictor for de novo HCC. The time between HCC ablation and DAAs was the strongest predictor of recurrence.
