Objective:To investigate the expression of long-chain non-coding RNA MINCR (LncRNAMINCR) and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) mRNA in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, and to analyze the relationship between its expression and clinical pathological parameters and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Seventy-five surgically resected primary hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and paracancerous tissues were selected. Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of LncRNA-MINCR and CDK2 mRNA in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and adjacent tissues. The relationship of clinicopathological parameters and prognosis between hepatocellular carcinoma and LncRNA-MINCR and CDK2 mRNA were analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient describes the correlation between LncRNA-MINCR and CDK2 mRNA.Results:The expression of LncRNA-MINCR and CDK2 mRNA in primary hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was higher than that in the adjacent tissues [(5.51±0.62) vs (1.62±0.51), (4.52±0.73) vs (1.85±0.95), P0.05). LncRNA-MINCR expression was associated with TNM staging, lymph node metastasis, and cirrhosis (PConclusion:The expression of LncRNA-MINCR and CDK2 mRNA in primary hepatocellular carcinoma tissues increased significantly. The two play a synergistic role in the invasion, invasion and metastasis of hepatocarcinoma cells. High expression of LncRNA-MINCR and CDK2 mRNA indicates poor prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
