Hemodialysis patients are at increased risk for development of blood-borne viral infections. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a once fatal infection, has become treatable, but continues to be associated with increased mortality. Hepatitis B and C viral infections can lead to acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Young children and immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop chronic disease leading to increased morbidity and mortality, as compared to the healthy population. The hemodialysis population is at increased risk of blood-borne viral infections as compared to the general population due to multiple factors. Here we review risk factors of blood-borne viral infections, strategies for prevention, and approach to therapy in the pediatric hemodialysis population.
