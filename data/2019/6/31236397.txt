Background:Sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma (SHC) combined with paraneoplastic leukemoid reaction (PLR), which is associated with a poor prognosis, is rarely seen in the clinic. Here, we report the case of a patient in the above situation.Case summary:A 75-year-old female patient with a past medical history of hypertension and cerebral infarction paid a hospital visit as a result of right upper quadrant abdominal pain and anorexia for two months. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 43790/μL, which was then increased up to 77050/μL. In addition, the results of bone marrow examination suggested a leukemoid reaction. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a focal hepatic mass, which was confirmed through pathological examination to be an SHC postoperatively. In addition, the WBC count had fallen to a normal level before she left the hospital. However, the patient died two and a half months after the second hospital admission.Conclusion:This is a rare case of SHC combined with PLR, both of which have an extremely poor prognosis.
