The aim of this article is to detail an optimized approach to transradial Y-90 (TRY-90), showing it to be a safe and feasible first-line approach to hepatic selective internal radiation therapy. Salient preprocedural considerations to enable appropriate patient selection for TRY-90 are discussed and a detailed equipment list is provided. The article will describe our approach to TRY-90 in addition to a discussion around technical pearls and pitfalls.
