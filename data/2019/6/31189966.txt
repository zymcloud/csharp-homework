Several studies have shown that the use of sulfonylureas in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the effects of individual sulfonylureas on HCC development using the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort in South Korea. Among 47,738 subjects aged 40 years or older who had newly diagnosed with diabetes, 241 incident HCC cases and 1205 matched controls were identified. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) as estimates of the relative risk of HCC were calculated using logistic regression analysis. Compared to patients never treated with a sulfonylurea, those treated with a sulfonylurea had a 1.7-fold increased risk of HCC development. Of the different types of sulfonylureas, the exclusive use of glimepiride was associated with a significantly elevated risk of HCC (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.02-3.47) compared to those who were never treated with sulfonylureas. No significant associations were observed between exclusive gliclazide use and incident HCC (OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 0.75-5.52). In conclusion, the association between the use of sulfonylureas and risk of HCC was different according to the type of sulfonylurea, in patients with new-onset T2DM. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these results and translate them into clinical practice.
