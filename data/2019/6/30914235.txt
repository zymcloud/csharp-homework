Objective:To evaluate the inhibition effects and mechanism of bortezomib in a subcutaneous H22 mouse hepatocarcinoma model.Methods:A subcutaneous xenograft model was constructed by subcutaneous injection of H22 cells in mice. The xenograft mice was randomly divided into bortezomib and control groups (n = 8 each). The bortezomib group was injected with 0.5 mg/kg bortezomib in saline via tail vein once every four days for a total of 4 times. The control group was intravenously given an equal volume of saline. The tumor size was measured every four days. At day 19, subcutaneous xenografts were obtained and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in tumor was detected by immunochemical staining.Results:The tumor volume of H22 xenografts in bortezomib group was significantly smaller than that in control group on day 19 (p = 0.004). The tumor volume/mouse weight ratio in bortezomib group was significantly lower compared with control group on day 13, 16 and 19 (all p Conclusion:Bortezomib effectively inhibited the growth of H22 xenografts without affecting the mouse weight. The anti-tumor effects of bortezomib is associated with its stimulation on tumor cell apoptosis.
