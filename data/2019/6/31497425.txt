The prevalence of liver tumors is increasing worldwide. These can be broadly classified into primary and secondary types, depending upon the origin of the tumor. Multiple modalities are available for the management of these tumors. Ablative techniques are becoming the cornerstone of management especially for the tumors which are unresectable. Thermal ablative techniques include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and cryotherapy. Recently, a non-thermal technique known as irreversible electroporation (IRE) is gaining importance owing to its better clinical outcome and a good safety profile. IRE works by high voltage and intensity electrical discharge which makes pores in the membrane of the cells. Its clinical outcome is reported in different studies in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), frequency of complete ablation, and local recurrence of the tumor. Favorable results were seen especially for the small size tumors and very early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It was also found to be useful for the management of tumors which are close to vital structures of the liver. The adverse effects of IRE are also comparable to other ablative techniques like RFA and MWA. The common complications associated with this procedure include liver abscess, bleeding, renal failure, pleural effusion, fever, and partial portal vein thrombosis. In view of this literature review, IRE is found to be a good alternative for the management of liver tumor in patients who cannot undergo surgery, thermal ablative procedures or tumor lying close to vital structures. The safety profile of this procedure is also encouraging. Further studies and clinical trials need to be done to explore this technique.
