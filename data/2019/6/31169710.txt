To explore interleukin-17 (IL-17) and its epigenetic regulation during the progression of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.A total of 162 patients with chronic HBV infection, including 75 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 54 with hepatitis B-associated liver cirrhosis and 33 with hepatitis B-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC), were enrolled in this study. Thirty healthy adults of the same ethnicity were enrolled in the control group. Whole venous blood was obtained from the patients and normal controls (n = 30). Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed, and we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative real-time PCR to measure the serum levels and relative mRNA expression of IL-17, respectively. IL-17 promoter methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed by methylation-specific PCR. We analyzed the serum and mRNA levels of IL-17 and IL-17 promoter methylation in the 4 groups as well as the effect of methylation on serum IL-17 levels. Correlations between the IL-17 promoter methylation status and clinical parameters were analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis.Compared to the normal control group, the patient groups exhibited significantly higher serum and relative mRNA levels of IL-17. The methylation distribution among the patients was significantly lower than that among the normal controls (P
