Background:Beta-herpesviruses are common opportunistic pathogens that cause morbidity after liver transplantation (LT).Methods:Objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence and correlation of herpesviruses in bile, blood and liver tissue and to investigate their association with biliary complications and retransplantation (re-LT) free survival after LT. The study design is a single-center case-control study. We performed quantative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for herpesvirus 1-8 DNA in bile, blood and liver tissue of 73 patients after first LT and analyzed their clinical courses retrospectively.Results:The median follow-up was 48 months (range 2-102), during which a total of 16 patients underwent re-LT and 11 patients died. Of the patients, 46.5% received valganciclovir prophylaxis at the time of bile sample acquisition. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (18.3%), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) (34.2%), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) (20.5%) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (16.4%) were highly prevalent in bile after LT, while herpes simpex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) were not or rarely detected in bile. Valganciclovir prophylaxis did not reduce the prevalence of HHV-6 and HHV-7 in bile, but it did reduce the presence of CMV and EBV. The presence of HHV-6 in bile was associated with non-anastomotic biliary strictures (NAS) and acute cellular rejection (ACR).Conclusions:CMV, EBV, HHV-6 and HHV-7 are more prevalent in biliary fluid than in liver biopsy or blood serum after LT. HHV-6 and HHV-7 might be associated with biliary complications after LT. Biliary fluids might be an attractive target for routine herpesvirus detection.
