Background:Higher facility volume is correlated to better overall survival (OS), but there is little knowledge on the effect of facility treatment modality number on OS in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This is a retrospective analysis of data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004-2014 on patients with non-metastatic HCC. Treatment modalities assessed were surgical resection, transplantation, ablation, radioembolization, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), single-agent chemotherapy, and multi-agent chemotherapy. Facilities were dichotomized at the median of the listed treatment modalities.Results:There were a total of 112,512 patients with non-metastatic HCC. Of a total of 1,230 sites, 830 (67.5%) used four or fewer modalities. Average survival for patients treated at facilities using fewer modalities was 12.0 and 23.5 months for those treated at facilities with more modalities [hazard ratio (HR) =0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.53, PConclusions:Institutions that offered more treatment modalities had improved OS for patients with non-metastatic HCC, especially for those with stage I and II.
