Background:Although MELD score is a reliable tool for estimating mortality in the waiting list, criteria for preoperative prediction of survival after liver transplantation (LT) are lacking. ALBI score was validated as a prognostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization, hepatic resection, and sorafenib treatment but not for LT outcomes yet. This study aimed to evaluate ALBI score as a prognostic factor in LT.Methods:This is a single-center analysis of patients undergoing LT between October 2001 and June 2017. Primary endpoint was overall post-LT mortality. Secondary endpoint was 90-day mortality.Results:Of all 301 patients included in this study, 185 (61.5%) were males. The median age was 54.1 ± 11.3 years. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that ALBI grade 3 (HR 1.836, 95% CI 1.154-2.921, p = 0.010), low serum albumin (HR 0.628, 95% CI 0.441-0.893, p = 0.010), black race (HR 2.431, 95% CI 1.160-5.092, p = 0.019), and elevated body mass index (HR 1.061, 95% CI 1.022-1.102, p = 0.002) all were associated with decreased overall survival following LT. Patients with both ALBI grade 3 (n = 25) and calculated MELD score ≥ 25 had the lowest overall survival (p Discussion:ALBI grade 3 was related to lower post-LT survival and can be utilized as a tool for risk stratification in LT.
