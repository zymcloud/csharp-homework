Aberrant Src kinase activity is known to be involved in a variety of human malignancies, whereas the regulatory mechanism of Src has not been completely clarified. Here, we demonstrated that tripartite motif containing 7 (TRIM7) directly interacted with Src, induced Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of Src and reduced the abundance of Src protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We further identified TRIM7 as a tumor suppressor in HCC cells through its negative modulation of the Src-mTORC1-S6K1 axis in vivo and in vitro in several HCC models. Moreover, we verified the dysregulated expression of TRIM7 in clinical liver cancer tissues and its negative correlation with Src protein in clinical HCC specimens. Overall, we demonstrated that TRIM7 suppressed HCC progression through its direct negative regulation of Src and modulation of the Src-mTORC1-S6K1 axis; thus, we provided a novel insight into the development of HCC and defined a promising therapeutic strategy for cancers with overactive Src by modulating TRIM7.
