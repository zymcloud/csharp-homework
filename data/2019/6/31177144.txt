Background/aim:apelin and apelin receptor (APJR) are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, and their high expression is related to poor outcomes in several cancer types. Recently, several positive results on APJR antagonists in cancer treatment have been reported at the preclinical level. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic effect of APJR expression on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) survival.Materials and methods:We evaluated APJR expression in 288 curatively resected HCCs using immunohistochemistry and investigated the correlation with clinicopathological features.Results:High APJR expression was significantly associated with the presence of microvascular invasion (pConclusion:We described-high APJR expression and its prognostic effect in HCC. Emerging target agents may be applicable in patients with HCC and high APJR expression.
