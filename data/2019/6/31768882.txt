Patients with focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) develop benign hepatocellular nodules. FNH most frequently occurs in young women. There are no reports of the onset of FNH in elderly men. We report a case of FNH in an elderly man, whose nodules increased in number and size. The patient underwent surgery for carcinoma of the left renal pelvis at 69 years of age; no liver masses were noted on yearly follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Ten years later, CECT revealed a hepatic mass, and magnetic resonance imaging suggested FNH. The nodules increased in number and size in subsequent follow-up examinations.
Elderly man; Focal nodular hyperplasia; Older age; Progressive type.
