Background:Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are effective in patients aged ≥65 years. However, little is known about the effects of DAAs on survival, liver decompensation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Objective:To compare the incidence of liver-related events and mortality between patients aged ≥65 and Methods:Prospective study comparing patients aged ≥65 and Results:Five hundred patients (120 aged ≥65 and 380 aged Conclusions:The incidence of liver-related events and liver-related mortality was low in older people treated with DAAs and was similar to that in younger patients. The extra mortality in people aged ≥65 years treated with DAAs seems to be secondary to non-liver-related causes. These results support the utilization of DAAs in patients aged ≥65 years.
