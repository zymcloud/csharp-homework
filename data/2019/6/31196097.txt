Background:Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for peritoneal metastasis (PM) from colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported to substantially improve the prognosis and the quality of life of patients in comparison to systemic chemotherapy or palliative approaches. This study aimed to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of hepatectomy for metachronous liver metastases from CRC following CRS and HIPEC for PM on the basis of three case reports.Case presentation:We describe three cases involving patients who underwent hepatectomy for metachronous liver metastases from CRC after CRS and HIPEC for PM. All patients underwent CRS and HIPEC after primary tumor resection, and hepatectomy was performed for the metachronous liver metastases after CRS and HIPEC. The hepatectomy procedures for cases 1, 2, and 3 were left hemihepatectomy and partial resection of S5, posterior sectionectomy, and left-lateral sectionectomy and partial resection of S5 and S8, respectively. Although adhesion of surrounding organs to the liver surface was observed on a broad level, dissections and hepatectomy could be performed safely. No recurrence was detected in cases 1 and 2 after hepatectomy. In case 3, liver metastases were detected from the time of the initial diagnosis of the primary tumor, and complete remission was achieved once with systemic chemotherapy. Although we performed hepatectomy for the recurrence of liver metastases after complete remission, early re-recurrence was observed after hepatectomy.Conclusions:Hepatectomy for metachronous liver metastases after CRS and HIPEC for PM could be a multi-modality treatment option for CRC recurrence.
