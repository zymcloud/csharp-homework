Background:Early recurrence is associated with poor prognosis after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, we studied which factors, including this inflammation-based scoring system, affect disease recurrence in single hepatocellular carcinoma patients with liver cirrhosis.Methods:A total of 430 consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients were enrolled in our institution between January 2002 and December 2015. Survival rate, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the variables associated with recurrence and early recurrence especially.Results:The overall survival rate was significantly lower in the early recurrence group than in the non-early recurrence group (P<0.001). According to the multivariate analysis, protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist (PIVKA) greater than 200 (P=0.035), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio greater than 2.0 (P<0.001), elevated Glasgow prognostic score (P=0.003), tumor size greater than 5 cm (P=0.002), and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (P=0.002) were significantly different among the groups and affected the early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patients were categorized into five levels of risk for early recurrence according to the number of independent risk factors, and patients with no risk factors were set as the reference group.Conclusion:Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Glasgow prognostic score, and serum level of PIVKA offer significant prognostic information associated with early recurrence following single lesion hepatocellular carcinoma patients with liver cirrhosis after curative resection.
