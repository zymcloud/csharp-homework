Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a role in chronic inflammation. Still, little is known about the expression of TLRs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we tried to assess the prognostic value of TLR2 and TLR4 expression on circulating monocytes in HCC patients and correlate their levels with some clinical, laboratory data, and treatment outcomes. Forty patients with hepatic focal lesions diagnosed radiologically as HCC by triphasic multislice CT pelviabdominal and chest, and in some patients MRI diffusion and 38 age and sex matching healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Subjects were evaluated for liver functions, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), imaging, response to different treatments, and overall survival. TLR2 and TLR4 expression by monocytes was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 on monocytes was significantly increased in HCC patients than the controls, in patients with more progressive HCC than those with lower progression and in patients with poor response to treatment than patients with better treatment response. Moreover, their levels showed positive correlations with ALT, AST, and AFP and inverse correlations with the overall survival of HCC patients. The results of the current study suggest that increased expression ofTLR2 and TLR4 on peripheral monocytes might reflect the development and progression of HCC and can be used to indicate poor prognosis. In addition, high expression of TLR2 correlated significantly with poor response to treatment, while high expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 were associated with poor survival. Our findings will help to design more studies on the role of TLRs in HCC pathogenesis and prognosis which may provide new therapeutic targets for HCC.
