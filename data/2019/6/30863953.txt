Background:Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, contributing significant burden on healthcare systems.Aim:We aim to evaluate trends in clinical and economic burden of HE among hospitalized adults in the USA.Methods:Using the 2010-2014 National Inpatient Sample, we identified adults hospitalized with HE using ICD-9-CM codes. Annual trends in hospitalizations with HE, in-hospital mortality, and hospital charges were stratified by the presence of acute liver failure (ALF) or cirrhosis. Adjusted multivariable regression models were evaluated for predictors of in-hospital mortality and hospitalization charges.Results:Among 142,860 hospitalizations with HE (mean age 59.3 years, 57.8% male), 67.7% had cirrhosis and 3.9% ALF. From 2010 to 2014, total number of hospitalizations with HE increased by 24.4% (25,059 in 2010 to 31,182 in 2014, p Conclusions:The clinical and economic burden of hospitalizations with HE in the USA continues to rise. In 2014, estimated national economic burden of hospitalizations with HE reached $11.9 billion.
