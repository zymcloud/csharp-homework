Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Heterogeneity of clinical conditions contributes to the complex management of care for patients with advanced HCC. Recently, the treatment landscape for advanced HCC has expanded rapidly, with the additional FDA approvals of several oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (lenvatinib, regorafenib, and cabozantinib), as well as immunotherapies such as immune check point inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and the monoclonal IgG1 antibody, ramucirumab. This expansion has generated a need for novel treatment sequencing strategies in this patient population. In light of these developments, an evaluation of the impact of FDA-approved therapeutics on patient-centered outcomes such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is warranted. An increased understanding of HRQoL in patients included in advanced HCC clinical trials could potentially help physician decision-making for treatment sequencing in patients with advanced HCC.
