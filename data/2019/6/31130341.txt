We performed genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of 133 combined hepatocellular and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC) cases, including separate, combined, and mixed subtypes. Integrative comparison of cHCC-ICC with hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma revealed that combined and mixed type cHCC-ICCs are distinct subtypes with different clinical and molecular features. Integrating laser microdissection, cancer cell fraction analysis, and single nucleus sequencing, we revealed both mono- and multiclonal origins in the separate type cHCC-ICCs, whereas combined and mixed type cHCC-ICCs were all monoclonal origin. Notably, cHCC-ICCs showed significantly higher expression of Nestin, suggesting Nestin may serve as a biomarker for diagnosing cHCC-ICC. Our results provide important biological and clinical insights into cHCC-ICC.
