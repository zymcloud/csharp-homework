Regenerating islet-derived protein (Reg) could participate in the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, inflammation, tumors, and other diseased or damaged tissues. However, the correlation of Reg with acute hepatic failure (AHF) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly defined. To reveal the expression profiles of Reg family and their possible regulatory roles in AHF and HCC, rat models of HCC and AHF were separately established, and Rat Genome 230 2.0 was used to detect expression profiles of Reg-mediated signaling pathways-associated genes from liver tissues in AHF and HCC. The results showed that a total of 79 genes were significantly changed. Among these genes, 67 genes were the AHF-specific genes, 45 genes were the HCC-specific genes, and 33 genes were the common genes. Then, K-means clustering classified these genes into 4 clusters based on the gene expression similarity, and DAVID analysis showed that the above altered genes were mainly associated with stress response, inflammatory response, and cell cycle regulation. Thereafter, IPA software was used to analyze potential effects of these genes, and the predicted results suggested that the Reg-mediated JAK/STAT, NF-ÎºB, MAPK (ERK1/2, P38 and JNK), PLC, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways may account for the activated inflammation and cell proliferation, and the attenuated apoptosis and cell death during the occurrence of AHF and HCC.
