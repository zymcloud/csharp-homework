Jagged1, the essential ligand of the Notch signalling pathway, is highly expressed in metastatic prostate cancer, and its high expression in breast cancer is linked to poor survival rates. However, the mechanism of Jagged1's involvement in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the roles of Jagged1 in the platinum resistance of ovarian cancer and its possible mechanisms. Compared with a platinum responsive group of ovarian epithelial cell carcinomas, we found the positive staining intensity of Notch1, Notch2, Jagged1, STAT3 and Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins were lower in a platinum-resistant group. The DDP-resistant ovarian cancer cell line (C13K) had a higher IC50 of DDP than its parental cell line (OV2008) (P < 0.05) and acquired an EMT phenotype and invasive characteristics. Inhibiting or knockdown of Jagged1 expression could not only reduce its capacity of migration and invasion but also reverse EMT and down-regulate the expression of serine 727-phosphorylated STAT3 (pS727) at the protein level but not total STAT3 or tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3 (pY705) in C13K cells. Furthermore, it was found that crosstalk between the Jagged1/Notch and JAK/STAT3 signalling pathways were involved in Jagged1-promoting EMT in C13K cells. Experiments in vivo showed a reduced micrometastatic tumour burden in the lung, liver and spleen of mice implanted with C13K cells with knocked-down Jagged1 compared with mice implanted with control cells. All of these results demonstrate that Jagged1 can crosstalk with the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and they all cooperate to promote the aberrant occurrence of EMT, further reinforcing the abilities of invasion and migration of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in vivo and in vitro.
