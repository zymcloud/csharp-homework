Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous, multigene-driven malignant tumor. ZNF384 is an overexpressed gene with a high frequency of alteration in HCC, but research on the function of ZNF384 in HCC is lacking. In this study, the expression level of ZNF384 in HCC was analyzed through immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR. We also generated ZNF384 knockdown and knockout HCC cell lines using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. MTS, colony formation, and 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU) assays; flow cytometry; and a xenograft mouse model were used to evaluate the effects of ZNF384 on cell proliferation. Western blot analysis, a dual luciferase reporter assay and a ChIP assay were performed to explore the potential mechanism. We found that overexpression of ZNF384 in HCC and elevated expression of ZNF384 in HCC tissues was significantly correlated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.0097). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that high expression levels of ZNF384 were correlated with poor overall survival (P = 0.0386). Downregulation of ZNF384 expression suppressed HCC cell proliferation by inhibiting the expression of Cyclin D1. These findings suggest that ZNF384 tends to act as an oncogene in the development of HCC. ZNF384 promotes the proliferation of HCC cells by directly upregulating the expression of Cyclin D1 and might serve as a prognostic predictive factor for HCC patients.
