Background and aims:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In NAFLD, HCC occurs more commonly in the absence of cirrhosis compared with other liver diseases; yet, patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD-HCC are poorly characterized. Here, we characterized a large cohort of HCC cases and assessed the outcomes of patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD-HCC.Methods:We identified all cases of HCC treated at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden from 2004 to 2017. Patient charts were manually reviewed for variable extraction. Cases were followed passively for all-cause and HCC-related mortality until the end of April 2018. Cox regression was performed to estimate mortality rates and identify mortality risk factors in patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD-HCC.Results:Totally, 1562 cases with HCC were identified. Of these, 225 (14.4%) had NAFLD-HCC, of which 83 (37%) did not have cirrhosis. Compared with patients with cirrhotic NAFLD-HCC, patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD-HCC were older (74 vs 70 years, P Conclusions:Patients with non-cirrhotic NAFLD-HCC differ from those with cirrhosis in age, tumour size and allocated treatments. Despite these differences, survival is similar.
