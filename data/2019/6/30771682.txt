Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of cancer death worldwide. Resection offers the best chance of long-term survival, but a consistent adverse prognostic factor is the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI). In this study, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS), a high throughput method of analyzing complex samples, was used to explore differentially expressed proteins between HCC and adjacent nontumour liver tissue (ANLT). These findings were correlated with clinical outcomes.Materials and methods:From 2002 to 2011, tumor and ANLT were collected from patients who underwent liver resection and these samples were later prepared for SELDI-TOF MS. Output data were then used to identify proteins capable of discriminating HCC from ANLT. Proteins from the multivariate analysis were then analyzed to determine prognostic factors and the m/z ratios of these proteins were entered into the ExPASy database to infer potential candidates.Results:During the study period, 30 patients had SELDI-TOF MS performed on their HCC and ANLT samples. On multivariate analysis, a panel of four proteins-m/z 5840, m/z 8921, m/z 9961, and m/z 25,872-discriminated HCC from ANLT with an area under the ROC curve of 0.954 (P Conclusions:Using SELDI TOF-MS, we identified a panel of four proteins with excellent discriminative capacity between HCC and ANLT. Of these, m/z 9961 was the only protein significantly associated with a known poor prognostic factor (presence of MVI) and survival (shorter disease-free survival). While loss of CAR 3/7 could lead to MVI, further research is warranted to validate the identity of protein m/z 9961.
