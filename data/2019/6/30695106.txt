The clinical outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may be related to host and viral genetic factors, as well as to the type of infection (monoinfection and coinfection). To analyze the distribution/combination of HBV/hepatitis D virus (HDV) genotypes and the associated clinical characteristics, 409 serum samples from patients with chronic HBV (94 of them coinfected by HDV) followed at the Viral Hepatitis Referral Center of Rio Branco, Brazil were enrolled. HBV DNA and HDV RNA were amplified, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR using specific primers in the PreC/C region and the S gene, and by reverse-transcription PCR and seminested PCR using specific primers in the delta antigen region and sequenced. The proportion of women (56.1%) was significantly higher than males in this cohort ( P < 0.01). Women were significantly younger (39.8 years; 8-77 years) than males (44.7 years; 12-79 years; P < 0.01). Sixty-eight (18%) patients were infected with HBV-F genotype and 264 (69.8%) with HBV/non-F genotypes. Coinfection by HDV was detected in 23.9% (94 of 409) of this population and was more frequent in male (54.2%, 51 of 94) than in female patients (44.7%, 42 of 94; P = 0.015). HDV-3 was the most prevalent (88.9%) genotype. Almost 70% of HDV-3 coinfected patients were infected with HBV/non-F genotypes. Severe liver disease was diagnosed in 41 patients, 60.9% (25 of 41) of them coinfected with HDV. HBV/HDV coinfection was associated with male sex, age above 30 years, severe liver disease, and increased alanine aminotransferase levels. HBV/HDV-3 coinfection is associated with severe liver disease, in Rio Branco, Brazil.
