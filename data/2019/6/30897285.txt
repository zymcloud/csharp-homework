The system of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met plays a critical role in tumor invasive growth and metastasis. The mortality rate of colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies, is increased by it gradual development into metastasis, most frequently in the liver. Overexpression of c-Met, the protein tyrosine kinase receptor for the HCF/scatter factor, has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of human colorectal carcinoma. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of c-Met in CRC liver metastasis and illustrate the clinical impact of regulating HGF/c-Met signaling in patients with CRC liver metastasis. We found that (I) higher levels of c-Met expression (mRNA and Protein) in CRC liver metastasis than primary CRC by assessing the patient tissue samples; (II) a positive correlation of c-Met expression with tumor stages of CRC liver metastasis, as well as c-Met expression in CRC, live metastasis concurred with regional lymph node metastasis; (III) the clinical impact of downregulation of HGF/c-Met signaling on the reduction of proliferation and invasion in CRC liver metastasis. Therefore, we demonstrate that the regulation of HGF/c-Met pathways may be a promising strategy in the treatment of patients with CRC liver metastasis.
