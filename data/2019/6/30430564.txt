Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) differentiation antagonizing nonprotein coding RNA (DANCR) has been identified as an oncogene in several cancers. However, the biological function and role of DANCR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Our current study aimed to investigate the detailed mechanism of DANCR in HCC. We found that DANCR was significantly upregulated in HCC cell lines in comparison to LO2 cells. Then, we observed that knockdown of DANCR could greatly inhibit Huh7 and HepG2 cell proliferation. In addition, HCC cell apoptosis was increased by silence of DANCR and meanwhile, cell cycle progression was blocked in G1 phase. Apart from these, downregulation of DANCR repressed HCC cell migration and invasion ability obviously. As predicted by the bioinformatics analysis, microRNA-216a-5p (miR-216a-5p) could serve as a direct target of DANCR. MiR-216a-5p has been reported to be involved in many cancers. Here, the correlation between miR-216a-5p and DANCR was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter assay and radioimmunoprecipitation assay. Subsequently, Kruppel-like factor 12 (KLF12) exerts an important role in different tumor types. KLF12 can function as a downstream target of miR-216a-5p. Finally, the in vivo experiments were used and the data proved that DANCR also strongly suppressed HCC tumor growth in vivo via targeting miR-216a-5p and KLF12. In conclusion, our study indicated that DANCR might provide a new perspective for HCC treatment.
