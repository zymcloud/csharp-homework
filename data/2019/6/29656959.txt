Interleukin (IL)-33/ST2 pathway plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis through influencing cancer stemness, tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and accumulation of regulatory T cells in tumor microenvironments. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of IL-33 rs7025417 and ST2 rs3821204 with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genotyping of IL-33 rs7025417 and ST2 rs3821204 was carried out using a Taqman assay. IL-33 and ST2 mRNA was examined using real-time PCR and plasma IL-33 and sST2 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ST2 rs3821204 CC genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of HCC (CC vs. GG: adjusted OR = 2.29, 95% CI, 1.39-3.78; dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.58, 95% CI, 1.12-2.23; recessive model: adjusted OR = 1.88, 95% CI, 1.21-2.93; C vs. G: adjusted OR = 1.53, 95% CI, 1.20-1.95). Gene-environment interaction analysis showed that the risk effect of rs3821204 CG/CC genotypes was more evident in smokers (adjusted OR = 1.70, 95% CI, 1.13-2.55) and drinkers (adjusted OR = 1.57, 95% CI, 1.04-2.37). The increased risk was also observed in combined analysis. Moreover, HCC patients with ST2 rs3821204 CC genotype had higher levels of mRNA and protein expression (P
