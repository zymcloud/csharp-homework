Background & aims:It remains unclear whether the classic imaging criteria for the non-invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be applied to chronic vascular liver diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Herein, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of washout for the discrimination between benign and malignant lesions in patients with BCS.Methods:This retrospective study included all patients admitted to our institution with a diagnosis of BCS and focal lesions on MRI from 2000 to 2016. MRI images were reviewed by 2 radiologists blinded to the nature of the lesions. Patient and lesion characteristics were recorded, with a focus on washout on portal venous and/or delayed phases. Lesions were compared using Chi-square, Fisher's, Student's t or Mann-Whitney U tests.Results:A total of 49 patients (mean age 35 ± 12 years; 34 women [69%] and 15 men [31%]) with 241 benign lesions and 12 HCC lesions were analyzed. Patients with HCC were significantly older (mean age 44 ± 16 vs. 33 ± 9 years, p = 0.005), with higher alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (median 16 vs. 3 ng/ml, p = 0.007). Washout was depicted in 9/12 (75%) HCC, and 69/241 (29%) benign lesions (p 15 ng/ml was associated with 95% specificity.Conclusion:Washout was observed in close to one-third of benign lesions, leading to an unacceptably low specificity for the diagnosis of HCC. The non-invasive diagnostic criteria proposed for cirrhotic patients cannot be extrapolated to patients with BCS.Lay summary:Washout on MRI is depicted in a significant proportion of benign nodules in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), limiting its value for the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Criteria proposed for the non-invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis cannot be extrapolated to patients with BCS. Additional imaging findings and patient characteristics, including alpha-fetoprotein serum level, can help determine the probability of a nodule being HCC in patients with BCS.
