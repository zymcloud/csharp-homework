Background:An ideal staging system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) should rely on the hepatic reserve function and tumor burden. With the improvement in diagnostic and treatment strategies for HCC, in addition to recent treatment of viral hepatitis, finding a suitable assessment tool for hepatic reserve has become mandatory.Aim:To validate a recently proposed modified albumin-bilirubin-TNM (mALBI-T) grade as a prognostic model for patients with HCC in Egypt.Methods:For patients diagnosed with HCC, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI), plateltet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI), ALBI-based BCLC, ALBI-T and mALBI-T grades were estimated. Patients were followed from time of diagnosis to date of death or date of data collection if they remained alive. Overall survival and received treatments were determined. Survival data were analyzed.Results:A total of 1910 patients were included (mean age, 57 years; 1575 males). At presentation, 50.6% had CTP A, 36.1% had CTP B and 13.4 % had CTP C; 12% had ALBI grade 1, 62.3% had ALBI grade 2 and 24.7% had ALBI grade 3. Overall median survival was 13 mo; survival was better in patients with ALBI 1 than in those with ALBI 2 and 3 (28.6 vs 14 and 5.8 mo, respectively, P < 0.001). Patients with ALBI-T grades 0 and 1 had better survival than those with ALBI-T grades 2, 3, 4 and 5 (P < 0.001). The modified ALBI-T showed better stratification and significant improvement in prediction of survival.Conclusion:ALBI-T grade is a superior prognostic tool that selects patients with HCC who have better liver reservoir and tumor stage. mALBI-T is a better prognostic model in patients with HCC.
