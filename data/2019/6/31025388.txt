Background:The Liver stiffness measurement hepatocellular carcinoma (LSM-HCC) score predicts HCC accurately in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Aim:To assess the ability of LSM-HCC combined with enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score to predict HCC in CHB patients who received anti-viral treatment.Methods:CHB patients who had transient elastography examinations in 2006-2013 with intermediate and high risk of HCC by LSM-HCC score (ie 11 or above) were assessed by repeat transient elastography at least 3 years later. ELF score was assessed by retrieving the stored serum samples 4 weeks within transient elastography examination. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of HCC.Results:A total of 453 CHB patients (mean age 51.7 Â± 10.3 years; male 74.4%) were recruited, 45 patients (9.9%) developed HCC during the mean follow-up of 56 months. Regarding LSM-HCC score, 71.4%, 24.3% and 4.3% of patients had LSM-HCC score improved, remained static and deteriorated respectively; whereas 36.9%, 57.8% and 5.3% of patients had ELF score improved, remained static and deteriorated respectively. The sensitivity (86.7%) and negative predictive value (NPV) (95.3%) of combined LSM-HCC and ELF score were higher than that of each score alone. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that ELF score would help further differentiate the HCC risk in patients with intermediate risk by LSM-HCC score (P = 0.026), but not in patients with high risk by LSM-HCC score (P = 0.770).Conclusions:The two-step algorithm combining LSM-HCC score and ELF score could improve the accuracy of predicting HCC of CHB patients receiving anti-viral treatment.
