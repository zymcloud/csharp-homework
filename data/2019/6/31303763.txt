Background:This study was designed to investigate the antitumor activity of the mAb (AC10364) in vitro and elucidate the related mechanisms of inhibition to cell growth using bel/fu cells treated with AC10364.Methods:The inhibitory effects of AC10364 on the proliferation of Bel/fu cells were examined using a cytotoxicity assay. Apoptosis of Bel/fu cells was detected using FITC annexin V and PI staining following treatment with AC10364 for 24 h. The factors regulating apoptosis were identified by Western blot using lysates of Bel/fu cells treated with AC10364 for 0, 12, 24, or 36 h. Genes associated with tumorigenesis or growth were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction using Bel/fu cells treated for 12, 24, or 36 h with AC10364.Results:The early apoptotic ratios of Bel/fu cells treated with AC10364 increased in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of caspases, including cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3 and caspase-9, were significantly high in Bel/fu cells treated with AC10364 (P<0.001). Compared with untreated cells, those exposed to AC10364 had showed significant downregulation of the expression of binding protein gene (G protein subunit α 15, GNA15) and other protein-coding genes, including fms-related tyrosine kinase 1(FLT1), nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), netrin 4 (NTN4), platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGFA), S100 calcium binding protein A11 (S100A11), tubulin β 3 class III (TUBB3), aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3), endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), and interferon α-inducible protein 27 (IFI27) (P<0.001). Two other genes, AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) and carboxypeptidase A4 (CPA4), were significantly upregulated (P<0.001).Conclusion:AC10364 inhibited cell viability and proliferation through aberrant expression of multiple genes associated with tumorigenesis or growth, which suggests that these genes may be promising therapeutic candidates for cancer therapy.
