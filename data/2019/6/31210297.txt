Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) TP73-AS1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cells, and to further investigate whether it can accelerate the progression of HCC by regulating microRNA-103.Patients and methods:Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine TP73-AS1 expression in 60 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent ones, and the association between lncRNATP73-AS1 level and clinical indicators of HCC as well as patients' prognosis was analyzed. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR was used to further verify TP73-AS1 expression in HCC cell lines. The lncRNA TP73-AS1 knockdown model was constructed using lentivirus in the HCC cell lines, including Bel-7402 and HepG2. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and flow cytometry assays were performed to figure out the influence of TP73-AS1 on the basic biological function of the HCC cells. Finally, the involved potential regulatory mechanism was explored using cell recovery experiments, and the relationship between TP73-AS1 and microRNA-103 was further studied.Results:QRT-PCR results indicated that TP73-AS1 expression in HCC samples was conspicuously enhanced compared with paracancerous tissues, and patients with a relatively high level of TP73-AS1 had a higher tumor stage and a lower overall survival rate. Meanwhile, the proliferation ability of cells in the sh-TP73-AS1 group was strikingly lower than that in the control group, while cell apoptosis showed the opposite trend. Besides, qRT-PCR results indicated a negative correlation between microRNA-103 and TP73-AS1 in HCC tissue specimens. The results of the luciferase reporting assay revealed that TP73-AS1 could be targeted by microRNA-103 through binding site. In addition, the cell recovery experiment demonstrated that TP73-AS1 and microRNA-103 might have a mutual regulation, and the two of which could together affect the malignant progression of HCC.Conclusions:TP73-AS1 expression was conspicuously enhanced both in HCC tissues and cell lines, which were associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis. In addition, TP73-AS1 could accelerate the proliferation of HCC cells by regulating microRNA-103.
