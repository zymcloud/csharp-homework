Background:There are several types of primary malignant hepatic tumors (PMHT) other than hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC): they are infrequent and poorly known. Imaging studies could help characterize the lesions and may guide the diagnosis. However, the definitive diagnosis of PMHT is made by pathology.Aim:To review a registry of liver biopsies performed to diagnose hepatic tumors.Patients and methods:Review of a pathology registry of liver biopsies performed for the diagnosis of liver tumors. Among these, 25 patients aged 57 Â± 17 years, 60% males, in whom a liver tumor other than a HCC or CC was diagnosed, were selected for review. The medical records of these patients were reviewed to register their clinical characteristics, imaging and the pathological diagnosis performed during surgery and/ or with the percutaneous liver biopsy.Results:Ten patients (40%) had neuroendocrine tumors, six (24%) had a lymphoma and four (16%) had hepatic hemangioendothelioma. Angiosarcoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma were diagnosed in one patient each. In 22 patients (88%), neither clinical features nor imaging studies gave the correct diagnosis. Four patients (16%) had chronic liver disease. The most frequent symptoms were weight loss in 28% and abdominal pain in 24%.Conclusions:The most common PMHT other than HCC and CC were neuroendocrine tumors and lymphomas. Imaging or clinical features were not helpful to reach the correct diagnosis.
