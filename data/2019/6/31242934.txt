Background:The prognosis of adrenal metastases (AM) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with surgical contraindication was poor. This study evaluated the feasibility, safety and treatment efficacy of percutaneous ultrasound (US)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the local treatment of AM originated from HCC.Methods:A retrospective study was carried out on 22 patients (21 male and 1 female, mean age, 53.0 ± 13.0 years) who had single AM (mean diameter, 4.0 ± 1.8 cm, range, 1.7-8.0 cm) originated from HCC and received US-guided percutaneous RFA at our institution. The diagnosis was established on typical radiologic findings. The primary technical success was defined as the tumour being completely ablated in the first RFA session. The secondary technical success was defined as tumour residual left from the first ablation was completely ablated by a second ablation session. Local tumour progression (LTP) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:A total of 25 ablation sessions were performed. The primary technical success and the secondary technical success were 77.3% (17 of 22) and 86.4% (19 of 22), respectively, with the major complication rate at 4.5% (1 of 22). The median follow-up period after RFA was 10 months (3-55 months). During the follow-up period, five patients were detected LTP. The LTP at 3, 6, and 12 months were 15.8, 26.3, and 26.3%, respectively. Nine patients died of distant extra-adrenal metastases and another five of liver failure due to HCC. The OS at 6, 12, 24 months after RFA for AM were at 79.7, 52.6, and 32.9%, respectively.Conclusion:Percutaneous US-guided RFA in the treatment of AM originated from HCC is feasible, safe and effective.
