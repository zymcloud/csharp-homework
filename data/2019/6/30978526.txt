Accumulating evidence suggested that YrdC involved in growth, telomere homeostasis, translation and the N6-threonylcarbamoylation (t6A) of tRNA was abnormally expressed in the progression of tumor. However, the role of YrdC in hepatocellular carcinoma remained elusive. Our study aimed to investigate the clinical significance and oncogenic phenotypes of YrdC in hepatocellular carcinoma, and to determine its related mechanism of this disease. With the usage of GEO datasets, we analyzed the expression of YrdC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of hepatocellular carcinoma patients in TCGA. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses in vitro of YrdC were also performed to evaluate its effects on oncogenic phenotypes and relevant signaling pathways. YrdC expression was not only dysregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue but also related to the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, YrdC depletion suppressed the capability of proliferation, migration and invasion of huh7 cells, while there was opposite result for YrdC overexpression. Our data also unraveled that YrdC promoted the progression of HCC by activating MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Together, our findings indicated that YrdC was a potential prognosis marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, and therapeutic strategies targeting YrdC might hold promise in improving the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
