Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with some of the highest cancer-associated mortality rates. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors anti-HCC activities have been shown to promote Snail-induced metastasis. In the present study, it was shown that BAY 87-2243, a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1α inhibitor, could enhance the anti-HCC effects of HDAC inhibitors, including trichostatin A and vorinostat. In addition, BAY 87-2243 plus HDAC inhibitors exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity and induced significant cell death in Hep3B cells. Additionally, BAY 87-2243 combined with HDAC inhibitors-treated Hep3B cells formed fewer and smaller colonies as compared with either the control or single agent-treated cells. Furthermore, glycogen synthase kinase-3β might be involved in the enhanced cell death induced by BAY 87-2243 plus HDAC inhibitors. The present data also indicated that BAY 87-2243 combined with HDAC inhibitors could suppress the migration of Hep3B cells, and BAY 87-2243 could reverse the HDAC inhibitor-induced Snail activation in Hep3B cells. In conclusion, BAY 87-2243 combined with HDAC inhibitors might be an attractive chemotherapy strategy for HCC therapy.
