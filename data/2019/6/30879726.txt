Objectives:The goals of retrocrural metastasectomy are complete resection with preservation of the diaphragmatic function while avoiding phrenic nerve injury and spinal cord ischemia. We describe 2 approaches for metastasectomy depending on the pattern of metastases.Methods:Between 1999 and 2017, 44 patients underwent 50 retrocrural metastasectomies. In case of lower retrocrural, bilateral retrocrural, and or additional retroperitoneal and abdominal metastases, an abdominal approach with mobilization of the liver and the kidney followed by longitudinal incision of the diaphragmatic crus was performed. In case of upper retrocrural metastases and additional thoracic disease, a thoracic approach was performed. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to analyze survival and prognosticators.Results:The minor morbidity, major morbidity, and mortality were 16.6%, 0%, and 0% for the abdominal approach, respectively, and 15.4%, 3.8%, and 0% for the thoracic approach. There was no phrenic nerve palsy, diaphragmatic hernia, or spinal cord ischemia. Additional retroperitoneal, mediastinal, pulmonary, or further resection was necessary in 10, 25, 9, and 6 cases, respectively. In all cases, a R0 resection was achieved. The 15-year survival rate was 95%.Conclusions:Depending on the pattern of metastases, a complete retrocrural metastasectomy with low morbidity and without mortality by thoracic or abdominal approach is possible. Both approaches preserve diaphragmatic function. Furthermore, the lateral abdominal approach provides a good view and might lead to less tension at the spinal arteries and therefore might reduce the risk of paresis. Good long-term survival is achievable. These patients should be operated on in specialized centers.
