s-Triazine is considered a privileged structure, as it is found in several FDA-approved drugs. In the framework of our ongoing medicinal chemistry project based on the use of s-triazine as a scaffold, we synthesized a series of mono- and di-pyrazolyl-s-triazine derivatives and tested them against four human cancer cell lines, namely Human breast carcinoma (MCF 7 and MDA-MB-231), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), colorectal carcinoma (LoVo), and leukemia (K562). The cell viability assay revealed that most of the s-triazine compounds induced cytotoxicity in all four types of human cancer cell lines, however, compounds 4a, and 6g, both of them have a piperidine moiety in their structure were most effective. These two compounds affected the cell viability of cancer cells, with IC50 values within the range between 5 to 9 ÂµM. The cell cycle analysis showed that 4a and 6g induced S and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in K562 cells. This could be the mechanism by which these molecules induced cytotoxicity in tested cancer cells. The prepared compounds were tested in zebrafish embryos to evaluate in vivo and developmental toxicity of the pyrazolyl-s-triazine derivatives in animals. None of the derivatives were lethal in the concentration range tested.
