Background:Recently, the dysregulation of circular RNA (circRNA) have been shown to have important regulatory roles in cancer development and progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the roles of most circRNAs in HCC are still unknown.Methods:The expression of circular tripartite motif containing 33-12 (circTRIM33-12) in HCC tissues and cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. The role of circTRIM33-12 in HCC progression was assessed by western blotting, CCK-8, flow cytometry, transwell and a subcutaneous tumor mouse assays both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo circRNA precipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assays were performed to evaluate the interaction between circTRIM33-12 and miR-191.Results:Here, we found that circTRIM33-12, is downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. The downregulation of circTRIM33-12 in HCC was significantly correlated with malignant characteristics and served as an independent risk factor for the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients with HCC after surgery. The reduced expression of circTRIM33-12 in HCC cells increases tumor proliferation, migration, invasion and immune evasion. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that circTRIM33-12 upregulated TET1 expression by sponging miR-191, resulting in significantly reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels in HCC cells.Conclusions:These results reveal the important role of circTRIM33-12 in the proliferation, migration, invasion and immune evasion abilities of HCC cells and provide a new perspective on circRNAs in HCC progression.
