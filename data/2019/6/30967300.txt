Background:Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) as a Mediator complex-associated transcriptional regulator has been shown to play important role in the initiation and progression of various cancers. The present study aimed to explore miR-152-3p-modulated post-transcriptional repression of CDK8 in hepatic carcinogenesis.Methods:Eighty-nine pairs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected for molecular biological analysis. Cell viability and apoptosis assays were detected using CCK8 and Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (Annexinv-FITC) double staining, respectively. Bioinformatics algorithms and luciferase reporter assay were performed to validate CDK8 as a direct target of miR-152-3p. Gene and protein expression levels were monitored using RT-qPCR, western blotting or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.Results:CDK8 expression levels were up-regulated and miR-152-3p was down-regulated in HCC tissues. The correlation analysis had documented a significant negative correlation between miR-152-3p and CDK8 in the HCC tissues. Both CDK8 and miR-152-3p could serve as the independent prognostic factors for predicting the OS and DFS in HCC patients. Bioinformatics and experimental measurement revealed that CDK8 was a direct target of miR-152-3p. After co-transfection with the miR-152-3p mimics and the CDK8 overexpressed plasmids, the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic roles of miR-152-3p were restricted by CDK8.Conclusion:The present results obtained forcefully proved that miR-152-3p exhibited an antineoplastic activity via targeting CDK8 and might be served as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.
