Objective: This study aimed to investigate the anatomic configuration of the blood vessels that contribute to portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), a common complication of hepatocellular carcinoma, in VX2 rabbits. Materials and methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated and labeled using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles in vitro. Twenty-four rabbits were injected with the VX2 tumor via the portal vein to establish the PVTT model. The rabbits (n=6/treatment group) were randomly assigned into four groups. Rabbits of groups A, B and C received an infusion of iron-labeled MNCs via the hepatic artery, the portal vein or the auricular vein, respectively, whereas rabbits of group D received an injection of normal saline via the auricular vein 7 days after the injection of VX2 tumors. MRI was performed, and the signal intensity (SI) of the PVTTs was measured on T2-weighted images (T2WIs) 1 day after the transfusion of iron-labeled cells. Results: The SI of PVTTs, as measured on T2WIs, in rabbits of groups A, B, C and D was 241.400 (172.350, 364.825), 221.150 (203.775, 318.225), 590.200 (363.325, 728.875) and 568.050 (474.725, 705.150), respectively. Our data showed a significant decrease in the SI of PVTTs in rabbits of groups A and B compared with rabbits of groups C and D (group A vs group C, U=4.000, p=0.025; group A vs group D, U=2.000, p=0.010; group B vs group C, U=4.000, p=0.025; group B vs group D, U=1.000, p=0.006). There was no significant difference in the SI of PVTTs in rabbits of group A and B. Conclusion: Our results indicated that the portal vein and the hepatic artery supplied blood flow to the PVTT in rabbits.
