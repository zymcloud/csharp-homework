Copper and zinc are essential micronutrients, whose imbalance may be involved in the development and progression of cancer. However, the role of copper and/or zinc imbalance in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently unclear. Our objective was to investigate the association between serum levels of copper, zinc and their ratio (copper/zinc) at diagnosis with HCC survival. We included 989 patients with incident HCC in this prospective cohort study, who were enrolled in the Guangdong Liver Cancer Cohort (GLCC) study within 30 days of diagnosis between September 2013 and February 2017. Serum copper and zinc were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Primary outcomes were liver cancer-specific survival (LCSS) and overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Higher serum copper levels were strongly associated with worse LCSS (Q4 vs. Q1: HR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.22-2.86; p
