Radiologists routinely evaluate for tumor thrombus in the portal and hepatic veins in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in the renal vein and inferior vena cava in patients with renal cell carcinoma. However, tumor thrombus occurs in association with numerous other tumor types, e.g. colorectal carcinoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Furthermore tumor thrombi are not limited to the primary tumor but also seen with local recurrence and metastatic disease. While less recognized, these thrombi nevertheless affect patterns of recurrence and prognosis. Their detection is critical for accurate local staging and early detection of local recurrence and metastatic disease. The purpose of this pictorial review is to draw the attention of radiologists to the less familiar manifestations of tumor thrombus, review the imaging findings and illustrate the clinical significance of these thrombi.
