Objectives:We investigated the prognostic value of tumor blood supply in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 53 patients with advanced GC treated with FLEEOX chemotherapy. The tumor computed tomography (CT) enhancement value was measured before chemotherapy (CT1; arterial phase CT-plain phase CT). The liver parenchyma CT enhancement value (CT2) was also measured using the same method, to eliminate individual differences. Tumor blood supply was defined as good or poor based on the median CT1/CT2 values. We evaluated the relationships between tumor blood supply and response to chemotherapy, clinicopathologic characteristics, and overall survival (OS).Results:A good blood supply (GBS) was associated with significantly better clinical and pathological responses to chemotherapy than a poor blood supply (PBS). The 3-year OS was 65.8% for the entire cohort. Patients with a GBS had a significantly higher OS (78.57%) than those with a PBS (54.44%). Additionally, patients with Bormann type III GC had a better blood supply than those with type II GC.Conclusion:Patients with advanced GC and a GBS are more likely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy than those with a PBS. Blood supply may thus be a predictor for chemotherapy response.
