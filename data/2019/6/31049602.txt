Liver transplantation (LTPL) is the only curative option for patients with end stage liver disease (ESLD) or with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Eurotransplant in Leiden, the Netherlands, is responsible for organ allocation. The model of end stage liver disease (MELD) score, which describes the severity of the liver disease, is decisive for organ allocation. The heterogeneous patient collective and hepatic-related comorbidities and their dynamics represent challenges. The anesthesiologist is responsible for evaluating the overall prognosis, whereby cardiac, pulmonary, renal and neurological comorbidities must be taken into consideration. During LTPL surgery is divided into several stages. Besides volume management, heat preservation and coagulation management, major challenges for the anesthesiologist are hemodynamic stabilization and regulation of the acid-base balance.
Acid-base equilibrium; End stage liver disease; Hemodynamics; Portal hypertension; Water-electrolyte balance.
