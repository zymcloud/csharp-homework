Active liver diseases are characterized by an infiltration of inflammatory immune cells, which interact locally with hepatocytes. Co-cultures between non- and -activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human hepatoma HepaRG cells were used to determine the role of these cell interactions in the inflammatory response. At the early stage, PBMC-HepaRG cell interactions increased mRNA expression and/or secretion of IL-6, IL-8, CCL-20 and MCP-1, in part through direct cell contact and the induction was higher in PHA-activated conditions. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and/or TNFÎ± contributed to the increase of IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. HepaRG cells modulated T cell polarization by increasing Th1 cell transcription factor expression and by reducing CD3+ CD4+ IL-17+ cell frequency when PBMCs were activated with PHA. At a later stage, the presence of HepaRG cells inhibited PHA-induced HLA-DR expression on PBMCs, and PBMC proliferation. In contrast, the presence of skin fibroblasts had no effect of PBMC proliferation induced by PHA. After a first pro-inflammatory phase, PBMC-HepaRG cell interactions may down-regulate the immune response. The PBMC-hepatocyte interactions can thus participate first to the initiation of hepatitis and later to the maintenance of immune tolerance in liver, possibly contributing to chronicity.
