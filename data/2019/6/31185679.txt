Photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a non-aggressive therapy with fewer side effects has unique advantages over traditional treatments. However, PDT still has certain limitations in clinical applications, mainly because most photosensitizers utilized in PDT are hydrophobic compounds, which will self-aggregate in the aqueous phase and cause undesirable effects. In order to resolve this, we utilized the self-polymerization of dopamine molecules under alkaline conditions to coat cerium oxide nanorods (CeONR) with a dense polydopamine (PDA) film. Thereafter, thiolated galactose (Gal-SH) and hypericin (Hyp) were modified and loaded onto the surface to construct CeONR@PDA-Gal/Hyp, respectively, which can be used for targeted photodynamic therapy of human hepatoma HepG2 cells. CeONR@PDA-Gal/Hyp was characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), Zeta potential, Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. This hypericin delivery system possesses good biocompatibility and specific targeting ability, where the galactose units on the surface of CeONR@PDA-Gal/Hyp can specifically recognize the asialo-glycoprotein receptors (ASGP-R), which overexpress on HepG2 cell membrane. Furthermore, Hyp will detach from the surface of CeONR@PDA-Gal/Hyp after the nanorods enter cancer cells, and shows excellent PDT effect under the irradiation of light with a wavelength of 590 nm. Our work exemplifies a novel targeted delivery of hydrophobic photosensitizers for cancer treatment.
