One possible hypothesis for pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma is deregulated expressed adipokines (adipose tissue cytokines). Chronic inflammation in the cirrhotic liver adipose tissue is associated with a modification in adipokine secretion. Changes in serum levels of adiponectin are known to be associated with the development of insulin resistance. Increased insulin resistance is a pathophysiological feature of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease. In addition, it was suggested that liver cancer development is probably connected with insulin resistance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the significance of serum Adiponectin level and insulin resistance in patients with chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patient and Methods: 100 patients were enrolled in this cross sectional study and divided as following: Group I: 52 HCV patients with chronic liver disease (CLD).Group II: 48 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For all subjects, Serum Adiponectin and Insulin Resistance parameters (Fasting serum Insulin, Fasting serum Glucose, HOMA IR) were measured. Results: Serum Adiponectin was significantly lower in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (p=0.000 ) and it is inversely correlated to tumor size and the number (p= 0.0001).Meanwhile, Insulin Resistance parameters (Fasting s. Insulin, Fasting s. Glucose, HOMA IR) were significantly higher in HCC patients than CLD patients (p= 0.0001). Conclusion: Insulin Resistance is significantly associated with the development of HCC. Serum level of Adiponectin may guard against HCC development among patients with chronic liver disease.
