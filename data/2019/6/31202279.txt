Background:Human microRNAs (miRNAs) have diverse functions in biology, and play a role in nearly every biological process. Here we report that miR-520d-5p (520d-5p) causes undifferentiated cancer cells to adopt benign or normal status in vivo in immunodeficient mice via demethylation and P53 upregulation. Further we found that 520-5p causes normal cells to elongate cellular lifetime and mesenchymal stem cell-like status with CD105 positivity. We hypothesized that ectopic 520d-5p expression reduced mutations in undifferentiated type of hepatoma (HLF) cells through synergistic modulation of methylation-related enzymatic expression.Methods:To examine whether there were any changes in mutation status in cells treated with 520d-5p, we performed next generation sequencing (NGS) in HLF cells and human iPSC-derivative cells in pre-mesenchymal stem cell status. We analyzed the data using both genome-wide and individual gene function approaches.Results:520d-5p induced a shift towards a wild type or non-malignant phenotype, which was regulated by nucleotide mutations in both HLF cells and iPSCs. Further, 520d-5p reduced mutation levels in both the whole genome and genomic fragment assemblies.Conclusions:Cancer cell genomic mutations cannot be repaired in most contexts. However, these findings suggest that applied development of 520d-5p would allow new approaches to cancer research and improve the quality of iPSCs used in regenerative medicine.
