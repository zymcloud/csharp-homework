Aims:Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) prolongs survival in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, but limited data exist on its use in patients with hepatic impairment. This Phase I, open-label, nonrandomized study investigated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of FTD/TPI in patients with advanced solid tumours (except breast cancer) and varying degrees of hepatic impairment, to provide dosing recommendations.Methods:Patients aged ≥18 years with advanced solid tumours and normal hepatic function, or mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment according to National Cancer Institute criteria, were planned to be enrolled. Patients received FTD/TPI 35 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 of each 28-day cycle.Results:Twenty-four patients were enrolled to the normal hepatic function (n = 8) and mild (n = 10) and moderate (n = 6) hepatic impairment cohorts. Overall, 12 patients (50.0%) had at least 1 adverse event leading to study discontinuation. In the moderate hepatic impairment cohort, 5 of 6 patients experienced grade ≥ 3 elevation in bilirubin. No patients with severe hepatic impairment were enrolled. FTD area under the curve at steady state decreased by 18% and 22% in the mild and moderate cohorts, respectively; however, no clear change was observed in TPI area under the curve.Conclusions:FTD/TPI can be safely administered in patients with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic impairment, with no initial dose adjustment. FTD/TPI is not recommended for use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment because of findings of grade 3 or 4 increased blood bilirubin. Therefore, FTD/TPI is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
