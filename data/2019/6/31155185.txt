Objectives:Refractory ascites after liver transplant commonly occurs in living donor liver transplant (LDLT). Refractory ascites is associated with postoperative complications and poor prognosis. This study sought to determine the risk factors of refractory ascites and discuss their perioperative management.Methods:A retrospective study of 122 living donor liver transplant recipients between 2008 and 2017 was performed to analyze the risk factors, incidence, and characteristics of refractory ascites. Refractory ascites post LDLT was defined as the production of ascites fluid >1000 mL/d on postoperative day 14 or required repeated drainage.Results:A total of 24 patients (19.6%) developed refractory ascites. The 1-year survival rate was significantly worse in the refractory ascites group compared with the nonrefractory ascites group (P Conclusion:Refractory ascites is associated with reduced 1-year survival and increased postoperative complications. Four factors including MELD score ≥20, donor age 50 years or older, presence of left graft, and ascites at laparotomy ≥350 mL were independent predictors for refractory ascites.
