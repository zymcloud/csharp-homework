Transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein 4 (TFAP4) is established as a regulator of human cancer genesis and progression. Overexpression of TFAP4 indicates poor prognosis in various malignancies. The current study was performed to quantify TFAP4 expression as well as to further determine its potential prognostic value and functional role in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We identified that the expression of TFAP4 mRNA in 369 tumor tissues was higher than that in 160 normal liver tissues. Upregulated TFAP4 expressions were discovered in HCC cell lines compared to the healthy liver cell line, and similarly, the levels of TFAP4 were higher in tumor tissues than its expression in paratumor tissues. High mRNA and protein expression of TFAP4 was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, TFAP4 expression emerged as a risk factor independently affecting both OS and DFS of HCC patients. Functional studies demonstrated that TFAP4 increased HCC cell migration and invasion. Further investigations found that TFAP4 promotes invasion and metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and regulating MMP-9 expression via activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in HCC. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that TFAP4 is a valuable prognostic biomarker in determining the likelihood of tumor metastasis and recurrence, as well as the long-term survival rates of HCC patients. Exploring the regulatory mechanism of TFAP4 will also contribute to the development of new prevention and treatment strategies for HCC.
