Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent cancers, and to date, there have been very few drugs available that can improve survival, the most well-known being sorafenib. The pathogenesis of HCC is complex, involving multiple processes including abnormal cell and tissue regeneration, angiogenesis, genomic instability, cellular proliferation, and signaling pathway alterations. Capsaicin is a substance that holds increasingly high interest and is studied as a therapeutic option in a wide array of diseases. Several studies have investigated capsaicin roles in various stages of HCC oncogenesis. This paper aims to thoroughly detail the available information on the individual effects of capsaicin on the cellular mechanisms and pathways involved in HCC development, as well as investigate their possible cooperation and interferences. The synergistic antitumor effects of capsaicin and sorafenib are also addressed.
