Since sorafenib has been first-line molecular-targeted drug for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), clinical studies in the last 10 years failed to confirm that a new molecular-targeted drug or immune checkpoint inhibitor was superior or non-inferior to sorafenib, or approved second-line treatment for patients with the failure of sorafenib. However, many clinical studies published in 2017 have changed people's previous understanding. REFLECT trial showed that as the first-line treatment of advanced HCC, lenvatinib was non-inferior than sorafenib. In addition, RESORCE trial and CheckMate-040 trial confirmed respectively that regorafenib and PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab were options of second-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC after sorafenib treatment. The development of these drugs will bring a new prospect for advanced HCC patients.
