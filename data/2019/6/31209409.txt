Objective:To explore the expression and clinical significance of chemokine CXCL10 and CXCR3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expression and prognostic of CXCL10 and CXCR3 in HCC tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues were analyzed in two different publicly available databases the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Liver Cancer Institute (LCI). In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the mRNA expression of CXCL10 and CXCR3 in 45 HCC clinical samples with HBV infection background. Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correlation were used to determine the correlation between the expression level of CXCL10 and CXCR3 in tumor and non-tumor tissues.Results:In TCGA database, the expression of CXCL10 in HCC tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in non-tumor tissues (nonpaired samples: 3.379±2.081 vs. 2.213±2.274, PConclusion:Expression of CXCL10 was up-regulated in HCC tissues, expression of CXCR3 was down-regulated in HBV-related HCC tissues, and the higher expression of both genes was correlated with better overall survival in HCC patients.
