Integration of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA into host's genome is evident in all stages and models of HBV infection. Investigations of the initial virus-host junctions have been just recently initiated since their nature may promote liver oncogenesis immediately following infection. We examined the time-frame and host sites at which HBV integrates in HepG2 cells overexpressing sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) receptor mediating HBV entry. HepG2-NTCP cells were analyzed from 15 min to 13 days post-infection (p.i.). The results showed that except for 15 min p.i., HBV-host integrations were detected at all time points thereafter. At 30 min p.i., virus junctions with retrotransposon SINE and with neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 1 gene were detected. At one-hour p.i., HBV integration with retrotransposon THE-1B-LTR was identified, while virus insertions into proline-rich protein and protein kinase cGMP-dependent type 1 encoding genes were found at 3 h p.i. Fusion with runt-related transcription factor 1 was detected at 24 h p.i. and merges with 9 different genes at 13 day p.i. The data showed that retrotransposon elements are frequent among first-hit sites of HBV insertion. This may suggest a mechanism by which HBV DNA may spread across host's genome from earliest stages of infection.
