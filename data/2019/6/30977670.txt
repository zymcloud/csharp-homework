Background: Production of effective, low-cost, and efficient radiopharmaceuticals is an important task and requires further research and clinical studies. In this clinical trial, safety and efficacy of 177Lu/153Sm-ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMP) cocktail has been evaluated for pain relief of bone metastases. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five patients with the mean age of 55.5 Â± 15.8 years participated in this study. Patients received a total dose of 37 MBq/kg. Pain and performance assessments were followed using a Brief Pain Inventory form. Complete blood count and renal and liver function tests were also performed up to 12 weeks postadministration. Results: Eighteen patients (72%) demonstrated complete pain relief (relief = 100%) and approximately all patients (96%) experienced significant improvement in their quality of life. No grade IV hematological toxicity was observed during the 12-week follow-up period, and grade III toxicity was seen in 1 patient only. In addition, no abnormalities were seen in renal and liver function during the follow-up period. Conclusions: There were no considerable complications after administration of 177Lu/153Sm EDTMP; this cocktail seems to be a safe and effective treatment for bone pain palliation in patients with skeletal metastases and improves the quality of life.
