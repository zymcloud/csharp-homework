The patient was a 69-year-old woman.Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a protruding tumor in the mid-thoracic esophagus, and biopsy revealed small cell carcinoma in November 2012. Four courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising CDDP and CPT-11 were administered, and radical resection was performed in March 2013.I n March 2014, chest computed tomography revealed the recurrence of mediastinal lymph nodes; thus, we administered chemoradiotherapy comprising 5- FU and CDDP, and the size of the recurrent tumors decreased.However, in February 2015, positron emission tomographycomputed tomography revealed liver metastases.Therefore, we switched to a new chemotherapy regimen containing CDDP and VP-16.Although the treatment was very effective and the liver metastases significantly decreased in size, it was discontinued after 9 courses owing to neurotoxicity.Next, 7 courses of chemotherapy comprising amrubicin, which is administered for treating small cell lung carcinoma, were administered, which suppressed tumor growth for approximately 8 months.However, the tumor then re-grew.Chemotherapy comprising S-1 was administered; however, the tumor gradually progressed.The patient died 51 months after the initial treatment.
