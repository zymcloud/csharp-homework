Background:Liver stiffness increases after the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transient elastography for liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using fibroscan is a simple noninvasive method of proven efficacy. This study aims to assess the changes in LSM following HCC treatment.Patients and methods:This study included 150 patients with hepatitis C virus related HCC attending the multidisciplinary HCC clinic, Kasr Al-Ainy Hospital between March 2014 and October 2015 who underwent either transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or microwave ablation (MWA). Baseline LSM was carried out 3 and 6 months after treatment. The response rate was calculated according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria; overall survival and LSM changes were then compared between the two procedures.Results:MWA showed higher rates of complete ablation (77.4%) than did TACE (31.7%) (P=0.004). Increase in LSM 3 and 6 months after treatment was statistically significant in the TACE group (PConclusion:The increase in LSM is significant after TACE than after MWA. Moreover, lower pre-ablation LSM is a predictor of complete ablation.
