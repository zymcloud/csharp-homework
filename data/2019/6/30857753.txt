Background:Whether the weaning outcome of solid cancer patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is comparable to that in non-cancer patients is unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the weaning outcomes between non-cancer patients and patients with different types of cancer.Methods:We studied patients requiring MV during ICU stay for medical reasons between 2012 and 2014. Cancer patients were grouped into those with lung cancer (LC), head and neck cancer (HNC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and other cancers (OC). The primary endpoint was successful weaning at day 90 after the initiation of MV, and the main secondary endpoints were 28-day and 90-day mortality after ICU admission.Results:Five hundred and eighteen patients with solid cancers and 1362 non-cancer patients were recruited. The rate of successful weaning at day 90 was 57.9% in cancer patients, which was lower than 68.9% in non-cancer patients (p Conclusion:Among mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU, those with LC were associated with a lower probability of weaning at day 90 compared to non-cancer patients.
