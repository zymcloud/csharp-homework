Background:We investigated the relationship between hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related pathogenesis and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin-21 (IL-21)-JAK-STAT signaling pathway genes.Methods:We used the high-resolution melting (HRM) method to genotype five SNPs (IL-21 rs2221903, IL-21 rs4833837, IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) rs2285452, JAK3 rs3008, and STAT3 rs1053023) in 546 HBV-infected patients and 353 healthy Chinese subjects. The HBV-infected patients were further divided into subgroups based on the HBV-related pathologies: chronic hepatitis B (CHB), HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC), and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele distributions of the five SNPs between the HBV-infected patients and healthy subjects. The genotype and allele frequencies were similar in the two groups for IL-21 rs2221903 (A>G, P = 0.83 and 0.67), rs4833837 (A>G, P = 0.80 and 0.49), IL-21R rs2285452 (G>A, P = 0.25 and 0.68), STAT3 rs1053023 (A>G, P = 1.00 and 0.96), and JAK3 rs3008 (C>T, P = 0.32 and 0.54). However, patients with the IL-21R rs2285452 AA genotype were more susceptible to HBV-related HCC than those with the IL-21R rs2285452 GA/GG genotype (P = 0.03, OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.16-9.20). The serological marker model of "HBsAg+, HBeAg+, HBcAb+" was predominant among patients with HBV infection. However, there was no association between the genotype's distribution of the five SNPs and the serological marker models (P > 0.05).Conclusions:These findings demonstrate that the IL-21R rs2285452 AA genotype increases the risk of HBV-related HCC in Chinese patients.
