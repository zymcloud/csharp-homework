Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) participates in diverse cancer-associated signaling pathways, playing an oncogenic role in multiple human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our recent works clarify that Pin1 modulates miRNAs biogenesis by interacting with ERK-phosphorylated exportin-5 (XPO5) and changing XPO5 conformation, giving a potential target for HCC treatment. Herein, we discover 4,6-bis(benzyloxy)-3-phenylbenzofuran (TAB29) as a novel Pin1 inhibitor that targets Pin1 PPIase domain. TAB29 potently inhibits Pin1 activity with the IC50 value of 874 nM and displays an excellent selectivity toward Pin1 in vitro. Cell-based biological evaluation reveals that TAB29 significantly suppresses cell proliferation of HCC cells through restoring the nucleus-to-cytoplasm export of XPO5 and upregulating mature miRNAs expression. Collectively, this work provides a promising small molecule lead compound for Pin1 inhibition, highlighting the therapeutic potential of miRNA-based treatment for human cancers.
