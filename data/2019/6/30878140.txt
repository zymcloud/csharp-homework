Background:Microvascular invasion is the strongest prognostic factor of survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We therefore developed a predictive model for microvascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma to help guide treatment strategies in patients scheduled for either hepatic resection or liver transplantation.Methods:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatic resection or liver transplantation from 1994 to 2016 were divided into training and validation cohorts. A predictive model for microvascular invasion was developed based on microvascular invasion risk factors in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort.Results:A total of 910 patients (425 having received hepatic resection, 485 having received liver transplantation) were included in the training (n = 637) and validation (n = 273) cohorts. Multivariate analysis identified α-fetoprotein ≥100 ng/mL (relative risk 3.05, P Conclusion:This model developed from preoperative data allows reliable prediction of microvascular invasion in candidates for either hepatic resection or liver transplantation.
