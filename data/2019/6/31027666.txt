Hepatitis B and C are complex and dynamic viral infections. An infected individual spreads the viruses to an uninfected individual in contaminated blood and body fluids. Acute hepatitis B and C infections may or may not produce mild symptoms and spontaneously resolve. Some individuals will progress to chronic hepatitis B and C, which can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and possibly death. Choosing medications available to treat chronic hepatitis B and C is based on individual serology results, including genotype and level of liver damage. Treatment has been successful in inducing remission and complete recovery in many individuals.
