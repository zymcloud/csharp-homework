HDGF-related protein 3 (HRP3, also known as HDGFL3) belongs to the family of HDGF-related proteins (HRPs) and plays an essential role in hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis. All HRPs have a PWWP domain at the N-terminus that binds both histone and DNA substrates. Despite previous advances in PWWP domains, the molecular basis by which HRP3 interacts with chromatin is unclear. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of the HRP3 PWWP domain in complex with various double-stranded DNAs with/without bound histone peptides. We found that HRP3 PWWP bound to the phosphate backbone of the DNA minor groove and showed a preference for DNA molecules bearing a narrow minor groove width. In addition, HRP3 PWWP preferentially bound to histone peptides bearing the H3K36me3/2 modification. HRP3 PWWP uses two adjacent surfaces to bind both DNA and histone substrates simultaneously, enabling us to generate a model illustrating the recruitment of PWWP to H3K36me3-containing nucleosomes. Cell-based analysis indicated that both DNA and histone binding by the HRP3 PWWP domain is important for HRP3 recruitment to chromatin in vivo. Our work establishes that HRP3 PWWP is a new family of minor groove-specific DNA-binding proteins, which improves our understanding of HRP3 and other PWWP domain-containing proteins.
