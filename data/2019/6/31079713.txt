Y90 radioembolization is an alternative to transarterial chemoembolization for the intra-arterial treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the optimal treatment of HCC varies by tumor stage, underlying liver function and functional status, and local expertise. Therefore, the appropriate selection of patients for Y90 radioembolization is of paramount importance for optimal outcomes. Data on the role of Y90 radioembolization for HCC are most robust in the palliative treatment of inoperable, liver-confined disease. However, data are also present on the role of Y90 radioembolization as a bridge to or to downstage patients for transplant. Outcomes for radiation segmentectomy (ablative radiation doses) with curative intent or prior to resection are also discussed.
