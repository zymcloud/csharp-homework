Background:There is no data regarding prognostic impact of interleukin (IL)-26 on outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of IL-26 on HCC patients undergoing liver resection.Methods:From 2003 to 2008, 122 patients with HCC who received surgical curative resection were enrolled. Patients were stratified into IL-26-upper and -lower groups according to the median expression level from immunohistochemical staining of resected specimens. Prognostic impact of IL-26 was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate time-dependent prognostic impact and independency of IL-26. Demographic and clinical factors that were associated with IL-26 were comprehensively identified.Results:Prognosis of the patients with high level of IL-26 revealed to be significantly unfavorable in both cumulative recurrence-free survival (P Conclusions:IL-26 is a novel prognostic factor for HCC after resection. Evaluation of IL-26 expression may be potentially valuable in clinical therapy when planning individualized follow-up schedule and evaluating candidates for prophylactic adjuvant treatment to prevent recurrence.
