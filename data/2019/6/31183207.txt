Background:Clinicopathological features and the outcomes of patients with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) are not clearly defined.Methods:Data were collected by retrospective chart review on 42 patients with FLHCC treated between 1990 and 2017 at Mayo Clinic.Results:Of 42 patients (median age at diagnosis 22 years), 10 patients (23.8%) had stage I disease and 32 patients (76.2%) had stage II to IVB disease. All 10 patients with stage I disease and 21 of 32 patients with stage II-IVB disease underwent resection at presentation. In stage I patient group, 6 patients experienced recurrence with a median time to recurrence of 30.5 months and a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 86%. Patients with stage II to IVB disease who underwent resection (n=21) upfront had a median OS of 32.5 months and 5-year OS of 44%. In the upfront surgery group, 71% of patients experienced recurrence. The median OS of patients with unresectable disease (n=11) was 10 months. Four out of nine patients treated with sorafenib had stable disease and one patient with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expressing tumor had a near complete response after 2 months of therapy with nivolumab.Conclusions:In FLHCC, surgical resection was associated with prolonged OS; although most patients had a disease recurrence regardless of disease stage and resection margin status. The response to kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, was variable. In select cases, therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor may provide a viable treatment option.
