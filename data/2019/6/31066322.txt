Introduction:Primary renal lymphoma is a rare malignant lymphoma that is difficult to differentiate from renal cell carcinoma. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography and image-guided percutaneous biopsy are valuable tools for diagnosis.Case report:A 64-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of repeated right waist pain and a 1-month history of nausea, vomiting, and frequent and urgent urination. A computed tomography scan showed a huge mass that was initially considered to be renal cell carcinoma at the upper pole of the right kidney. The mass had invaded the renal pelvis, narrowed the right renal artery, and constricted the inferior vena cava and liver. Postoperative examination of the tumor confirmed lymphoma. We herein present this case and its multidisciplinary team management.Conclusion:Multidisciplinary team management is efficient for preoperative assessment and surgery in difficult and high-risk cases. Based on our literature review, we suggest biopsy before chemotherapy whenever possible. Chemotherapy can be implemented after surgery for better survival outcomes.
