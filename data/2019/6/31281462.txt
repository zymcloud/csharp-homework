With development of surgical technology, we aimed to investigate whether resection could challenge the standard treatment, ablation, in treating multifocal hepatocellular carcinomas meeting the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer A stage. From January 2005 to January 2017, the oncological outcomes of patients undergoing resection (n = 72) or ablation (n = 63) were retrospectively analysed using propensity score matching. At baseline, patients in the ablation group had more tri-focal lesions (30.2% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.001) and smaller tumours (2.00 cm vs. 2.50 cm, P = 0.002) than resection group. After matching, the baseline was well-balanced between treatments (n = 46 pairs); resection provided comparable 5-year overall survival (77.0% vs. 83.6, P = 0.790) and superior 5-year recurrence-free survival (40.4% vs. 16.9%, P = 0.022) to ablation. The multivariate Cox model confirmed that ablation was not associated with worse overall survival (HR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.33 - 2.42, P = 0.819), but identified ablation as an unfavourable predictor of recurrence-free survival (HR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.27 - 3.57, P
