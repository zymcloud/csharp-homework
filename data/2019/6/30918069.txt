Lithocholic acid (LCA) is a bile acid associated with adverse effects, including cholestasis, and it exists in vivo mainly as conjugates known as glyco-LCA (GLCA) and tauro-LCA (TLCA). Tamoxifen has been linked to the development of cholestasis, and it inhibits sulfotransferase 2A1 (SULT2A1)-catalyzed dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfonation. The present study was done to characterize the sulfonation of LCA, GLCA, and TLCA and to investigate whether triphenylethylene (clomifene, tamoxifen, toremifene, ospemifene, droloxifene), benzothiophene (raloxifene, arzoxifene), tetrahydronaphthalene (lasofoxifene, nafoxidine), indole (bazedoxifene), and benzopyran (acolbifene) classes of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) inhibit LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation. Human recombinant SULT2A1, but not SULT2B1b or SULT1E1, catalyzed LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation, whereas each of these enzymes catalyzed DHEA sulfonation. LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation is catalyzed by human liver cytosol, and SULT2A1 followed the substrate inhibition model with comparable apparent K m values (≤1 µM). Each of the SERMs inhibited LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation with varying potency and mode of enzyme inhibition. The potency and extent of inhibition of LCA sulfonation were attenuated or increased by structural modifications to toremifene, bazedoxifene, and lasofoxifene. The inhibitory effect of raloxifene, bazedoxifene, and acolbifene on LCA sulfonation was also observed in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Overall, among the SERMs investigated, bazedoxifene and raloxifene were the most effective inhibitors of LCA, GLCA, and TLCA sulfonation. These findings provide insight into the structural features of specific SERMs that contribute to their inhibition of SULT2A1-catalyzed LCA sulfonation. Inhibition of LCA, GLCA, and TLCA detoxification by a SERM may provide a biochemical basis for adverse effects associated with a SERM.
