Rationale:Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease originating from abnormal proliferation of B or T lymphocytes in bone marrow (BM). Invasion of the pancreas is extremely rare in adults.Patient concerns:In this article, we report a case presenting that ALL invades the pancreas, as well as liver, kidney, and duodenum detected by magnetic resonance image. The patient was misdiagnosed as pancreatic tumor at initial since hemogram was unremarkable.Diagnoses:The diagnosis of ALL was established based on the endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration and bone marrow examination, showing BCR/ABL gene positive.Interventions:The patient was actively treated with chemotherapy. Hematological remission was obtained and the lesions in the pancreas disappeared.Outcomes:The patient finally died of complication from fungal pneumonia and central nervous system involvement 12 months after diagnosis.Lessons:Under the context of infection, persistent or intermittent fever and complete blood count are not significant prognoses of pancreatic involvement for adult with ALL. We hope that this case will help hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeon to be aware of this kind of disease as pancreatic carcinoma and pancreas involvement by ALL have totally different treatment strategy.
