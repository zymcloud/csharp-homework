MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of gene expression regulators that participate in the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although the underlying mechanism by which they function in HCC has not been fully elucidated. Here, small RNA deep sequencing was used to identify aberrantly expressed miRNAs in HCC tissues, and a novel miRNA named miR-HCC2 was identified. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that miR-HCC2 displayed higher expression in HCC tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues. We documented that miR-HCC2 facilitated the growth, migration and invasion of HCC cells by accelerating cell cycle progression, incressing the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated marker vimentin but decreasing the expression of E-cadherin. MiR-HCC2 directly targeted the 3' UTR of BAMBI and ELMO1 and up-regulated their expression. Both BAMBI and ELMO1 had the same patterns of expression with miR-HCC2 in HCC tissues. Additionally, blocking BAMBI or ELMO1 counteracted the phenotypic alterations elicited by miR-HCC2. Collectively, our investigation identified miR-HCC2 as a new positive modulator of HCC aggressiveness that may serve as a potential biomarker for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for HCC.
