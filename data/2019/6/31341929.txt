Background:Trends in the epidemiology of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) among routine clinical care patients in the United States are not well documented. We used data from the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study to investigate changes in prevalence and newly recorded cases of CHB from 2006 to 2015.Methods:Annual percentage changes (APCs) were estimated using join point Poisson regression. Analyses were adjusted by study site; when an interaction with the trend was observed, APCs were estimated by subgroups. Differences in rates based on race, age, and sex were calculated with rate ratios.Results:We identified 5492 patients with CHB within select health systems with total populations that ranged from 1.9 to 2.4 million persons. From 2006 to 2014, the prevalence of diagnosed CHB increased from 181.3 to 253.0 per 100 000 persons in the health system population; from 2014 to 2015, it declined to 237.0 per 100 000 persons. APC was +3.7%/y through 131 December 2014 (P < .001) and -15.0%/y (P < .001) thereafter. The rate of newly reported cases of CHB did not change significantly across the study period (APC, -1.1%/y; P = .07). The rates of newly reported cases were 20.5 times higher among patients in the Asian American/American Indian/Pacific Islander (ASINPI) category, compared with white patients, and 2.8 times higher among African American patients. The ratio of male to female patients was roughly 3:2.Conclusions:The prevalence of diagnosed CHB in this US patient population increased from 2006 to 2014, after which it decreased significantly. Rates declined most rapidly among patients â‰¤40 or 61-70 years old, as well as among ASINPI patients. The rate of newly reported cases remained steady over the study period.
