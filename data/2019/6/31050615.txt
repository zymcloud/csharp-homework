Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. It is currently one of the leading indications for liver transplant, with selected 5-year survival rates after liver transplant of about 70%. Despite excellent results of liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma, a number of patients develop metastases after transplant, and multifocal metastatic disease is the most frequent cause of death. In a large autopsy series of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, adrenal glands were the third most common site of extrahepatic metastasis after lungs and bones. However, isolated metastatic disease in the adrenal glands is rare, and isolated metachronous bilateral metastasis is an even rarer occurrence. Only few reports have been published of metachronous bilateral metastasis of hepatocellular carinoma after liver transplant treated with bilateral adrenalectomy. We describe a case of a 56-year-old man who underwent liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma in a cirrhotic liver. Two years after liver tranplant, regular follow-up revealed metastatic disease in the left adrenal gland. Preoperative imaging showed no other metastasis, and he underwent an uneventful left adrenalectomy. A year after surgery, he presented with right flank pain and tenderness. Imaging showed hemorrhage and tumor involvement of the right adrenal gland, and he underwent right adrenalectomy. Two years after surgery, he is alive and well with no signs of disease recurrence. Apparently, in the absence of intrahepatic or other metastases, bilateral metachronous recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver tranplant can be a good surgical indication with acceptable long-term survival.
