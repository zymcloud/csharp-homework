Liver resection is the mainstay of treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Most of HCC patients are associated with varied degrees of liver cirrhosis.Severity of liver cirrhosis adversely affects the outcomes of liver resection, and also plays a vital role in making an appropriate surgical strategy for HCC.In current surgical practice for HCC, liver function and functional reserve are the focus of preoperative evaluation. Liver cirrhosis is still widely regarded as an one-stage entity. The pathological severity of liver cirrhosis is largely ignored. As neither liver function nor functional reserve can reflect the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis when liver function is at the stage of compensation. Preoperative evaluation on the severity of cirrhosis has not been established in a surgical setting.Thus, there is an urgent need to stage the severity of cirrhosis in surgical practice in order to make more precise surgical modalities for individual patients.This article mainly introduces the ongoing research progress in staging the severity of liver cirrhosis while treating HCC at Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and emphasizes the importance of staging the severity of cirrhosis in surgical treatment of HCC.
