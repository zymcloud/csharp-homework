Accumulating evidence has indicated crucial roles for pseudogenes in human cancers. However, the roles played by pseudogenes in the pathogenesis of HCC, particularly HCC early recurrence, still incompletely elucidated. Herein, we identify a novel early recurrence related pseudogene RACGAP1P which was significantly upregulated in HCC and was associated with larger tumour size, advanced clinical stage, abnormal AFP level and shorter survival time. In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that RACGAP1P is a prerequisite for the development of malignant characteristics of HCC cells, including cell growth and migration. Mechanistic investigations indicated that RACGAP1P elicits its oncogenic activity as a ceRNA to sequestrate miR-15-5p from its endogenous target RACGAP1, thereby leading to the upregulation of RACGAP1 and the activation of RhoA/ERK signalling. These results may provide new insights into the functional crosstalk of the pseudogene/miRNA/parent-gene genetic network during HCC early relapse and may contribute to improving the clinical intervention for this subset of HCC patients.
