Rationale and objectives:To assess the association between baseline CT-based volumetric parameters and biochemical hepatic evaluations, such as, Child-Pugh, MELD score, and modified MELD-Na score, on the prediction of outcomes of patients with HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:A retrospective of a prospectively maintained database, single arm, and single center study was performed including 41 patients with diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with TACE. Study endpoints included liver dysfunction (new events of ascites, encephalopathy, and/or death) and overall survival rate. Multi-phase CT-based volumetric analysis was performed to calculate total liver volume and tumor volume using portal and late arterial phases, respectively. Residual volume was calculated subtracting the tumor volume minus the total liver volume. Child-Pugh, MELD score, and MELD-Na score were measured during the baseline evaluation.Results:At a median follow-up time of 8 months (IQR, 5-14), 16 patients (39%) were diagnosed with hepatic dysfunction. In patients with hepatic dysfunction, the median residual hepatic volume was 1002.1 cc (IQR, 633-1077.1 cc) compared to patients with normal liver function post-TACE with a median residual volume of 1233 cc (IQR, 1018.7-1437.6 cc) (p = 0.02). Survival analysis demonstrated an overall survival rate of 95%, 90%, 85% at 30 days, 12 months, and 24 months, respectively. The overall survival rate in patients with Child-Pugh A was 100%, 97%, and 97% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively; compared to patients with Child Pugh B with an overall survival of rate of 86%, 78%, and 78% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively (p = 0.07). Median baseline MELD-Na score was higher in patients that died during the study period compared to patients that survived (6.7 [IQR, 5-14.2] versus 4.1 [IQR, 2.14-6.85]) (p = 0.09).Conclusion:Low baseline CT-based residual volume is associated with the occurrence of hepatic dysfunction at a median time of 8 months. Baseline Child-Pugh A patients were found to have higher survival rate than Child-Pugh B. Interestingly, higher baseline MELD-Na score was associated with mortality.
