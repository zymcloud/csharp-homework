As the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes up to one million deaths annually. Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are becoming the two major risk factors because both may develop liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) if left untreated. However, compared with 3-10% of patients with ASH may progress to HCC annually, about only 0.5% NASH patients may progress to HCC annually. The present study is to clarify the protein expression differences of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) between ASH and NASH. In liver biopsied specimens from NASH and ASH patients, using an immunofluorescence method and morphometrically quantitating the fluorescence intensity, we studied the protein expression within hepatocytes cytoplasm of candidate TSGs including RUNX3, GSTP1, and RASSF1A. Compared with the control group of patients, the expression levels of all three proteins were upregulated in the ASH group of patients (p
