The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has evolved over the past few decades with the advancement of technology and improved imaging. Radiotherapy can offer high local control rates in unresectable HCC, including cases with major vascular involvement, and can provide a modality to help bridge patients to potentially curative resection or transplantation. In metastatic cases, radiotherapy can provide good palliation. This review focuses on the common radiotherapy treatment modalities used for HCC, provides outcome comparisons of these radiotherapy techniques to outcomes with other treatment modalities for HCC, and highlights the discrepancy of the role of radiotherapy in HCC amongst the current available treatment guidelines.
