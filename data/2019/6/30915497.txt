Purpose:This study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the anti-CD27L antibody-drug conjugate AMG 172 in patients with relapsed/refractory clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).Methods:This was an open-label, adaptive dose-exploration study in patients with relapsed/refractory ccRCC. The study was conducted in two parts for dose exploration and dose expansion on a biweekly dosing schedule. AMG 172 doses of 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.4 mg/kg were studied in the dose-exploration phase.Results:The 1.6 mg/kg dose of AMG 172 was identified as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The most common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (59%), nausea (54%), decreased appetite (49%), vomiting (46%), and fatigue (35%). The most common dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia and liver injury constituted DLTs that required discontinuation of treatment. Of the 10 patients treated at the MTD in part 2 of the study, 2 patients had grade 3 hepatocellular injury with aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase elevation. Pharmacokinetic profiles indicated low levels of circulating unconjugated antibody and unconjugated cytotoxin. Dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure were observed over the dose range of 0.3-2.4 mg/kg. Following multiple biweekly doses, plasma accumulation was less than two-fold. Two patients (5.4%) had a partial response, 6 patients (16.2%) had stable disease, and 13 patients (35.1%) had progressive disease.Conclusion:AMG 172 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in patients with relapsed/refractory ccRCC and showed evidence suggestive of limited antitumor activity. Safety and tolerability were as expected for a maytansinoid antibody-drug conjugate.
