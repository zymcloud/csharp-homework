Extensive evidence indicate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulates the tumorigenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the expression and biological function of lncRNA A1BG antisense RNA 1 (A1BG-AS1) were poorly known in HCC. Here, we found the underexpression of A1BG-AS1 in HCC via analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Further analyses confirmed that A1BG-AS1 expression in HCC was markedly lower than that in noncancerous tissues based on our HCC cohort. Clinical association analysis revealed that low A1BG-AS1 expression correlated with poor prognostic features, such as microvascular invasion, high tumor grade, and advanced tumor stage. Follow-up data indicated that low A1BG-AS1 level evidently correlated with poor clinical outcomes of HCC patients. Moreover, forced expression of A1BG-AS1 repressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Conversely, A1BG-AS1 knockdown promoted these malignant behaviors in HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, A1BG-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA by directly sponging miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Notably, miR-216a-5p restoration rescued A1BG-AS1 attenuated proliferation, migration and invasion of HCCLM3 cells. A1BG-AS1 positively regulated the levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog and SMAD family member 7, which were reduced by miR-216a-5p in HCC cells. Altogether, we conclude that A1BG-AS1 exerts a tumor suppressive role in HCC progression.
