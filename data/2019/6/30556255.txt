LnRNA-NEF has characterized functionality only in liver cancer. In the present study, we observed that plasma lnRNA-NEF was downregulated, while plasma transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) was upregulated in patients with early-stage prostate carcinoma (PC) than in healthy controls. The levels of plasma lnRNA-NEF and plasma TGF-β1 were inversely correlated in patients with PC but not in healthy controls. After surgical resection, the follow-up was performed for 5 years. It was observed that lnRNA-NEF was further decreased in patients with distant recurrence (DR), but not in patients with local recurrence and nonrecurrence. lnRNA-NEF overexpression caused inhibited TGF-β1 expression in cells of PC cell lines, while TGF-β1 overexpression failed to affect lnRNA-NEF expression. LnRNA-NEF overexpression inhibited, while the TGF-β1 overexpression promoted the migration and invasion of cells of PC cell lines. TGF-β1 overexpression partially rescued the inhibited migration and invasion of cells of PC cell lines caused by the lnRNA-NEF overexpression. Therefore, the downregulation of lnRNA-NEF may contribute to the postoperative DR in patients with PC through the interactions with TGF-β1.
