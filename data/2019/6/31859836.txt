Eighty percent of hepatocarcinomas are inoperable at the moment of diagnosis. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice in these cases, but local therapies are another alternative. Among these, Image-Guided BrachyAblation is a safe choice. We report a 76-year-old male with a hepatocarcinoma, who was considered inoperable due to the high surgical risk of the patient. A local treatment with Image-Guided BrachyAblation was decided. A brachytherapy needle was placed in the tumor under computed tomography guidance and a 15 Gy single dose was delivered from an Iridium-192 source. The patient had no immediate complications and at one month of follow up he continued without incidents.
