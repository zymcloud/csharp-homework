MicroRNA-500 (miR-500) is a potential prognostic biomarker in a number of different types of cancer, such as prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study aimed to explore the clinical implications of miR-500 expression status in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that had received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). miR-500 expression status and clinical data were obtained from 74 patients with AML in the The Cancer Genome Atlas database receiving allo-HSCT. Patients with low expression level of miR-500 (miR-500low) were significantly more likely to present with a French-American-British classification M2 subtype (P=0.003), and less likely to have the M5 subtype (P=0.040) compared with patients with high expression levels (miR-500high). miR-500low patients were associated with low-risk AML (P=0.003) and core-binding factor subunit b-myosin heavy chain 11 translocation mutation (P=0.021). There was a significant difference in nucleophosmin 1 (P=0.009), NRAS proto-oncogene GTPase/KRAS proto-oncogene GTPase (P=0.047) and PHD finger protein 6 (P=0.040) expression levels between the two groups. miR-500high patients had a decreased overall survival (OS) time compared with the low expression group (P=0.035). Multivariate analysis revealed that miR-500 expression significantly affected OS time independent of other classical prognostic factors, such as age and common mutations. The analysis of survival curves further substantiated this result. The results obtained in the current study suggested that miR-500 may be a suitable prognostic marker for patients with AML receiving allo-HSCT.
