In attempts to delay tumor progression after surgery or minimally invasive local treatments, multidisciplinary strategies have been broadly studied in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective of this present study was to evaluate the efficacy of autologous transplantations of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells as an adjuvant therapy for patients with HCC. A total of 264 patients with HCC were enrolled in this retrospective study. Of these patients, 165 received either CIK cell therapy alone or as adjuvant therapy to surgery, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), or TACE-based comprehensive treatments (CT). The remaining 99 patients received only surgery or TACE. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Chi-squared test were used to analyze the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and clinical characteristics of the patients in the different treatment subgroups. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that patients in the Surgery+CIK group had a significantly improved OS compared with those in the other three groups (P
