This study investigates the application and evaluation of existing indirect methods, namely point-based registration techniques, for the estimation and compensation of observed motion included in the 2-D image plane of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) cine-loops recorded for the characterization and diagnosis of focal liver lesions (FLLs). The value of applying motion compensation in the challenging modality of CEUS is to assist in the quantification of the perfusion dynamics of an FLL in relation to its parenchyma, allowing for a potentially accurate diagnostic suggestion. Towards this end, this study also proposes a novel quantitative multi-level framework for evaluating the quantification of FLLs, which to the best of our knowledge remains undefined, notwithstanding many relevant studies. Following quantitative evaluation of 19 indirect algorithms and configurations, while also considering the requirement for computational efficiency, our results suggest that the "compact and real-time descriptor" (CARD) is the optimal indirect motion compensation method in CEUS.
