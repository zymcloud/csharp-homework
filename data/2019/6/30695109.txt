Background:A real-life study is essential outside clinical trials. The aim is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of direct acting agents (DAA) for patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in real practice.Methods:We analyzed 590 consecutively enrolled patients with CHC-1b who received DAAs since 2015, when DAAs were introduced in Korea. The patients were checked for resistance-associated variants (RAV) against nonstructural protein 5A inhibitors and then daclatasvir/asunaprevir or sofosbuvir based regimens were chosen.Results:The frequency of patients with cirrhosis and prior hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 29.2% and 4.7%, respectively. For the RAV test, 10% were positive and in 3.6% the result was "indeterminate." Overall, 518 patients were treated with a 24-week regimen of daclatasvir/asunaprevir, 72 patients (RAV positive 75%) were treated with 12 weeks regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or daclatasvir/sofosbuvir. The SVR12 was 94.0% in the daclatasvir/asunaprevir, 98.2% in the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, and 100% in the daclatasvir/sofosbuvir group. A total of 93.3% of SVR12 in the RAV-"indeterminate" patients was not difference 95.0% in the RAV-negative patients. Up to 1 year, de novo HCC occurrence and recurrence developed in 2.6% and 17.8%, respectively. HCC was more frequent in cirrhotic patients than in noncirrhotic patients (P = 0.000). Î± Fetoprotein (AFP) level at the end of treatment was a predicting factor for de novo HCC.Conclusions:Optimizing the choice of DAAs according to RAV test resulted in high SVR among CHC-1b Korean patients. This real practice multicenter cohort study suggests the importance of AFP and HCC surveillance in cirrhotic patients even after successful HCV therapy.
