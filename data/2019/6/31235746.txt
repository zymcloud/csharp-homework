Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs are involved in numerous physio-pathological conditions included cancer. To better understand the molecular mechanism of the oral antitumor multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, we profiled the expression of a panel of lncRNAs and miRNAs by qPCR array in a sorafenib-treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line. Among the most affected ncRNAs, we found that sorafenib mediated the dysregulation of the lncRNAs GAS5, HOTTIP and HOXA-AS2 and the miR-126-3p, in a panel of human cancer cell lines (HCC, renal and breast carcinomas). By luciferase gene reporter assay, we discovered that GAS5 may act as a sponge for miR-126-3p in HCC cells. The expression level of GAS5 and miR-126-3p was verified in human liquid and/or solid biopsies from HCC patients. miR-126-3p expression in HCC tissues was decreased respect to their correspondent peritumoral tissues. The levels of plasmatic circulating miR-126-3p and GAS5 were significantly higher and lower in HCC patients compared to healthy subjects, respectively. This study highlighted the capability of sorafenib to modulate the expression of a wide range of ncRNAs and specifically, GAS5 and miR-126-3p were involved in the response to sorafenib of different cancer cell types.
