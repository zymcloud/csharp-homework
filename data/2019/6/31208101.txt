A chemical investigation of the fibrous roots of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge. led to the isolation of four benzophenones, including one new compound (1) and three known ones (2-4). Comprehensive 1D, 2D NMR and HRESIMS data established the structures of the isolated compounds. The absolute configurations were determined by comparison of the calculated optical rotation (OR) with experimental data. All the isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxicities on hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B). Compound 1 showed strong cytotoxicity against HepG2 and Hep3B cells, with IC50 values at 153.1 and 180.6 nM. Through MTT assay, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis, compound 1 demonstrated the ability to stimulate apoptosis via the NF-κB signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. These benzophenones are potential lead compounds for the development of better treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma.
