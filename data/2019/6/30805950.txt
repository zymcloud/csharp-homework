Potentially curative treatments for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have drawbacks and contraindications. Recently, radiotherapy has achieved good outcomes. We compared the outcomes of radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for early-stage HCC. Consecutive patients with ≤3 early-stage HCC lesions and tumor diameters ≤3 cm treated with RFA or radiotherapy were reviewed. RFA was the first choice for HCC unsuitable for surgery. Otherwise, stereotactic body radiotherapy in five fractions was mainly performed. For HCC adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract, radiotherapy with mild hypofractionation was performed. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce the selection bias between the RFA and radiotherapy groups. Between 2012 and 2016, a total of 231 patients with 474 tumors and 143 patients with 221 tumors were eligible and were treated with RFA and radiotherapy, respectively. In an unmatched comparison, the 3-year local recurrence rate was significantly lower for radiotherapy than for RFA (5.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-9.2; versus 12.9%, 95% CI, 9.9-16.2) (P
