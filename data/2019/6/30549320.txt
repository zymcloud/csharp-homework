Background and aim:Albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade was developed as a new method to assess hepatic function. Sorafenib has been confirmed to be effective in improving survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the impact of ALBI grade versus Child-Pugh classification on survival in HCC patients who received sorafenib.Methods:A total of 567 patients with advanced HCC who received sorafenib were included. We analyzed survival based on Child-Pugh classification or score and ALBI grade or score. We also compared the ability of ALBI and Child-Pugh scores to predict survival using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis.Results:Cumulative survival rates at 90, 180, 360, and 720 days were 84.1%, 66.6%, 47.0%, and 23.3%, respectively. Median survival was 316 days (95% confidence interval, 279-377). Both Child-Pugh classification and ALBI grade were independently associated with overall survival in multivariate analyses. In addition, overall survival differed significantly between patients with ALBI grades 1 and 2 (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.92, P = 0.011) among patients with a Child-Pugh score of 5. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that ALBI score predicted overall survival better than Child-Pugh score.Conclusions:Albumin-bilirubin grade is a better predictor of survival in patients with advanced HCC who received sorafenib therapy than Child-Pugh classification.
