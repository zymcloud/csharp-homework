Background:To evaluate the value of a three dimension (3D)visualization operative planning system in ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (US-PMWA) for large hepatic hemangiomas (LHHs).Methods:Fifty-eight patients with LHHs were divided into 3D and 2D groups. The therapeutic efficacy was assessed by contrast-enhanced imaging during follow-up. Hepatic and renal function were examined. The complete ablation, tumor volume shrinkage, and complication rates were analyzed.Results:The ablation time and energy of the 3D group were lower than those of the 2D group (1152.0 ± 403.9 s vs. 1379.7 ± 375.8 s and 87,407.2.9 ± 50,387.0 J vs. 117,775.8 ± 46,245.6 J, P = 0.031 and 0.021, respectively). The 3D group had a higher complete ablation rate than the 2D group (97.7 ± 2.4% vs. 94.5 ± 3.7%, P < 0.001). The incidence of hemoglobinuria after ablation in the 3D group was lower than that in the 2D group (32.0% vs. 57.6%, P = 0.047). The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and creatinine (Cre) after ablation in the 3D group were lower than those in the 2D group (126.7 ± 56.4 U/L vs. 210.9 ± 96.2 U/L, P < 0.001; 141.0 ± 60.8 U/L vs. 211.4 ± 90.0 U/L, P = 0.001; 57.3 ± 17.6 U/L vs. 80.8 ± 41.9 U/L, P = 0.010; and 66.6 ± 16.6 mmol/L vs. 84.5 ± 39.6 mmol/L, P = 0.037, respectively). There were no significant differences in antenna insertion and the volume reduction rate between the groups. One patient developed acute kidney injury shortly after ablation in the 2D group and recovered after hemodialysis. No other severe complications occurred during the follow-up period.Conclusions:The 3D visualization operative planning system has a relatively high clinical application value in providing scientific, reasonable, quantifiable, and individualized therapy for LHHs by US-PMWA.
