With the development of diagnostic and screening technologies, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extrahepatic metastasis is increasing. It is a kind of refractory disease with extremely poor prognosis. Currently, there is no standard therapy. The existing guidelines only recommend targeted therapy, systemic chemotherapy or best supportive care for HCC patients with extrahepatic metastasis, but have not mentioned surgical therapy.Several studies have shown that the majority of HCC patients with extrahepatic metastasis died of progressive intrahepatic tumor leading to hepatic failure, but not extrahepatic metastases; and primary tumor resection may have a favorable impact on the prognosis of these patients with resectable primary tumors.Furthermore, the role of resection of metastatic tumors for HCC patients with extrahepatic metastasis remains unclear so far.Majority of experts think that resection of lung metastases has survival benefit when the hepatic lesion is resected or controlled, whereas resection of lymph nodes, bone metastases, adrenal gland lesions, or brain metastases does not prolong survival, which may be recommended when the goal is to relieve symptoms or improve quality of life.Therefore, surgical treatment is important for HCC patients with extrahepatic metastasis, and surgical therapy combined with personalized systemic treatment shows survival benefit for selected patients.
