Aim: The present study aimed to determine whether anatomical resection was necessary for early hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: A log-rank test or two-stage test was used for univariate analysis. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable analysis. Results: For patients without microvascular invasion, a resection margin ≥1 cm provided the longest recurrence-free survival time regardless of whether they underwent anatomical resection (p = 0.005) or nonanatomical resection (p = 0.006). For patients with microvascular invasion, anatomical resection combined with a resection margin ≥1 cm provided the longest recurrence-free survival time compared with other treatments (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Anatomical resection was not necessary for patients without microvascular invasion. However, for patients with microvascular invasion, both anatomical resection and a resection margin ≥1 cm were necessary.
