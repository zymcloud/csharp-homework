Few reports have described dose re-escalation after long-term low-dose sorafenib leading to good outcomes. Here, we report the case of an 80-year-old woman with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who achieved complete response from sorafenib dose re-escalation after the failure of long-term low-dose sorafenib treatment combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Sorafenib therapy was initiated at 400 mg once daily due to old age and low platelet count. 5 months later, this dose was reduced to 200 mg once daily because of adverse events. Best radiological antitumor response by sorafenib treatment alone was judged as stable disease according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. 1 year later, she showed progressive disease owing to the progression of intrahepatic lesions. She received combination therapy with low-dose sorafenib (200 mg every other day) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, which proved relatively effective for three and a half years. Antitumor response by the fourth transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and subsequent low-dose sorafenib was clearly progressive disease. At that time, sorafenib-related adverse events were well-controlled. Sorafenib dose was re-escalated to 200 mg once daily. After this re-escalation, tumor markers declined rapidly, and adverse events remained tolerable. 4 months later, complete response was achieved.
