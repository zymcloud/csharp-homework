Peliosis hepatis (PH) is a rare disease characterized by the presence of sinusoidal dilation and blood-filled cysts throughout the hepatic parenchyma. We report a case of PH in a 49-year-old woman with chronic renal failure (CRF) on hemodialysis and with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a 35-mm-diameter, hypervascular tumor in the liver and RCC in the right renal cyst. Ultrasound and superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging were also performed; however, the liver tumor could not be distinguished from the metastasis of RCC. Therefore, echo-guided biopsy of the liver tumor using an 18-G Majima needle was performed. Histological evaluation of the specimen showed irregular sinusoidal dilatation and blood-filled cavities without malignant cells. She was ultimately diagnosed with PH. Subsequently, she underwent total right nephrectomy for RCC and was diagnosed with RCC stage 1 (pT1N0M0). A follow-up CT performed 4 months after nephrectomy showed no growth of PH. Although the development of PH in patients with CRF or RCC who do not undergo renal transplantation is extremely rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis to distinguish PH from the metastasis of RCC.
