Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer type. This study was aimed to investigate the role of microRNA-584-5p (miR-584-5p) in regulating HCC progression.Methods:The expression of miR-584-5p in HCC cell lines was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Effects of miR-584-5p depletion on HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro were analyzed by cell counting kit-8 assay, wound-healing assay, and transwell invasion assay. miR-584-5p targeting potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 2 (KCNE2) was identified using bioinformatics algorithm and dual-luciferase activity reporter assay. Kaplan-Meier Plotter website was used to investigate the effect of miR-584-5p or KCNE2 expression on the overall survival of HCC patients.Results:In vitro functional assays showed miR-584-5p depletion decreased HCC cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell invasion. Moreover, miR-584-5p functions by directly targeting KCNE2, and it in turn, mediates the effects of miR-584-5p on HCC cell behaviors.Conclusions:These results demonstrated that miR-584-5p functions as an oncogenic miRNA in HCC.
