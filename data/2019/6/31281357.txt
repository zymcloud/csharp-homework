Purpose:Associations between XRCC1, XRCC3, and ERCC2 gene polymorphism and prognosis have been investigated in several cancers. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prognostic value of XRCC1, XRCC3, and ERCC2 gene polymorphism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A systematic literature search was performed to identify relevant studies in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library up to December 2018. The prognostic values of XRCC1, XRCC3, and ERCC2 polymorphisms in HCC were estimated using crude HRs with 95% CIs.Results:Ten studies involving 2687 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. There were no statistically significant associations between XRCC1 rs1799782 C>T, XRCC1 rs25487 G>A, and ERCC2 rs1799793 G>A polymorphisms and overall survival (OS). OS was significantly longer for the ERCC2 rs13181 CC genotype than for AA (CC vs. AA: HR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.15-0.72). A significantly lower OS was observed for patients with the CT genotype compared with the CC genotype at XRCC3 rs861539 (CT vs. CC: HR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.11-2.42).Conclusion:The ERCC2 rs13181 A>C polymorphism and XRCC3 rs861539 C>T polymorphism may be predictive markers for prognosis in patients with HCC. Well-designed studies with larger sample sizes are needed to verify our findings.
