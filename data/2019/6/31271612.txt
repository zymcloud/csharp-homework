Introduction:HPA polymorphism has been associated with HCV presence and fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C. However, it is unknown if there is an association between HPA-1 polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate HPA-1 polymorphism in the presence of HCC.Methods:PCR-SSP was used to perform HPA genotyping on 76 HCV-infected patients.Results:There was no association between patients with and without HCC. There was significant difference in HPA-1 genotypic frequency distribution between HCC and F1/F2 fibrosis degree.Conclusions:The HPA-1a/1b polymorphism appears to be more associated with liver damage progression than with HCC presence.
