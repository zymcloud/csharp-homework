Purpose:This study evaluated the usefulness of performing dual arterial phase computed tomography (CT) during pre-transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) angiography for identifying the feeding arteries of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC).Materials and methods:Dual arterial phase CT was performed during pre-TACE angiography in 73 patients with 139 HCC. Ten HCC underwent this procedure twice, so the total number of examined HCC was 149. Early and late arterial phase images were obtained 6 seconds after injection of an iodinated contrast material serially during a single breath-hold. The feeding artery was defined as the branch of the hepatic artery that was connected to the enhanced areas of the tumor. For HCC that could not be visualized on the early arterial phase images, fusion images superimposing the early and late arterial phase images were constructed. Furthermore, technical success defined as successful catheterization of the subsegmental or more distal feeding artery was evaluated.Results:The feeding artery was correctly identified on dual arterial phase CT in 146 of the 149 tumors (98.0%). In two HCC, the feeding arteries could not be identified due to severe motion artifacts, and in one, due to the presence of anastomosis between the right and left hepatic arteries. Catheterization of the subsegmental feeding artery was successful in all TACE procedures (technical success rate: 100%).Conclusion:Performing dual arterial phase CT during angiography appears to be useful for identifying the feeding arteries of HCC.
