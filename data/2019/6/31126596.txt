Purpose:Irreversible electroporation (IRE) differs from thermal radiofrequency (RF) ablation, especially in terms of the reparative process in the ablation zone induced. To elucidate this, the systemic immune responses after 2 mechanistically different types of ablation (IRE and RF ablation) were evaluated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Twenty-one patients with HCC who underwent either RF ablation (n = 11) or IRE (n = 10) were studied. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all patients at 4 timepoints: before ablation, within 1 hour after ablation, 1 day after ablation, and 4 days after ablation. The phenotypes and functions of immune cells in peripheral blood and serum levels of cytokines and chemokines were monitored and analyzed using the mixed-effects model. Follow-up radiological images were also obtained to assess temporal changes in the ablation zone.Results:The most significant difference was seen in the levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in the IRE group compared to the RF ablation group (P = .0011): the serum levels of MIF in the IRE group significantly increased immediately after IRE and then rapidly decreased to the pre-ablation range 1 day after IRE, but, in contrast, no consistent trend was observed in the RF ablation group. The axial diameter (P = .0009) and area (P = .0192) of the ablation zone of IRE were significantly smaller than those of RF ablation 1 year after ablation.Conclusions:IRE was found to be associated with a significant early increase in MIF levels, which may facilitate the early reparative process and result in significant shrinkage of the ablation zone.
