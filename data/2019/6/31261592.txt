The aim of this study was to obtain real-world, US, observational data on the effect of baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) on achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in hepatitis C (HCV) patients treated with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens; the need for long-term follow-up in post-SVR patients.It is uncertain if the presence of RASs limits efficacy to DAAs. Once SVR is achieved, society guidelines recommend long-term surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in certain patients. Real-world data are limited on these topics.Adult patients treated with DAAs at community hepatitis clinics between January 2015 and April 2017 were included in this study. Baseline resistance testing was performed before treatment. Per guidelines, post-SVR long-term monitoring was required in patients with F3 to F4 fibrosis before treatment or with elevated ALT levels (>19 U/L females; >30 U/L males).A total of 875 chronic, mostly GT1a (60%) HCV patients were treated with an approved DAA regimen. Average baseline AST and ALT were 75 and 67 U/L, respectively, and 47% had F3 to F4 fibrosis at baseline. SVR was achieved in 863 (98.6%) patients despite a high presence of baseline RASs (61%). Long-term monitoring was required post-SVR in 539 patients (62%).In a real-life, US cohort of HCV-infected patients, nearly all patients achieved SVR with available DAA regimens regardless of baseline RASs. Approximately two-thirds of these patients required long-term follow-up, despite viral eradication.
