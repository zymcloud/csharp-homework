Three previously undescribed seco-dammarane triterpenoid glycosides O-Q (1-3) along with two known compounds (4 and 5) were isolated and characterized from the leaves of Cyclocarya paliurus. Their structures were determined by comprehensive analysis of 1 D, 2 D NMR and HRESIMS data. Compounds 1-5 were evaluated for their inhibitory effects against human pancreatic tumor (ASPC-1), human gastric carcinoma (SNU5), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG-2) and human colon tumor (HCT116) cell lines. Among them cyclocarioside P (2) showed somewhat inhibitory activity towards those tumor cells.
