Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver with high mortality and frequent recurrence. Although various therapies provide potential cure for HCC patients, unfortunately the five-year survival rate of advanced HCC remains dismal. It is critical to explore the pathogenesis of HCC and identify novel biomarkers for early HCC diagnosis. PSMD4 is a major receptor of the 26S proteasome involved in ubiquitindependent and proteasome-mediated protein degradation. In our study, PSMD4 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines determined by Northern blot, western blot and immunohistochemistry. The silencing of PSMD4 blocked cell proliferation and tumor growth, induced cell apoptosis and inhibited the proteasome activity. Western blot results showed that the knockdown of PSMD4 blocked the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), phosphorylated Sarcoma tyrosine kinase (P-SRC) and Bcl-2, but improved the levels of p53 and Bax in HCC, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and endometrial cancer cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicated that the subunit of 26S proteasome PSMD4 exerts as an oncogene in HCC and other cancers via regulating the expression p53, Bcl-2 and Bax. These findings enriched the pathogenesis of HCC, and provided a new biomarker for cancers diagnosis and a new target for cancers therapy.
