Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the clinical dilemmas in chronic liver diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that play an important role in the pathogenesis of liver diseases and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genes affect the clinical course of HBV infection. Previous studies have shown that miRNA-146a rs2910164 polymorphism can be associated with the pathogenesis of liver diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study investigated the association between miRNA-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and susceptibility to HBV infection in an Iranian population. The study comprised 266 patients with chronic HBV infection, 172 patients with spontaneous viral clearance (SVC) after acute HBV infection, and 266 healthy control adjusted for sex and age. The genotyping of the miRNA-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Our data revealed that GG genotype and G allele of miRNA-146a rs2910164 SNP is dominated (P
