To compare the efficacy of drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization combined with radiofrequency ablation (DEB-TACE+RFA) versus DEB-TACE alone in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.The 28 patients receiving DEB-TACE+RFA and 74 HCC patients receiving DEB-TACE were recruited in this study. Treatment responses, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.One to 3 months after treatments, the proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR) (78.6% vs 33.8%, P 3.3 cm (P = .025) was longer and patients with unilobar disease (P = .009), and patients with no hepatic invasion (P = .019) and Child-pugh stage A (P = .037) had more favorable OS in DEB-TACE+RFA group compared with DEB-TACE group.DEB-TACE+RFA achieved better treatment responses and OS compared with DEB-TACE alone in Chinese HCC patients.
