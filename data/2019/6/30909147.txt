Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of alkannin on HCC cells growth, migration and invasion.Methods:Huh7 and Hep3B2.1-7 cells were treated with alkannin. Expression of miR-92a in cell was altered by transfection with miR-92a-mimic (miR-92a-M) or miR-92a-inhibitor (miR-92a-I). Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8, BrdU assay, flow cytometry, and transwell assay, respectively. The expression of miR-92a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of proteins associated with proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis was measured by Western blot.Results:Alkannin decreased cell viability and proliferation, executed cell apoptosis, and inhibited the migration and invasion of Huh7 and Hep3B2.1-7 cells. Alkannin negatively regulated the expression of miR-92a, and transfection with miR-92a-M impeded alkannin's anti-tumor functions. PTEN and TP53INP1 were found to be target genes of miR-92a. Alkannin inhibited PTEN-dependent PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the biological effects of miR-92a-I in alkannin treated cells were eliminated by PTEN silencing.Conclusion:Alkannin exerted anti-tumor activities by downregulation of miR-92a. This process might be executed by inactivating PTEN/PI3K/AKT signal pathways through the binding effects of miR-92a on PTEN.
