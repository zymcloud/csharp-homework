Abdominal surgery is sometimes needed in patients with portal hypertension. The indication may be related to the underlying liver disease, including liver resection for liver cancer and parietal surgery. Surgery may also be performed for another indication, unrelated to the liver disease. Portal hypertension increases both morbidity and mortality after abdominal surgery, and it should be taken into account when planning surgery timing and surgical strategy. This article provides an overview of the main etiologies of portal hypertension, and the post-operative outcomes after liver resection and non-hepatic abdominal surgery, underlining the importance of a multidisciplinary approach.
