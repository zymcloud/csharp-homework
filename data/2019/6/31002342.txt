Sorafenib remains the standard care for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) even though it has low antitumor efficacy. Protein neddylation is abnormally activated in many types of human cancer. However, whether dysregulation of neddylation is involved in HCC progression and whether targeting neddylation sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib need to be ascertained. In the present study, it was demonstrated that high expression of neddylation components, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8) and NEDD8‑activating enzyme 1 (NAE1), were associated with poor survival of patients with HCC. Inhibition of neddylation by MLN4924, a small‑molecule inhibitor of NAE1, significantly inhibited HCC growth, reduced clonogenic survival, increased apoptosis, and decreased migration capacity. Sorafenib alone exhibited minimal anticancer efficacy. However, a combination of sorafenib with MLN4924 at a low concentration significantly enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration as well as the induction of apoptosis induced by sorafenib. In vivo HCC xenograft mouse models also showed that MLN4924 increased the antitumor efficacy of sorafenib. Mechanistically, MLN4924 enhanced the antitumor activity of sorafenib in HCC cells via upregulation of cullin‑RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL)/Skp1‑Cullin1‑F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase substrates p21, p27, Deptor and IκBɑ. Taken together, these findings suggest that combination therapy of MLN4924 with sorafenib appears to present an additive effect with a maximal in the treatment of HCC.
