Diagnostic value of hepatic artery perfusion fraction (HAF) combined with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the diagnosis of primary liver carcinoma (PLC) was evaluated. The clinical data of 128 PLC patients undergoing radical hepatectomy in Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University were regarded as the study group. Seventy-four healthy volunteers examined in Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University were collected as the control group. Double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the expression level of serum TGF-β. The upper abdomen of the subjects was scanned by a 64-slice spiral CT, and the perfusion parameters were analyzed and calculated. According to the HAF and the expression level of TGF-β in the two groups, single and combined detection of TGF-β and HAF parameters were detected, respectively, by ROC curve. The expression of TGF-β in serum of the study group was higher than that of the control group (P
