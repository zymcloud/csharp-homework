Background:With the improvement in survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, extrahepatic metastases have become a more frequent complication. Although pathological fractures or paralysis due to bone metastases deteriorate the quality of life of patients, no treatment guideline for bone metastases has been established. This study aimed to clarify the risk factors for these events and the clinical course of patients with bone metastases.Methods:Out of 783 hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated in our institution between 2009 and 2016, 76 patients with bone metastases were enrolled. They were divided into two groups by the trigger of bone metastases detection. One was those diagnosed by surveillance (surveillance group), and the other was those based on symptom presentation (non-surveillance group). We investigated the clinical features, risk factors for fractures or paralysis and prognostic factors for survival after bone metastases.Results:Baseline characteristics and survival were not significantly different between two groups. Fractures or paralysis occurred in 10 patients (13.2%), and the frequency was significantly higher in the non-surveillance group (20.9%) than the surveillance group (3.0%) in univariate analysis (p = 0.036). The median survival after diagnosis of bone metastases was 11.7 months. Age over 75 years (p = 0.002), hepatitis C-virus etiology (p = 0.007) and Child-Pugh class B/C (p Conclusions:Early diagnosis through surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma bone metastases may prevent fractures or paralysis and lead to a better quality of life for these patients.
