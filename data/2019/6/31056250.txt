Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), defined as T4 in TNM stage by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (eighth edition), is a serious life-threatening complication. Effective treatment remains challenging because of a high 1-month mortality, a short median survival, and the potential of peritoneal metastasis. We reported on a case that received a living related donor liver transplantation (LDLT) after successful consecutive downstaging therapies. A 63-year-old man with alcohol-related liver cirrhosis and multiple HCC developed spontaneous rupture and hemoperitoneum. He received 3 sessions of transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization and target therapy with sorafenib. Computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging after 11 months of treatment showed that the patient's HCCs fulfilled the Milan criteria and the University of California San Francisco criteria prior to LDLT. The perioperative course was rather smooth. After discharge, interval follow-up computed tomography studies of chest and liver and a whole-body bone scan showed no tumor recurrence or metastasis up to 20 months post-operation. Successful downstaging therapies of ruptured HCC to fulfill Milan criteria to receive liver transplantation is advisable in highly selected patients.
