Activity-guided fractionation was used to isolate and identify two components of the Brazilian açaí berry (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) with the ability to induce antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent gene transcription in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Using an ARE-Luciferase reporter construct in cultured HepG2 cells, a suite of fractions from dried and powdered açaí berries were evaluated for transcriptional up-regulation of the luciferase gene. Active fractions were further refined until several pure compounds were isolated and identified. These compounds belong to the pheophorbide class of molecules, and are composed of the methyl and ethyl esters of the parent pheophorbide A, all of which are classified as photosensitizers. Using standard pheophorbides, dose response studies were carried out, and ARE-activation could be observed at concentrations as low as 8.2 μM and 16.9 μM for pheophorbide A methyl ester and pheophorbide A, respectively. These studies not only suggest a possible source of antioxidant properties for the açaí berry, but may also explain the recently identified photosensitizing abilities of açaí products as well.
