An increasing interest in liver cancer stemness arises owing to its aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. CD133, a widely known liver cancer stem cell marker, plays critical roles in the maintenance of liver cancer stemness. Thus, exploring the regulatory mechanism of CD133 expression is significant. In the present study, we proved the carcinogenesis roles of aquaporin 3 (AQP3) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and demonstrated that AQP3 promotes the stem cell-like properties of hepatoma cells by regulating CD133 expression. In addition, AQP3 promoted the stimulation and nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) with a subsequent increase in the level of CD133 promoter-acetylated histone H3. This phenomenon accelerated CD133 transcription. Next, whether AQP3 acted as an oncogenic gene in HCC and maintained the stemness of CD133+ hepatoma cells were elucidated; also, a novel mechanism underlying the AQP3/STAT3/CD133 pathway in HCC was deduced.
