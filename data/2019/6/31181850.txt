MSC-derived exosomes display, among others, an efficient biocompatibility and a reduced intrinsic immunogenicity, representing a valuable vehicle for drug delivery in a tumor-therapeutic approach. Following treatment of several human mesenchymal stroma/stem-like cell (MSC) populations with sub-lethal concentrations of taxol for 24 h, exosomes were isolated and applied to different human cancer populations including A549 lung cancer, SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer, and MDA-hyb1 breast cancer cells. While MSC control exosomes revealed little if any growth inhibition on the tumor cells, exposure to taxol-loaded MSC-derived exosomes was associated with 80-90% cytotoxicity. A similar application of taxol-loaded exosomes from HuVEC displayed much fewer effects. Quantification by LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated a 7.6-fold reduced taxol concentration in MSC exosomes when compared to equivalent cytotoxic in vitro effects achieved with taxol substances, indicating a specific and more efficient tumor-targeting property. Consequently, MSC-derived taxol exosomes were tested in vivo. Highly metastatic MDA-hyb1 breast tumors were induced in NODscid mice, and systemic intravenous application of MSC-derived taxol exosomes revealed a more than 60% reduction of subcutaneous primary tumors. Moreover, the amount of distant organ metastases observed at least in lung, liver, spleen, and kidney was reduced by 50% with MSC taxol exosomes, similar to the effects observed with taxol, although the concentration of taxol in exosomes was about 1000-fold reduced. Together, these findings in different cancer cell populations and in vivo provide promising future perspectives for drug-loaded MSC-derived exosomes in efficiently targeting primary tumors and metastases by reducing side effects.
