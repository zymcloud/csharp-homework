Objective:To investigate inhibitory effect of semen litchi drug serum on proliferation of human hepatoma HepG2 cells and its effect on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).Study design:An experimental study.Place and duration of study:College of Pharmacy, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, China, from June 2017 to January 2018.Methodology:Semen litchi drug serum with concentrations of 0 mg/kg (control group), 3 g/kg (low dose group), 6 g/kg (medium dose group) and 12 g/kg (high dose group) was used to act on HepG2 cells at the logarithmic phase. Inhibitory effect of semen litchi drug serum on cell growth, expression of VEGF and MMP-9 mRNA and protein was detected.Results:Inhibitory effect of semen litchi drug serum on the proliferation of HepG2 cells significantly increased with the increase of drug concentration, which was dose-time dependent. Expression levels of VEGF and MMP-9 mRNA in HepG2 cells after 48 hours of treatment by semen litchi low-dose group, medium-dose group, and high-dose group were lower than those in control group (all p Conclusion:Semen litchi drug serum can inhibit proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro. The anti-hepatoma effect of semen litchi drug serum may be exerted through down-regulating the expression of VEGF and MMP-9 and inhibiting angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
