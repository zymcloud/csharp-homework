Background:Liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) are a small subset of cells characterized by unlimited self-renewal, cell differentiation, and uncontrollable cellular growth. LCSCs are also resistant to conventional therapies and are thus believed to be held responsible for causing treatment failure of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been recently found that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators in HCC. This present study aims to explore the underlying mechanism of how lncRNA DLX6-AS1 influences the development of LCSCs and HCC.Methods:A microarray-based analysis was performed to initially screen differentially expressed lncRNAs associated with HCC. We then analyzed the lncRNA DLX6-AS1 levels as well as CADM1 promoter methylation. The mRNA and protein expression of CADM1, STAT3, CD133, CD13, OCT-4, SOX2, and Nanog were then detected. We quantified our results by evaluating the spheroid formation, proliferation, and tumor formation abilities, as well as the proportion of tumor stem cells, and the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) in LCSCs when lncRNA DLX6-AS1 was either overexpressed or silenced.Results:LncRNA DLX6-AS1 was upregulated in HCC. The silencing of lncRNA DLX6-AS1 was shown to reduce and inhibit spheroid formation, colony formation, proliferation, and tumor formation abilities, as well as attenuate CD133, CD13, OCT-4, SOX2, and Nanog expression in LCSCs. Furthermore, downregulation of lncRNA DLX6-AS1 contributed to a reduction in CADM1 promoter methylation via suppression of DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b in LCSCs and inactivating the STAT3 signaling pathway.Conclusion:This study demonstrated that down-regulated lncRNA DLX6-AS1 may inhibit the stem cell properties of LCSCs through upregulation of CADM1 by suppressing the methylation of the CADM1 promoter and inactivation of the STAT3 signaling pathway.
