The necessity for early detection and hence improving the outcome of treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is critical especially in Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-Genotype 4 induced cases. In our current work, we examined the miRNA-152 and DNMT-1 expression in chronic liver disease (CLD) due to HCV genotype 4 infection with/without cirrhosis and HCC patients as an attempt to evaluate the potential benefits of these new circulating, noninvasive, prognostic, epigenetic markers for liver cirrhosis and carcinogenesis of Egyptian patients. Eighty subjects were included in this study, divided into two groups; group I (40 patients) were classified into subgroup Ia (CLD without cirrhosis, n = 18) and subgroup Ib (CLD with cirrhosis, n = 22), group II (CLD patients with HCC, n = 20), and control (Healthy volunteer, n = 20). The expression of miRNA-152 and DNMT-1 genes were analyzed using Real-Time PCR. MiRNA-152 showed a persistent and significant downregulation in all diseased groups, which was in consistence with the progression of the disease toward the HCC stage. DNMT-1 showed upregulation in all diseased groups when compared to control and subgroup Ia. The miRNA-152 was shown to correlate inversely with DNMT-1 in subgroup Ia, Ib and group II (r = -0.557, p
