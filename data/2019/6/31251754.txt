The direct cytopathic effects of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) on subsequent liver damage are not fully understood in HBV-infected patients. However, associations between the prevalence of various HBV genotypes and the extent of liver damage have been reported from different parts of the world. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of HBV genotypes in patients with chronic HBV infection in Bangladesh, a country of 160 million people, of which approximately 3-6 million are chronically infected HBV patients. In addition, whole and partial genome sequencing of HBV was performed to evaluate the relationship between HBV mutations and genotypes. We found that 42% of the patients with low HBV DNA and normal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had HBV genotype D. In contrast, the HBV genotype C was dominant among patients with high HBV DNA levels (>2000 IU/ml) and elevated ALT and in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Whole and partial genome sequences of HBV revealed that most patients with LC and HCC had HBV genotype C with mutations at the T1762/A1764 positions. It seems that Bangladesh represents a borderline country, situated within East Asia, which mainly consists of individuals with HBV genotypes B and C, whereas in the western parts of Asia, HBV genotypes A and D are prevalent. Bangladesh is, therefore, an excellent model for the comparison of the pathophysiology of three major HBV genotypes in a single population. The findings of this study suggest a possible association between HBV viral factors and the extent of liver damage in chronic HBV-infected patients.
