A series of novel bis-coumarin derivatives containing triazole moiety as a linker between the alkyl chains was synthesized and their inhibitory activity against the human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) isoforms I, II, IX and XII were evaluated. In addition, cytotoxic effects of the synthesized compounds on renal adenocarcinoma (769P), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and breast adeno carcinoma (MDA-MB-231) cell lines were examined. While the hCA I and II isoforms were inhibited in the micromolar range, the tumor-associated isoform hCA IX and XII were inhibited in the high nanomolar range. 4-methyl-7-((1-(12-((2-oxo-2H-chromen-7-yl)oxy)dodecyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)-2H-chromen-2-one (5p) showed the strongest inhibitory activity against hCA IX with the Ki of 144.6 nM and 4-methyl-7-((1-(10-((2-oxo-2H-chromen-7-yl)oxy)decyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)-2H-chromen-2-one (5n) exhibited the highest hCA XII inhibition with the Ki of 71.5 nM. In order to better understand the inhibitory profiles of studied molecules, multiscale molecular modelling approaches were applied. Low energy docking poses of studied molecules at the binding sites of targets have been predicted. In addition, electrostatic potential surfaces (ESP) for binding sites were also generated to understand interactions between proteins and active ligands.
