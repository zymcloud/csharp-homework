Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences that protect the ends of linear chromosomes, and they are maintained by a ribonucleoprotein complex called telomerase. Variants in genes encoding for telomerase components have been associated with a spectrum of disease in the lung, skin, bone marrow, and liver. Mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomerase RNA component genes have been observed at a higher prevalence in patients with liver disease compared with the general population; however, the presence of variants in other components of the telomerase complex and their impact on clinical outcomes has not been explored. We evaluated 86 patients with end-stage liver disease for variants in an expanded panel of eight genes, and found that 17 patients (20%) had likely deleterious variants by in silico analysis. Seven unique likely deleterious variants were identified in the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1) gene that encodes for a DNA helicase important in telomere maintenance and genomic stability. In gene burden association analysis of their clinical data, the presence of any RTEL1 variant was associated with a 29% lower baseline white blood cell count (95% confidence interval [CI], -7% to -46%; P Value = 0.01) compared with patients without RTEL1 variants, and the presence of any exonic missense RTEL1 variant was associated with a 42% lower baseline platelet count (95% CI, -5% to -65%: P Value = 0.03). The presence of any telomerase variant was associated with an increased number of readmissions within 1 year after transplantation demonstrated by an incident rate ratio (IRR) of 3.15 (95% CI, 1.22 to 8.57). No association with survival was observed. Conclusion: Among patients who underwent liver transplantation, the presence of any exonic missense variant was associated with a longer postoperative length of stay with an IRR of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.31 to 3.68).
