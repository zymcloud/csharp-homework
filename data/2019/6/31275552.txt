The appropriate surgical treatment for inguinal hernia in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites remains controversial. A 79-year-old male undergoing treatment for Child-Pugh B hepatitis C-induced liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma complicated with bilateral inguinal hernia underwent transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. During surgery, barbed sutures were used to facilitate appropriate peritoneal closure. His postoperative course was uneventful. Information on TAPP repair for inguinal hernia in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites is limited. The International Guidelines for Inguinal Hernia Management recommend Lichtenstein repair for patients with ascites. TAPP repair requires peritonectomy via a posterior endoscopic approach; therefore, proper peritoneal closure is important to prevent the leakage of ascitic fluid. Herein, TAPP repair was safely and successfully completed using barbed sutures to achieve proper and strong peritoneal closure. TAPP repair using barbed sutures can be an effective treatment option for patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites.
