Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate multiple cellular processes during cancer progression, identified to be involved in tumorgenesis of several cancers including cancers of digestive system. However its role in gallbladder inflammatory disease (GID) and gallbladder cancer (GBC) has not been well documented. The present study was aimed to investigate the clinical significance of hsa-miRNA-335-5p (miR-335) in GBC and GID. Subjects and Methods: This prospective case control study, conducted from July 1, 2014 to December 1, 2017 in Era’s Lucknow Medical College & Hospital, India, evaluated miR-335 expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Hundred tissue samples GID (control; n=50) and GBC (case; n=50) were studied. Relative quantification of target miR-335 expression was examined using the comparative cycle threshold method. Their expression was correlated with different clinicopathological parameters. Fishers’ exact test, Student’s t-test, and Chi-square test were used as appropriate for data analysis. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to calculate overall and disease-free survival rate. Two sided P<0.05 was considered as significant. Results: miR-335 expression was found to be significantly low in GBC lesions when compared with GID lesions (P<0.001). The low expression level of miR-335 was correlated with histological grade (P=0.007), clinical stage (P<0.001), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001) and liver metastasis (P=0.016). Reduced expression of miRNA-335 was associated with a shorter median overall survival (7 months vs. 25 months) in GBC patients (P<0.001). Conclusions: Down regulation of miR-335 is associated with the severity of the disease and thus indicate that miR-335 expression may serve as prognostic marker for GBC.
