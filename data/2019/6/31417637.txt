Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of surgical resection plus radiofrequency ablation (SR-RFA) for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with 2 or 3 nodules compared with surgical resection (SR). Method: We retrospectively evaluated 824 consecutive HCC patients (SR, n = 754; SR-RFA, n = 70) from January 2009 to December 2015 and performed propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust for patient imbalances at a ratio of 1:4. Results: At baseline, patients in the SR-RFA group had a smaller tumour size and worse liver function (including more ascites, a higher total bilirubin level, and a longer prothrombin time) than patients in the SR group. However, the two groups had similar overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates (P = 0.209 and P = 0.332). The local recurrence rate of the SR-RFA group was significantly higher than that of the SR group (25.71% and 14.32%, P = 0.011). More patients in the SR-RFA group had postoperative complications (P = 0.003). In the propensity model, there was no intergroup difference in OS or RFS (P = 0.229 and P = 0.311, respectively). Conclusion: SR-RFA provides a similar long-term survival to that on SR in HCC patients with 2 or 3 nodules, and its application should be carefully considered.
