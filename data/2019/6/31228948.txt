Background:DEPTOR is an endogenous inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 that plays a vital role in the progression of human malignances. However, the biological function of DEPTOR in HCC metastasis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unclear.Methods:Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry(IHC) were employed to examine DEPTOR expression in HCC cell lines and tissues. A series of in vivo and in vitro assays were performed to determine the function of DEPTOR and the possible mechanisms underlying its role in HCC metastasis.Results:We found that DEPTOR was frequently overexpressed in HCC tissues, and its high expression was associated with high serum AFP levels, increased tumor size, vascular invasion and more advanced TMN and BCLC stage, as well as an overall poor prognosis. Functional experiments demonstrated that DEPTOR silencing inhibited the proliferation and mobility of HCC cells in vitro and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis of HCC cells in vivo. Accordingly, DEPTOR overexpression promoted the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, but had no effect on cell proliferation in vitro. Overexpression of DEPTOR induced EMT by snail induction. Conversely, knockdown of snail expression impaired the DEPTOR-induced migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells. Furthermore, we found that the increase of snail expression by DEPTOR overexpression was due to an activation of TGF-β1-smad3/smad4 signaling possibly through feedback inhibition of mTOR.Conclusion:DEPTOR promotes the EMT and metastasis of HCC cells by activating the TGF-β1-smad3/smad4-snail pathway via mTOR inhibition. Therefore, targeting DEPTOR may be an ideal treatment strategy for inhibiting the growth and metastasis of HCC.
