Purpose:Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown marked responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in clinical trials. However, because such trials comprise cohorts selected based on specific criteria, it is unclear if their results represent routine clinical practice.Methods:We examined 155 patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea between March 2014 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, EGFR/ALK mutation status, metastatic locations, response to ICIs, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The median age was 64 years and 72.9% of patients were male; former or current smokers constituted 67.1% of the subjects. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (67.7%), and 50.3% of the patients underwent â‰¥ 2 previous treatments. Twenty-three patients (14.8%) were EGFR mutation- or ALK rearrangement-positive. The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.4-31.4%]; the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.06 (95% CI 1.893-4.21) and 10.25 (95% CI 5.39-15.11) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG performance status, EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement status, liver metastasis and PD-L1 proportion as independent predictors of OS. Furthermore, 61.9% of the patients had adverse events of any grade; 38.1% had immune-related adverse events that were associated with PFS and OS on multivariate analysis.Conclusions:The real-world ORR, PFS, OS, and adverse event profiles were comparable to previous clinical trials despite the patients' different baseline characteristics. Our findings can aid in establishing effective immunotherapeutic management of NSCLC in routine clinical practice.
