Previous studies demonstrated microRNA-185 (miR-185) as a tumor suppressive microRNA (miRNA) in various types of cancer. The current study aimed to verify this finding in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explored the downstream channel of miR-185-5p. We detected miR-185-5p and Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) mRNA and protein levels by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting in HCC tissues and cell lines. Luciferase reporter assay proved the direct relationship between miR-185-5p and ROCK2. Cell migration and invasion were assessed via Transwell assay. miR-185-5p level was reduced in HCC tissues and cell lines. miR-185-5p overexpression impeded migration and invasion of HCC cells. Moreover, miR-185-5p directly targeted ROCK2 which was repressed by miR-185-5p in HCC. In addition, ROCK2 contributed to cell metastasis of HCC. In summary, miR-185-5p inhibited cell metastasis of HCC by suppressing ROCK2. The novel miR-185/ROCK2 axis shows potential in improving the therapies of HCC and enhancing HCC survival.
