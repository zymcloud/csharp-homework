Percutaneous thermal ablation of hepatic tumors continues to play an integral role in the treatment of early-stage primary or secondary hepatic malignancies. Interventional radiologists must be familiar with potential complications of this procedure, associated risk factors, and methods for prevention. The authors report a devastating case of septic shock and death following percutaneous microwave ablation of a solitary hepatocellular carcinoma in a liver transplant patient with a bilioenteric anastomosis (BEA). We review the literature regarding prophylactic antibiotic regimens and bowel preparation prior to performing thermal ablation in patients with BEAs.
