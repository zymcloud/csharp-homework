Long noncoding RNAs have been reported to be essential regulators in several human diseases, including tumorigenesis. A recent report revealed that FLVCR1-AS1 promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, whether FLVCR1-AS1 is involved in lung cancer remains unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of FLVCR1-AS1 was increased in lung cancer tissues according to The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Similarly, FLVCR1-AS1 was significantly upregulated in lung cancer cell lines. Knockdown of FLVCR1-AS1 dramatically reduced the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of SPCA1 and A549. Mechanistically, we found that the expression levels of CTNNB1, SOX4, CCND1, CCND2, c-MYC, as well as nucleus β-catenin were decreased in lung cancer cells after FLVCR1-AS1 silencing. Thus, FLVCR1-AS1 positively regulates the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Overexpression of CTNNB1 reversed the effect of FLVCR1-AS1 knockdown on A549 cells. In sum, FLVCR1-AS1 silencing inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells by inhibiting the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
