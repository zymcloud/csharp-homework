Background:Limited information is available about hospitalization rates for cirrhosis in Australia.Methods:Using information on all hospital episodes of care for patients admitted to Queensland hospitals during 2008-2016, we report age-standardized hospitalization rates/10,000 person-years, in-hospital case-fatality rate among these admissions (n = 30,327), and examine the factors associated with hospital deaths using logistic regression analyses.Findings:Hospitalization rates increased from 8.50/10,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.18-8.82) to 11.21/10,000 (95%CI 10.87-11.54) between 2008 and 2016, and peaked in men aged 55-59 years (34.03/10,000) and in Indigenous Australians (32.79/10,000). The number of admissions increased by 61.7% from 2701 admissions in 2008 to 4367 in 2016. During the same period, the percentage increase varied by socioeconomic disadvantage (3.2%/year in the most affluent vs. 9.4%/year in the most disadvantaged quintile; p Interpretation:The increasing healthcare use by Australians with cirrhosis has resource and economic implications. Our data highlight the disproportionate impact of cirrhosis on Indigenous Australians and people from the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.Funding:Brisbane Diamantina Health Partners.
