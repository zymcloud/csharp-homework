Objectives:Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor) is a rare tumor entity, which is diagnosed late due to uncharacteristic symptoms. The therapeutic strategy for cure is still liver resection. Liver transplant in cases of locally irresectable tumors represents an alternative potential curative therapy for a select group of patients.Materials and methods:We present our data of 22 patients with irresectable Klatskin tumors who received transplants between 1996 and 2015. We analyzed relevant prognostic factors for the selection of patients to be transplanted to ensure an acceptable overall survival and reviewed known and established selection criteria.Results:Four factors (age, tumor size, serum level of carbohydrate antigen 19-9, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage) could be detected for possible patient selection. Positive lymph node status and advanced tumor stage according to the Union for International Cancer Control were confirmed as negative prognostic factors for survival after transplant.Conclusions:Liver transplant is a curative therapy for selected patients with irresectable Klatskin tumors, but further prospective studies are urgently needed.
