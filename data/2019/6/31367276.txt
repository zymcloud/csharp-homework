Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading malignancies worldwide. Early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma and its management in the form of liver transplantation offers an attractive treatment option. The Milan criteria, proposed by Mazzaferro et al, have been the standard for selecting patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for transplantation. Recently, several studies have shown that even patients selected outside the Milan criteria can undergo transplantation with a relatively good outcome. This article examines the currently existing criteria other than the Milan criteria and also evaluates use of alpha-fetoprotein and positron emission tomography scans to predict the chance of recurrence.
