Introduction: Curcuma wenyujin is a plant which belongs to the family of Zingiberaceae, found in South Asia and China. C. wenyujin is a major constituent in Chinese traditional medicine and is used to treat liver diseases, blood clots, and is also prescribed as a painkiller. C. wenyujin possesses antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antitumorogenic properties, and many researchers have proved the efficacy of C. wenyujin against various types of cancer. The major drawback of this historical drug is it's low bioavailability. Methods: This study synthesized gold nanoparticles using C. wenyujin and assessed its potency against in vitro renal cancer cells. The biosynthesized C. wenyujin gold nanoparticles (CWAuNPs) were characterized using UV-Spec, DLS, FTIR, SAED, TEM, EDAX, and Atomic Force analysis. The cytotoxicity of CWAuNPs against renal cancer cell lines A498 and SW-156 was assessed with MTT assay. The induction of apoptosis by CWAuNPs in A498 cell was measured using apoptotic staining DAPI, Rhodamine 123, and H2DCFDA. The apoptotic activity of CWAuNPs was further confirmed with flow cytometric analysis. The molecular mechanism of CWAuNPs was analyzed with qPCR and immunoblotting analysis of caspases, proapoptotic, and antiapoptotic proteins. Results: The characterization of results of synthesized CWAuNPs satisfy the distinctive properties of a potent nanodrug. The results of apoptotic staining techniques confirm the induction of CWAuNPs in A498 by increasing the apoptotic Caspase 3,9, Bid, and Bad, and decreasing the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, Bcl-xl expressions, which is authentically proven by the qPCR and immunoblotting analysis. Conclusion: In conclusion, these results confirmed that biosynthesized CWAuNPs is a potent anticancer agent which induces apoptosis in the A498 renal carcinoma cell line.
