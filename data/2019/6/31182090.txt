Background:Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is a rare hereditary kidney cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk of skin and uterine leiomyomatosis and kidney cancer. HLRCC-associated kidney cancer is a lethal disease with a highly aggressive behavior, and there is no standard treatment option for metastatic disease.Case presentation:Here, we report a 29-year-old patient with a locally advanced HLRCC-assiciated RCC. He was administrated temsirolimus initially, then underwent surgical removal of kidney, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, inferior vena cava and tumor thrombi. Unfortunately, multiple liver metastases were confirmed 1 month after surgery, so axitinib was given but failed immediately. We tried bevacizumab plus erlotinib, which achieved long-term good response lasting more than 18 months. He is alive with disease and maintains bevacizumab plus erlotinib treatment.Conclusion:The promising results obtained in this patient suggest that combined bevacizumab plus erlotinib may offer a valid treatment option for advanced HLRCC-associated kidney cancer, even after failures of mTOR inhibitor and/or VEGFR TKI based therapies.
