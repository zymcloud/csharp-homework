Background:The Wnt signaling pathway, an evolutionarily conserved molecular transduction cascade, has been identified as playing a pivotal role in various physiological and pathological processes of the liver, including homeostasis, regeneration, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to use a bibliometric method to evaluate the emerging trends on Wnt signaling in liver diseases.Methods:Articles were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. We used a bibliometric software, CiteSpace V 5.3.R4, to analyze the active countries or institutions in the research field, the landmark manuscripts, important subtopics, and evolution of scientific ideas.Results:In total, 1,768 manuscripts were published, and each was cited 33.12 times on average. The U.S. published most of the articles, and the most active center was the University of Pittsburgh. The top 5 landmark papers were identified by four bibliometric indexes including citation, burstness, centrality, and usage 2013. The clustering process divided the whole area into nine research subtopics, and the two major important subtopics were "liver zonation" and "HCC." Using the "Part-of-Speech" technique, 1,743 terms representing scientific ideas were identified. After 2008, the bursting phrases were "liver development," "progenitor cells," "hepatic stellate cells," "liver regeneration," "liver fibrosis," "epithelial-mesenchymal transition," and etc.Conclusion:Using bibliometric methods, we quantitatively summarized the advancements and emerging trends in Wnt signaling in liver diseases. These bibliometric findings may pioneer the future direction of this field in the next few years, and further studies are needed.
