The aim of the current study was to examine the preventive effect of green tea catechins on the transport of Benzo[a]pyrene (B[α]P) into the brain using an in vitro bio-mimic system coupled with sequential co-cultures. When 72 μM of catechins was pre-treated, cellular cytotoxicity induced by IC50 of B[α]P in human liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) was reduced by 27% and 26%, respectively. The cellular integrity measured in HBMECs, which was exposed to IC50 of B[α]P, slowly decreased. However, the pre-treatment of catechins retained cellular integrity that was 1.14 times higher than with the absence of catechins. Co-consumption of catechins reduced not only the bio-accessibility of B[α]P in digestive fluid, but it also decreased absorption of B[α]P in human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) with a HepG2 co-culture system. It was found that approximately a two times lower amount of B[α]P was transported via the blood-brain barrier (BBB) compared to only the B[α]P intake. These results are taken in conjunction with each other support that catechins could be able to prevent brain toxicity induced by B[α]P in the human body by limiting the bio-availability of B[α]P.
