Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas (CHC) are mixed tumours with both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) components. CHC prognosis is similar to intrahepatic CC (ICC) and worse than HCC; staging and treatment generally follow ICC algorithms. However, the molecular biology of CHC remains poorly characterised. We performed capture-based next-generation sequencing of 20 CHC and, for comparison, 10 ICC arising in cirrhosis. Intratumour heterogeneity was assessed by separately sequencing the HCC and CC components of nine CHC. CHC demonstrated molecular profiles similar to HCC, even in the CC component. CHC harboured recurrent alterations in TERT (80%), TP53 (80%), cell cycle genes (40%; CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN2A), receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras/PI3-kinase pathway genes (55%; MET, ERBB2, KRAS, PTEN), chromatin regulators (20%; ARID1A, ARID2) and Wnt pathway genes (20%; CTNNB1, AXIN, APC). No CHC had alterations in IDH1, IDH2, FGFR2 or BAP1, genes typically mutated in ICC. TERT promoter mutations were consistently identified in both HCC and CC components, supporting TERT alteration as an early event in CHC evolution. TP53 mutations were present in both components in slightly over half the TP53-altered cases. By contrast, focal amplifications of CCND1, MET and ERRB2, as well as Wnt pathway alterations, were most often exclusive to one component, suggesting that these are late events in CHC evolution. ICC in cirrhosis demonstrated alterations similar to ICC in non-cirrhotic liver, including in IDH1 or IDH2 (30%), CDKN2A (40%), FGFR2 (20%), PBRM1 (20%), ARID1A (10%) and BAP1 (10%). TERT promoter and TP53 mutation were present in only one ICC each. Our data demonstrate that CHC genetics are distinct from ICC (even in cirrhosis) and similar to HCC, which has diagnostic utility and implications for treatment.
