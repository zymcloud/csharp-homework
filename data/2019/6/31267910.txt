This study aims to provide some experience in diagnosis and treatment of unexpected gallbladder cancer (UGBC) and find the major risk factors. Retrospective data were collected and analyzed on 22 patients who were diagnosed with UGBC during or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy from January 2013 to January 2018 at our hospital. Average age of the patients was (60.2 Â± 12.8) years (range, 42-83 years). Among them, there were 6 men and 16 women. Gallbladder stones, atrophic gallbladder, uneven thickened wall of the gallbladder, and choledocholithiasis were found to be the major risk factors. Eight patients (36.4%) were diagnosed intraoperatively. Seven cases (31.8%) were at the T1 stage; of these, three were treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy; two were converted to cholecystectomy; and two underwent cholecystectomy, lymph node dissection, and liver resection. Eight (36.4%) T2 patients, five (22.7%) T3 patients, and one T4 patient had radical cholecystectomy. Partial cholecystectomy and cholecystotomy were carried out in another T4 patient. T1 patients did not receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Eleven had chemotherapy and four received chemoradiotherapy. The follow-up period ranged from six months to five years. The one-year survival rate for T1 to T4 patients was 100 per cent, 75 per cent, 40 per cent, and 0 per cent, respectively. A high index of clinical suspicion of UGBC is needed if one patient suffered from both gallbladder stones and choledocholithiasis with atrophic gallbladder or uneven thickened wall of the gallbladder preoperatively. To avoid more UGBC and reoperation, imaging examinations combined with tumor marker tests and intraoperative histopathologic examination are highly recommended.
