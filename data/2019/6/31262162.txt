Asafoetida resin has been reported for various biological activities but its use has been widely restricted owing to its pungent smell and pool water solubility.Aim:In vitro study of the anticancer potential of microwave-extracted essential oil (EO) of Ferula asafoetida.Materials and methods:The phytochemical investigation and in vitro cytotoxicity assessment was carried out in two human liver cancer cell lines. The expression of NFKB1, TGFB1, TNF, CASP3 was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Results:Ferula asafoetida EO contains high concentrations of dithiolane, which possess antiproliferative activity in human liver carcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and SK-Hep1) in a dose-dependent manner. The bioactive compounds in F. asafoetida are capable of induction of apoptosis and altered NF-kB and TGF-β signalling with increase in caspase-3 and TNF-α expression.Conclusion:Further elucidation of bioactive molecules and underlying mechanisms could lead to potential intervention in liver cancer in animal models. The safety and efficacy as well as the mode of EO action in animal models would be highly crucial.
