While the most compelling levels of evidence for the use of Yttrium-90 (90Y) radioembolization are in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, a growing body of literature supports its use in other primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. This includes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, as well as hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine cancer, ocular melanoma, and breast cancer. While is it not feasible to conduct prospective, randomized trials for radioembolization in the setting of these malignancies due to the low overall prevalence of liver-only disease, numerous single-arm studies in the last several years make a compelling argument for its use in select situations. This clinical update summarizes those findings.
