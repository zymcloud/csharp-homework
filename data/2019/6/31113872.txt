Objective: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) involves higher rates of recurrence and distant metastasis. The present study sought to characterize the risk factors for distant metastasis of TNBC.Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was exploited to enroll patients diagnosed with TNBC from 2010 to 2015. The eligible patients were dichotomized into locoregional and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Patients' demographics and tumor features, and treatment were evaluated to identify the risk factors for distant metastasis of primary TNBC. The categorical variables were examined by chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the risk factors for distant metastasis. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank tests.Results: We collected 26863 patients with primary TNBC, 1330 (5.0%) of them presented with distant metastasis. In the univariate analysis, all the variables indicated statistical significance. The significant variables were subsequently enlisted into the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Age > 50, higher clinical stage T and N, and tumor size > 5 cm were independent risk factors for distant metastasis of primary TNBC. Moreover, higher clinical stage T and stage N were independent risk factors for bone metastasis of the patients. TNBC patients with either bone or visceral metastasis have poor survival, with brain metastasis worst of all, though the OS difference was not statistically significant.Conclusions: TNBC patients with larger age, higher clinical stage, larger tumor size were more predisposed to have distant metastasis. Great attention should be paid to the prognosis of these patients with distant metastasis.
