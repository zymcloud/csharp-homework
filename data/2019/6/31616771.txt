Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a neuroendocrine skin cancer that typically presents as a painless erythematous nodule on body surfaces visible to the sun. Metastatic disease is typical to the lymph nodes, liver, and lungs. There are previous case reports of patients with metastases to the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach, small intestine, and pancreas. To our knowledge, there are only rare occurrences of metastases to the colon. We report a patient with a history of MCC treated with chemotherapy who presented with hematochezia and underwent a colonoscopy that showed a partially obstructing, edematous, friable 7-cm circumferential mass in the transverse colon. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of MCC that metastasized to the transverse colon.
