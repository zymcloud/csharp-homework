Purpose:To assess the change in hepatic arterial blood pressure (HABP) and computed tomography during hepatic arteriography (CTHA) using the double balloon technique.Materials and methods:Nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were enrolled. We inserted a 5.2-Fr balloon catheter into the common or proper hepatic artery and a 1.8-Fr microballoon catheter into the lobar or segmental artery feeding the HCC. HABPs were measured with the 1.8-Fr microballoon catheter (usual-HABP), with the 1.8-Fr balloon inflated (B-HABP), and with both the 5.2-Fr and 1.8-Fr balloons inflated (BB-HABP). CTHAs were performed via a 1.8-Fr microcatheter (usual-CTHA), with the 1.8-Fr balloon inflated (B-CTHA selective), with both the 5.2-Fr and 1.8-Fr balloons inflated (BB-CTHA selective), and via the 5.2-Fr catheter with the 1.8-Fr balloon inflated (B-CTHA whole) and with both the 5.2-Fr and 1.8-Fr balloons inflated (BB-CTHA whole).Results:In all cases, B-HABP was lower than usual-HABP. There was a decrease in BB-HABP in comparison with B-HABP in cases with occlusion of the proper hepatic artery. The contrast effect of B-CTHA selective increased in four cases. The contrast effect on B-CTHA whole remained in all cases.Conclusion:This technique can be useful in decreasing HABP and collateral blood flow from the adjacent hepatic segment.
