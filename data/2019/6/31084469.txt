Chronic inflammation is the main risk factor for induction of liver cirrhosis and also hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Although our knowledge is growing regarding molecular mechanisms of immune responses against viruses, the main mechanisms that lead to the progression of chronic inflammation and then CHB are yet to be clarified. IL-18 and IL-1β are the members of the IL-1 family and produced in the cytoplasm of a wide range of immune and nonimmune cells and activated by inflammasome pathways. The cytokines play key roles in the pathologies of CHB. IL-18 and IL-1β productions are altered in CHB patients. It has been hypothesized that the polymorphisms within IL-18 and IL-1β genes may be the main reasons for the induction of chronic inflammation in CHB patients. This review article discusses the related investigations regarding the main correlation between the polymorphisms within IL-18 and IL-1β genes and CHB pathogenesis.
