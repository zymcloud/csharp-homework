Pancreatectomy might confer a survival benefit in patients with metastatic tumors of the pancreas (MTPs); however, the optimal treatment for MTP has not been established. We reviewed six patients with MTP undergoing pancreatectomy and discussed the clinical features, surgical treatment, and survival. The sites of primary cancer included renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n = 5; 83.3%) and rectal cancer (n = 1; 16.7%). The median interval between the resection of the primary site and the development of MTP was 157 months (range, 16-180 months). Three (60.0%) of the five cases of MTP-originating RCC and a MTP-originating rectal cancer, biopsy was performed under endoscopic ultrasonography guidance and MTP was pathologically diagnosed. All patients with MTP originating from RCC have remained alive for 3, 13, 18, 18, and 113 months without recurrence after pancreatectomy. In contrast, the patient with MTP originating from rectal cancer developed multiple liver metastases at 7 months after pancreatectomy, and then underwent chemotherapy. A preoperative pathological diagnosis using biopsy under endoscopic ultrasonography guidance was indispensable for the treatment of MTP. Pancreatectomy for MTP conferred a survival benefit in patients with metastatic RCC, whereas a combination of pancreatectomy and chemotherapy might be necessary to improve the prognosis of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
