Background:Nomograms have been developed for the prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) and liver toxicity in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who are treated with pazopanib. The objectives of this study were to review clinical outcomes, to perform an external validation of these nomograms and to develop a new nomogram in Japanese patients.Methods:A retrospective chart review of 150 Japanese patients with advanced RCC who received pazopanib at Kobe University Hospital and affiliated hospitals from March 2014 to June 2017 was performed. We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of pazopanib using logistic regression analysis to analyze the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and PFS. For nomogram validation, concordance index (C-index) and calibration were used.Results:The median PFS and OS in this study was 13.1 and 37.4 months, respectively. Multivariate analyses identified prognostic factors for OS (number of metastasis, white blood cell (WBC) count and lactate dehydrogenase) and PFS (number of metastasis, WBC count). The C-index of nomograms for 12-month PFS was 0.598. The C-index of nomograms for liver toxicity was 0.558. A new Nomogram for predicting 12-month PFS for patients who received pazopanib was developed and performed internal validation. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.768.Conclusion:The clinical effect and safety of pazopanib reported in this study was similar to previous studies. This study suggests careful application of nomograms to Japanese patients treated with pazopanib. We have developed a new nomogram for predicting 12-month PFS with pazopanib therapy from Japanese patients.
