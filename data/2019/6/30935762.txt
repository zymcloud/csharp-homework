Aim:To elucidate whether the interaction between Anxa2 and Stat3 could promote the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and that high co-expression of Anxa2 and Stat3 could predict poor prognosis in HCC patients.Methods:We investigated Anxa2 and Stat3 expression using Western blot analysis in 4 HCC and adjacent nontumor tissues and using immunohistochemistry in 100 patients' paraffin sections. Then we assessed the expression of Stat3, Anxa2 and co-expression of Stat3 and Anxa2 with relevant clinical pathological parameters and their prognostic value in HCC patients. The recurrence and overall survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The prognostic analysis was carried out with univariate and multivariate Cox regressions models.Results:The incidence of high Stat3 expression in HCC tissues (35%) was significantly higher than that in non-HCC tissues (8%) (P 3 cm in diameter, multiple tumor number, and the presence of microvascular tumor thrombus were also significantly associated with recurrence in 100 patients. Then, all enrolled patients were divided into four groups according to IHC score of Stat3 and Anxa2, and the results indicated a significant difference in recurrence time between the subgroups (P 0.05).Conclusion:The expression of Stat3, Anxa2, or co-high-expression of the two proteins was associated with HCC recurrence and survival.
