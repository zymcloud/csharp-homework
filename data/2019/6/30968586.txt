Our previous work demonstrated cancer-testis (CT) genes as a new source of candidate driver of cancer. Recently, mounting evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with CT expression pattern could play a pivotal role in cancer biology. Here, we characterized a conserved CT long noncoding RNA (CT-lncRNA), PCAT6, which is expressed exclusively in the testis and is reactivated in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) tissues due to the highly frequent amplification. The expression in LIHC was correlated with clinical prognosis in TCGA data. Knockdown of PCAT6 could inhibit cell proliferation and migration in hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based on coexpression network revealed that PCAT6 was involved in similar cilium-related pathways in the testis and LIHC tissues. However, PCAT6 was mainly positively correlated with gametogenesis-related pathways in the testis but was coexpressed with mitotic cell cycle genes in LIHC. Together, our data demonstrated that CT-lncRNA PCAT6 represents the similarity and difference between tumorigenesis and gametogenesis. The CT expression pattern and important role in LIHC oncogenesis make PCAT6 an ideal target for LIHC diagnosis and therapy.
