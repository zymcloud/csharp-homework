Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the third major cause of cancer-associated mortality globally. Numerous studies have attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of HCC using various biomarkers. In the present study, two expression profiles datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE76427 and GSE84402) and data associated with liver cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were downloaded for integrated analysis. Five differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exhibiting high expression, including ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2C (UBE2C), topoisomerase II Î±, pituitary tumor transforming gene 1, glypican-3 and polycomb-repressive complex 1, were selected and considered as candidate genes. Enrichment analysis demonstrated that these genes were associated with Gene Ontology terms of cellular components and molecular functions, including regulation of apoptosis, stabilization of p53 and Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) (APC/C:Cdc20)-mediated degradation of Securin. The expression profiles of these genes in HCC, other human malignancies and different human HCC cell lines were validated using GSE14520, GSE3500 and TCGA data. The results confirmed the upregulation of UBE2C in tissues from patients with HCC or other human malignancies and human liver cancer cell lines, compared with the expression levels in the corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues and cell lines, respectively. Patients with HCC who exhibited an increased messenger RNA level of UBE2C exhibited a significantly shorter survival time. The results of the present study suggest that the overexpression of UBE2C may be used as a novel prognostic biomarker of HCC.
