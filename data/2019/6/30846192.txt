Background:To investigate the prognostic values of the change of α-fetoprotein within 1 week after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent curative hepatectomy as primary therapy at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University (Shanghai, China) from 2009 to 2011. We measured serum α-fetoprotein before (α-fetoprotein0) and 1 week after (α-fetoprotein7) hepatectomy, calculated change of α-fetoprotein, namely the α-fetoprotein response by the formula: AR = lgAFP7/lgAFP0 (lg = log10), analyzed the relationship between patient survival and α-fetoprotein response, and explored the potential clinical implications of the α-fetoprotein response. The results were validated in an independent cohort of patients from the same institute.Results:A total of 841 eligible patients were analyzed. We determined that the optimal cutoff value of the α-fetoprotein response was 0.8135 and subsequently classified patients from the exploration cohort into the α-fetoprotein responder (α-fetoprotein response ≤ 0.8135; n = 452) and α-fetoprotein nonresponder (α-fetoprotein response > 0.8135; n = 146). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the α-fetoprotein response independently predicted overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) time after resection (both P Conclusion:The α-fetoprotein response is a reliable and simple predictive marker for evaluating the oncological effect of surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma with positive α-fetoprotein before resection, independent of tumor features.
