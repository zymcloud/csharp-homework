Introduction: The inability to having comprehensive access to all pertinent imaging data related to an endovascular procedure in the sterile field is an unmet need, and its absence may have deleterious effects on decision-making, outcomes and workflow. Current image navigation solutions rely on traditional personal computing interfaces which are difficult to use in the sterile field. Innovative technological solutions are needed to address this need.Material and methods: Utilizing novel hardware and software integration, a human computer interaction (HCI) based platform has been developed through an iterative design and development process, that allows intuitive real-time access to imaging data in the sterile field. Following validation and pre-clinical testing, the platform has been introduced to the endovascular suite for clinical use.Results: Three prospective case-based observational reviews are presented that demonstrate the utility of touchless image navigation in the sterile field in facilitating decision-making and resource utilization during endovascular procedures, while avoiding the cognitive and workflow disturbances inherent in leaving the sterile field or involving non-scrubbed third persons in the image navigation process.Conclusion: Physician engagement and 'needs-based' technological innovation is needed to improve human computer interaction in the endovascular suite, in hopes of positively affecting procedural decision-making, outcomes, and workflow.
