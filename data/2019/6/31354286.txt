Purpose: It has been reported that miRNA-124 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, while lncRNA-UCA1 promotes HCC. The aim of this study is to find whether miRNA-124, as a tumor suppressor in HCC can inhibit lncRNA-UCA1 in HCC cell. Methods: Tumor tissues and adjacent healthy tissues were obtained from 66 patients diagnosed with HCC in Binzhou Medical University Hospital from January 2011 to January 2013. Cell proliferation assay, in vitro cell migration and invasion assay were applied for the research. Results: In the present study we found that miRNA-124 was downregulated, while lncRNA-UCA1 was upregulated in tumor tissues comparing to adjacent healthy tissues of HCC patients. Expression of miRNA-124 and lncRNA-UCA1 in tumor tissues were not affected by HBV or HCV infection. Analysis of followed-up data revealed that low miRNA-124 level and high lncRNA-UCA1 level were closely correlated with poor survival. Overexpression of miRNA-124 led to inhibited lncRNA-UCA1 expression in cells of HCC cell lines, while overexpression of lncRNA-UCA1 failed to significantly affect miRNA-124 expression. Expression levels of miRNA-124 and lncRNA-UCA1 were inversely and significantly correlated in tumor tissues but not in adjacent healthy tissues. Overexpression of miRNA-124 led to inhibited, while overexpression of lncRNA-UCA1 led to increased proliferation, migration and invasion rates of HCC cell lines. In addition, lncRNA-UCA1 overexpression attenuated the inhibitory effects of miRNA-124 overexpression on cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Conclusion: Therefore, miRNA-124 may inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cell in hepatocellular carcinoma by downregulating lncRNA-UCA1.
