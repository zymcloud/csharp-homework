Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has become one of the first-line standard treatments for intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as an effective treatment for metastatic hepatic carcinoma. The majority of TACE-related complications are mild and acceptable to patients. Compared with conventional (C)-TACE, drug-eluting bead (DEB)-TACE allows permanent embolization of blood vessels, a slow continuous release of anti-tumour drugs in a locally targeted manner, and reduction of the systemic release of anti-tumour drugs, so that their adverse effects are significantly reduced. The general consensus is that DEB-TACE is safer and better tolerated by patients than C-TACE because serious complications after DEB-TACE are rarely reported. This current case report describes a rare case of diffuse biliary peritonitis secondary to rupture of a hepatic tumour after DEB-TACE. After the procedure, the patient presented with progressively worsening upper abdominal pain. As conventional management methods for the suspected tumour rupture failed, an emergency laparotomy was performed to remove the metastatic mass of differentiated hepatic adenocarcinoma. The patient remains under surveillance with no further complications. In our opinion, although DEB-TACE is safe and rarely has serious complications, caution should be exercised when this method is used to treat tumours that are located close to the liver surface.
