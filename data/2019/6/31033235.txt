Background:Accompanied by HBV infection, HBV mutations gradually occur because HBV polymerase appears proofread deficiencies. In our previous study, we have identified that EnhII/BCP/PC mutations and genotype C of HBV DNA were associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. In this study, we extend our research to explore HCC prognosis associated genotype and mutations in EnhII/BCP/PC regions.Methods:We designed a case-cohort study of 331 HCC patients to evaluate the effects of the HBV genotypes and mutations on HCC survival. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used for the analyses.Results:Results showed that genotype C, which was more frequent in HBV-related HCC (77.4%), presented a negative signal with HCC survival. Interestingly, we detected a significant association between EnhII/BCP/PC mutation nt1753 and HCC prognosis (Log-rank P = 0.034). Subgroup analysis revealed that this risk effect was more pronounced in non-B genotype (P = 0.090 for heterogeneity test). We also detected a borderline multiplicative interaction between genotypes of nt1753 and HBV genotype on HCC survival (P for interaction = 0.069).Conclusions:These findings indicated that, in Chinese population, nt1753 in EnhII/BCP/PC region might be a novel marker for HCC prognosis.
