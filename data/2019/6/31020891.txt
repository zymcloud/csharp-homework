Objective:This study was performed to determine the relationship between the minimum distance from the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) needle tip to the tumor and local tumor progression (LTP) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules and identify prognostic factors for LTP.Methods:We reviewed 197 patients (197 nodules) who underwent RFA after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for HCC from January 2010 to January 2015. Three-dimensional registration of images was used to calculate the minimum distance from the tip to the tumor. We then divided the minimum distance into two groups: Results:The cumulative 1-year LTP rates in the Conclusions:A minimum distance of 2 mm from the needle tip to the tumor should be completely ablated along with the tumor.
