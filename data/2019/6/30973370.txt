Objectives:The survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) has been increasing over recent decades due to improvements in chemotherapy and surgery. There is a need to refine prognostic information to more accurately predict survival as patients survive for any given length of time to assist multidisciplinary cancer management teams in treatment decisions.Materials and methods:We performed a single center retrospective analysis of patients treated with metastatic CRC (unresectable and resectable) who survived >24 months between 2005 and 2015 (N=155). Patient tumor and treatment related variables were collected. Overall survival (OS) estimates conditional on surviving >24 months were compared with actuarial survival estimates of a cohort of patients (33,104 resected, 39,382 unresected) from the National Cancer Database (NCDB).Results:With a median follow-up of 44.2 months, the median OS of resected patients (n=86) was not reached. The median OS of unresected patients was 75.9 months. The conditional survival probabilities of living 1, 2, or 3 years longer after 24 months of survival are 92%, 72%, and 52%, respectively, in unresectable patients and 98%, 92%, and 89% in patients who were resected. The corresponding NCDB 1, 2, and 3 year actuarial survival was 38%, 20%, and 11% for unresected patients and 68%, 46%, and 32% for resected.Conclusions:These results indicate that CRC patients who survive 24 months with metastatic colorectal cancer have an excellent prognosis and surgery may be appropriate in a subset of patients initially deemed unresectable.
