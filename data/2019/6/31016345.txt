Purpose of review:To review the current status and ideal time interval of the combination therapy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and local ablation for patients with HCCs.Recent findings:In recent years, local ablation has been proposed as an alternative curative treatment in the management of HCC. Additionally, many treatment options are available including TACE molecular targeted agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Similar overall survival rates and prognoses have been obtained with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) microwave ablation (MWA) and cryoablation for patients with HCCs up to 3 cm in diameter. Yet, MWA has shown superiority in treating large HCCs while cryoablation has several advantages compared with RFA or MWA. Furthermore, the treatment strategy of TACE combined with local ablation is widely accepted by many physicians in order to further increase the survival rate and improve the prognosis of patients with HCCs. However, the time interval between the two sessions of combination therapy remains uncertain in the current guidelines. Combination therapy of TACE and local ablation has advantages on survival and prognosis in patients with HCC compared with monotherapy. Good patient selection for the right modality needs to be carried out to guarantee the most efficacious treatment for HCC patients. Further studies are needed to find the ideal time interval between TACE and local ablation for HCC patients.
