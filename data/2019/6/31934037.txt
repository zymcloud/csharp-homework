Epithelial ovarian cancer is one of the most common causes of gynecological cancer deaths. The knockdown of LncRNA PCAT-1 has been reported to suppress tumor growth in various kinds of cancers, including esophageal cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its function in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is still unclear. In the present study, the expression of LncRNA PCAT-1 was investigated. The results indicate that the expression of LncRNA PCAT-1 is up-regulated in EOC tissues compared with non-cancer controls by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-qPCR), and its higher expression is always associated with larger tumor sizes and advanced tumor grades in patients with EOC. In addition, silencing PCAT-1 in the EOC cell lines SKOV3 and OVCAR3 significantly inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion, which is also shown by cell cycle assays, as the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase is dramatically increased after knocking down PCAT1. Finally, it is observed that PCAT-1's knockdown significantly decreased the levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4 protein expression. Taken together, LncRNA PCAT-1's oncogenic role in EOC by mediating cyclin D1/CDK4 is demonstrated, indicating it is a potential target for EOC treatment.
