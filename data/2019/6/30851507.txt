Ten previously undescribed triterpenoid congeners, namely irpeksolactins A-J, together with eighteen known ones, were isolated from the fruiting bodies of the rainforest-dwelling medicinal fungus Irpex lacteus. The structures of all the isolates were characterized by extensive spectroscopic approaches, including 1D & 2D NMR and MS spectroscopic methods. Irpeksolactin J displayed selective and weak cytotoxicity against the human lung cancer cell line A549 and the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721.
