Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common fatal type of malignant tumor that has highly metastatic and recurrent properties. Fisetin is a natural flavonoid found in various vegetables and fruits which exhibits anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as other effects. Thus, we hypothesized that fisetin can act as an adjuvant therapy in cancer or drug-resistant cancer cells, and further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of drug-resistance in HCC cells. We found that fisetin effectively inhibited the cell viability of not only parental cells but also histone deacetylase inhibitors-resistant (HDACis-R) cells and enhanced the chemosensitivity of HCC cells. Interestingly, fisetin did not induce cell apoptosis through the activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor of protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, but rather through the non-canonical pathway of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated suppression of eIF2α phosphorylation. Moreover, fisetin-induced cell apoptosis was reversed by treatment with PP1 activator or eIF2α siRNA in HCC cells. Based on these observations, we suggest that PP1-eIF2α pathways are significantly involved in the effect of fisetin on HCC apoptosis. Thus, fisetin may act as a novel anticancer drug and new chemotherapy adjuvant which can improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and diminish their side-effects.
