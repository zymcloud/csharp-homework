Aims:The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Xiaoaiping on the stemness of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vivo and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism.Methods:A subcutaneous xenograft nude mouse model was established using Hep3B-derived HCC cells. The mice were randomly assigned to the 100 mg/kg Xiaoaiping or 100 μL/20 g normal saline (control) groups (n =3/sex/group) for daily intragastric administration for 14 days. The tumor size was closely monitored during the dosing phase. After the treatment period, the tumor tissues were weighed and harvested for mRNA and protein isolation. qPCR and Western blotting were used to evaluate the expression of cancer stemness markers (epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM], cluster of differentiation [CD13], CD90, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 [ALDH1], CD44, and CD45), totipotency factors (sex determining region Y-box 2 [Sox2], Nanog, and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 [Oct4]), and genes involved in the Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, and Hippo signaling pathways.Key findings:The tumor size and weight were significantly reduced in the nude mice treated with 100 mg/kg Xiaoaiping when compared with the controls. The Xiaoaiping effects on the stemness markers and totipotency factors included decreased expression of EpCAM, CD24, CD47, Sox2, Oct4, and sal-like protein 4 (SALL4), as well as increased expression of CD13 and ALDH1. In addition, Xiaoaiping inhibited the Hippo, Wnt, and Hedgehog signaling pathways.Conclusion:Xiaoaiping significantly inhibited the growth of HCC xenograft in nude mice. These antitumor effects may be mediated by modulating the expression of multiple stemness markers and totipotency factors and inhibition of the Hippo, Wnt, and Hedgehog signaling pathways.
