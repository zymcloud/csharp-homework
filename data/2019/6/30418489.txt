Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is multifunctional cytokine that is involved in the coordination and regulation of many cellular homeostatic processes. Compromised TGFβ activity has been attributed to promotion of human cancers. Recent studies have identified a role for TGFβ in response to radiation-induced DNA damage, suggesting a link between TGFβ and the DNA damage response with implications for cancer development. In this study, the effects of TGFβ on promoting the repair of bulky DNA damage, through modulation of nucleotide excision repair (NER), were investigated. We show that treatment of cells with exogenous TGFβ leads to enhanced repair of DNA damage formed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ultraviolet-C radiation; similarly, cells with constitutively activated endogenous TGFβ signaling show comparable responses. This effect of TGFβ is independent of the cell cycle. The response to TGFβ is decreased in cells that have compromised TGFβ signaling through RNA interference of Smad4 and is decreased in NER-deficient cells and cells with compromised NER through RNA interference of excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1). Increased interaction and nuclear localization of ERCC1/xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) F and ERCC1/XPA proteins is observed after TGFβ treatment. Our study represents the first experimental evidence of a role for TGFβ in the repair of bulky DNA damage resulting from promotion of the interaction and localization of repair protein complexes involved in the incision step of NER.
