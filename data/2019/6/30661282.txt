Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence is high in The Gambia, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the main cause. People coinfected with HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) have an even greater risk of HCC and cirrhosis. Using a new HDV quantitative microarray antibody capture (Q-MAC) assay, we evaluated the association between HDV infection and HCC or cirrhosis among participants in The Gambia Liver Cancer Study. In this case-control study, cases had HCC (n = 312) or cirrhosis (n = 119). Controls (n = 470) had no clinical evidence of liver disease and normal serum alpha-foetoprotein. Participants were previously tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); we tested HBsAg+ specimens by HDV Q-MAC, western blot and RNA assays. We evaluated separate cut-offs of the Q-MAC assay for predicting anti-HDV and RNA positivity. Q-MAC correctly identified 29/29 subjects who were western blot-positive (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 99.4%) and 16/17 who were RNA-positive (sensitivity = 94.1%, specificity = 100%). Compared to controls, cases more often had HBV monoinfection (HBsAg+/HDV RNA-; 54.1% vs 17.0%; odds ratio [OR] = 6.28; P
