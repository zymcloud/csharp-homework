Approximately 500 million people worldwide are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), and are therefore at an increased risk for developing fatal liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The intracellular antiviral responses induced by interferon (IFN)-alpha/-beta and/or IFN-gamma play critical roles in the pathogenesis of HBV and HCV infection, and the function of IFN-lambda in the host immune response to these viruses is beginning to be revealed. A better understanding of how IFN-lambda influences HBV or HCV persistence is not only important for understanding the mechanisms of chronic virus infection, but also may lead to new approaches for improved antiviral therapies.
