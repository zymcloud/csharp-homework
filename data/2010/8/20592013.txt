Purpose:Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) have an unpredictable clinical course, and molecular classification could provide better insights into prognosis and patient-directed therapy. We hypothesized that in HCC, certain microenvironmental regions exist with a characteristic gene expression related to chronic hypoxia which would induce aggressive behavior.Experimental design:We determined the gene expression pattern for human HepG2 liver cells under chronic hypoxia by microarray analysis. Differentially expressed genes were selected and their clinical values were assessed. In our hypothesis-driven analysis, we included available independent microarray studies of patients with HCC in one single analysis. Three microarray studies encompassing 272 patients were used as training sets to determine a minimal prognostic gene set, and one recent study of 91 patients was used for validation.Results:Using computational methods, we identified seven genes (out of 3,592 differentially expressed under chronic hypoxia) that showed correlation with poor prognostic indicators in all three training sets (65/139/73 patients) and this was validated in a fourth data set (91 patients). Retrospectively, the seven-gene set was associated with poor survival (hazard ratio, 1.39; P = 0.007) and early recurrence (hazard ratio, 2.92; P = 0.007) in 135 patients. Moreover, using a hypoxia score based on this seven-gene set, we found that patients with a score of >0.35 (n = 42) had a median survival of 307 days, whereas patients with a score of Conclusions:We identified a unique, liver-specific, seven-gene signature associated with chronic hypoxia that correlates with poor prognosis in HCCs.
