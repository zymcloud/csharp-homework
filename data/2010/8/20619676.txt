Purpose:To assess the predictors of hypersensitivity reaction to chemoembolization procedures with cisplatin and Lipiodol suspension for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:Between February 2005 and December 2008, 434 patients with HCC were treated with chemoembolization with a cisplatin and Lipiodol suspension. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions as an adverse effect and their predictors by multivariate logistic regression analyses.Results:In total, 847 chemoembolization procedures were carried out in 434 patients. The median number of procedures per patient was 2 (range, 1-12). Mean dose of cisplatin per chemoembolization session was 27 mg (range, 15.0-80.0 mg), and the median total dose of cisplatin per patient was 55 mg (range, 5.0-560.0 mg). Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 14 patients (1.7%). The median number of chemoembolization procedures in these patients was 7 (range, 3-10). Mean dose of cisplatin per session was 22 mg (range, 9.2-35.7 mg), and the median total dose of cisplatin was 134 mg (range, 37-286 mg). On multivariate analysis, the only parameter that showed an independent association with hypersensitivity reactions was the performance of 3 or more than three chemoembolization procedures.Conclusions:Performance of more than three chemoembolization procedures with a cisplatin and Lipiodol suspension was found to be independently associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Patients undergoing repeated chemoembolization procedures with cisplatin and Lipiodol suspension may experience hypersensitivity reactions as an adverse effect.
