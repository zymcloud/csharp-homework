Aim:Hepatic resections for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic liver are characterized by early recurrence and poor survival. In this study, we analyzed several factors affecting both survival and recurrence after hepatic resection.Patients and methods:From October 1995 to April 2007, 550 patients underwent hepatic resections, of which, 175 patients had HCC in cirrhotic liver in Gastroenterology Surgical Center, Mansoura University, Egypt. There were 131 males (74.9%) and 44 females (25.1%) with a mean age of 54.8 +/- 9.2 years (ranges from 26 to 75 years).Results:Most of our patients were in Child's Pugh class A (86.9%). Major hepatic resection was done for 65 patients (37.1%), segmentectomy was done for 62 patients (35.4%), and localized resection was done for 48 patients (27.4%). Hospital mortality occurred in 16 (9.1%) patients, while hospital morbidity occurred in 40% of patients. The 1, 3, and 5 years survival were 68.6%, 29.6%, and 10.7%, respectively. The prognostic factors affecting recurrence were multifactorial, and the univariate analysis showed that multifocality of the tumor (p = 0.006), capsule (p = 0.001), staging (p = 0.001), blood transfusion (p = 0.02), infiltration of the cut margin (p = 0.001), vascular invasion (p = 0.006), and lymph nodes infiltration (p = 0.014) affect the recurrence rate, while with multivariate analysis, only cut margin was significantly affecting the recurrence (p = 0.026). Also, factors that significantly predicted survival were preoperative serum albumin (p = 0.005), tumor differentiation (p = 0.008), staging (p = 0.001), tumor's capsule (p = 0.001), cut margin (p = 0.031), vascular invasion (p = 0.049), and operative blood transfusion (p = 0.001). However, tumor differentiation (p = 0.048) was the only independent factor on multivariate analysis affecting long-term survival.Conclusion:In our experience, the prognostic factors after resection for recurrence and survival are different and multifactorial. However, resection of HCC in cirrhotic liver with preserved liver function is the treatment of choice in the present time and can be done with favorable results.
