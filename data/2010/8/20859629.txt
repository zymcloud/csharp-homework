Purpose:We have previously reported the clinical efficacy of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion containing anticancer agent. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) of W/O/W emulsion via a cystic artery for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:TAI of a W/O/W emulsion was performed at our institute in five patients with Stage III or IV HCC with blood supply from the cystic artery. In all patients, 2-12 ml/O/W emulsion was infused via a cystic artery. Therapeutic effects and complications were evaluated in these patients.Results:Of the five patients treated, one achieved a complete response and two achieved a partial response. After treatment, acute cholecystitis or gallbladder ischemia that required treatment was not encountered in any patient.Conclusions:W/O/W emulsion can be safely infused via a cystic artery without major complications; it is a good therapeutic option for the patients with advanced HCC fed by a cystic artery.
