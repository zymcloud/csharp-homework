The consequences of chronic hepatitis B virus infection include hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis. Effective antiviral therapy in patients with hepatitis B with advanced liver disease with viral suppression and sustained HBeAg seroconversion (where applicable) may abort hepatic decompensation, diminish hepatocellular risk, and reduce the risk of viral recurrence after transplantation. Overt hepatic decompensation is an indication for referral to a transplant center.
