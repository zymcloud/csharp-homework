Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone), a natural anthraquinone derivative found in several herbal medicines, is highly active in suppressing the proliferation of various tumor cells such as breast, hepatocellular, and lung cancer cells under in vitro conditions. The mechanism of emodin-induced apoptosis in esophagus carcinoma cells, EC-109, is not completely understood. In this study, EC-109 cells treated with emodin underwent rapid apoptosis as judged by morphological changes and flow cytometry analysis. The addition of emodin to EC-109 cells led to the inhibition of growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Fluorescence measurements of cells indicated that the intracellular pH (pHi) decreased significantly by 0.47-0.78 units. The results obtained from flow cytometry suggested that bursts of reactive oxygen species took place after the application of emodin. The present study indicates that emodin may be a strong anticancer drug against esophagus cancer cells by causing various early events leading to growth inhibition, including the production of reactive oxygen species and decrease of pHi, which may result in cellular apoptosis.
