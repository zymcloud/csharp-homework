Infection by hepatitis B virus is the main cause of liver cirrhosis in Africa. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate clinical and epidemiological features as well as factors related to death in cirrhosis patients admitted to the National University Hospital in Cotonou, Benin.Methods:The files of patients admitted from January 1 to December 31, 2004 were reviewed.Results:Out of the 230 useable files reviewed, a total of 52 involved patients were admitted for liver cirrhosis. The male/female sex ratio was 2.25 and mean age was 49 years. The proportion of unemployed and salaried patients was 42.3% and 28.8% respectively. Hepatitis B and alcohol consumption were the main etiological factors: 53.3% and 23.2% respectively. The main reasons for hospitalization were asthenia in 73% of cases, abdominal pain in 57%, and digestive bleeding in 21%. The revealing manifestations were ascitis (75%), jaundice (71.7%), and hepatocellular carcinoma (42.3%). Higher risk for in-hospital death (42.3%) was correlated with male gender, salaried employment, and presentation with jaundice, ascitis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk of death during hospitalization was higher for patients who were of male gender, working as salaried employees and admitted for the first time with jaundice, ascitis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:A program for mass vaccination of children against hepatitis B virus is needed to prevent cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A campaign against alcohol abuse could reduce cirrhosis due to alcohol consumption.
