Study design:A report of 4 cases of spinal osteotomy performed under the guidance of a computer-assisted navigation system and a technical note about the use of the navigation system for spinal osteotomy.Objective:To document the surgical technique and usefulness of computer-assisted surgery for spinal osteotomy.Summary of background data:A computer-assisted navigation system provides accurate 3-dimensional (3D) real-time surgical information during the operation. Although there are many reports on the accuracy and usefulness of a navigation system for pedicle screw placement, there are few reports on the application for spinal osteotomy.Methods:We report on 4 complex cases including 3 solitary malignant spinal tumors and 1 spinal kyphotic deformity of ankylosing spondylitis, which were treated surgically using a computer-assisted spinal osteotomy. The surgical technique and postoperative clinical and radiologic results are presented.Results:3D spinal osteotomy under the guidance of a computer-assisted navigation system was performed successfully in 4 patients. All malignant tumors were resected en bloc, and the spinal deformity was corrected precisely according to the preoperative plan. Pathologic analysis confirmed the en bloc resection without tumor exposure in the 3 patients with a spinal tumor.Conclusion:The use of a computer-assisted navigation system will help ensure the safety and efficacy of a complex 3D spinal osteotomy.
