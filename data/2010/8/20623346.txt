Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are uncommon malignancies, highly resistant to chemotherapy, that have emerged as attractive platforms for evaluating novel targeted regimens. Everolimus is an oral rapamycin derivative within the mammalian target of rapamycin class of agents. Preclinical series have shown that everolimus exhibits anticancer effects in RCC and NET cell lines. A phase 3 placebo-controlled study in advanced clear-cell RCC, known as RECORD-1 (for "REnal Cell cancer treatment with Oral RAD001 given Daily"), documented that everolimus stabilizes tumor progression, prolongs progression-free survival and has acceptable tolerability in patients previously treated with the multikinase inhibitors sunitinib and/or sorafenib. Everolimus has been granted regulatory approval for use in sunitinib-pretreated and/or sorafenib-pretreated advanced RCC and incorporated into clinical practice guidelines, and the RECORD-1 safety data are being used to develop recommendations for managing clinically important adverse events in everolimus-treated patients. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating everolimus as earlier RCC therapy (first-line for advanced disease and as neoadjuvant therapy), in non-clear-cell tumors, and in combination with various other approved or investigational targeted therapies for RCC. Regarding advanced NET, recently published phase 2 data support the ability of everolimus to improve disease control in patients with advanced NET as monotherapy or in combination with somatostatin analogue therapy, octreotide long-acting release (LAR). Forthcoming data from phase 3 placebo-controlled trials of everolimus, one focused on monotherapy for pancreatic NET and the other on combination use with octreotide LAR for patients with advanced NET and a history of carcinoid syndrome, will provide insight into its future place in NET therapy. The results of a number of ongoing phase 3 evaluations of everolimus will determine its broader applicability in treating breast cancer (in combination with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy), several advanced gastrointestinal cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lymphoma (in the adjuvant setting), as well as the various lesions associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex tumor suppressor gene.
