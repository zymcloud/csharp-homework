Oral cancer is the eighth most prevalent cancer worldwide. It causes significant mortality and morbidity rates, which have motivated the search for prognostic factors to better tailor the individual management of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients. Nucleophosmin is a multifunctional protein that is involved in many cellular activities, such as, regulation of the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and p14(ARF) and is associated with proliferative and growth suppressive roles in the cell. Nucleophosmin is overexpressed in many solid tumors in human, including tumors of the colon, liver, stomach, ovary, and prostate. In this study, we analyzed the expression of nucleophosmin, Ki-67, and p53 by immunohistochemistry in oral squamous cell carcinomas. Less than 10% of nuclear staining was observed in 90.3%, 50.6%, and 65.3% of the cases for nucleophosmin, p53, and Ki-67, respectively. Expression of p53 was not significantly associated with any of the clinicopathologic parameters analyzed. Increased expression of Ki-67 was associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis (P < .0001), advanced stages of disease (P = .0030), tumors occurring in the floor of mouth (P = .0018), and moderately/well-differentiated tumors (P = .0287). Local recurrence was associated with higher expression of nucleophosmin (P = .0233), and disease-free survival rate was significantly better in patients with low expression of nucleophosmin. Multivariate analysis suggested that expression of nucleophosmin could be an independent prognostic factor for oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.
