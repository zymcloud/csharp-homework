During recent years, we have experienced an increased detection of previously unsuspected liver masses in otherwise asymptomatic patients owing to the widespread application of imaging techniques. Regardless of the malignant or cystic tissues, a remarkable percentage of these masses are represented by benign solid neoplasms. Treatment of benign liver tumors still represents a major concern in the hepatic surgery field. Indications for surgery have remained unchanged for many years, but the laparoscopic approach could determine in some cases a broadening of indications, which may result in overtreatment. In this article, the main surgical indication for hepatic hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma are discussed with regard to the most recent advancements in literature. In addition, a separate section deals with the role of laparoscopy in the treatment of benign liver neoplasms.
