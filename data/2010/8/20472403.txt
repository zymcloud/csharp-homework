Hospital-associated invasive pneumococcal disease (HA-IPD) is infrequently reported. A retrospective surveillance of IPD in a medical centre in Taiwan was conducted from 2000 to 2008 to compare the clinical and microbiological characteristics of HA-IPD and community-associated IPD (CA-IPD). HA-IPD was identified in 37 patients, comprising 12.3% of the 302 hospitalised patients with IPD. Patients with HA-IPD were more likely to have solid-organ cancer (40.5% vs. 16.6%; P=0.001) or to have received immunosuppressive therapy (56.8% vs. 26.8%; P<0.001). The 30-day mortality rate of HA-IPD was significantly higher than that of CA-IPD (40.5% vs. 16.2%; P=0.001). Age >or=65 years [odds ratio (OR)=2.10; P=0.033], HA-IPD (OR=2.90; P=0.009) and liver cirrhosis (OR=3.19; P=0.009) were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. No significant differences in serotype distribution or in susceptible rates to penicillin (18.2% vs. 32.6%; P=0.14) and cefotaxime (60.6% vs. 67.8%; P=0.53) were found between HA-IPD and CA-IPD isolates. Similar prevalences of the serotypes included in the pneumococcal vaccines were found in isolates from patients with HA-IPD and CA-IPD. Among patients with HA-IPD and CA-IPD, 26 (78.8%) and 172 (73.2%) (P=0.45) had isolates of serotypes included in the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and 30 (90.9%) and 224 (95.3%) (P=0.96) had isolates of serotypes included in the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, respectively. In summary, this study found that HA-IPD and CA-IPD were not significantly different with regard to serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility in Taiwan. Patients with HA-IPD have a higher mortality rate, and pneumococcal vaccination for patients at increased risk for HA-IPD should be encouraged.
