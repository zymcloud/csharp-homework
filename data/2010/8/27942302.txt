Primary small cell carcinoma of the liver is very rare tumor. Till date only 12 cases have been reported in the English literature. We are reporting a case of primary small cell carcinoma of the liver in a female patient. She had 13 cm x 7 cm tumor in the right lobe of liver and fine needle aspiration cytology revealed features of small cell carcinoma. After ruling primary from elsewhere, patient underwent central bisectionectomy of the liver and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of primary small cell carcinoma of the liver. On immunohistochemistry examination, the tumor was positive for Neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin but negative for Thyroid transcription factor 1 and Hep-Par 1. Here we discuss the clinical course and treatment of primary small cell carcinoma of the liver in our case and review the literature.
