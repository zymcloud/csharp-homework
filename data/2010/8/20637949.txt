Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 80% of all primary liver cancers and ranks globally as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. Partial hepatectomy remains the best treatment option for select patients with HCC without cirrhosis. Liver transplantation is well established as the gold standard for patients with HCC and cirrhosis in the absence of extrahepatic spread and macrovascular invasion. Local regional therapy is indicated in select patients who are not surgical candidates, and its role as adjuvant therapy remains to be clarified by prospective studies.
