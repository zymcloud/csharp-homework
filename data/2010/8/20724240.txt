Background:Distant spread from renal cell carcinoma is commonly found in the liver and lung. Metastatic involvement of any other gastro-intestinal organ (duodenum, other kidney, adrenal gland) is unexpected. However, clear cell renal carcinoma is known to cause pancreatic metastasis.Methods:The authors present the case of a successfully operated 82- year-old man, who was operated for a metastatic tumor in his pancreas. 8 years prior to his current hospitalization, a left sided nephrectomy was performed for renal cell carcinoma. The CT scan revealed a tumor localised in the tail of the pancreas. Distal pancreas resection was performed with splenectomy. Histology revealed clear cell renal carcinoma metastasis.Conclusions:pancreatic tumors are mostly primaries. Renal cell carcinoma generally gives hepatic and pulmonary metastases. However, clear cell renal carcinoma is known to give pancreatic metastasis, too.
