Background:The mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) gene represents one of the central nodes in the p53 pathway. A naturally occurring T/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the intronic promoter of MDM2, SNP309 (rs2279744), was shown to influence MDM2 expression and p53 activity. SNP in the promoter region of MDM2 gene has recently been shown to be associated with accelerated tumor formation in both hereditary and sporadic cancers in humans. In this study, we aim to evaluate the association of SNP309 with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development among Turkish population.Methods:MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism was investigated in 110 confirmed subjects with HCC and 110 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol consumption by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay.Results:The allele frequencies of case subjects (T, 0.48; G, 0.52) were significantly different from those of control subjects (T, 0.65; G, 0.35) (p=0.003). The proportion of GG genotype of the SNP309 in patients with HCC (26%) was significantly higher than that in patients without HCC (14%). We observed that compared with the TT genotype, the genotypes containing G allele [TG (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.18-4.07; p=0.013) or GG (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.65-8.00; p=0.001)] were associated with significant increased susceptibility to HCC.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that the MDM2 promoter SNP309 G allele is associated with presence of HCC in Turkish population.
