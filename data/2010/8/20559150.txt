Background:Inhibition of angiogenesis is a novel strategy for the treatment of cancer. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of cediranib, a potent small molecule inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, in patients with refractory or recurrent small cell lung cancer (SCLC).Methods:Patients with SCLC with progression after prior platinum-based chemotherapy only; performance status (PS) of 0 to 2; and adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function were included. The dose of cediranib was 45 mg PO once a day for the first 12 patients and was reduced to 30 mg PO once a day for the subsequent patients because of intolerance of the higher dose. Treatment was given on a daily continuous schedule. The primary end point was determination of the response rate.Results:Twenty-five patients were enrolled. Patient characteristics were as follows: 13 men; median age 61 years; PS 0 (12 pts), PS 1 (12 pts). A median of two cycles were administered. Salient grade 3/4 toxicities were fatigue, diarrhea, hypertension, proteinuria, and elevated liver enzymes. Tolerability was better with the 30 mg dose once a day. Nine patients had stable disease, but none had a confirmed partial response. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 2 and 6 months, respectively. Response criteria to proceed to full accrual were not met. Increase in circulating endothelial cell count was noted at the time of progression in several patients.Conclusions:Cediranib failed to demonstrate objective responses in recurrent or refractory SCLC at the dose and schedule evaluated. The 45 mg dose was intolerable in a majority of SCLC patients.
