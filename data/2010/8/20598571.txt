Purpose:To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of chemoembolization for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter.Materials and methods:Chemoembolization was performed in 30 patients with HCCs with a largest diameter of more than 5 cm with three or fewer lesions and no portal vein tumor thrombus. The mean maximum tumor diameter was 7.7 cm +/- 2.4. When the tumor was extremely large and had multiple feeding arteries, stepwise chemoembolization sessions at intervals of 3-10 weeks were performed. In addition, extrahepatic collateral supply was identified and embolized. Local therapeutic effects, survival rates, and complications were analyzed.Results:The mean follow-up period was 33.8 months +/- 24.1. One to 13 chemoembolization sessions (mean, 4.0 sessions +/- 3.0) were performed in each patient. Additionally, 62 collateral vessels were embolized in 21 patients, including 22 vessels in 14 patients at the initial procedure. Early tumor response rate 2-3 months after treatment was 43.3% by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors. Complete radiologic response was achieved in 19 patients. Eleven patients died between 4 and 61 months after treatment (mean, 27.2 months +/- 21.8), including four deaths unrelated to hepatic causes. Nineteen patients have survived for 6-103 months (mean, 37.5 months +/- 25.2). Overall and progression free-survival rates at 1, 3, and 6 years were 82.3% and 66.0%, 73.9% and 57.6%, and 32.9% and 34.2%, respectively. Three infectious complications developed and were managed by interventions.Conclusions:Chemoembolization was effective for large HCCs, although there is a risk of infectious complications after the procedure.
