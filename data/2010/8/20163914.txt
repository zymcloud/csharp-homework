A physiologically stable gold compound, gold(III) meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (gold-1a), has been shown to be effective in inducing apoptosis and prolonging the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-bearing rats as well as inhibiting the tumor growth of mice bearing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), neuroblastoma and colon carcinoma. In this study, we showed that gold-1a prolonged the survival of NPC metastasis-bearing mice and inhibited intrahepatic and lung metastasis. Histologically, gold-1a markedly reduced tumor microvessel formation. Consistently, in in vitro studies, gold-1a inhibited migration and invasion of C666-1 human NPC cells. The data strongly support the use of gold(III) compounds to treat cancer metastasis.
