Adenosine can exhibit cytotoxic activity in vivo and in vitro, though its mechanisms are still uncertain. In this study, we investigated the adenosine-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway and the role of NF-kappaB in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were treated with different concentrations of adenosine for 12-48 h, and the effect of adenosine on cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay. The cytotoxicity of adenosine alone or in combination with an NF-kappaB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was also evaluated by MTT assay and the mode of cell death was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining. Cell cycle progress was performed by flow cytometry with PI staining. The protein expressions of Bcl-2, p53, NF-kappaB subunit p65, and caspase-3 were assayed by Western blot. Caspase-3 activity was measured by spectrophotomteric assay. The results showed that adenosine significantly reduced the viability of HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with IC 50 (24 and 48 h) of 2.52 and 1.89 mmol x L(-1), respectively. The apoptotic index (percentage of sub-G1 phase) of HepG2 cells in adenosine treatment alone for 12 and 24 h or in combination with PDTC were 8.30%, 22.32% and 20.18%, 30.89%, respectively. All of them were higher than that in the control group (0.81%, p
