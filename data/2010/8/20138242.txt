Hepatoma (hepatocellular carcinoma) is the most common type of malignant tumor originating in the liver and has a relatively low 5-year survival rate. The development of hepatoma-targeted therapy is needed to increase treatment efficiency and to reduce the incidence of undesirable side effects. In this study we developed a novel hepatoma-targeted gene delivery system. The gene delivery system was prepared by combining a human liver cell-specific bionanocapsule (BNC) and a tumor cell-specific gene regulation polymer, which responds to hyperactivated protein kinase C alpha in hepatoma cells. The complex of the polymer-DNA with BNCs was delivered into cells and tissues. The developed system showed increased transfection efficiency and resulted in cell-specific gene expression in hepatoma cells and tissues (HuH-7), but no gene expression in normal human hepatocytes or human epidermoid tumor cells (A431). The combination of a tumor cell-specific gene regulation system responding to protein kinase C alpha and BNCs showed excellent potential for the selective treatment of hepatomas. The system could be a useful method with applications in hepatoma-specific gene therapy and molecular imaging. From the clinical editor: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of malignant tumor in the liver with a low 5-year survival rate. In this study, a novel hepatoma-targeted gene delivery system was prepared by combining a human liver cell-specific bionanocapsule and a tumor cell-specific gene regulation polymer, which responds to hyperactivated protein kinase C (PKC)a in hepatoma cells. The system could be a useful in hepatoma-specific gene therapy and molecular imaging.
