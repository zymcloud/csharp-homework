Objective:To investigate the therapeutic effect and biological changes of hepatic arterial perfusion of p53 gene via port catheter system (PCS) on advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:A total of 48 cases of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were divided into the experimental group (30) and the control group (18). Transiliac external artery PCS implantation was performed in all cases. p53 gene was perfused into target artery confirmed by angiography. In the experimental group, 10(12) VP of p53 gene and 20 mg OPT were employed every week as a course for 21 days. In the control group, only 20 mg OPT was used. KPS, AFP and the survival period, RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid) tumor were analyzed. Flow cytometry (FCM) and micronucleus (MN) assay in vivo were used to detect p53 gene mutation and spontaneous micronucleus formation in peripheral blood of the experimental group.Results:The experimental group were performed 1 to 8 courses. There was a significant difference with AFP level and KPS in the experimental group(P 0.05) in the control group. After one month, survival rate of the the experimental group and the control group was 96.6% and 94.4%, there was a significant difference between the two groups in objective tumor relieve (P Conclusion:p53 gene sequential infusion via hepatic artery is effective for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The biological study will play a important role in selecting the therapeutic dose and judging therapeutic efficacy by means of guiding and monitoring.
