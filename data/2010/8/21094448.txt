Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy typically associated with chronic liver disease and is a leading cause of mortality among these patients. Prognosis is improved when detected early. MRI is the best imaging examination for accurate diagnosis. Although arterial enhancement with delayed washout, increased T2-weighted signal intensity, delayed capsular enhancement, restricted diffusion, and tumor thrombus are typical features, not all lesions demonstrate these findings. The radiologist must be familiar with these typical imaging characteristics, and less common appearances and associated findings of HCC, and must be able to differentiate them from those of lesions that mimic HCC. Knowledge of therapeutic options and how those are related to imaging findings is imperative to assist clinicians in managing these patients.
