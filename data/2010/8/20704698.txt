Background:There is a demand for serum markers for the routine assessment of the progression of liver cancer. We previously found that serum N-linked sugar chains are altered in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we studied glycomic alterations during development of HCC in a rat model.Results:Rat HCC was induced by the hepatocarcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DENA). N-glycans were profiled using the DSA-FACE technique developed in our laboratory.In comparison with control rats, DENA rats showed a gradual but significant increase in two glycans (R5a and R5b) in serum total N-glycans during progression of liver cirrhosis and cancer, and a decrease in a biantennary glycan (P5). The log of the ratio of R5a to P1 (NGA2F) and R5b to P1 [log(R5a/P1) and log(R5b/P1)] were significantly (p Conclusions:We found an increase in core-alpha-1,6-fucosylated glycoproteins in serum and liver of rats with HCC, which demonstrates that fucosylation is altered during progression of HCC. Our GlycoTest model can be used to monitor progression of HCC and to follow up treatment of liver tumors in the DENA rat. This GlycoTest model is particularly important because a rapid non-invasive diagnostic procedure for tumour progression in this rat model would greatly facilitate the search for anticancer drugs.
