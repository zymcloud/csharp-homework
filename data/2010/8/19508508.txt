Aim:To determine the factors affecting the survival in colorectal cancer patients with synchronous liver metastases.Method:A total of 168 patients who had been treated colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases at Guangxi Medical University from January 2000 to December 2005 were identified. Criteria studied consisted of gender, age, time of symptoms, primary tumour location, primary tumour circumference, histological type, grade (tumour differentiation), T-status, N-status, large bowel obstruction, type of operation, primary tumour resection, ascities, location, number and diameter of liver lesions, preoperative CEA and chemotherapy. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was conducted by Cox regression analysis.Results:The mean survival time for all patients was 18.71 (SEM = 1.59) months. The 1, 2, 3 and 5-year survival rates were 55.95%, 23.21%, 12.30%, 8.0% respectively. Univariate analysis share of grade (tumour differentiation), N-status, large bowel obstruction, operation, primary tumour resection, location, number and the most diameter of liver lesions, extrahepatic transfer, preoperative CEA level and chemotherapy to be predictors of survival. In the Cox regression analysis, the N-status, large bowel obstruction, operation, diameter of liver lesion and extrahepatic transfer were independent factors related to survival.Conclusion:Tumour differentiation, N-status, bowel obstruction, operation, primary tumour resection, location of liver metastasis, number of liver metastasis, diameter of liver metastasis, extrahepatic transfer, preoperative CEA level and chemotherapy are related to the survival of patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases.
