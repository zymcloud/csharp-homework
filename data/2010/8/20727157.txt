Background:The increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in Western countries has led to an expanding interest of scientific research in this field. Therefore, a vast need of experimental models that mimic the natural pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a short time period is present. The goal of our study was (1) to develop an efficient mouse model for HCC research, in which tumours develop in a natural background of fibrosis and (2) to assess the time-dependent angiogenic changes in the pathogenesis of HCC.Methods:Weekly intraperitoneal injections with the hepatocarcinogenic compound N-nitrosodiethylamine was applied as induction method and samples were taken at several time points to assess the angiogenic changes during the progression of HCC.Results:The N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced mouse model provides well vascularised orthotopic tumours after 25 weeks. It is a representative model for human HCC and can serve as an excellent platform for the development of new therapeutic targets.
