During the next few decades, vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) will dramatically change the epidemiological profile of this worldwide infection especially when Heath Policies encourage including HBV vaccination program for the newborns. However, it is still estimated that more than 2000millions living people have met HBV. Symptomatic hepatitis with jaundice is less frequent than asymptomatic infection; however, as much as 350millions of individuals remain chronically infected by HBV. In these cases, the need for efficient antiviral therapy remains clear when a viral replication is observed to control the risk of progression and the need for liver transplantation, which represents the only end-stage treatment. Indeed, patients having chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can now be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA) or pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN). Therefore, beside vaccination, prevention of the progression of the disease to cirrhosis and liver decompensation, leading to end-stage liver disease and/or to hepatocellular carcinoma, by inhibiting viral replication seems to represent the best approach to improve survival. At last but not least, co-morbidities and other viral infections, leading also to chronic liver cirrhosis or liver inflammation such as the specific satellite delta virus (HDV), human immunodeficency virus (HIV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV) virus, are able to accelerate the progression and have to be taken in account. Interestingly, in treated infection, the dogma of the irreversibility of the liver fibrosis, when the cirrhosis is constituted, is tumbling down. In this review, we will focus on the clinical, virological and therapeutic aspects of hepatitis B infection in order to expose the proposals to follow-up and treat HBV-infected patients and the prevention of drug-resistant HBV mutants that frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease.
