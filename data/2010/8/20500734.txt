Background:Portal vein tumour thrombosis is a negative prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aim:To assess the efficacy of cisplatin in lipiodol emulsion combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for patients with HCC and portal vein tumour thrombosis.Methods:The study subjects were 51 patients with the above-specified criteria who received injection of cisplatin suspension in lipiodol emulsion followed by intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU. The primary objective was to determine tumour response to the treatment, while the secondary objectives were safety and tolerability. Independent factors for survival were also assessed.Results:Ten patients had complete response and 34 patients had partial response (response rate, 86.3%). The median survival for all 51 patients was 33 months, while that for 10 complete response patients and 21 patients who showed disappearance of HCC following additional therapies was 39 months. The single factor that significantly influenced survival was therapeutic effect. Treatment was well tolerated and severe toxicity was infrequent, with only grade 3 toxicity (thrombocytopenia) in one patient.Conclusions:The present study demonstrated the efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy using cisplatin-lipiodol emulsion and 5-FU without serious adverse effects in patients with unresectable HCC and portal vein tumour thrombosis.
