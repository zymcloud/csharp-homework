Background:The decision to perform liver transplantation (LT) or liver resection (LR) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are beyond the Milan criteria remains controversial.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed outcome data for 179 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria who were treated with LR (n = 135) or LT (n = 44). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were established. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and a log-rank test was performed to compare group survival status.Results:Patients who underwent LR group were significantly older, had a lower TNM stage, and were more likely to have unilateral disease and noncirrhotic liver. Significantly more patients in the LR group had recurrence (53.3% vs 29.5%) or died (61.5% vs 43.2%) than patients in the LT group. Recurrence-free survival rates were 11.9% for the LR group and 61.5% for the LT group. The median overall survival duration showed no statistically difference between the LR group (28.0 months) and the LT group (50.0 months).Conclusions:LT may be the better choice for patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria.
