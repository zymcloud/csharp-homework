Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is required for the assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins. Previously, we demonstrated that the N-terminal 1,000 residues of apoB (apoB:1000) are necessary for the initiation of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly in rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells and that these particles are phospholipid (PL) rich. To determine if the PL transfer activity of MTP is sufficient for the assembly and secretion of primordial apoB:1000-containing lipoproteins, we employed microRNA-based short hairpin RNAs (miR-shRNAs) to silence Mttp gene expression in parental and apoB:1000-expressing McA-RH7777 cells. This approach led to 98% reduction in MTP protein levels in both cell types. Metabolic labeling studies demonstrated a drastic 90-95% decrease in the secretion of rat endogenous apoB100-containing lipoproteins in MTP-deficient McA-RH7777 cells compared with cells transfected with negative control miR-shRNA. A similar reduction was observed in the secretion of rat endogenous apoB48 under the experimental conditions employed. In contrast, MTP absence had no significant effect on the synthesis, lipidation, and secretion of human apoB:1000-containing particles. These results provide strong evidence in support of the concept that in McA-RH7777 cells, acquisition of PL by apoB:1000 and initiation of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly, a process distinct from the conventional first-step assembly of HDL-sized apoB-containing particles, do not require MTP. This study indicates that, in hepatocytes, a factor(s) other than MTP mediates the formation of the PL-rich primordial apoB:1000-containing initiation complex.
