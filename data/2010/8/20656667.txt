In this review article author analyzes the results of liver transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to the restrictive criteria, long term survival exceeds the results of surgical resections in many centers. With the use of biomarker des-carboxy-prothrombin, Asian transplant centers have significantly modified the previous restrictions. Author overviews the possible therapies of patients on the waiting list, as well as bridging and down staging modalities.
