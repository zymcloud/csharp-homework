Purpose:To analyze which patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related factors may influence outcome after (90)Y radioembolization ((90)Y-RE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Seventy-two consecutive patients with advanced HCC treated with (90)Y-RE were studied to detect which factors may have influenced response to treatment and survival.Results:Median overall survival was 13 months (95% confidence interval, 9.6-16.3 months). In univariate analysis, survival was significantly better in patients with one to five lesions (19 vs. 8 months, p = 0.001) and in patients with alpha-fetoprotein 52 UI/mL, and their survival in the multivariate analysis was significantly worse (hazard ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 13-1.73) (p = 0.002).Conclusions:Yttrium-90 radioembolization results in control of target lesions in the majority of patients with HCC but does not prevent the development of new lesions. Survival of patients treated with (90)Y-RE seems to depend largely on factors related to the aggressiveness of the disease (number of nodules, levels of alpha-fetoprotein, and presence of microscopic disease).
