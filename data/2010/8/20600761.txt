Ethnopharmacological relevance:Styrax japonica Siebold et al Zuccarini (SJSZ) has been used to heal inflammation and bronchitis as an herbal plant in Korea.Aims of the study:The purpose of the present study is to determine whether the ethanol (EtOH) extract of SJSZ induces the programmed cell death (apoptosis) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells.Materials and methods:It was evaluated cytotoxicity using MTT assay, amount of intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) and Ca(2+) using fluorescence. Activities of apoptotic relevant factors [Bid, cytochrome c, caspase-9, -3, and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)] were measured by Western blot.Results:The results in this study indicated that ethanol extract of SJSZ (75 microg/ml) stimulates to increase amount of iROS, Ca(2+), and the apoptotic relevant factors [Bid, cytochrome c, caspase-9, -3, and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in the HepG2 cells.Conclusion:The results in this study indicated that ethanol extract of SJSZ (75 microg/ml) induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the HepG2 cells. Therefore, we speculate that ethanol extract of SJSZ could be used for healing of hepatocarcinoma as one of chemotherapeutic agents.
