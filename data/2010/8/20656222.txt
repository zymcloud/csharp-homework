Purpose:To compare survival after treatment with either locoregional therapy (LRT) or supportive care in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria.Materials and methods:Patients with HCC who were classified within the Milan criteria (solitary HCC Results:Of 162 patients studied, 110 patients (67.9%) underwent LRT, and 52 patients (32.1%) received supportive care alone. Median survival within the Milan criteria for patients who did and did not receive LRT were 644 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 193-1094) and 162 days (95% CI, 73-250) respectively (P Conclusions:LRT is more effective than supportive care in prolonging survival within the Milan criteria in patients with HCC. The long-term survival in patients not undergoing transplant was significantly longer for patients who received LRT than for patients who were treated with supportive care.
