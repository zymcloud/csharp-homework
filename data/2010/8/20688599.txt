Background:Liver transplantation (LT) has been widely accepted as the treatment of choice for end-stage liver diseases. Due to the scarcity of cadaveric donors, adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is advocated as a practical alternative to deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). However, some reports suggest that the long-term and recurrence-free survival rates of LDLT are poorer than those of DDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to compare the long-term and recurrence-free survival rates of HCC between LDLT and DDLT.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 150 patients with HCC from January 2005 to March 2009. Eleven patients who died of complications during the perioperative period were excluded. The remaining 139 eligible patients (101 DDLT and 38 LDLT) were regularly followed up to October 2009. The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used to compare the characteristics of LDLT and DDLT. The long-term and recurrence-free survival curves of both groups were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method with comparisons performed using the log-rank test. One-way analysis of variance was performed to compare the waiting time of the two groups.Results:Survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years for LDLT were 81%, 62%, 53%, and 45% and for DDLT were 86%, 60%, 50%, and 38%, respectively. The overall 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year recurrence-free rates for LDLT were 71%, 49%, 42%, and 38%, and for DDLT were 76%, 52%, 41%, and 37%, respectively. No significant differences were found by the log-rank test on both long-term and recurrence-free survival rates.Conclusions:The role of LDLT is reinforced by our study. It may expand the donor pool and achieve the same long-term and recurrence-free survival rates of DDLT.
