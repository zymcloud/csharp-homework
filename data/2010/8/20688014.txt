Objective:To describe the clinico-pathological and radiological profile of hepatocellular carcinoma.Study design:A case series.Place and duration of study:Medical Unit-III Ward-7, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, from January to December 2008.Methodology:All consecutive patients suspected of having hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), were admitted and included in this study. Diagnosis of HCC was established by clinical, biochemical, ultrasonographic and histopathologic findings. Patients with primary carcinoma elsewhere in the body, metastatic in the liver, fibrolamellar carcinoma and benign tumours were excluded from the study. At ultrasonography, the details of tumour size and number, portal vein thrombosis and presence of ascites were recorded. Patients were staged according to Okuda staging system. Results were described in mean and percentage values.Results:There were 82 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma including 58 males and 24 females, with male to female ratio of 2.8:1. The mean age of patients was 56.24+/-13.65 years. Right hypochondrial pain was the main symptom in 52 (63.4%) patients. The duration of symptoms varied from 1 month to 2 years. Tumour size was larger than 50% of liver size in 42 (51.2%) with portal vein thrombosis in 10 (12.19%). Anti HCV was positive in 44 (53.7%), HBsAg in 26 (31.7%) and both were found positive in 2 (2.44%) patients. Ten patients (12.2/%) found negative both for anti-HCV and HBsAg. According to Okuda staging system 18 patients had stage 1, 50 had stage 2 and 14 had stage 3 hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:The mean age of presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma was younger as compared to western countries with potentially large non-resectable lesions. Chronic hepatitis C and B was found to be the major known factors. Patients with chronic hepatitis C and B should undergo vigorous HCC surveillance to detect early, potentially respectable HCC.
