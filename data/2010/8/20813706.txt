Objective:To study the therapeutic effects of Nexavar on liver cancer and its relation to the expressions of Ki-67 and CD34.Methods:Twenty-eight patients with liver cancer were treated with Nexavar. The therapeutic efficacy of Nexavar on liver cancer was observed. Liver cancer tissues were examined for the expressions of Ki-67 and CD34 by immunohistochemistry. Microvessel density (MVD) was calculated according to the expression of CD34.Results:Of 28 patients, none achieved a complete response (CR), 12 had a partial response (PR), 7 had stable disease (SD), and 9 progressive disease (PD). The efficacy of Nexavar was associated significantly with Ki-67 expression. The mean MVD count was 346.03-/+146.98 in PR patients, and 89.14-/+45.66 in PD patients. There was a significant difference in MVD between PR and PD patients.Conclusion:There is a better efficacy of Nexavar in treatment of liver cancer in the patients who had Ki-67-positive expression and high MVD count.
