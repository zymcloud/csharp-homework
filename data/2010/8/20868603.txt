Objective:To explore the prognostic values of Raf-1 kinase (Raf-1), phosphorylated mitogen extracellular kinase 1 (pMEK1), and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2(pERK1/2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:We assessed the expressions of Raf-1, pMEK1, and pERK1/2 in HCC using immunohistochemical techniques. The relationships between the expressions of Raf-1, pMEK1, and pERK1/2 and the prognosis were explored.Results:The over-expression rates of Raf-1, pMEK1, and pERK1/2 in HCC were 38.3%, 46.7%, and 38.3%, respectively. The over-expressions of Raf-1, pMEK1, and pERK1/2 were positively correlated with each other (P>0.05), but had no significant correlation with sex, age, Î±-fetoprotein, hepatitis B surface antigen status, the TNM stage, size,differentiation and vascular invasion of tumor, and liver cirrhosis (P>0.05). Univariate survival analysis and COX proportional hazard regression model showed that Raf-1 over-expression was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (PConclusion:Raf-1 over-expression is an independent marker for the patients of HCC, which may provide new clue in the future targeted therapy.
