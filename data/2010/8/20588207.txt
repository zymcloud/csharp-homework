Background:Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been performed in adult patients. However, there are a few reports on how recipient age affects the outcome of LDLT. This study assessed LDLT outcome in patients aged 60 years or older.Methods:A total of 267 patients were enrolled and classified into two groups: those younger than 60 years (younger group, n=210) and those aged 60 years or older (older group, n=57). The 6-month and 1-, 3-, and 5-year patient survivals and the incidence of complications were compared. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the risk factors.Results:Fifty-five of 57 (96.5%) donors in the older group were younger than 50 years (range 25-47 years), whereas only 177 of 210 (84.3%) donors in the younger group were younger than 50 years (PConclusion:Recipient age did not affect LDLT outcome when patients with MELD Score less than 20 received grafts from consanguineous donors.
