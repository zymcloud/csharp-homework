Background:Surgical cytoreduction and endocrine blockade are important options for care for neuroendocrine liver metastases. We investigated the long-term survival of patients surgically treated for hepatic neuroendocrine metastases.Methods:Patients (n= 172) undergoing operations for neuroendocrine liver metastases from any primary were identified from a prospective liver database. Recorded data and medical record review were used to analyse the type of procedure, length of hospital stay, peri-operative morbidity, tumour recurrence, progression,and survival.Results:The median age was 56.8 years (range 11.5-80.7 years). 48.3% of patients were female. Median overall survival was 9.6 years (range 89 days to 22 years). On multivariate analysis, lung/thymic primaries were associated with worse survival [hazard ratio (HR): 15.6, confidence interval (CI): 4.3-56.8, P= 0.002]. Severe post-operative complications were also associated with worse long-term survival (P < 0.001). A positive resection margin status (R1) was not associated with a worse overall survival probability (P approximately 0.8).Discussion:Early and aggressive surgical management of hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumours is associated with significant long-term survival rates. Radiofrequency ablation is a reasonable option if a lesion is unresectable. R1 resections, unlike many other cancers, are not associated with a worse overall survival.
