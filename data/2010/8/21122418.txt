Objective:To explore the prognostic factors for rectal cancer patients with synchronous liver metastases.Methods:Data from a total of 77 cases of rectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases treated in our center from January 2002 to December 2008 were collected and reviewed. The total survival rate was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test and Cox regression model with SPSS 17.0 software were used to analyze 13 factors including clinicopathological factors and treatment choices.Results:The median survival time of the 77 cases was 12 months. The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 47.7%, 28.0%, 13.1%, and 1.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis with Kaplan-Meier method revealed that the differentiation of the primary tumor, T-stage, N status, the distribution, number and size of liver metastases, extrahepatic disease, serum CEA level at diagnosis and treatment modality were prognostic factors (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the differentiation of the primary tumor (P = 0.007), T-stage (P = 0.027), the size of liver metastases (P = 0.003), serum CEA value at diagnosis (P = 0.000) were independent prognostic factors for rectal cancer patients with synchronous liver metastases.Conclusion:The factors affecting the prognosis for rectal cancer patients with synchronous liver metastases are the differentiation of the primary tumor, T-stage, N status, the distribution, number and size of liver metastases, extrahepatic disease, serum CEA level at diagnosis and treatment modality. The differentiation of the primary tumor, T-stage, the size of liver metastases, and serum CEA value at diagnosis are independent prognostic factors.
