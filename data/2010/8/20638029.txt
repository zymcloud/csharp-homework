Prevention is most cost effective toward successful control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its complications. It is particularly urgent where HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are prevalent. To achieve better results of primary HCC prevention globally, higher world coverage rates of HBV vaccine, better strategies against breakthrough infection/nonresponder, and good long-term protection are needed. With the universal hepatitis B vaccination program starting from neonates in most countries, HBV infection and its complications will be further reduced in this century. An effective decline in the incidence of HCC in adults is expected in the near future. The concept of a cancer preventive vaccine, using HBV as an example, can be applied further to other infectious agents and their related cancers.
