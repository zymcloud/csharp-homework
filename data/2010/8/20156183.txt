There is no protective vaccine or effective drug against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Sustained virological response to INF/ribavirin treatment regimen has an efficiency of about 50%. Many patients worldwide have used traditional medicines and herbal medicine in particular. A laccase has been purified from oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) to homogeneity by DEAE Affi-gel blue gel, CM-Sephadex G-50 and Sephadex G-100. The molecular weight of the laccase was about 58 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH and temperature of the laccase activity were pH 4.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The activity of the enzyme increased steadily from 20 to 40 degrees C, then very slowly from 40 degrees to 60 degrees C, while the enzyme activity decreased to 9% at 90 degrees C. The activity of the laccase changed gradually over the pH range 2.0-4.0. However, the enzyme activity was totally abrogated at the pH 8 and above. Incubation of peripheral blood cells PBCs and hepatoma HepG2 cells with laccase which were then infected with HCV did not protect the cells from HCV attack and entry, while direct interaction between HCV and the laccase at the concentrations of 2.0 and 2.5 mg/ml led to a complete inhibition of virus entry after seven days of incubation. Meantime, the laccase at the concentrations of 1.0 and 1.5 mg/ml did not display any blocking activity. The potential activity of the laccase on intracellular HCV replication in infected HepG2 cells has been examined. The laccase was capable of inhibiting HCV replication at the concentrations of 1.25 and 1.5 mg/ml after first dose of treatment for four days and at the concentrations of 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 mg/ml after the second dose of treatment for another four days.
