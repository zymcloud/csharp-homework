Between January 2007 and January 2008, a port/catheter system for hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy was implanted in seven patients with retrograde blood flow in the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). The GDA was not coil-embolized when the catheter tip was positioned in the right gastroepiploic artery. In all cases, implantation of the port/catheter system was successful, and there were no complications. Interventionalists can economize on expensive microcoils by using this simple and time-saving method.
