Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known as a major complication associated with poor survival. We clinically defined a type of distinct PVTT (dPVTT) in small HCC patients that is distant to liver parenchyma tumor (PT). The biological features of dPVTT are not clear. We utilized two-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem MS to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins between dPVTT and PT tissues. Of the 65 spots identified as differentially expressed (p
