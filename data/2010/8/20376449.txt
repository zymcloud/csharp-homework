Background:We compare the recurrence and treatment pattern in long-term survivors after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and surgery for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This retrospective study included 121 patients who survived for more than 5 years [RFA (n = 61) vs. surgery (n = 60)]. All patients underwent follow-up CT at a 3-4-month interval after the first-line treatment. The mean overall and disease-free survival duration was analyzed. The pattern of recurrence and treatment modalities for recurrence was compared between the patients who received RFA or surgery.Results:Disease-free survivors were found in 30% (18/61) of the RFA group and 60% (36/60) of the surgery group, respectively (P = 0.001). The mean disease-free survival duration were 35.4 months for the RFA group and 60.2 months for the surgery group, respectively (P = 0.018). Recurrence after initial treatment was more frequent in RFA group than for surgery group (mean number, 3.3 vs. 1.2; P = 0.000). There were no significant differences in the recurrence pattern and the treatment pattern for the recurrence between the both groups.Conclusions:Surgery is superior to RFA for the treatment of HCC in terms of disease-free survival and frequency of recurrence, although the overall survival duration, pattern of recurrence, and treatment pattern were similar between the both groups.
