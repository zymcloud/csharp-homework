Objective:To evaluate the relationship of expressions of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (nm23) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), as well as apoptosis, with the prognosis of HCC patients by analyzing their pathological and clinical data.Methods:The expressions of nm23 and PCNA were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and the apoptotic phenomena were detected by TUNEL technique in the liver samples from 43 HCC tissues, 39 para-neoplastic tissues, and 10 normal tissues. The mean apoptosis index (AI) and proliferative index (PI) in individual sample were calculated.Results:As shown by the detection, 32.6% of carcinomas had negative nm23 signal in tumor tissues, whereas all para-neoplastic and normal tissues had positive nm23. The AI in nm23 positive HCC was significantly higher than that in nm23 negative one, with statistical difference (PConclusions:These data suggest that expressions of nm23 protein in tumor tissues are correlated with occurrences of metastasis and length of survival of the HCC patients, which may be an indicator for their prognosis.
