Background:This study aimed to present our experience with pulmonary metastasectomy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and to evaluate the prognostic factors.Methods:The clinicopathologic data of 17 patients including presence of viral hepatitis, the serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, the number of metastases, and laterality were analyzed. The overall survival rates and the prognostic factors were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis.Results:The median follow-up periods after pulmonary resection and initial hepatic resection were 28.9 and 46.2 months, respectively. The actuarial overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates after pulmonary metastasectomy were 64.7 +/- 11.6%, 29.4 +/- 11.1%, and 11.8 +/- 7.8%, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, disease-free interval (DFI) of more than 24 months (hazard ratio = 2.36, 95% confidence interval = 1.33-25.33, p = 0.020) and AFP levels after pulmonary resection (hazard ratio = 51.3 95% confidence interval = 3.68-716.66, p = 0.003) were found to be independent prognostic factors.Conclusions:Although only a small number of patients were enrolled in this study, a disease-free interval more than 24 months and the serum AFP level after pulmonary metastasectomy might be important prognostic factors.
