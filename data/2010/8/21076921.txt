Purpose:This study was designed to evaluate the effect of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE)/embolization (TAE) for symptomatic bone metastases especially in palliation.Methods:Between April 2006 and December 2009, 24 bone metastatic lesions of 18 patients (8 women and 10 men; mean age, 64 years) underwent palliative TACE or TAE. A total of 40 sessions were performed, with 1-4 sessions per lesion. The primary lesions included hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, uterine cervical cancer, and esophageal cancer. Symptomatic lesions involved thoracic spine, lumbar spine, pelvis, rib, and femur. The procedures were performed with a coaxial catheter technique to catheterize selectively target arteries. If not possible due to small branches, blood flow alteration by coil was achieved. Gelatin sponge was the initial embolic materials. As anti-cancer agents, epirubicin, fluorouracil, and mitomycin were mainly used in consideration for primary lesion and past treatment.Results:Sufficient devascularization of targeted lesions was obtained in 18 of 24 (75%) lesions without any serious complication. Pain relief was obtained in 20 lesions (83%), with significantly decrease in the visual analogue scale score (P Conclusions:Palliative TACE/TAE for symptomatic bone metastases could be a suitable treatment method because it is minimally invasive, repeatable, effective, and rapid-acting.
