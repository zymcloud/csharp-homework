Purpose:To establish whether the serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in drainage venous blood (d-CEA) is a better predictor of prognosis or survival than the preoperative CEA level in peripheral venous blood (p-CEA), and how these two CEA levels compare as predictive factors for metachronous hepatic metastasis.Methods:We examined specimens of peripheral and drainage venous blood from 119 patients with colorectal cancer.Results:There was a strong positive correlation between p-CEA and d-CEA levels. The 5-year survival rates were 81.5% and 80.2% for patients with normal p-CEA and d-CEA levels (< or =5 ng/ml), respectively, and 68.4% and 71.1% for those with abnormal p-CEA and d-CEA levels (>5 ng/ml). The p-CEA and d-CEA levels were both normal in seven of ten patients with metachronous hepatic metastasis. The CEA gradient between the d-CEA and p-CEA levels (d-p CEA gradient) was not a significant predictive factor for hepatic metastases.Conclusions:There was virtually no change between preoperative p-CEA and d-CEA levels. These findings suggest that the d-CEA level is not a predictor for metachronous hepatic metastasis and that measuring p-CEA levels is sufficient in the surveillance of colorectal cancer.
