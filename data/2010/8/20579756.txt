Background and purpose:To compare the efficacy and toxicity of short-course carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of tumor location: adjacent to the porta hepatis or not.Materials and methods:The study consisted of 64 patients undergoing C-ion RT of 52.8 GyE in four fractions between April 2000 and March 2003. Of these patients, 18 had HCC located within 2 cm of the main portal vein (porta hepatis group) and 46 patients had HCC far from the porta hepatis (non-porta hepatis group). We compared local control, survival, and adverse events between the two groups.Results:The 5-year overall survival and local control rates were 22.2% and 87.8% in the porta hepatis group and 34.8% and 95.7% in the non-porta hepatis group, respectively. There were no significant differences (P=0.252, P=0.306, respectively). Further, there were no significant differences in toxicities. Biliary stricture associated with C-ion RT did not occur.Conclusions:Excellent local control was obtained independent of tumor location. The short-course C-ion RT of 52.8 GyE in four fractions appears to be an effective and safe treatment modality in the porta hepatis group just as in the non-porta hepatis group.
