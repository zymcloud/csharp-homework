Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has become one of the chief methods of saving patients with end-stage liver disease due to liver cirrhosis. Accumulation of knowledge about indication and perioperative managements improve outcome of this treatment. In this study, we elucidate the risk factors of LDLT, which still exist today. Sixty-one patients received LDLT in our institute between 2003 and 2009 were included in this study. Recipient age and sex, donor age and sex, etiology, preoperative model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), graft versus recipient weight ratio (GRWR), cold and warm ischemic time, operation time, blood loss, ABO compatibility, rejection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, biliary stricture, and calcineurin inhibitor (FK506 or cyclosporin A) were the factors investigated. p
