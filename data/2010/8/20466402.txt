Background:Hepatocellular and pancreatic carcinomas are often auxotrophic for L-arginine, a semi-essential amino acid. The purpose of this study was to investigate cancer cell death using a significantly more active, cobalt-substituted bioengineered arginase.Methods:Panc-1, a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, and Hep 3B, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, were exposed to L-arginase. Flow cytometry was used to measure expression of Ki-67, caspase-3, and argininosuccinate synthetase-1 (ASS-1) 4 days after treatment. An MTT assay measured proliferation. The Student t test determined statistical significance.Results:Viability decreased by 31% +/- 2% for Panc-1 cells (P Conclusion:Increased ASS-1 expression by these cells, in order to increase L-arginine concentration, is inadequate, suggesting a mechanism by which arginine depletion can be used in multimodality therapy for arginine-dependent cancers.
