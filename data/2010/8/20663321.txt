Background and objective:Rosiglitazone is a peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligand, which inhibits tumor growth by activating PPARgamma signaling pathways. Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. However, patients develop drug resistance of 5-FU over time. The aim of this study was to investigate whether rosiglitazone can enhance 5-FU-induced cell growth inhibition and to explore its potential mechanisms.Methods:Cell viability was measured using MTT assay. Protein expression levels were detected by Western blot analysis. Small interference RNA was utilized to knockout PPARgamma and PTEN in Hep3B cells.Results:After 48 h of treatment with 10, 20, and 40 µmol/L rosiglitazone, the viability of Hep3B cells was (78.0 ± 2.7)%, (37.3 ± 8.1)%, and (19.8 ± 2.2)%, respectively (compared with control group, P values were all Conclusions:Rosiglitazone enhances 5-FU-induced cell growth inhibition of Hep3B cells.
