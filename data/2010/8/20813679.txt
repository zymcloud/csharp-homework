Objective:To investigate the relationship between CTLA4 +49G/A SNP polymorphism and the susceptibility to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:CTLA4+49G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was analyzed by DNA sequencing in 165 control subjects, 155 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 149 HCC patients. Serum HBsAg, HBeAg and AFP levels were measured in all the subjects.Results:In HCC and CHB groups, the genotype frequency was 40.3% and 50.0% for GG , and 59.7% and 50.0% for AG+AA, respectively, while the genotype frequency was 61.8% for GG and 38.2% for AG+AA in the control group. In HCC group, CHB group and controls, the A allele frequencies was 44.6%, 37.4% and 28.8%, and the G allele frequencies was 55.4%, 62.6% and 71.2%, respectively. Significant differences were found not only in the allele frequencies (PConclusion:+49G/A SNP of the CTLA4 gene can be associated with HBV and HBV-related HCC.
