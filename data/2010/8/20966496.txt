Liver is a key organ responsible for organismâ€™s homeostasis. A proper function of this organ is crucial for detoxification of metabolic products and regulation of metabolic processes of macromolecules (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates). The most important infectious factors, leading to liver damage, are primary hepatotropic viruses, particularly those causing chronic inflammation of the organ (HBV, HCV, HDV), which may subsequently cause cirrhosis and/or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. There has been a growing interest in Helicobacter spp. liver infections as a potential factor promoting injury of the organ towards hepatocellular carcinoma. The association between hepatocellular carcinoma and the presence of Helicobacters in the liver has been well documented in animal models (Helicobacter hepaticus versus liver cancer in mice). Some reports also indicate similar association in humans, where the presence of Helicobacter antigens in patients with liver cancer is detected more often in comparison to healthy or chronically infected population. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying such a phenomenon are not well known, the knowledge on this subject has considerably increased during recent years. The review presents data on the association between the presence of Helicobacter spp. in the liver and injuries of the organ, as well as the role that is played by the bacteria in chronic liver diseases.
