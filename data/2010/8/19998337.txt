Using comparative proteomic and genomic approaches, the authors identified eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) as an oncofetal molecule highly abundant in mouse embryonic livers and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. To evaluate the oncogenic role and prognostic significance of eIF5A in HCC, we investigate the expression patterns of the two isoforms (eIF5A1 and eIF5A2) in a cohort of 258 HCC cases by cDNA microarray. Both eIF5A isoforms were expressed in the tumors, and clinically correlated eIF5A1 with more numbers of tumor nodules and eIF5A2 with tumor venous infiltration in HCC. In a separate cohort of 50 HCCs, high level of eIF5A2, but not eIF5A1, was associated with elevated levels of deoxyhypusine synthase and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase that catalyze post-translational hypusination of eIF5A protein. Interestingly, N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7), which is an inhibitor for the first step of eIF5A hypusination, was shown to significantly impair the cell proliferation and invasion of primary HCC cells (HepG2 and Hep3B). To further demonstrate the tumorigenic role associated with eIF5A, a drastic reduction of cell proliferation was associated with suppression of eIF5A2 by transfecting Hep3B, H2-P and H2-M HCC cells expressing high level of this isoform using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against eIF5A2. For these assays, a milder response was usually observed in normal hepatocyte cell line. Therefore, these findings suggest that eIF5A plays an important role in HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis, and targeting eIF5A hypusination by GC7 inhibitor or eIF5A2 by RNA interference (RNAi) may offer new therapeutic alternatives to HCC patients.
