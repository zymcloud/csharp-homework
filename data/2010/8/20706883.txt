A case of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHCC) in an adult male lesser flamingo (Phoenicopterus minor) that was part of a breeding programme at a private facility is reported. Grossly, the liver was markedly enlarged with multifocal, well-circumscribed, pinpoint to 2 cm diameter pale tan nodular masses. Histologically, the hepatic parenchyma was replaced by neoplastic cells that demonstrated hepatocellular and, less frequently, biliary epithelial cell differentiation. Positive pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3/PCK26) immunolabelling of the neoplastic cells forming bile ducts with the scattered immunoreactivity of cells forming glandular structures within the areas of hepatocellular differentiation supported the diagnosis. No metastases were detected. CHCC is a rare neoplasm in mammals and birds. This is the first report where gross, histological, and immunohistochemical characteristics of CHCC in a bird are described, and the first report of CHCC in a lesser flamingo.
