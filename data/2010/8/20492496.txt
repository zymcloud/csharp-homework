Background:Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are evolutionarily conserved cell surface receptors of innate immune system. Various polymorphisms in TLR genes have been identified and associated with susceptibility toward various malignancies such as prostate cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. The present study was undertaken to examine the potential association of two polymorphisms in TLR2 and TLR4 genes with gallbladder cancer (GBC) susceptibility.Methods:Genotypes and allelic frequencies of TLR2 and TLR4 gene polymorphisms were determined for 233 GBC patients and 257 cancer-free controls randomly selected from the population, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated in a multivariate logistic regression analysis for the association of TLR polymorphisms with GBC.Results:'del' allele carriers of TLR2 (Delta22) polymorphism were associated with a 1.54-fold increased risk for GBC (95% CI=1.02-2.24; P(trend)=0.091). The TLR4 Ex4+936C >T polymorphism (g.14143C>T; rs4986791) was also found to be significantly associated with the overall higher risk of GBC under a dominant mode of inheritance (OR=1.96; 95% CI=1.11-2.26; P(trend)=0.021). The false-positive report probability (FPRP) approach advocated that these results were noteworthy (FPRP<0.5). Subgroup analysis showed that TLR4 Ex4+936C>T polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of GBC in females and GBC cases with gallstones (OR=2.85 and 2.22 respectively).Conclusion:In summary, low-penetrance variants in TLR genes may alter the susceptibility towards gallbladder cancer.
