Our previous studies demonstrated that KG-135, a quality-controlled red ginseng-specific formulation containing approximately equal amounts of three major ginsenosides (Rk1, Rg3 and Rg5), down-regulated G1 cyclin-dependent kinase in HeLa cells. In the present work, we have found that KG-135 potentates cytotoxicity of etoposide by modulating apoptotic signaling. Co-treatment of etoposide and KG-135 markedly elevated the expression and phosphorylation at the serine 15 residue of p53 as well as the cellular levels of Bax and p21(Waf1/Cip1). The increased accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 (Ser15) were attenuated by treatment of cells with wortmannin, a pan-phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor. Moreover, co-treatment of etoposide and KG-135 enhanced mitochondrial localization of Bax. Our results indicate that etoposide-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells can be potentiated in the presence of KG-135 through a mechanism that involves the stabilization of p53 and the stimulation of Bax- and p21-mediated apoptotic signaling pathways. These findings suggest that KG-135 represents a useful candidate adjuvant for the treatment of cancers that could potentially minimize the adverse effects of current clinical chemotherapeutics.
