Purpose:To determine the diagnostic utility of delayed hypointensity and delayed enhancing rim on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as indicators of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in arterially enhancing nodules Materials and methods:Gadolinium-enhanced MRI studies performed from January 2001 to December 2004 in patients with cirrhosis were evaluated for arterially enhancing nodules measuring Results:In all, 116 arterially enhancing nodules were identified in 80 patients ( or =2 cm) and delayed enhancing rim, as main features and their interaction, were the most significant predictors of HCC.Conclusion:Delayed hypointensity and enhancing rim improve the specificity of diagnosis of HCC of all sizes but are seen less frequently in small ( or =2 cm) and delayed enhancing rim are the strongest predictors of HCC.
