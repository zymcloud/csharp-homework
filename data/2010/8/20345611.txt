Unresectable malignant liver tumors may be treated by LTx. We evaluated the results of LTx for HB and HCC. All patients transplanted for HB or HCC between 1990 and 2007 were included. Effects of histologic tumor type, primary tumor resection, disease staging, and serum AFP levels at diagnosis and at transplantation on disease recurrence and survival were evaluated. Twelve patients with median age of five (range, 2-16) were transplanted and followed for a median of 11 (2-18) yr. Six patients had HB and six had HCC. At diagnosis, eight patients were staged as PRETEXT III and four patients as PRETEXT IV. Two patients had pulmonary metastases. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Median time from diagnosis to LTx was seven (2-133) months. At LTx, none of the patients had radiological evidence of extrahepatic disease, and the median AFP level was 85 (6-15 180) microg/L. No routine chemotherapy after LTx was used.The overall one-, five-, and 10-yr cumulative survival rates were 100%, 80%, and 67%, respectively. Survival was comparable between the two tumor types (4/6 for both). Two deaths occurred secondary to tumor recurrence, one of each tumor type. Both of these patients had an AFP response of
