Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy in the world, especially in China. Early diagnosis of new and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma, followed by timely treatment, will help decrease mortality. Currently biomarkers are not satisfactory. Better diagnostic methods are highly demanded.Methods:In this study, we have used in silico identification and RT-PCR test and discovered a hepatoma associated gene (HTA). Knockdown of endogenous HTA expression was performed by small interfering RNA in malignant hepatocyte HepG2. Then we tested the cell proliferative ability of these cells in vitro and in vivo.Results:HTA was expressed specifically in some kinds of tumors, but not detected in any normal tissues. It was expressed especially high in hepatocellular carcinoma. Knockdown of endogenous HTA expression in HepG2 by small interfering RNA attenuated HCC cell growth.Conclusions:HCA is a very good marker for tumors, especially for HCC. It could play important roles in HCC development and progression and can be a promising molecular target for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HCC.
