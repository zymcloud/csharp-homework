Objective:To analyze the clinicopathologic features and prognostic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Clinicopathological data of 185 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma treated in our hospital between 2000 and 2005 were collected and their follow up information was obtained. The clinicopathological features and prognostic factors were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analysis.Results:The 185 patients had a median age of 51.0 ± 11.0 (range, 19 - 72) years. The apparent peak incidence age was 40 to 60 years old, and the ratio of male to female was 10.6:1; the 3- and 5-year postoperational survival rates were 52.0% and 38.0%; respectively. The tumour numbers (P = 0.000), tumor size (P = 0.025), histological pattern (P = 0.000), nuclear features (P = 0.000), differentiation (P = 0.001) and vascular invasion (P = 0.000) were significantly correlated with prognosis. The postoperational survival times of patients with thin trabeculae pattern, compact pattern and pseudoglandular pattern were significantly longer than that of thick trabeculae, scirrhous pattern, and solid pattern (P ≤ 0.009). The postoperational survival time of patients with nuclear features grade 1 and 2 was significantly longer than that of grade 3 and 4 (P = 0.000). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the tumor number (P = 0.001), tumor size (P = 0.042), nuclear features (P = 0.023) and vascular invasion (P = 0.000) were independent prognostic factors.Conclusion:The postoperational survival rate of HCC patients is low. The tumor size, tumor number, differentiation and vascular invasion are major prognostic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma, The higher is the tumor number, tumor size, degree of differentiation and presence of vascular invasion, the higher risk of mortality is.
