Background and purpose:To examine whether liver volume changes affect prognosis and hepatic function in patients treated with carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Material and methods:Between April 1995 and March 2003, among the cases treated with CIRT, 43 patients with HCC limited to the right hepatic lobe were considered eligible for the study. The left lateral segment was defined as the non-irradiated region. Liver volume was measured using contrast CT at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months after CIRT. We examined serum albumin, prothrombin activity, and total bilirubin level as hepatic functional reserve.Results:After CIRT, the non-irradiated region showed significant enlargement, and enlarged volume of this region 3 months after CIRT 50 cm(3) was a prognostic factor. The 5-year overall survival rates were 48.9% in the larger enlargement group (enlarged volume of non-irradiated region 3 months after CIRT > or =50 cm(3)) and 29.4% in the smaller enlargement group (as above, Conclusions:This study suggests that compensatory enlargement in the non-irradiated liver after CIRT contributes to the improvement of prognosis.
