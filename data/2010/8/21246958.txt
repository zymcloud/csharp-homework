The study aimed to clarify whether vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA (VEGF mRNA) and TNFa mRNA in the HCC tissues on top of HCV with and without cirrhosis obtained from specimens after curative hepatic resection has a prognostic value and recurrence predictive value compared to other tumor criteria. A total of 160 patients were studied. The preoperative laboratory, radiological and staging to patients was done. Using in situ hybridization technique, VEGF mRNA and TNFa mRNA were determined in liver tissues of, 10 controls, 50 with HCC, 50 with HCV without cirrhosis and 50 HCV with cirrhosis. The results showed that in HCC cases there was positive correlation between increasing age, loss of weight, INR and AFP but not in other cases of CHC with or without cirrhosis. AFP, vascular invasion, encapsulation, tumor size and grade and platelet count were related to patients outcome and recurrence of tumor after follow up of most cases for 3 years. The expression of VEGF in liver tissues was proportional to progress of viral hepatitis to cirrhosis with more expression in cases progressed to malignant changes. More expression of VEGF in HCC was more evident with intense expression in cases with Vascular and capsular invasion and higher level of AFP. Expression of TNF alpha mRNA and VEGF mRNA shows increasing expression with positive correlation to progression of viral hepatitis to cirrhosis with more positive with cases developed HCC.
