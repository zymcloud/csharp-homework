We evaluated the clinical value of perioperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) levels in predicting recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection, with a focus on the time course as surveillance tools. A total of 165 consecutive HCC patients who had undergone curative hepatectomy at our institution from 2005 to 2007 and whose serum AFP and DCP had been measured before and after hepatectomy were included in this study. The minimum postoperative levels within a 4-month period were used for analysis. Among the patients with a positive level of AFP before operation, the number of patients whose AFP level did not change from positive to negative after operation in the group with recurrence exceeded that in the group without recurrence (48/60, 80.0% vs. 4/23, 17.4%), and the difference was significant (P
