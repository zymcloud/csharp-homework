Hepatocellular carcinoma often develops in the setting of abnormal hepatocyte growth associated with chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine pivotal in the regulation of hepatic cell growth, differentiation, migration, extracellular matrix production, stem cell homeostasis, and hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which TGF-beta influences hepatic cell functions remain incompletely defined. We report herein that TGF-beta regulates the growth of primary and transformed hepatocytes through concurrent activation of Smad and phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2)alpha (cPLA(2)alpha), a rate-limiting key enzyme that releases arachidonic acid for the production of bioactive eicosanoids. The interplays between TGF-beta and cPLA(2)alpha signaling pathways were examined in rat primary hepatocytes, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and hepatocytes isolated from newly developed cPLA(2)alpha transgenic mice.Conclusion:Our data show that cPLA(2)alpha activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and thus counteracts Smad2/3-mediated inhibition of cell growth. Therefore, regulation of TGF-beta signaling by cPLA(2)alpha and PPAR-gamma may represent an important mechanism for control of hepatic cell growth and hepatocarcinogenesis.
