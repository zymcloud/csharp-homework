Background:In spite of improvements in surgical management, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still recurs after operation in 60-70% of patients. Therefore, we investigated the relation between perioperative change in white blood cell count (WBC) and tumor recurrence as well as survival in patients with HCC after hepatic resection.Methods:Subjects were 53 patients who underwent elective hepatic resection for HCC. We retrospectively examined the relation between perioperative change in WBC and recurrence of HCC as well as overall survival.Results:Advanced tumor stage and increasing of WBC on postoperative day (POD) 1 were positively associated with worse disease-free survival rate on both univariate and multivariate analysis (P Conclusions:Perioperative change in WBC after elective hepatic resection for HCC is positively associated with recurrence and worse survival.
