Most colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases are not resectable upon initial diagnosis. Recently, chemotherapy improves overall survival of initially unresectable patients by allowing tumor downstaging and complete resection. We report a FOLFOX-refractory rectal cancer patient with unresectable multiple liver metastases, whose tumors could be downstaged and completely resected after initiation of FOLFIRI with cetuximab.Case:A 41-year-old male demonstrated rectal cancer with unresectable multiple liver metastases. He was treated by FOLFOX4 therapy as first-line chemotherapy. After initiating 14 courses, he was treated by FOLFIRI with cetuximab because of disease progression. After initiation of chemotherapy, radiographic examination demonstrated remarkable reduction of primary rectal tumor and metastatic liver tumors. He underwent complete rectal tumor resection after 13 courses of chemotherapy, and metastatic liver tumor resection after 18 courses of chemotherapy.
