Antiproliferative and apoptosis inducing effects of black tea polyphenols (Polyphenon-B) on HepG2 cells in vitro and in a rat hepatocarcinogenesis model in vivo were investigated. Viability of HepG2 cells was evaluated by the MTT assay, and apoptosis by AO-EB and DAPI staining, cell cycle analysis, and annexin V-PI assay. For the in vivo study, male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with dimethylaminoazobenzene (DAB) (0.06%) were used. The expression of Bcl-2 and NF-κB family members were analyzed by immunoblotting. Administration of Polyphenon-B induced dose-dependent inhibition of growth of HepG2 cells and reduced tumor incidence in DAB administered animals. HepG2 cells also exhibited morphological features characteristic of apoptotic cell death. In addition, administration of Polyphenon-B increased the expression of Bax, tBid, Smac/Diablo, cytochrome C, Apaf-1, caspases, and IκB with PARP cleavage, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, pBad, NF-κB, p-IκB-α, IKKβ and Ub in both HepG2 cells and in DAB-treated animals. These results provide evidence that Polyphenon-B effectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting NF-κB, and inducing intrinsic apoptosis by modulating the expression of a network of interrelated molecules eventually culminating in caspase-mediated cell death.
