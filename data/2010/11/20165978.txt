Background:Hepatic angiomyolipoma is a rare mesenchyme-derived neoplasm often misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma, and the treatment for it remains controversial.Aims:To develop the optimal preoperative diagnoses means and treatment modalities of hepatic angiomyolipoma.Methods:Retrospective analysis of the clinical features, treatment, and prognostic data of 17 hepatic AML patients admitted to Chinese People's Liberation Army Generation Hospital between 1996 and 2006.Results:Most hepatic angiomyolipoma were solitary. The overall preoperative diagnostic rate was 18% and the most common misdiagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma (10/17, 59%). In three patients, observation was performed for 2-3 years before being admitted. The tumors increased 1-9 cm in size in all patients. All of the 17 patients finally received various liver resection procedures, and postoperative mortality and morbidity was 0 and 12% (2/17). After a median follow-up period of 73 months, the tumor recurred only in one patient 9 years post-operatively.Conclusions:Hepatic angiomyolipoma should be suspected in liver tumor patients with normal Î±-fetoprotein levels and no concomitant hepatitis. Preoperative MRI combined with percutaneous fine-needle biopsy should be the diagnostic methods of choice. Small hepatic AML proved through pathologic examination (
