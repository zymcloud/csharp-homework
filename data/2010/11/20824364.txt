Background:The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a cell surface receptor implicated in tumor cell proliferation and migration. We hypothesized that RAGE signaling impacts tumorigenesis and metastatic tumor growth in murine models of colorectal carcinoma.Materials and methods:Tumorigenesis: Apc (1638N/+) mice were crossed with Rage (-/-) mice in the C57BL/6 background to generate Apc (1638N/+)/Rage (-/-) mice. Metastasis: BALB/c mice underwent portal vein injection with CT26 cells (syngeneic) and received daily soluble (s)RAGE or vehicle. Rage (-/-) mice and Rage (+/+) controls underwent portal vein injection with MC38 cells (syngeneic). Rage (+/+) mice underwent portal vein injection with MC38 cells after stable transfection with full-length RAGE or mock transfection control.Results:Tumorigenesis: Apc (1638N/+)/Rage (-/-) mice had reduced tumor incidence, size, and histopathologic grade. Metastasis: Pharmacological blockade of RAGE with sRAGE or genetic deletion of Rage reduced hepatic tumor incidence, nodules, and burden. Gain of function by transfection with full-length RAGE increased hepatic tumor burden compared to vector control MC38 cells.Conclusion:RAGE signaling plays an important role in tumorigenesis and hepatic tumor growth in murine models of colorectal carcinoma. Further work is needed to target the ligand-RAGE axis for possible prophylaxis and treatment of primary and metastatic colorectal carcinoma.
