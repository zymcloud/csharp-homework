Liver resection for metastases from a colorectal cancer is well established and it is considered the treatment of choice. However, for patients with liver metastases from other carcinomas, the value of resection is incompletely defined and still debated. We report two cases of partial hepatectomies for liver metastases from non-small cell lung cancer leading to different outcomes. A review of the literature suggests that although early reports of similar procedures were not favorable, hepatic resection became a safe procedure, which can sometimes offer a long-term survival and should be considered in selected cases.
