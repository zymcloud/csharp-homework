Background:The long-term benefit of interferon-alfa (IFN-α) treatment in preventing various hepatic complications is not certain.Aim:To study the effects of IFN-α on reducing the risk of developing overall hepatic events (hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhotic complications and liver-related mortality) in chronic hepatitis B patients.Methods:Randomized controlled trials, case-control studies and cohort studies were retrieved from electronic databases and conference abstracts. Relative risks (RRs) of different hepatic complications among patients treated by IFN-α vs. no treatment or placebo were studied.Results:Eleven studies were identified totalling 975 patients treated by IFN-α vs. 1147 untreated controls for analysis. Patients were treated by IFN-α for 1-24 months with a post-treatment follow-up of 1-13 years. Treatment by IFN-α reduced the risk of overall hepatic events (RR 0.55, 95% confident interval or CI 0.43-0.70, P Conclusion:Interferon-alfa treatment reduces the risk of hepatic events particularly among responders to treatment.
