Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel plus prednisolone treatment in Japanese patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).Methods:From April 2004 through August 2008, we used docetaxel plus prednisolone to treat 55 HRPC patients (median age, 72 years). Eighteen patients (32.7%) had measurable soft tissue lesions, whereas 52 patients (94.5%) had bone metastases. During the 21-day treatment cycle, docetaxel (70 mg/m(2)) was administered once every 21 days and oral prednisolone (5 mg), twice daily. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, defined as a reduction of at least 50% in the baseline levels for 4 weeks, was evaluated.Results:The median follow-up period was 30.1 months; median overall survival, 15.3 months and median progression-free survival, 7.5 months. During follow-up, 37 patients (67.3%) achieved the PSA response, and 5 of 18 (27.8%) patients with measurable disease showed a partial response. Among the 27 patients who experienced cancer pain before treatment initiation, 15 (55.5%) reduced their analgesic drug intake. Multivariate analysis of the prognostic variables revealed a significant association between the overall survival and pain (P = 0.033). Hematological toxicity (grades 3-4) included neutropenia (87.3%), febrile neutropenia (25.5%) and thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Frequent non-hematological adverse events were general edema (52.7%), general fatigue (32.7%) and sensory neuropathy (30.9%). Three patients died of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Conclusion:Docetaxel plus prednisolone treatment is effective in Japanese HRPC patients. The main toxicity is neutropenia, which can be safely controlled by outpatient treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. However, the Japanese patients in our study developed ARDS more frequently than other patients in previous studies did.
