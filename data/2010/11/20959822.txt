Background:We assessed the effectiveness of cetuximab plus chronomodulated irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (FA) and oxaliplatin (L-OHP) (chrono-IFLO) administered as neoadjuvant chemotherapy to increase the resectability of colorectal liver metastases.Methods:This was a phase II prospective trial with rate of liver metastases resection as primary end point. Forty-three patients with unresectable metastases were enroled: 9 with metastases >5 cm; 29 with multinodular (>4) disease; 1 with hilar location; 4 with extrahepatic lung disease. Treatment consisted of cetuximab at day 1 plus chronomodulated irinotecan 5-FU, FA and L-OHP for 2-6 days every 2 weeks. After the first 17 patients, doses were reduced for irinotecan to 110 mg m⁻², 5-FU to 550 mg m⁻² per day and L-OHP to 15 mg m⁻² per day.Results:Macroscopically complete resections were performed in 26 out of 43 patients (60%) after a median of 6 (range 3-15) cycles. Partial response was noticed in 34 patients (79%). Median overall survival was 37 months (95% CI: 21-53 months), with a 2-year survival of 68% in the entire population, 80.6% in resected patients and 47.1% in unresected patients (P=0.01). Grade 3/4 diarrhoea occurred in 93% and 36% of patients before and after dose reduction.Conclusion:Cetuximab plus chrono-IFLO achieved 60% complete resectability of colorectal liver metastases.
