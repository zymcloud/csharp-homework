We evaluated the effect of sorafenib and intermittent hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using cisplatin for unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:5 patients (4 male/1 female, median age: 73.0 years) with unresectable advanced HCC including portal vein tumor thrombus were treated with soraenib (400 mg/body, day 1-28) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2 HAIC, day 1, 8, 15). We assess efficacy and safety after 1 course of this therapy.Results:Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 2 patients (1 serum bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, 1 serum bilirubin elevation and hepatic encephalopathy). Grade 2 adverse events occurred in 4 patients (1 hypertension and nertropenia, 1 hypertension and thrombocytopenia, 1 hypertension and serum amylase elevation, and 1 abdominal pain). Grade 3 adverse events were improved by suspending this therapy, and completion of this therapy was achieved in all patients. After one course of this therapy, the clinical response was rated as 1 partial response (PR), 3-stable disease (SD), and 1 progressive disease (PD).Conclusion:Sorafenib and intermittent HAIC using cisplatin for unresectable advanced HCC was expected to be safe and effective treatment.
