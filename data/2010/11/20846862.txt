Novel thienopyridine derivatives 1b-1r were synthesized, based on a hit compound 1a that was found in a previous cell-based screening of anticancer drugs. Compounds 1a-1r have the following features: (1) their anticancer activity in vitro was first reported by our group. (2) The most potent analog 1g possesses hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific anticancer activity. It can specifically inhibit the proliferation of the human hepatoma HepG2 cells with an IC(50) value of 0.016μM (compared with doxorubicin as a positive control, whose IC(50) was 0.37μM). It is inactive toward a panel of five different types of human cancer cell lines. (3) Compound 1g remarkably induces G(0)/G(1) arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 cells in vitro at low micromolar concentrations. These results, especially the HCC-specific anticancer activity of 1g, suggest their potential in targeted chemotherapy for HCC.
