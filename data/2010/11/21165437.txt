Histological analysis demonstrated an increase in the number of blood vessels and expression of CD34 and vascular endothelial growth factor in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue compared to adjacent liver tissue. Increased immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and the content of this factor and its type 2 receptor correlated with the degree of histological differentiation and stage of the tumor.
