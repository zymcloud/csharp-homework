A 40s woman, who had undergone hepatic resection twice for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), was admitted to our hospital because of a tumor with pain on the right 9th rib. From the findings of chest computed tomography (CT), abdominal CT and bone scintigraphy, we diagnosed the rib metastasis of HCC without any other recurrences. Local resection of the right 9th rib was performed in July 2008. Histologically, the tumor of the rib was diagnosed as the metastasis of HCC. The patient's pain on the right rib was disappeared after the operation. After the rib resection, the recurrence of the remnant of the right 9th rib occurred in June 2009. Local resection of the rib was performed in July 2009. Afterward, the recurrence of the remnant of the right 9th rib occurred again in April 2010. Local resection of the tumor of the same rib was performed in May 2010. The patient is still alive five years after the first hepatectomy. For HCC patients whose intrahepatic lesion or other metastatic lesions are controllable and the metastatic bone lesion is solitary and easily resectable, a resection for bone metastasis from HCC is thus locally effective in patient's pain control.
