Importance of the field:Hepatic cirrhosis is a frequent consequence of chronic hepatitis infection (HBV and HCV) or alcohol abuse and the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, liver transplantation remains the only effective therapeutic approach for cirrhosis-related HCC patients. The evolution of the pathology strongly depends on immunological mechanisms.Areas covered in this review:Despite the presence of specific T cells, viral chronic infection and continuous tumor growth suggest a failure of immune control. It appears that direct suppression of antiviral or antitumor effector cells by regulatory T cells plays a pivotal role in the impairment of immune response. Several types of regulatory T cells have been described, natural regulatory T cells (nTreg) and induced-type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1) being the best characterized.What the reader will gain:Currently, there is no evidence for a direct implication of regulatory T cells in the evolution of hepatitis, especially concerning chronic infection, cirrhosis late stage and HCC progress. However, recent studies show that regulatory T cells are implicated in the modulation of HBV- and HCV-associated immune response, thus, promoting HCC progress.Take home message:Therefore, nTreg and Tr1 cells seem to play an important role in the control of immune response leading to chronic hepatitis infection and progression of the pathology to cirrhosis and HCC.
