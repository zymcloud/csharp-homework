Approximately 170 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide. Infection with this pathogen is persistent in more than 80% of cases, frequently developing severe forms of liver damage such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. No preventive vaccine is available against HCV, and current treatment based on the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is effective in âˆ¼55% of patients infected with genotype 1, the most prevalent genotype. This review analyzes several factors influencing the achievement of a sustained virological response, namely undetectable HCV RNA at 6 months after conclusion of therapy. Particularly, the relevant issue of age and duration of infection is discussed in detail. Indeed, the final decision for starting treatment should be a case-by-case point. However, the cost-benefit analysis seems to indicate that in patients who are motivated and without contraindications, starting the treatment as early as possible is probably the best choice for success.
