Objective:To analyze the clinical features and survival for patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (MTNBC), especially such a metastatic site as brain.Methods:The clinical data and survival status of 120 cases of operable MTNBC treated at our hospital from January 2002 to December 2004 were collected. SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistic treatment. Statistical significance was considered at P < 0.05.Results:At the time of last follow-up, the median time after metastasis was 22 months. Nine deaths (65.8%) were recorded. In terms of all metastatic sites (initial + subsequent), lung (58.3%), liver (41.7%) and brain (40.8%) were most common sites. The patients with brain metastasis had a worse survival than those with non-brain metastases. Twenty-two (18.3%) patients were found to have brain metastasis at the time of first metastatic presentation. The initial metastatic site in patients with brain metastasis had a worse survival than those with non-brain metastases. The median survival time after metastasis was 8 and 31 months respectively (P = 0.000).Conclusion:Triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a poor survival after metastases. The patients with brain metastases have a worse survival than those with non-brain metastases. New treatment strategies are needed.
