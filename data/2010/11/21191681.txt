Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as an important cause of liver disease in India. Epidemiological studies suggest prevalence of NAFLD in around 9% to 32% of general population in India with higher prevalence in those with overweight or obesity and those with diabetes or prediabetes. Clinicopathological studies show that NAFLD is an important cause of unexplained rise in hepatic transaminases, cryptogenic cirrhosis and cryptogenic hepatocellular carcinoma in Indian patients. There is high prevalence of insulin resistance and nearly half of Indian patients with NAFLD have evidence of full-blown metabolic syndrome. Though oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, serum or liver iron and HFE gene mutations appear not to play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in Indian patients. Imaging modalities are not useful in differentiating simple steatosis from NASH and liver biopsy may be useful in those with risk factors for significant liver disease. Pilot studies on treatment strategies have shown that weight reduction and exercise, ursodeoxycholic acid, metformin, vitamin E and pentoxyfylline are effective in normalizing transaminases and or in improving hepatic steatosis and inflammation in Indian patients with NAFLD. Randomized controlled treatment trials involving large number of patients with histological end point are required to assess the efficacy of different modalities. In conclusion, a lot has been done, yet more is required to understand various aspects of NAFLD in India.
