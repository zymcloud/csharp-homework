Background:Resection of isolated hepatic or pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer is widely accepted and associated with a 5-year survival rate of 25-40%. The value of aggressive surgical management in patients with both hepatic and pulmonary metastases still remains a controversial area.Materials and methods:A retrospective review of 1,497 patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) was analysed. Of 73 patients identified with resection of CRC and, at some point in time, both liver and lung metastases, 17 patients underwent metastasectomy (resection group). The remaining 56 patients comprised the non-resection group. Primary tumour, hepatic and pulmonary metastases of all patients were surgically treated in our department of surgery, and the results are that of a single institution.Results:The resection group had a 3-year survival of 77%, a 5-year survival of 55% and a 10-year survival of 18%; median survival was 98 months. The longest overall survival was 136 months; six patients are still alive. In the resection group, overall survival was significantly higher than in the non-resection group (p < 0.01). Independent from the chronology of metastasectomy, 5-year survival was 55% with respect to the primary resection, 28% with respect to the first metastasectomy and 14% with respect to the second metastasectomy. A disease-free interval (>18 months), stage III (UICC) and age (<70 years) were found to be significant prognostic factors for overall survival.Conclusion:Our report strongly supports aggressive surgical therapy in patients with both hepatic and pulmonary metastases from CRC. Overall survival for surgically treated selected patients with both hepatic and pulmonary metastases from CRC is comparable to hepatic or pulmonary metastasectomy. Simultaneous metastases tend to have a poorer outcome than metachronous metastases.
