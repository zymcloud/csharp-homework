A 56-year-old man presented with asymptomatic gross hematuria. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed right hydronephrosis and a slightly enhanced invasive tumor in the right lower ureter, providing a diagnosis of ureteral cancer stage cT3NOM0. The patient underwent minimum incision endoscopic nephrouretectomy, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed urothelial carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma with metastases to right obturator lymph nodes (pT3pN2). Ten months later, CT scan of the abdomen revealed two hepatic metastases. After three courses of combination chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC), one tumor completely disappeared and another achieved a partial response. The patient underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the residual followed by GC chemotherapy. However, eighteen months later, CT scan of the abdomen revealed two metastatic foci in other hepatic lesion. The patient underwent RFA again followed by GC chemotherapy and then all hepatic metastases have not revealed enlargement. More than three years after surgery, the patient has achieved a high quality of life.
