Purpose:To identify the parameters that predict hepatic toxicity and deterioration of hepatic function.Materials and methods:A total of 47 patients with small unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma received hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using the CyberKnife. Of those, 36 patients received no other local treatments that could influence hepatic toxicity at least for 3 months after the completion of SBRT. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was 18.3 Â± 15.9 cm(3) (range, 3.0-81.3 cm(3)), and the total dose administered was 30-39 Gy (median, 36 Gy). To assess the deterioration of hepatic function, we evaluated the presence or absence of the progression of Child-Pugh class (CP class). To identify the parameters of predicting the radiation-induced hepatic toxicity and deterioration of the hepatic function, several clinical and dose-volumetric parameters were evaluated.Results:Of 36 patients, 12 (33%) developed Grade 2 or higher hepatic toxicity and 4 (11%) developed progression of CP class. The multivariate analysis showed that the only significant parameter associated with the progression of CP class was the total liver volume receiving a dose less than 18 Gy (Conclusions:The progression of CP class after SBRT limits other additional local treatments and also reflects the deterioration of hepatic function. Therefore, it would be important to note that the presence or absence of the progression of CP class is a dose-limiting factor. The total liver volume receiving
