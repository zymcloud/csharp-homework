The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains dismal. Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), a fetal growth factor, is highly expressed during HCC development. We examined serum IGF-II levels and circulating IGF-II messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics in patients with liver diseases. The higher IGF-II level in the serum of patients with HCC could be correlated with hepatitis B virus infection but not with patient sex, age, tumor size, or Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) level. Total RNAs were extracted from liver tissues or peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and IGF-II complementary DNA (cDNA) and AFP cDNA were synthesized through random primers and reverse transcriptase; gene fragments were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by sequencing. The incidence of the hepatic IGF-II gene was 100% in HCC, 54.3% in paracancerous tissues, and none in noncancerous tissues. The incidence rates for circulating IGF-II and AFP genes were 34.3% and 52.7%, respectively, and for both, 61.6% in patients with HCC. They were 100% in cases with extrahepatic metastasis. The IGF-II abnormality associates with HCC, and circulating IGF-II and IGF-II mRNA are useful molecular markers for HCC differential diagnosis and hematogenous metastasis.
