The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of hepatic artery infusion (HAI) plus systemic chemotherapy (SYS) as the prehepatectomy chemotherapy for liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Clinicopathologic data were available for 117 patients who were treated with chemotherapy before liver surgery. Response rate of chemotherapy and frequency of liver resection after chemotherapy of patients treated with HAI/SYS (n=26; 65% and 96%, respectively) were higher than those treated with HAI alone (n=63; 41% and 70%) or SYS alone (n=28; 25% and 42%). Histological examination of adjacent nonneoplastic liver confirmed that severe sinusoidal dilatation was less frequent in HAI/SYS group than in SYS group, and moderate to severe steatosis was also less frequent in HAI/SYS group as compared to HAI group. The combination of regional HAI and systemic chemotherapy is an effective prehepatectomy regimen for the treatment of patients with aggressive liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
