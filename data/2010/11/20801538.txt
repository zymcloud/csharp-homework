Background & aims:KLF6 protein is a transcription factor that plays important functions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is one of the leading causes of death by cancer worldwide. Previous studies showed the existence of three splice variants of KLF6, termed SV1, SV2, and SV3. An increased SV1/KLF6 mRNA ratio in HCC was already described. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of the SV2 variant in HCC samples and its role in hepatic cells.Methods:We measured the expression of the SV2 variant in HCC and adjacent tissue samples by q-RT-PCR. We established IHH and HepG2 stable cell lines over-expressing the SV2 variant and measured cell growth and apoptotic rate.Results:We observed a reduced expression of the SV2 variant in HCC samples versus surrounding tissues and normal liver. Interestingly, our findings demonstrate that the over-expression of the SV2 variant in IHH and HepG2 cells leads to a significant reduction of proliferation associated with cell death by apoptosis. We further demonstrate that the SV2 expression leads to an induction of the cell-cycle-controlling p21(CIP/WAF1) and the pro-apoptotic Bax genes, mediated by the p53 protein. We show further that the SV2 expression in IHH and HepG2 cells induces their sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug, gemcitabine.Conclusion:We reveal a reduced expression of the SV2 variant of KLF6 in HCC samples and describe anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic functions for this variant in hepatic cells.
