Background:Transarterial chemotherapy infusion (TAI) with lipiodol is a palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of TAI from a single scandinavian centre between 1995 to 2008.Methods:The study is a retrospective analyse of prospectively collected data. TAI (doxorubicin, 50 mg with lipiodol) was administrated every 6 weeks. After 5 treatments, a CT scan was performed, and if the disease was stable, (RECIST score) treatment was continued.Results:57 patients with HCC were treated with TAI. Median age; 72 years (52-84), 41 (71%) men. 52 (91%) had Child-Pugh score A, and 5 (9%) had Child-Pugh B. Nine (16%) patients had a BCLC score A, 19 (33%) B, 29 (51%) C, while none was classified as BCLC D. Twenty nine (51%) patients had a tumour size â‰¥ 10 cm. In total 254 treatments were performed, a median of 4 (1-20) per patient. Treatment mortality was 0%. In 30 (53%) patients the treatment strategy was not completed due to deteriorating clinical conditions. Median survival was 17 months (2-108), 2, 3, and 5-years survival was 34%, 22%, and 13%, respectively. Patients that responded to treatment (n = 23) had a median survival of 26 (13-108) months compared to 8 (2-48) months for those not fulfilling the treatment plan, p Conclusions:The 5 year survival was 13%, and median survival 17 months. Treatment mortality was 0%. Patients that responded to treatment (40%) had a median survival of 26 months. TAI provides good palliation but selection of patients is crucial.
