Purpose:The positive role of radiotherapy for patients with lymph node (LN) metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma has recently been reported. The outcome and prognostic factors for these patients were analyzed.Methods and materials:Between May 2004 and October 2007, 38 patients with LN metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma underwent radiotherapy. The median age was 59 years (range, 42-81). The radiation dose was 35-56 Gy with a fraction size of 1.8-3 Gy, for a biologically effective dose of 43.75-67.2 Gy(10) (median, 59.0). The median follow-up period was 8 months.Results:The median survival time was 10 months. On univariate analysis, Child-Pugh class B (p = .0006), distant metastasis (p = .0095), symptoms related to metastatic LNs (p Conclusion:Patients with intact liver function and without related symptoms had the best prognosis when undergoing radiotherapy for LN metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma.
