Purpose:Lintuzumab (HuM195), a humanized anti-CD33 antibody, targets myeloid leukemia cells and has modest single-agent activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To increase the potency of the antibody without the nonspecific cytotoxicity associated with β-emitters, the α-particle-emitting radionuclide bismuth-213 ((213)Bi) was conjugated to lintuzumab. This phase I/II trial was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and antileukemic effects of (213)Bi-lintuzumab, the first targeted α-emitter, after partially cytoreductive chemotherapy.Experimental design:Thirty-one patients with newly diagnosed (n = 13) or relapsed/refractory (n = 18) AML (median age, 67 years; range, 37-80) were treated with cytarabine (200 mg/m(2)/d) for 5 days followed by (213)Bi-lintuzumab (18.5-46.25 MBq/kg).Results:The MTD of (213)Bi-lintuzumab was 37 MB/kg; myelosuppression lasting >35 days was dose limiting. Extramedullary toxicities were primarily limited to grade ≤2 events, including infusion-related reactions. Transient grade 3/4 liver function abnormalities were seen in five patients (16%). Treatment-related deaths occurred in 2 of 21 (10%) patients who received the MTD. Significant reductions in marrow blasts were seen at all dose levels. The median response duration was 6 months (range, 2-12). Biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies suggested that saturation of available CD33 sites by (213)Bi-lintuzumab was achieved after partial cytoreduction with cytarabine.Conclusions:Sequential administration of cytarabine and (213)Bi-lintuzumab is tolerable and can produce remissions in patients with AML.
