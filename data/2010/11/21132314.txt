Purpose:The aims of this study were to assess the surgical outcomes and to also determine the prognostic factors in patients with surgically resectable liver metastases for recurrent ovarian cancer.Methods:Between 1991 and 2008, 18 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who underwent hepatic resection as part of secondary cytoreductive surgery were identified from the tumor registry pathology database. Parameters for safety, efficacy, and survival data were considered as primary endpoints.Results:Hepatic resections included wedge resection (n = 4), unisegmentectomy (n = 13), and bisegmentectomy (n = 1). There were no surgery-related deaths. Only one patient (5.6%) had postoperative major complications. The median postoperative hospitalization was 15.5 days (range 11-46 days). The prognostic factors associated with improved survival were less abdominal than pelvic disease (38 vs. 11 months, P = 0.032), optimal cytoreduction (40 vs. 9 months, P = 0.0004), and negative margin status of the hepatic resection (40 vs. 9 months, P = 0.0196). The overall median survival after hepatic resection was 38 months (range 3-78 months).Conclusion:Hepatic resection for recurrent ovarian cancer is safe and is associated with a favorable outcome. Parenchymal liver metastases should not exclude attempts at optimal secondary cytoreductive surgery, and especially, patients with solitary liver metastases should be considered for hepatic resection.
