Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) frequently suffer from stage IV disease at the time of presentation. Survival of these patients is disadvantageous although they may benefit from chemotherapy. The main purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the prognostic relevance of the metastatic localisation in unselected patients. The second purpose was to evaluate the impact of clinical characteristics on the kind of decision-making in patients with stage IV NSCLC in an epidemiological manner.[nl]Clinical data as well as survival of 336 patients with stage IV NSCLC were analysed. The recruitment period was 3? years, mean follow-up was 24 months. This investigation was part of the HALLUCA studies which were sponsored by the German Ministry of Health.[nl]Localisation-dependent median and 1-year survivals were significantly different and varied between 2.2 months and 4.7 % (liver metastases) and 11.0 months and 44.5 % (lung metastases). The different survival remained significant in the multivariate analyses with age, performance status, treatment and histology as co variables. The chemotherapy rate of all patients with stage IV NSCLC was 39 %. Patients with liver, bone and multiple metastases received less often chemotherapy compared to patients with other metastases although the performance status was not different to the other groups.[nl]Although there are some limitations in this investigation, these epidemiological data demonstrate the prognostic heterogeneity of stage IV NSCLC patients which should be considered for stratification in controlled clinical trials. Regional treatment decision-making is different from guidelines and controlled clinical trials. Further regionally orientated trials are necessary to improve the transformation from clinical trials to regional medical care.
