Chinese immigrants in the United States experience a higher incidence of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, stomach, and liver and higher rates of tuberculosis and hepatitis B virus than other U.S. immigrant groups. Because of language and cultural barriers, many do not seek the health information they need, resulting in delayed diagnosis and inability to effectively manage health problems. The purpose of this study was to identify the cultural beliefs and meanings influencing the utilization behaviors and perceptions of how this group finds and uses the health information they need. Using an explorative qualitative descriptive design, 24 Chinese immigrants in two urban centers in the northwestern part of the United States were interviewed about their beliefs and perceptions of health information. Results revealed many challenges that served as barriers to health promotion, indicating that health care providers need to respond to the needs of this population with increased thoughtfulness and culturally relevant practices.
