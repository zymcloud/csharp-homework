Objective:To evaluate the application of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of liver (IPL).Methods:The contrast-enhanced untrasonography was performed in 32 cases of IPL and the results were retrospectively analyzed.Result:Among total 32 cases, 21 had absent contrast enhancement (type I); 6 had rimlike or stringlike enhancement during arterial phase and presented hypoechoic lesions during the late phase (type II); 2 had diffuse and homogeneous enhancement during early arterial phase,persisting hyperechoic during the late phase (type III); 3 had enhancement during arterial phases and washed out more quickly than liver parenchymal (type IV).Conclusion:The perfusion pattern of IPL with CEUS varies, the predominant type is no contrast enhancement; type IV may be confused with atypical hepatic carcinoma, in that case the needle biopsy is necessary.
