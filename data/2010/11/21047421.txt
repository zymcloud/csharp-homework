Epidemiological, preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that chronic inflammation induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is crucial in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. The interaction between hepatocytes and microenvironment regards virus, inflammatory and immunocompetent cells, chemo- and cyto-kines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), generating cell transformation. We suggest hepatocarcinoma (HCC) as a model in which the targeting of microenvironment determine neoplastic transformation. The present review focuses on: the role of inflammation in carcinogenesis, the clinical impact of HCC and the inadequacy of the actual therapy, the chemoprevention targeting the microenvironment.
