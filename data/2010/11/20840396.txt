Background/aims:The recurrence rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high even in patients receiving curative therapy. In this study, we analysed the risk factors for tumour recurrence after curative therapy for HBV-related HCC while under treatment with nucleot(s)ide analogues (NAs) by measuring serum HBcrAg and intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels to elucidate the viral status associated with HCC recurrence.Methods:We enrolled 55 patients who developed HCC during NA therapy and underwent either curative resection or percutaneous ablation for HCC.Results:Hepatocellular carcinoma recurred in 21 (38%) of the patients over a period of 2.2 (range, 0.2-7.4) years. In multivariate analysis, serum HBcrAg levels â‰¥4.8 log U/ml at the time of HCC diagnosis (hazard ratio, 8.96; 95% confidential interval, 1.94-41.4) and portal vein invasion (3.94, 1.25-12.4) were independent factors for HCC recurrence. The recurrence-free survival rates of the high cccDNA group were significantly lower than those of the low cccDNA group only in patients who underwent resection (P=0.0438). A positive correlation (P=0.028; r=0.479) was observed between the intrahepatic cccDNA and the serum HBcrAg levels at the incidence of HCC.Conclusion:HBcrAg is a predictor of the post-treatment recurrence of HCC during antiviral therapy. Serum HBcrAg and intrahepatic cccDNA suppression by NAs may be important to prevent HCC recurrence.
