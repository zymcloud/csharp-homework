A 56-year-old man was revealed to be HCC with portal vein tumor thrombus. Curative operation was impossible because we recognized many daughter lesions in the liver. Tumor marker was very high. DSM-TACE was conducted as the first line therapy. There was no remarkable side effect. After two-course, the size of HCC was decreased in CT and tumor marker was normalized. Generally speaking, a prognosis of HCC with portal vein tumor thrombus is poor. Hence, DSM-TACE is one of the effective therapies for HCC with portal vein tumor thrombus.
