A case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with pulmonary recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC is presented in this report. The patient showed disease progression on sorafenib therapy demonstrated by computed tomography scans as well as serial serum Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) elevation. After his immunosuppression therapy was successfully transitioned to sirolimus and a continuation of sorafenib, he achieved partial remission based on RECIST criteria and normalization of AFP. Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors including sirolimus alone or in conjunction with sorafenib may be useful in the treatment of post transplant HCC.
