We report 5 cases of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) oxaliplatin after systemic infusion chemotherapy failure. Patients with unresectable CRLM and history of systemic chemotherapy failure were treated with HAI oxaliplatin (L-OHP 100 mg/body, 2 hours) combined with intravenous (iv) levofolinate calcium (175 mg/body, 2 hours) and iv bolus 5-FU (500 mg/body) every 2 weeks.Result:An average age was 58 years. All patients had previously received FOLFOX. Lung metastases had already existence before HAI oxaliplatin in 4 patients. A median of 10 treatments were administered (range 5-14). Serum level of CEA was decreased in 4 cases. In 2 patients, lung metastasis developed while a PR was obtained in the liver metastasis. Progress disease (PD) was confirmed in other 3 patients. No major toxicity was presented. The median time to progression free survival was 3.0 months and the median overall survival was 7.1 months.Conclusion:HAI oxaliplatin might be beneficial as a salvage therapy for CRLM without extrahepatic metastasis, which demonstrated an acceptable tolerability and maintenance of QOL.
