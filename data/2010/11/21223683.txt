Objective:To investigate the effect of phenylhexyl isothiocyanate (PHI) on histone acetylation and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (SMMC-7721) in vitro.Methods:The viability of SMMC-7721 cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Apoptotic cells were assessed by TUNEL assay. The proteins of Bcl-2, Procaspase-9, Procaspase-8, Procaspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-3, histone acetylated H3 and H4 were detected by Western blot.Results:Compared with the vehicle control, PHI at 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 µmol/L reduced the cell viability of SMMC-7721 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. PHI induced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. An increased amount of apoptotic cells was detected after 7 hours exposure to PHI at 10, 20, and 40 µmol/L, 6.9% ± 2.4%, 17.5% ± 4.2% and 54.5% ± 5.4%, respectively, while that of the vehicle control was 4.5% ± 2.3% (P Conclusion:PHI is a new histone deacetylation inhibitor. It may induce accumulation of histone acetylation H3 and H4, inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells via the mitochondrial pathway.
