Construction of three-dimensional volumes from a series of two-dimensional images has been restricted by the limited capacity to decrease the opacity of tissue. The use of commercial software that allows colour-keying and manipulation of two-dimensional images in true three-dimensional space allowed us to construct three-dimensional volumes from pixel-based images of stained plant and animal tissue without generating vector information. We present three-dimensional volumes of (1) the crown of an oat plant showing internal responses to a freezing treatment, (2) a sample of a hepatocellular carcinoma from a woodchuck liver that had been heat-treated with computer-guided radiofrequency ablation to induce necrosis in the central portion of the tumour, and (3) several features of a sample of mouse lung. The technique is well suited to images from large sections (greater than 1 mm) generated from paraffin-embedded tissues. It is widely applicable, having potential to recover three-dimensional information at virtually any resolution inherent in images generated by light microscopy, computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or electron microscopy.
