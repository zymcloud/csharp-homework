Objective:to raise awareness about lung cancer in pregnancy.Methods:the clinical presentations, diagnosis and treatment of 2 cases of lung cancer in pregnancy were reported, and related literatures were reviewed.Results:The first case was a 31-year-old pregnant woman at 34(th)-week gestation, who presented with right sided pleural effusion on a Chest X-ray film. A boy was delivered by Cesarean section at 35 weeks of gestation. Biopsy of the right-supraclavicular lymph node was performed simultaneously, and histopathological examination showed metastatic large cell lung cancer. Her respiratory condition worsened after the Caesarian section, and so mechanical ventilation, antibiotics and gefitinib were administered, but the treatment failed. She died on the 28(th) day after Caesarian section. The second case was a 28-year-old pregnant woman at the 27 week of gestation. PET showed right lung cancer with metastases to the pericardium, right pleura, liver and pelvic cavity. Bronchoscopic biopsy showed small-cell lung cancer. After pregnancy termination, the patient received 2 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and etoposide. The size of lesions decreased and the patient returned to the local hospital.Conclusions:lung cancer in pregnancy is a rare condition with poor prognosis. To improve the prognosis and prevent the metastasis to the fetus, systemic therapy should be considered, and meanwhile maternal advantage must be always weighed against possible embryo-fetal risks.
