Î¤he expression of cell cycle (P53, Ki-67, P21, and P27) and apoptotic proteins (BCL-2 and BAX) was investigated by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissues of normal and pathologic liver. An increased frequency of expression of P21 in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (p=0.003 and p=0.001 respectively) was found; P27 protein expression was more frequent in hepatitis (p=0.001) and HCC (p=0.003) when compared with normal tissue. BCL-2 protein was markedly more frequent in steatohepatitis (p
