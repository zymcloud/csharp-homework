To cure intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), only a surgical resection is the potential treatment at present. However, recurrence tumors in residual liver and/or distant organs even after curative surgery are commonly experienced in clinical course. Unfortunately the potential treatment for this recurrent disease is not established at present. Accordingly, the prognosis of this recurrent ICC is extremely poor. Here, we report the prolonged survival case with recurrent ICC after hepatic resection followed by combined therapy of intrahepatic arterial infusion with CDDP and S-1 administration. The patient was a 71-year-old female. She had been treated for hepatitis B for last 5 years. After that, liver tumor of 30 mm in diameter was detected in S1/8 by abdominal CT examination. Subsequently, caudate lobectomy and partial resection of Segment 8 were performed under the diagnosis of Hepatocellular carcinoma in Osaka university hospital. The pathological stage was T2N0M0, Stage II with moderately differentiated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. As the recurrence tumor was found in Segment 4 of residual liver, we started a treatment with intrahepatic arterial infusion with CDDP and S-1 administration, immediately. These combined therapy displayed beneficial effects and a recurrent liver tumor was well controlled. At present, this patient is still survived for over 5 years after the operation.
