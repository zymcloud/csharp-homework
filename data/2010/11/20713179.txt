Background & aims:Little is known about the impact of changes in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over time. We assessed trends in the pattern of care and in prognosis at a population level.Methods:Data on diagnostic conditions, treatment, and prognosis from 1976-2005 were collected by the population-based digestive cancer registry of Burgundy (France). A nonconditional logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with treatment for cure. A multivariate relative survival analysis was also performed.Results:The context of HCC diagnosis has changed; the proportion of asymptomatic patients increased from 5.6% (1976-1985) to 37.2% (1996-2005). The proportion of cases diagnosed on the basis of morphologic criteria increased from 14% during 1976-1985 to 35.6% during 1996-2005, whereas histologically verified cases decreased from 62.2% to 41.2% between the same time periods. The proportion of patients who were treated with intent to cure increased from 2.7% (1976-1985) to 19.6% (1996-2005). This increase was associated with improvements in relative survival from 4.7% (1976-1985) to 32.8% (1996-2005) at 1 year and from 1.4% to 10.0% at 5 years. The 5-year relative survival of patients treated with curative intent increased, reaching 46.6% for the 1996-2005 period. In the multivariate relative survival analysis, age, period of diagnosis, clinical presentation, alpha-fetoprotein level, and treatment were independent prognostic factors.Conclusions:During a 30-year period, there was an increase in the number of HCCs diagnosed in asymptomatic subjects that was associated with the development of new effective therapies; this association might account for improvements in prognosis of patients with HCC.
