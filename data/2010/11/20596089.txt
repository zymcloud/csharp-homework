Gene therapy promises to become an alternative choice for the treatment of hepatic cancer. In many cancers, the delivery of chimeric proteins by adenovirus vector has been reported to induce apoptosis. This study was performed to evaluate whether the recombinant adenovirus interleukin (IL)-24-Bax can induce apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Several recombinant adenoviruses were constructed, and the expression of their encoded proteins was measured. The effects of the recombinant adenovirus on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and the normal hepatocyte cell line were investigated through cell viability and apoptosis assays after the cells were treated with Ad.Luc, Ad.IL-24, Ad.Bax or Ad.IL-24-Bax. The mechanism involved was also explored. A tumor-bearing mouse model was used to evaluate the effects of the adenovirus on tumor volume and cell apoptosis in vivo. Ad.IL-24-Bax selectively suppressed growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and induced apoptosis, but it had little influence on the normal hepatocytes. The mechanism of this response may include the effect of the 10HRE/VEGF385 promoter and the synergistic effect of IL-24 and Bax. Ad.IL-24-Bax also suppressed tumor growth in nude mice and induced apoptosis. Ad.IL-24-Bax may be a useful tool for gene therapy of hepatic cancer.
