INrf2(Keap1) functions as an adapter for Cul3/Rbx1-mediated degradation of Nrf2. In response to stress, Nrf2 is released from INrf2 and translocates inside the nucleus leading to activation of cytoprotective proteins critical in protection against adverse effects including cancer. We demonstrate here a novel role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in control of the INrf2 and Nrf2 activation. Hsp90 interacted with INrf2 that leds to stabilization of INrf2 during heat shock stress. Domain mapping showed the requirement of INrf2-NTR and the Hsp90-CLD region for interaction of Hsp90 with INrf2. Heat shock and antioxidants induced Hsp90, and casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylated INrf2Thr55. This led to increased Hsp90-INrf2 interaction, dissociation of the Rbx1/Cul3·INrf2·Nrf2 complex, and activation of Nrf2. Inhibitors of CK2 and Hsp90, and mutation of INrf2Thr55 abolished the Hsp90-INrf2 interaction and downstream signaling. INrf2 is released from Hsp90 once the heat shock or antioxidant stress subsidized, thereby allowing INrf2 to interact with Nrf2 and facilitate Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. The results together demonstrate a novel role for the stress-induced Hsp90-INrf2 interaction in regulation of Nrf2 activation and induction of cytoprotective proteins.
