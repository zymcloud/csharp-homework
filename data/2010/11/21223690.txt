Objective:To investigate and analyze the expression of fascin and CK14 in multiple histological types of cancer and to explore the potential value of the two proteins as markers in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of various cancer types.Methods:Tissue microarray containing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), lung SCC, larynx SCC, uterine cervical SCC, SCC of external genital organs, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, heptocellular carcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma, thyroid papillary carcinoma, uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma, ovarian serous adenocarcinoma and renal clear cell carcinoma, 30 cases each, as well as corresponding normal controls was constructed. The expression of fascin and CK14 among different types of carcinoma and corresponding normal controls was detected by immunohistochemistry.Results:In normal esophagus, bronchus, larynx, uterine cervix and skin, fascin was mainly expressed in the basal cells or reserve cells, but the expression was diffuse in esophageal SCC, lung SCC, larynx SCC, uterine cervical SCC and SCC of external genital organs, with a positive rate of 90.0%, 90.0%, 96.7%, 78.6% and 89.7%, respectively. In the normal tissue of other organs, except breast and uterine endometrium, fascin was negative. In lung adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, breast infiltrating dutal adenocarcinoma, thyroid papillary carcinoma, uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma, ovarian serous adenocarcinoma and renal clear cell carcinoma, the positive rates were 38.0%, 23.3%, 14.3%, 10.3%, 73.3%, 13.3%, 6.7%, 60.0%, 66.7% and 10.0%, respectively. The difference between fascin expression in SCC and in other histological types was statistically significant (P Conclusion:Fascin and CK14 are highly expressed in SCC, compared with other histological types of carcinoma. Combination of fascin and CK14 should be a valuable marker in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of carcinoma.
