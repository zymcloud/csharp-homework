A series of new polyazaheterocyclic ring systems was synthesized via the reaction of enaminone 5 with active methylene compounds, hydrazine hydrate, hydroxylamine, and heterocyclic amines. The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were substantiated on the basis of spectral data and elemental analyses. The antitumor activity of the enaminone 5 against the human breast cell line MCF-7, the liver carcinoma cell line HEPG2-1, and HELA cells was determined. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of some selected products was evaluated.
