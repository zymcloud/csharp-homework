We herein report a case of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with Vp4 portal vein thrombosis (PVTT). All of the hepatic tumors have completely disappeared for more than two years by a dual treatment with reductive surgery plus percutaneous isolated hepatic perfusion (PIHP). A 68-year-old man was referred to our institution in May 2009. The abdominal CT scan demonstrated massive HCC in the right robe of the liver with PVTT reaching the portal trunk (Vp4). We semi-electively performed a right hepatectomy together with thrombectomy of the PVTT. Subsequently, we underwent a PIHP (doxorubicin 90 mg/m2). This resulted in normalization of serum AFP and PIVKA-II levels. Dual treatment is considered to be the strongest therapeutic modality for multiple advanced HCC with severe PVTT.
