A dendritic cell (DC) vaccine strategy has been developed as a new cancer immunotherapy, but the goal of complete tumor eradication has not yet been achieved. We have previously shown that baculoviruses potently infect DCs and induce antitumor immunity against hepatomas in a mouse model. Baculovirus-infected, bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) display increased surface expression of costimulatory molecules, such as CD80, CD86 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II, and secrete interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we evaluated the induction of antitumor immunity in mice by baculovirus-infected BMDCs against lung cancer and melanoma. After treatment with baculovirus-infected BMDCs, murine lung tumors caused by Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were significantly reduced in size, and the survival of the mice was improved. In addition, experiments using a melanoma mouse model showed that baculovirus-infected BMDCs inhibited tumor growth and improved survival compared with controls. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine levels remained normal in baculovirus-infected BMDC-treated mice. Our findings show that baculovirus-infected DCs induce antitumor immunity and pave the way for the use of this technique as an effective tool for DC immunotherapy against malignancies.
