Purpose:To give an up-to-date overview of the potential clinical utility of (18)F-labelled choline derivatives for tumour imaging with positron emission tomography.Methods:A PubMed search for (18)F-labelled choline analogues was performed. Review articles and reference lists were used to supplement the search findings.Results:(18)F-labelled choline analogues have been investigated as oncological PET probes for many types of cancer on the basis of enhanced cell proliferation. To date, studies have focused on the evaluation of prostate cancer. Available studies have provided preliminary results for detecting local and metastatic disease. Experience with (18)F-fluorocholine PET in other tumour types, including brain and liver tumours, is still limited. In the brain, excellent discrimination between tumour and normal tissue can be achieved due to the low physiological uptake of (18)F-fluorocholine. In the liver, in which there is a moderate to high degree of physiological uptake in normal tissue, malignancy discrimination may be more challenging.Conclusion:PET/CT with (18)F-fluorocholine can be used to detect (recurrent) local prostate cancer, but seems to have limited value for T (tumour) and N (nodal) staging. In patients presenting with recurrent biochemical prostate cancer, it is a suitable single-step examination with the ability to exclude distant metastases when local salvage treatment is intended. In the brain, high-grade gliomas, metastases and benign lesions can be distinguished on the basis of (18)F-fluorocholine uptake. Moreover, PET imaging is able to differentiate between radiation-induced injury and tumour recurrence. In the liver, (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT seems promising for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
