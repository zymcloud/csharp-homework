Hepatocarcinogenesis after a sustained virological response (SVR) in type C chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis is an important issue in endemic areas; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) therapy is especially very hard. We herein report a first case in which combination therapy with interferon-Î± and continuous intra-arterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (designated as FAIT) provided a complete response in HCC with PVTT after SVR. Therefore, we think that FAIT is a good option to treat HCC with or without PVTT, even after SVR.
