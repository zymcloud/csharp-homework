A variety of benign and malignant neoplasms can be encountered in the liver. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections alone may not yield sufficient information to definitively diagnose liver tumors; therefore, ancillary studies with immunohistochemical markers can play a crucial role in differentiating the different hepatic neoplasms. The recent development of oncofetoprotein glypican-3 has added to the value of immunohistochemistry in diagnosing liver cancer. This review discusses the immunohistochemical markers used most often in the diagnosis of hepatic tumors.
