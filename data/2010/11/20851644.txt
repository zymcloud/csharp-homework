Background:Genotype B and C are the predominant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains in Taiwan. We aimed to investigate the role of genotype in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after resection.Study design:From October 2005 to November 2008, 64 patients who underwent liver resection for HBV-related HCC were enrolled. HBV genotypes were determined by molecular method. Patient characteristics, biochemical, tumor, and viral factors were evaluated for their prognostic significance.Results:During a mean follow-up of 26.6 ± 13.2 months, patients infected with genotype C had higher HBV viral load (p = 0.007) and worse disease-free survival rate (p = 0.028) than patients with genotype B. By univariate analysis, genotype C, alanine transaminase >50 U/L, tumor size ≥5 cm, and microvascular invasion were associated with tumor recurrence. Further multivariate analysis demonstrated genotype C remained a significant risk factor (p = 0.034).Conclusions:Genotype C is a strong risk factor for HCC recurrence after resection. More intensive monitoring for recurrence should be considered in patients with genotype C.
