Background:For patients with compensated cirrhosis, transcatheter arterial embolization with and without additive chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival. The aim of this study was to compare periprocedural complications in a population with hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma to evaluate for differences in complications by severity of liver disease.Methods:Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated by transcatheter arterial embolization with or without additive chemotherapy procedures from 2003 to 2006 were retrospectively reviewed and compared by Child-Pugh (CP) class. A total of 141 embolizations were done in 76 patients.Results:Complication rates were seen in 27% of CP class A and 17% of CP class B patients. There was no significant difference in the grade of complications between the 2 groups or between procedure types. Survival rate was dependent on the degree of liver dysfunction (3-year CP class A, 49%; CP class B, 13%; P = .0048).Conclusion:Embolization procedures to treat hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma can be performed safely with low morbidity and mortality rates, even in patients with a compromised hepatic reserve.
