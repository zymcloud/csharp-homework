Objective:Discuss the relationship between the X-ray repair cross complementing gene group 1 (XRCC1) 399 point polymorphisms and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence.Methods:Search the domestic and abroad database to obtain the related cases of XRCC1 gene polymorphisms and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence, and use the analysis software Review Manager 4. 2. 8 to perform the comprehensive statistic processing and heterogeneity test for each research data included in this meta analysis and calculate the combined OR value (with 95% CI).Results:There were 7 literatures conformed to the inclusion criteria. A total of 1133 hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 1747 control cases were included. The meta analysis results showed that compared with the wild-type homozygous Arg/Arg, the combined OR (95% CI) of variant heterozygous genotype Arg/Gln and (Arg/Gln + Gln/Gln) were both 1.00 (0.68, 1.47), and the combined OR (95% CI) of variant homozygous genotype was 1.02 (0.60, 1.72). The relationship between XRCC1 399 point polymorphisms and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence was of no statistical significance.Conclusion:No statistically significant relationship between the genotype of XRCC1 399 point polymorphism and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence was found.
