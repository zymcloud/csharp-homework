A 69-year-old woman visited our emergency room because of sudden right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominal CT revealed a ruptured tumor in the anterior segment of the liver. Emergency laparotomy was selected due to interventional radiology was not available. As the patient was in shock status with massive intraabdominal hemorrhage, ligation of the right hepatic artery and suturing of the tumor bleeding point was carried out. Given the patient's history and liver biopsy report, we concluded as hepatocellular carcinoma derived form NASH. Anterior resection of the liver was performed after the patient became stable. About one year later, tumor was detected in the lateral segment and was removed. The patient is free of disease for two and a half years after the initial operation. Carcinogenesis of the hepatocellular carcinoma within NASH is not well described. We herein report a case of ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma originated from NASH.
