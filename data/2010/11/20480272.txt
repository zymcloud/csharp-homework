Celastrol, a novel HSP90 inhibitor, has recently attracted much attention due to its potential in multiple applications, such as anti-inflammation use, degenerative neuron disease relief, and tumor management. At present, the studies in celastrol's effects on HSP90's clients have focused on the kinase sub-population, while another key sub-population, nuclear transcription factors (TFs), is not being well-explored. In this study, we observe the effects of celastrol on 18 TFs (belonging to HSP90 clients) in three human cell lines: MCF-7 (breast cancer), HepG2 (hepatoma), and THP-1 (monocytic leukemia). The results show that at least half of the detectable TFs were affected by celastrol, though the effect patterns varied with cell type and dosage. Bi-directional regulations of some TFs were identified, a phenomenon not yet seen with other HSP90 inhibitors. Celastrol's capability to affect multiple TFs was consistent with its altering HSP90/TFs interactions and disrupting HSP90/Hop interaction, in addition to the reported damaging HSP90/Cdc37 interaction. This work confirms, for the first time, that celastrol has broad effects on TFs belonging to HSP90's clients, casts new light on understanding these reported actions, and suggests new possible applications for celastrol, such as diabetes management.
