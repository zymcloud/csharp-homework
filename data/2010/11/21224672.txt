We examined the case of laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (L-RFA) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and then the method of this treatment was considered in terms of selection and adjustment. Between January 2008 and May 2010, L-RFC was performed on 18 cases (27 tumors). A total operation time was 203 minutes (± 85.5). The median survival time was 562 days (± 197 day). The amount of blood was 21.0 g (± 68.4), and 3 postoperative complications (pleural effusion) were observed. The average length of hospital stay after the operation was 8 days. There was no vestigial remnant in all cases after the operation. The prognosis of death due to a liver failure was one case on the 516th day after the operation. All other 17 cases were survived. If the tumors were identified by the naked eye and ultrasonography, and considering the position in relation to the main vas, the ablation would be possible for the troublesome part in case of the percutaneous approach. Therefore, we thought the application of RFA to HCC would be more expandable.
