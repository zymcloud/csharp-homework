Sorafenib is an oral multiple kinase inhibitor that blocks Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. It has been approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib has demonstrated a 44% increase in survival for advanced HCC patients, compared with best supportive care alone. We have reviewed the pharmacology, pivotal studies, and safety data for this agent. Sorafenib is the first systemic drug demonstrating a significant survival benefit, and is the standard of care for patients with advanced HCC for whom no potential curative option is available.
