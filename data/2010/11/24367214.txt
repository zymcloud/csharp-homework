Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem. It is currently the third cause of cancer-related death, it is highly prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region and Africa, and is increasing in Western countries. The natural history of HCC is very heterogeneous and prediction of survival in individual patients is not satisfactory because of the wide spectrum of the disease. During the past decade, major advances have been achieved in prevention, through better surveillance of patients at risk, and in therapy through better surgical and ablative therapies and multimodal treatment approaches. Moreover, the increasing knowledge of molecular hepatocarcinogenesis provides the opportunity for targeted therapies. In this setting, the impact of sorafenib on advanced-stage HCC is a landmark finding in the treatment of liver cancer. The role of sorafenib administration as adjuvant therapy after curative treatment is being evaluated in clinical studies. Future research should lead to a molecular classification of the disease and a more personalized treatment approach.
