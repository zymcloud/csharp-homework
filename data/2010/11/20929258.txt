Psiguadials A (1) and B (2), two novel sesquiterpenoid-diphenylmethane meroterpenoids with unusual skeletons, along with a pair of known epimers, psidial A (3) and guajadial (4), were isolated from the leaves of Psidium guajava. Their structures with absolute configurations were elucidated by means of NMR, X-ray diffraction, and quantum chemical CD calculation. Compounds 1, 2, and 4 exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the growth of human hepatoma cells.
