Background & aims:The retinoblastoma-interacting zinc finger gene RIZ1 is inactivated in many cancers, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of RIZ1 inactivation by analyzing the relationship between DNA methylation and histone modifications during regulation of RIZ1 expression.Methods:Methylation-specific PCR, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine RIZ1 methylation and expression. Dynamic changes in histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) modifications and histone deacetylases (HDACs) associated with the promoter were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).Results:RIZ1 methylation was detected in 66.7% (32/48) HCC tissues, 6.3% (3/48) corresponding non-cancerous tissues, and 66.7% (4/6) HCC cell lines. All 32 HCC tissues with promoter methylation showed complete loss of RIZ1 protein, whereas RIZ1 protein was present in all the corresponding non-cancerous tissues. Neither 5-aza-2-deoxycitidine (5-Aza-dC) nor Trichostatin A (TSA) reversed promoter methylation, but did restore RIZ1 mRNA and resulted in the downregulation of HDAC1 but not HDAC3. However, 5-Aza-dC+TSA induced a partial reversal of promoter methylation and a markedly synergistic reactivation of RIZ1. Moreover, both HDAC1 and HDAC3 were downregulated. The ChIP assays showed 5-Aza-dC and/or TSA also contributed to the dynamic conversion of trimethylated to acetylated H3K9 at the promoter. Furthermore, a decrease in H3K9 trimethylation preceded an increase in H3K9 acetylation.Conclusions:Our results suggest that promoter methylation and H3K9 modifications work together to silence the RIZ1 gene in HCC. 5-Aza-dC can restore the expression of RIZ1, as reflected by its effects on histone modification levels. This finding indicates that cooperative effects between these epigenetic modifications exist.
