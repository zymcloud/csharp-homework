Gastric endocrine cell carcinoma is known to be highly malignant with a poor prognosis, and no standard treatment has been established. We experienced a case of gastric endocrine cell carcinoma with liver and lymph node metastases. The lesions became resectable after chemotherapy with S-1/cisplatin (CDDP). The patient was a 68-year-old male. He had gastrointestinal endoscopy for screening without complains. The endoscopy findings showed that a type 3 gastric cancer on lesser curvature of ventricular angle of the stomach, and was histologically diagnosed as an endocrine cell carcinoma by the biopsy specimen. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed metastatic lesions at S2 and S3 of the liver, and No.6 lymph node enlargement. Thus he was diagnosed as gastric endocrine cell carcinoma with liver and lymph node metastases. He was treated chemotherapy with S-1/CDDP every 5 weeks. After these courses of treatment, liver and lymph node metastatic lesions had reduced in size, but the primary lesion was still remained. Then he suffered from a drug induced eruption due to S-1. We changed the chemotherapy to biweekly CPT-11/CDDP. After 21 courses, he underwent distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection and a partial liver resection. Histological findings revealed that there were no cancer cells in removed specimens. He had treated 8 courses of CPT-11/CDDP therapy after the surgery, and survived for 5 years without recurrence.
