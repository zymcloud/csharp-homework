A 73-year-old male patient was found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm complicated with bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms. He also had hepatitis C, chronic liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B), a rupture of esophageal varices, hepatocellular carcinoma, and intractable ascites. The functions of other systemic organs were also impaired. We first performed a right internal iliac artery coil embolization prior to stent graft implantation combined with a left external-internal iliac artery bypass. These additional procedures allowed for safe treatment with stent graft implantation, without any serious complications.
