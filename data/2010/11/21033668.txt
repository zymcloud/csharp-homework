The extract of soybean exposed to biotic elicitors such as food-grade fungus is known to have antioxidant activity. Glyceollins were major bioactive compounds present in soybean elicited by fungi and shown to have antifungal and anticancer activities. The purpose of present study was to evaluate the antioxidant activities of glyceollins by measuring ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, singlet oxygen quenching, 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and lipid peroxidation inhibition. In addition, the antioxidant potential of glyceollins were measured by a fluorescent probe, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA), and dihydroethidium (DHE) in mouse hepatoma hepa1c1c7 cells in which they were insulted with H2O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Glyceollins showed a strong reducing power and inhibited lipid peroxidation, with significant scavenging activities of radicals including singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, ABTS, and DPPH. We also found that glyceollins significantly suppressed H2O2-induced ROS production in hepa1c1c7 cells. Therefore, glyceollins deserve further study as natural antioxidants and nutraceuticals.
