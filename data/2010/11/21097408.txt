Objective:To explore the value of ultrasono-portography using SonoVue in selective portal vein embolization (SPVE).Methods:Twenty-eight patients with malignant liver tumors underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided SPVE. The procedure was performed under color Doppler ultrasound guidance in 11 cases (conventional group) and under guidance with ultrasono-portography using SonoVue in 17 cases (contrast group). Contrast-enhanced CT was performed 2-4 weeks after SPVE to evaluate the effect of embolization.Results:The procedure of SPVE was aborted in 3 cases in which ultrasono-portography showed contraindications. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT showed ectopic embolization in 2 cases in the conventional group, and none of the cases in the contrast group showed ectopic embolization.Conclusion:Ultrasono-portography using SonoVue can provide important assistance for SPVE.
