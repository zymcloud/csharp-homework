Liver transplantation is an accepted management for end stage liver disease, early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute liver failure. The number of patients with end stage liver disease is growing rapidly. Living Donor Liver Transplantation (LDLT) has become an important alternative to cadaveric organ transplant for patients with end stage liver disease. On average, about one in three potential donors eventually donate part of their liver The overall reported donor mortality was 0.2% and median morbidity of l6%. Understanding donor outcomes is important as it enables the transplant team to fully inform the potential donor In addition, this information will help the transplant team improve their post operative management and plan for long-term follow-up after liver donation.
