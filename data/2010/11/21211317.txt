Objective:To investigate the influences of VEGF expression through the intervention of thalidomide in malignant transformation of hepatocytes.Methods:Hepatoma model was induced with 2-fluorenyl-acetamide (2-FAA, 0.05%) in male SD rats. And thalidomide was administered intragastrically to block the progress of hepatoma. Some rats were sacrificed at a fortnightly interval. Morphological changes were observed by pathological examinations (HE staining). The VEGF expressions in rat liver tissues were detected by ELISA and immunohistochemistry respectively.Results:Hepatocytes in rats fed with 2-FAA showed vacuole-like denaturations at an early stage, dysplastic nodules appeared at a middle stage and finally progressed to tubercles of cancerous nest. All were the manifestations of highly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An increasing tendency of hepatic VEGF protein was found for normal liver to precancerous to cancerous tissues during the development of hepatoma. The VEGF levels in hepatoma were significantly higher than those in normal ones. Thalidomide repressed the morphologic change of hepatic cells. And the VEGF level of thalidomide group was lower than those in 2-FAA group.Conclusion:Thalidomide can inhibit the hepatic VEGF expression and arrest the development of rat hepatoma.
