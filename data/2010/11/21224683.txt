A patient was a 61-year-old male. In December 2005, abdominal computer tomography (CT) revealed at a 4 cm-in-diameter early enhanced lesion in S6 and a 1.5 cm-in-diameter early enhanced lesion in S5/8, which were diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinomas. He underwent S6 partial hepatectomy and S5/8 partial hepatectomy. However, multiple lung metastatic lesions and a peritoneal metastatic lesion were detected by computer tomography (CT) in July 2007, led to a diagnosis as recurrence of HCC. Although he received S-1/IFN-Î± combination systemic chemotherapy, no effect was shown and peritoneal metastatic lesion grew to 10 cm-in-diameter. We thought that this lesion might lead to ileus, therefore, he received peritoneal tumor resection in December 2007. Multiple lung metastases grew and he was dead 13 months after the surgery: no abdominal symptom and sign due to ileus was noted. In this case, it was considered that a resection of peritoneal metastasis might be attempted to prevent ileus, even if there were other metastatic lesions, such as multiple lung metastases.
