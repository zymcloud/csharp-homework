Objective:To investigate the resection technique for small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC) in special sites and discuss their outcome.Methods:Clinicopathological data of 30 patients with SHCC in special sites undergone liver resection were reviewed. There were 29 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and 1 case of cholangiocarcinoma, confirmed by pathology. The tumor was close to the first porta hepatis in 8 cases, colse to the second porta hepatis in 15 cases, and close to the third porta hepatis in 7 cases. Twenty-five patients had one lesion, 4 patients had two and the other had three. The tumor diameter was (2.7 ± 1.2) cm.Results:No perioperative death occurred. The operation time was (279 ± 101) min, the mean intraoperative blood loss was 566 ml, and the postoperative hospitalization was (10.5 ± 2.7) days. The 1- and 3-year survival rates were 100% and 83.3%, respectively, and the 1- and 3-year disease free survival rates were 85.0% and 41.3%, respectively.Conclusion:Although the surgery for SHCC in special sites is quite difficult and risky, surgical treatment is still safe with good perioperative management and is an effective treatment of SHCC in special sites.
