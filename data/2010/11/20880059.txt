Aim:We compared the ability of five staging system to predict survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with chemoembolization.Methods:The study subjects were 214 patients with HCC treated with repeated chemoembolization alone using cisplatin and lipiodol. Predictors of survival were assessed by multivariate analysis. Before chemoembolization was carried out, the modified Japan Integrated Staging (m-JIS), Japan Integrated Staging (JIS score), Barcelona (BCLC) stage, Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan/Tumor-Node-Metastasis (LCSGJ/TNM) and Italian score (CLIP score) were checked. To validate the prognostic value of these staging systems, the survival curve was obtained and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Discriminatory ability and predictive power were compared using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) score and the likelihood ratio (LR) Ï‡(2) .Results:Overall survival was 1 year in 82.9%, 3 years in 39.9% and 5 years in 15.1%. Multivariate analysis identified more than 90% lipiodol accumulation (grade I) after the first chemoembolization (P = 0.001), absence of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) (P Conclusion:The discriminate ability of the m-JIS score is substantially better than those of other staging systems and has better prognostic predictive power in patients with grade I accumulation of lipiodol after first chemoembolization.
