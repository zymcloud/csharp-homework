We report a long-term survival case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with recurrence in the liver and multiple lymph nodes treated with lymph node dissection and percutaneous isolated hepatic perfusion (PIHP). The patient was a 70-year-old man with HCC. In 1999, transcatheter arterial chemoembolozation (TACE) was performed for HCCs. In 2000, partial hepatectomy was achieved for a recurrence in the liver. In 2002, CT scan disclosed multiple lymph node metastases around the hepatic artery and the recurrence in the liver. We performed a lymph node dissection and radio-frequency ablation for the hepatic tumor. After the operation, PIHP was performed for residual lymph node metastases. Then, a recurrence in the liver occurred 3 times, but was treated successfully with local therapy. The patient survives for 10 years after the initial therapy, and 8 years after a lymph node dissection.
