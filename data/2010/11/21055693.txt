Hepatic neoplasia is a rare but serious complication of metabolic diseases in children. The risk of developing neoplasia, the age at onset, and the measures to prevent it differ in various diseases. This article reviews the most common metabolic disorders in humans that are associated with neoplasms, with a special emphasis on the molecular etiopathogenesis of this process. The cellular pathways driving carcinogenesis are poorly understood, but best known in tyrosinemia.
