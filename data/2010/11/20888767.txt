A series of α-D-hex-2-enopyranosyl sulfonamides was evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) and human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cell lines. The most potent compound (2,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-3-deoxy-α-D-erythro-hex-2-enopyranosyl ethanesulfonamide) showed antiproliferative properties in the micromolar range. The SARs of these sulfonamidoglycoside which includes the influence of carbohydrate rings and sulfonamide class are described.
