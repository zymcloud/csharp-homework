In this study, we report four cases of re-resection of the liver as reduction surgery for a failure of transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization (TAE) for multiple intrahepatic recurrences after hepatic resection. In all of the 4 cases, a liver function was well preserved and portal vein thrombosis was not revealed in preoperative CT scan. Although bile leakage was observed in one case, no major complications were observed in other 3 cases and their hospital stay after surgery was within 13 days. To date, one year survival rate after re-resection is 100%, and a short-term prognosis is good. On the basis of the result, re-resection of the liver as reduction surgery could be considered as one of options of the locoregional treatment for a failure of TAE for multiple intrahepatic recurrences.
