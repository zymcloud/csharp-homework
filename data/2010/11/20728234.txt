Background & aims:Mechanisms linking obesity and unfavourable outcomes in patients with viral hepatitis C (HCV) cirrhosis are not well understood. Obesity is associated with insulin resistance, increased leptin, and decreased adiponectin serum levels.Methods:We assessed the predictive value of those factors for the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related death or transplantation in a cohort of 248 patients (mean age 58 (12 years, BMI 25.4 ± 4.4 kg/m(2)) with compensated HCV cirrhosis and persistent infection prospectively followed and screened for HCC.Results:The mean baseline serum levels of adiponectin and leptin were 16.8 ± 15 mg/L and 16.8 ± 19 ng/ml, respectively. The mean homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA) index was 3.8 ± 3; median 2.9. After a median follow-up of 72 months, 61 patients developed HCC, 58 died of liver causes, and 17 were transplanted. The incidences (Kaplan Meier) of HCC were 7%, 18%, and 27% at 5 years (p=0.017) and of liver-related death or transplantation 15%, 15% and 29% (p=0.002) according to the lowest, middle and highest tertile of HOMA, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the HOMA index was associated with HCC occurrence (HR=1.10, [1.01-1.21] p=0.026) and was a strong predictor of liver-related death or transplantation (HR=1.13, [1.07-1.21] pConclusions:In patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis, insulin resistance but not serum levels of adiponectin and leptin predicted the occurrence of HCC and of liver-related death or transplantation.
