A case of hepatocellular carcinoma, successfully treated with multimodal loco-regional treatments, is reported. An 80-year-old male presented with multiple pulmonary and peritoneal metastases 4 months after right heimihepatectomy for ruptured HCC. Bronchial artery infusion of mitomycin C induced pulmonary tumor regression and stabilization. Peritoneal tumor was treated by arterial infusion of SMANCS, followed by percutaneous injection of absolute ethanol, which ended in surgical removal in 28-postoperative month due to abscess formation. He had been well until right adrenal and left pulmonary metastases appeared. Resection of both metastases was carried out in 39-post hepatectomy month. Recurrent left pulmonary metastasis was treated with two sessions of bronchial artery infusion with no effect this time. Video-assisted partial resection of the left lung was performed in 54 post-hepatectomy month. But his AFP level kept rising. Eventually pulmonary metastasis recurred and tumor thrombus reached the left atrium 58 months after hepatectomy. He wanted no more treatment. He died of cerebral infarction caused by tumor thrombus. He enjoyed a good QOL for five years through multimodal loco-regional treatments.
