Several cases with skull metastases hepatocellular carcinoma have so far been reported in the English literature. However, recurrent skull metastasis hepatocellular carcinoma at 2 month post operation after craniectomy and total tumor removal has never been published. We reported a 57-year-old Thai female presented with a recurrent enlarging painless left parieto-occipital skull mass after 2 month post operation which confirmed by Cranial computerized tomography (CT). This case showed that the skull metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma can rapidly recur although closely monitored by clinical evaluation, laboratory and radiological finding had been done.
