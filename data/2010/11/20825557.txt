Background & aims:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are members of a class of small noncoding functional RNAs that modulate gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level in a sequence specific manner. miRNA dysfunction has been linked to the pathophysiology of human diseases including those resulting from viral infections. The objective of this study was to investigate changes in miRNA profiles that occur in hepatoma cells expressing hepatitis C virus (HCV) and identify anticorrelated mRNAs, which may be their regulatory targets.Methods:Microarrays were used to perform global miRNA and mRNA expression analysis. Fold changes and pairwise statistics were computed for the resulting datasets. Hierarchical cluster and pathway analyses were performed to assess the degree of differential expression and identify regulatory networks. Bioinformatics tools were used to integrate mRNA profiling results with miRNA target predictions.Results:Replication of the Con1 strain of HCV virus in hepatoma cells elicited extensive differential expression of both miRNAs and mRNAs. Forty-three differentially expressed miRNAs (P≤0.001) were identified by microarray analysis in HCV expressing cells. Six thousand eight hundred and fifteen differentially expressed mRNAs (P≤0.05) were identified. Computational analyses revealed anticorrelated miRNA:mRNA pairs for each target prediction algorithm used. Pathway analysis generated a filtered pathway with 120 entities, including seven major regulators and nine major targets potentially under the control of at least 11 miRNAs.Conclusions:The expression of a number of anticorrelated miRNAs:mRNA pairs are affected by the presence of HCV. These miRNAs and their putative targets are attractive candidates for being involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of HCV-induced chronic hepatitis.
