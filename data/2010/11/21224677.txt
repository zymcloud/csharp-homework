We analyzed the treatment outcome and effect of sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Nine patients were received the therapy of sorafenib between June 2009 and October 2009. The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was 87.5%. Grade 3 drug-related adverse events included a hand-foot skin reaction (two patients) and fatigue (one patient). Grade 2 hypertension (three patients), grade 1 diarrhea (two patients) and anorexia (four patients) occurred at this study. The response rate was 0% (CR/PR 0, SD 2, PD 6) and median overall survival length was 101 days. Now there are two patients undergoing the therapy of sorafenib. Effect of sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma was not good in this study, and drug-related adverse events had a high rate. However, the continuous treatment was possible with dose modified chemotherapy.
