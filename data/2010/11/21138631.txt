Objective:To investigate the expression of HBx and COX-2 in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma, and Its correlation with microangiogenesis and metastasis, and possible mechanism.Methods:Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of hepatitis B virus X, cyclooxygenase-2 and CD34 in hepatitis B virus related hepatic carcinoma and 22 non-HBV related hepatic carcinoma tissues. The expression of hepatitis B virus x protein and cyclooxygenase-2 in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma correlated with microangiogenesis and metastasis was tested by Spearman correlation analysis. The expression of COX-2 in HepG2-X was detected by Western blot and RT-PCR. PGE2 was detected by ELISA in clear supernatant liquid of HepG2-X. Trypan blue exclusion was performed to examine the inhibitory effects of COX-2 selective inhibitor (celecoxib).Results:In Hepatitis B carcinoma tissue, HBx and COX-2 were expressed at high level. The positive rate of COX-2 expression was 88.87% (55/62) in HBx positive expression group, which was significantly higher than that of the positive expression 31.82% (7/22, x2=27.188, PConclusion:The expressions of HBx and COX-2 were higher in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. COX-2 was significantly correlated with HBx in HCC and it could be a key factor involved in HBx contributed hepatocellular carcinoma's microangiogenesis and metastasis. The possible mechanism of the dual effects might be through HBx, COX-2 and PGE2 pathways in infiltration involved metastasis and microangiogenesis involved metastasis.
