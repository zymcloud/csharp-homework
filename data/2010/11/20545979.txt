Esophageal cancer patients with distant organ metastasis have usually been treated only to palliate symptoms without multimodality therapy. The current study evaluates the role of multimodality therapy in esophageal squamous cell cancer patients with distant organ metastasis. Between February 1988 and January 2007, 80 esophageal squamous cell cancer patients with distant organ metastases were treated at our institution. Multimodality therapy was performed in 58 patients: 43 patients received chemoradiotherapy, 13 underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, and two received chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Thirteen patients received single-modality therapy; chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery alone. The remaining nine patients received best supportive care alone. The metastatic organ was the liver (n= 40), the lungs (n= 33), bone (n= 10), and other (n= 6). Nine patients had metastasis in two organs. There was no difference in the median survival among the sites of organ metastasis, lung, liver, or bone (P= 0.8786). The survival of patients treated with multimodality therapy was significantly better than that of the patients who received single-modality therapy or best supportive care alone (P < 0.0001). In patients treated with multimodallity therapy, there was no difference in survival for patients treated with surgery compared with patients treated without surgery (P= 0.1291). This retrospective study involves an inevitable issue of patient selection bias. However, these results suggested that multimodality therapy could improve survival of the esophageal squamous cell cancer patients with distant organ metastasis.
