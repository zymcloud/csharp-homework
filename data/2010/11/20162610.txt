Cancer incidence rates and patterns are reported for a rural population, living in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa for the period 1998-2002. The population-based cancer registry has operated for 20 years, using both active and passive methods for case finding, through collaborations with 19 health facilities: 11 district hospitals, 7 referral hospitals and 1 regional laboratory. The age standardized incidence rates for all cancers were 73.1 per 100,000 in males and 64.1 per 100,000 in females. The leading top 5 cancers for males were oesophagus (32.7 per 100,000), lung (5.8 per 100,000), prostate (4.4 per 100,000), liver (4.4 per 100,000) and larynx (2.5 per 100,000) whereas for females they were cervix (21.7 per 100,000), oesophagus (20.2 per 100,000), breast (7.5 per 100,000), ovary (0.9 per 100,000) and liver (0.9 per 100,000). The incidence of Kaposi sarcoma was low, and higher for males (1.6 per 100,000) than females (0.3 per 100,000). Lung cancer in both males and females was relatively low compared to the high incidence of oesophagus cancer.
