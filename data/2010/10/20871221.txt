Objective:To investigate the different nature between hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach (HAS) and common stomach cancer without the hepatoid differentiation areas (non-HAS).Methods:From January 1996 to December 2007, 45 patients were diagnosed as HAS on the basis of the characteristic histologic features resembling hepatocellular carcinoma in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. The clinicopathologic features and the relevant prognosis of these patients were evaluated. In addition, 225 stage-matched common stomach cancer patients were selected as controls.Results:Histologically, the polygonal tumor cells were arranged in trabecular fashion or solid nests separated by narrow fibrous stroma composed of sinusoid-like capillaries. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for Î±-fetoprotein. Under transmission electron microscope, numerous circular granules of dense electron were found in the cytoplasm. HAS showed a higher rate of vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis than non-HAS. The 5-years survival rates of HAS and non-HAS were 9% and 44%, respectively. The prognosis of HAS was poorer than that of non-HAS (PConclusion:HAS had different clinicopathologic features and prognosis from non-HAS.
