Purpose:To analyze the clinical outcomes of chemoembolization for solitary caudate lobe hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) found at initial presentation.Materials and methods:This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board; the requirement for informed patient consent was waived. From July 1998 to June 2009, 40 patients (28 men, 12 women; mean age, 57 years) found to have a single HCC lesion in the caudate lobe at initial presentation were treated with chemoembolization and evaluated for overall survival and progression-free survival. Multivariate analyses for potential clinical and radiologic factors were performed by using the Cox proportional hazard model.Results:Selective chemoembolization via the caudate artery was achieved in 34 (85%) patients. Overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 92%, 79%, 65%, 56%, and 56%, respectively. Selective chemoembolization of the caudate artery was a critically important factor in longer overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.091; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.021, 0.389; P Conclusion:Selective chemoembolization via the caudate artery is possible in most patients with caudate lobe HCC and a critical factor in longer overall survival and longer progression-free survival.
