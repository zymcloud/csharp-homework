Background:The aim of this study was to analyze the combination with long-term, low-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleos(t)ide analogs as prophylaxis for hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and to assess the risk factors of HBV recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods:One hundred sixty patients undergoing OLT with HBV-related liver disease make up the cohort studied. Long-term, low dosage of HBIG in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs were used as prophylaxis for HBV recurrence after OLT. Patient preoperative data were collected by a retrospective method, and the rate and risk factors of HBV recurrence post-OLT after a long-term follow-up were analyzed.Results:Nineteen patients developed hepatitis B recurrence for a rate of recurrence of 11.88% (19/160). There was no significant correlation between HBV recurrence after OLT and the level of HBV DNA, HBeAg state pre-OLT, or the use of nucleoside analog drug therapy pre-OLT (P>0.05). Of 19 patients with HBV recurrence, 17 patients used Lamivudine, and HBV YMDD mutants were detected in nine cases. The HBV-YMDD mutation was the major reason for recurrence of HBV in our study (PConclusions:Long-term use of combination prophylaxis with nucleoside analogs and low-dose HBIG can effectively prevent hepatitis B recurrence after OLT, and that a positive preoperative serum HBV DNA status did not affect the recurrence rate of HBV post-OLT. Preoperative nucleoside analogs therapy is unlikely to be obligatory if the patients received effective combination prophylaxis postoperatively. HBV YMDD mutation is the primary reason for HBV recurrence in patients treated with Lamivudine after OLT.
