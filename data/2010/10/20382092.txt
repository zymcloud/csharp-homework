Background:Surveillance in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) family members recommends baseline colonoscopy starting at age 20 and then surveillance colonoscopy every 1-2 years.Aims:To verify adherence to the guidelines for HNPCC family members enrolled in endoscopic surveillance.Methods:Data regarding 11 HNPCC families was retrieved from our database. Excluding 11 probands, 106 family members were evaluated and 40 underwent surveillance.Results:At baseline colonoscopy, 7 colorectal cancers (CRC), 14 polyps (PO) [1 inflammatory, 2 hyperplastic, 10 adenomas with low grade dysplasia (LGD-AD) and 1 adenoma with high-grade dysplasia (HGD-AD)] were diagnosed in sixteen individuals. Twenty-eight HNPCC family members underwent endoscopic surveillance, with a total of 94 surveillance colonoscopies. Of these, 45 were positive (4 CRC, 3 inflammatory PO, 34 hyperplastic PO, 21 LGD-AD and 5 HGD-AD). Mean time between two consecutive surveillance colonoscopies was 24.6 months (range 4-168). Median time to first positive surveillance colonoscopy was 84 months for HNPCC family members with negative baseline colonoscopy, and 60 months for those with positive baseline colonoscopy (p=0.21).Conclusions:Our data suggests that surveillance colonoscopy every 2 years is adequate to diagnose advanced lesions in HNPCC family members, and improves their compliance with surveillance.
