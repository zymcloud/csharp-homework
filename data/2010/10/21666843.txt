Previous studies have revealed a close link between luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) signaling and oncogenesis in gonadal and nongonadal tissues. To investigate whether genetic ablation of LH receptor (Lhr) affects the animal's oncogenic susceptibility, adult female wild-type (wt), heterozygous, and homozygous Lhr knockout (LhrKO) mice were intraperitoneally injected with an alkylating agent, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg of body weight). The mice were sacrificed when they were short of breath or 10 months after the injection. The results showed that MNU induced non-Hodgkin's thymic and lymphonodus lymphomas in 70.6% and 100% of heterozygous and homozygous animals, respectively, compared with 35.7% in wt siblings. The tumor development was rapid; they were more aggressive and metastasized to the spleen, liver, and kidney in Lhr-deficient mice compared to wt siblings. All tumors were immunostained-positive for a T-cell specific marker, CD3, but not for a B-cell marker, CD22, suggesting that all the lymphomas arose from T-cells, which are known to be LH/hCG receptor-positive. There was no rearrangement of the Lhr gene locus or differences in thymic cell proliferation among the genotypes. However, apoptosis was lower in the Lhr-deficient thymuses. The thymic Bcl-2 levels were elevated and caspase-3 activation was reduced in Lhr heterozygous and homozygous animals. In conclusion, MNU induced a higher incidence and an earlier onset of aggressive lymphomas in LhrKO animals, which may be associated with a reduction in apoptosis of thymocytes.
