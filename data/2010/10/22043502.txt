Objective:To establish the frequency, significance and clinical utility of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) expression in the hepatobiliary system by performing a wide immunohistochemical screening of AMACR expression.Study design:A total of 204 neoplastic, preneoplastic and normal samples from the hepatobiliary and pancreatic system were immunohistochemically studied on tissue microarrays for AMACR expression and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters.Results:Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) showed intense AMACR expression, which was significantly stronger than in nonmalignant tissues and correlated with good differentiation but not with evolution. Weak AMACR expression was observed in cholangiocarcinomas and preneoplastic pancreatic lesions. HCC showed stronger expression than cholangiocarcinomas and ductal pancreatic adenocarcinomas.Discussion:AMACR is strongly expressed in some neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions of the hepatobiIiary system, mainly HCC, and may play a role in malignant transformation and be useful in the differential diagnosis.
