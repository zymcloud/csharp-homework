We used for the first time a right ventricular exclusion procedure for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the right ventricle. Our case report shows that this surgical option can be effective as rescue therapy for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction secondary to myocardial metastasis in critically ill patients. Most notably, this technique can prevent inadvertent dislodgement of tumor cells.
