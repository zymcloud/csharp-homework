A sialidase gene of Streptococcus intermedius was cloned. It was most similar to nanA, a major sialidase gene in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and was expressed in Escherichia coli. Since the gene-knockout S. intermedius strain lost detectable sialidase activity, the gene might code, either solely or mainly, the glycosidase in the bacterial genome. Polymerase chain reaction using the primers for the nanA homologue in S. intermedius (described as nanA below) showed that this sialidase gene was commonly distributed within the isolates of S. intermedius, but not found in the strains of other species among the anginosus group. In biofilm formation assay under cultivation with mucin, the nanA-deleted S. intermedius maintained the amount of biofilm for 72 hr, while that of the parent strain decreased during incubation from 24 to 72 hr. Since sialidase activity in the parent strain increased during that time period, sialidase might contribute to the degradation of biofilm under sialic acid-rich conditions. When S. intermedius was added into the HepG2 hepatoma culture, the calculated disassociation constant (K(d)) of EDTA-releasable bacterial adhesion to the cells was higher in the nanA-deleted strain than in the parent. Furthermore, the rate constant, assuming endocytosis of the bacterium mediated by ASGP-R in HepG2 cells, seemed to be increased by sialidase pretreatment of the bacterial cells before addition to the cell culture. According to the results, modification of sugar chains by sialidase on the bacterial surface and in the surrounding environment might influence both bacterial interaction and host-bacterial interaction in S. intermedius.
