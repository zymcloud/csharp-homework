Background and aims:Recently, some miRNAs have been reported to be connected closely with the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the functions of these miRNAs in HCC remain largely undefined.Methods:The expression profiles of miR-193b were compared between HCC tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues using qRT-PCR method. This method was also be used to screen the potential target genes of miR-193b. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm target association. Finally, the functional effect of miR-193b in hepatoma cells was examined further.Results:miR-193b was significantly down-regulated in most of the HCC tissues compared to the matching non-tumoural liver tissues. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-193b dramatically suppressed the ability of hepatoma cells to form colonies in vitro and to develop tumours in nude mice. CCND1 and ETS1 were revealed to be regulated by miR-193b directly. By regulating the expressions of these oncogenes, miR-193b induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited the invasion and migration of hepatoma cells.Conclusions:miR-193b may function as a tumour suppressor in the development of HCC by acting on multiple tumourigenic pathways.
