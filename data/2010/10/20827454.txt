Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma are relatively rare tumors of the gastrointestinal tract in western Europe but their incidence has been increased in recent years. Newly diagnosed intrahepatic lesions or intrahepatic cholestasis require extensive laboratory tests and imaging studies in order to confirm the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The treatment options range from liver resection or liver transplantation to conservative measures (in cases of non-resectable lesions). This review article aims to provide an overview on the diagnostic options and the subsequent treatment.
