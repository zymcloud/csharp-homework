Amphicrine tumors are defined by evidence of both glandular and neuroendocrine differentiation in the same cell. These are extremely rare tumors, with only scattered case reports in the pancreas and stomach. We here report a case of amphicrine carcinoma occurring in apparent isolation in the liver. The tumor was characterized by signet ring cell morphology, mucicarmine, and periodic acid Schiff with diastase (PASD) positivity, and expression of chromogranin, synaptophysin, villin, and CDX2. No other tumor was identified by radiological or endoscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract. The patient is disease-free 22 months after the resection. We speculate that this represents the first reported occurrence of primary amphicrine carcinoma of the liver.
