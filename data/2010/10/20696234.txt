The pro-apoptotic activity of J-7, a synthetic methyl jasmonate derivative, on the Hep3B human hepatocarcinoma cell line was investigated. Treatment of Hep3B cells with J-7 resulted in growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis as measured by trypan blue-excluding cells, MTT assay, nuclear staining, DNA fragmentation, and flow cytometry analysis. The increased apoptotic events in Hep3B cells caused by J-7 were associated with the alteration in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression. J-7 treatment induced the expression of death receptor-related proteins such as death receptor 5, which triggered the activation of caspase-8 and the down-regulation of the whole Bid expression. In addition, the apoptosis induction by J-7 was correlated with the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, down-regulation IAP family proteins such as XIAP and cIAP-1, and concomitant degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. However, the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects induced by J-7 were significantly inhibited by z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, which demonstrates the important role that caspase-3 plays in the process. Furthermore, blocking the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways showed increased apoptosis and the activation of caspases in J-7-induced apoptosis. The results indicated that J-7 induces the apoptosis of Hep3B cells through a signaling cascade of death-receptor-mediated extrinsic as well as mitochondria-mediated intrinsic caspase pathways, which are associated with the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases signal pathway.
