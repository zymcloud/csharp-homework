A 55-year-old man underwent a pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy in August 2006 because of acinar cell carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Since abdominal CT revealed multiple liver metastases, we started systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1,400 mg/body, day 1, 8, 15/q4w) in October 2006. At the beginning of this treatment, it seemed to be a stable disease, but CT revealed tumor progression in January 2007. Despite the change to oral chemotherapy with S-1 (100 mg/body, day 1-14/q3w), tumors were markedly enlarged in March 2007. Therefore, we selected combination chemotherapy with oral S-1 and hepatic arterial infusion of CDDP (50 mg/body) as third-line. After 6 months of treatment, abdominal CT revealed marked shrinkage of tumors, accompanied by a decrease in AFP level. Though the patient died of hepatic failure in July 2009 (33 months after recurrence), he spent most of his time at home and worked as usual. We suggest that combination chemotherapy with oral S-1 and intra-arterial CDDP can be effective treatments for pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma.
