There are usually multiple caudate arteries arising from the right, left, and middle hepatic arteries, and they are frequently connected to each other. Therefore, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the caudate lobe is frequently fed by multiple branches arising from different origins. HCC located in the Spiegel lobe is usually fed by the caudate arteries derived from the right and/or left hepatic artery. HCC in the paracaval portion is mainly fed by the caudate artery derived from the right hepatic artery; with low frequency, it is fed by the caudate artery derived from the left hepatic artery. HCC in the caudate process is usually fed by the caudate artery derived from the right hepatic artery. Because of the complexity and overlap of vascular territories, the tumor-feeding branch of a recurrent HCC lesion in the caudate lobe frequently changes on follow-up arteriograms. In addition, several extrahepatic collateral vessels supply the recurrent tumor. To perform effective transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for HCC in the caudate lobe, radiologists should have sufficient knowledge of vascular anatomy supplying HCC in the caudate lobe.
