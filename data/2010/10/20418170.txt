Pain is a common feature of most human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The reported frequency is quite variable, however, and the prognostic significance is not clear. In this report, we examine the incidence of pain in a large HCC database derived from unresectable patients whom we have treated and examine the prognostic and clinical correlates. We report that HCC patients with pain at presentation have a worse prognosis and adverse tumor characteristics.Perspective:This article presents one of the first looks at correlates of pain and survival in HCC. Results of this study could inform future research and clinical investigations regarding the importance of pain at presentation in patients with HCC, which impacts qualify of life and survival.
