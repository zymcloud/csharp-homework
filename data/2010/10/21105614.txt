Selective arterial radioembolization with Yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres has shown promise for regional management of hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Our objective was to report our early experience with this treatment modality from a nontransplant center. Treatment of patients with HCC was discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board. Patients with unresectable disease resulting from high lesion number, ill location of the tumor, poor hepatic reserve, or medical comorbidities were offered Y-90 treatment. Liver treatment was either lobar or tumor-targeted. Response to therapy was assessed by CT scan obtained within 3 months using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. During 2007 to 2009, 40 Y-90 radioembolizations were performed in 20 patients with age that ranged from 16 to 87 years; four patients were 80 years old or older. After the first therapy, CT assessment of the treated area showed stable disease (n=15), partial response (n=3), and progression (n=2). Of the two patients who progressed, one was retreated with a subsequent complete response. The other patient died of progressive disease. The most common side effects were mild fatigue, anorexia, and nausea. In summary, our nontransplant center experience shows that Y-90 radioembolization is a well-tolerated treatment in select patients with unresectable HCC with an associated high rate of local tumor control.
