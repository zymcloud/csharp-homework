In Alagille syndrome, routine follow-up imaging of the liver plays an important role in detecting early parenchymal changes and to evaluate portal hypertension. Modern contrast-enhanced imaging methods not only allow early detection of focal liver lesions, but also enable further characterization of their nature and guide biopsy procedures. We present the US and MR imaging findings of hepatocellular carcinoma and a regenerating nodule in a 3-year-old child with Alagille syndrome.
