The treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed dramatically after the beginning of molecular-targeted therapies. However,the treatment for liver metastasis is still difficult in patients with metastatic RCC. We treated liver metastases (8 target lesions) of RCC with stylene-maleic acid neocarzinostatin (SMANCS)/Lipiodol therapy. At the treatment procedure,a catheter was inserted at the femoral artery (Seldinger's method),a microcatheter was selectively inserted into the branch of hepatic artery which fed the liver metastasis,and then SMANCS/Lipodol was infused. We treated 1,2 and 1 patient 4,2, and 1 time,respectively. One lesion treated with SMANCS/Lipodol was further treated by radiofrequency ablation 13 days later. Of 6 metastatic lesions which could be followed up for more than 6 months after the treatment,one had partial response for 4 months and 4 had stable disease for more than 6 months. Four of the 6 lesions shrunk after SMANCS/Lipiodol treatment. Two of 4 patients survived more than 18 months after the first SMANCS/Lipiodol therapy. In all 9 SMANCS/Lipiodol treatments,grade 1 liver dysfunction (44.4%),ascites (11.1%) and fatigue (11.1%) occurred after the treatments. These adverse events were all improved by conservative treatments. SMANCS/Lipiodol therapy can be a treatment option as local treatment for liver metastasis of RCC.
