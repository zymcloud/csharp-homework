Background:To compare contrast-enhanced US (CE-US), multidetector-CT (MDCT), 1.5 Tesla MR with extra-cellular (Gd-enhanced) and intracellular (SPIO-enhanced) contrast agents and PET/CT, in the detection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.Materials and methods:A total of 34 patients with colo-rectal adenocarcinoma underwent preoperatively CE-US, MDCT, Gd- and SPIO-enhanced MR imaging (MRI), and PET/CT. Each set of images was reviewed independently by two blinded observers. The ROC method was used to analyze the results, which were correlated with surgical findings, intraoperative US, histopathology, and MDCT follow-up.Results:A total of 57 hepatic lesions were identified: 11 hemangiomas, 29 cysts, 1 focal fatty liver, 16 metastases (dimensional distribution: 5/16 < 5 mm; 3/16 between 5 mm and <10 mm; 8/16 ≥ 10 mm). Six of 34 patients were classified as positive for the presence of at least one metastasis. Considering all the metastases and those ≥ 10 mm, ROC areas showed no significant differences between Gd- and SPIO-enhanced MRI, which performed significantly better than the other modalities (P < 0.05). Considering the lesions <10 mm, ROC areas showed no significant differences between all modalities; however MRI presented a trend to perform better than the other techniques. Considering the patients, ROC areas showed no significant differences between all the modalities; however PET/CT seemed to perform better than the others.Conclusions:Gd- and SPIO-enhanced MRI seem to be the most accurate modality in the identification of liver metastases from colo-rectal carcinoma. PET/CT shows a trend to perform better than the other modalities in the identification of patients with liver metastases.
