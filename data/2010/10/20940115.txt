Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis. Approximately 85% of patients are not candidates for curative treatments at the time of diagnosis; hence palliative modalities (transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation, radiofrequency ablation, systemic chemotherapy) are used. Systemic chemotherapies have disappointing results. The increasing knowledge in the molecular biology of HCC will increase the possibilities of targeted therapy. The multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only drug which has approved. The VEGF-inhibitors (bevacizumab, sunitinib), EGFR-blocker agents (erlotinib), as well as the inhibition of mTOR (rapamycin) are promising. Combination of sorafenib or other anti-angiogenic agents with local ablative procedure (transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation, radiofrequency ablation), or with curative hepatectomy also can be favorable. Alteration of Wnt pathway, retinoid compounds, inhibition of the cell cycle as well as the proteosome, and epigenetic therapy can be other potential promising targets in HCC.
