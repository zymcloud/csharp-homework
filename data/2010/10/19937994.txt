Background and objectives:It is important to identify prognostic factors in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before hepatectomy. No previous studies have addressed the predictive efficacy of the preoperative doubling times of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II).Methods:A total of 210 HCC patients who underwent a hepatic resection between 1998 and 2006 were prospectively evaluated. Serum AFP and PIVKA-II levels were measured at least twice before surgery to calculate the doubling times. Nineteen clinical factors that can be examined preoperatively, including the doubling times of AFP and PIVKA-II were investigated to identify prognostic factors for disease-free and overall survival after hepatectomy.Results:There was no relationship between preoperative levels and doubling times of AFP and PIVKA-II. In a multivariate analysis, patients with a doubling time of AFP ≤30 days and PIVKA-II ≤16 days showed a significantly worse disease-free (P = 0.02, P = 0.03, respectively) and overall survival (P Conclusions:In HCC patients, the doubling times of preoperative serum AFP or PIVKA-II levels are useful tools to predict early postoperative recurrence and a poor prognosis.
