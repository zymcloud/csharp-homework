The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of Tspan-1, Jab1 and p27 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their clinicopathological significance. The expression of Tspan-1, Jab1 and p27 was detected in HCC tissues, the tissues around cancer (76 cases), and the normal tissues around the liver hemangiomas (10 cases). The overexpression of Tspan-1 and Jab1 was found in HCC tissues, positively correlated with clinical stage and negatively correlated with survival rate. The expression of p27 was found inversely linked to which of Tspan-1 and Jab1. In conclusion, the expression of Tspan-1, Jab1 and p27 is significantly associated with development of HCC. Overexpression of Tspan-1 and Jab1 suggests poor prognosis but overexpression of p27 may expect good prognosis for patients with HCC.
