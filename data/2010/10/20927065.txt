Patients with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis are at increased risk for hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They also responded less well to standard therapy compared with those without cirrhosis. Several recent studies have demonstrated that patients with cirrhosis can be safely treated and those who achieve a sustained virological response have better clinical outcomes compared with nonresponders. These results support treatment for patients with compensated cirrhosis. In addition, cirrhotic patients should be monitored after a sustained virological response is obtained, because some patients remain at risk for complications of liver disease, particularly HCC. Newer, more effective therapy is needed for patients with cirrhosis.
