This study is to investigate the cytoprotective role of NaNO2 preconditioning against ethanol induced damage in human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. The cells were preconditioned with NaNO2 (0.25 mmol x L(-1)) for 24 hours or 4 weeks, and then exposed to ethanol (200 mmol x L(-1)) for additional 12 h and untreated cells served as control. Both temporal and chronic NaNO2 preconditioning could prevent ethanol elicited cytotoxicity as evidenced by thiazolyl blue (MTT). NaNO2 preconditioning also could inhibit ethanol-induced apoptosis, which was confirmed by FITC-Annexin V/PI flow cytometer and Hoechst 33258 and PI staining. Further, simultaneous NaNO2 preconditioning treatment along with ethanol showed protection against ethanol mediated cellular damage as indicated by significantly decreased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and elevated activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Western blotting analysis revealed that in ethanol treated cells preconditioned with NaNO2, the HIF-1alpha and Bcl-2 increased obviously, while the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3 decreased. The results showed that low doses of NaNO2 preconditioning resistant to ethanol-induced human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells apoptosis, which mechanism may be related to increased expression of HIF-1alpha in the cells.
