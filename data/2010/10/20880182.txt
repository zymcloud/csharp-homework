Background and aim:Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection poses great challenges to humans, claiming one million lives annually worldwide. Solid data have related HBV to hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:In the present research, we verified the interaction between surface protein (HBs) encoded by HBV and aldolase A (ALDA) using yeast two-hybrid, mammalian two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down and laser scanning confocal.Results:Anti-ALDA antibody precipitated Gal4-HBs fusion protein in the presence of HBs. Anti-HBs antibody precipitated p65ΔN-ALDA only in the presence of ALDA. Small HBs could be pulled down by GST-ALDA. Cells transfected with pCMV-AD-ALDA showed a protection from ultraviolet radiation-induced apoptosis (21.3% ± 1.3% for ALDA, 35.4% ± 2.1% for control, P Conclusions:An interaction does exist between ALDA and HBs. The S region within HBs is sufficient for binding ALDA. In addition, ALDA conferred protection to ultraviolet radiation-induced apoptosis, and this effect was enhanced by the interaction between HBs and ALDA.
