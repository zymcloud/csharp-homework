The fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) differs from conventional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some clinical and pathological features. The authors investigated possible differences in reactivity between FLCs and HCCs using glypican-3 (GPC3), an oncofetal protein, and survivin, an antiapoptotic protein. They also compared staining of FLC and HCC with antibodies to cytokeratins 7 (CK7) and 19 (CK19) and CD34. GPC3 was significantly more often and more strongly expressed in HCCs (72%) than in FLCs (17%). Survivin nuclear translocation in tumor cells did not differ between HCCs (10%) and FLCs (9%). There was more abundant expression of CK7 in FLCs (92%) than in HCCs (33%), whereas CK19 was more often found in HCCs (20%) than in FLCs (5%). All tumors had CD34-positive sinusoids. This study shows that FLCs and HCCs differ in the expression of GPC3, CK7, and CK19 and that there is a lack of difference as regards survivin and CD34.
