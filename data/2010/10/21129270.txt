The aim of study was to explore the efficacy of cytokine induced autologous killer (CIK) cell infusion as an immune therapy for elderly patients with hematological malignancies. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were isolated from 20 elderly patients with hematological malignancies, and then augmented by priming with human recombinant interferon gamma (rhIFN-γ) followed by human recombinant interleukin 2 (rhIL-2) and monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD3. The obtained autologous CIK cells [(2-3)×10(9)] were infused back to individual patients, then followed by subcutaneous injection of IL-2 at single daily dose of 1×10(6) U for 10 consecutive days. The regimen was repeated every 4 weeks and total 136 cycles of CIK cells transfusion were completed. The changes in cellular immune function, tumor-related biological parameters, imaging characteristics, the condition of remission, quality of life (QOL) and survival were assessed. The results indicated that 14 patients received 8 cycles of CIK cells infusion, and 4 cycles were completed in 6 patients. No adverse reaction was observed in all patients. The percentages of CD3+, CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD56+ cells increased significantly (p
