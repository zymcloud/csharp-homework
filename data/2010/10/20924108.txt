Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generally a fatal disease due to a paucity of effective treatment options. The identification of oncogenic microRNAs that exert pleiotropic effects in HCC cells may offer new therapeutic targets. In this study, we have identified the human microRNA miR-191 as a potential target for HCC therapy. Inhibition of miR-191 decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and significantly reduced tumor masses in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of HCC. Additionally, miR-191 was found to be upregulated by a dioxin, a known liver carcinogen, and was found to be a regulator of a variety of cancer-related pathways. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for miR-191 targeting as a rational strategy to pursue for improving HCC treatment.
