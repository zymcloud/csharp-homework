Purpose:To evaluate effects of microwave ablation with a 2,450-MHz internally cooled-shaft antenna in animal experiments and in a clinical study.Methods:Microwave ablation was performed using a cooled-shaft antenna in eight in vivo (36 ablations) porcine livers. The coagulation diameters achieved in different microwave ablation parameter groups were compared. Sixty patients (44 men, 16 women; mean age 53 years) with 96, 1-8 cm (mean 3.20 +/- 0.17 cm) liver cancers were treated with the same microwave ablation technique. Complete ablation (CA), local tumor progression (LTP) rates and complications were determined.Results:In vivo livers, short axis diameter correlated with the coagulation duration in a sigmoidal curve fashion (60-W group R(2) = 0.76, 80-W group R(2) = 0.87), with a relative plateau achieved within 10 min for power settings of 60 or 80 W. Within 10 min in the 60 and 80-W groups, respectively, 89 and 85.76% of maximum short axis diameter were achieved. CA rates in small (3.0 cm), intermediate (3.1-5.0 cm) and large (5.1-8.0 cm) liver cancers were 96.43% (54/56), 92.31% (24/26) and 78.57% (11/14), respectively. During a mean follow-up period of 17.17 +/- 6.52 months, LTP occurred in five (5.21%) treated cancers. There was no significant difference in the CA and LTP rate between the HCC and liver metastasis patient subgroups (P > 0.05).Conclusions:The short axis diameter enlargement has a relative plateau within 10 min by fixing power output to 60 or 80 W, using the 2,450-MHz internally cooled-shaft antenna in vivo porcine livers. Effective local tumor control was achieved during one microwave ablation session.
