Objective:To investigate the influence of combined hepatectomy with splenectomy on safety of operation for hepatocellular carcinoma patients complied with cirrhosis and hypersplenism and the best peri-operative treatment of these patients.Methods:Clinical data of 177 hepatocellular carcinoma patients complied with cirrhosis and hypersplenism admitted from January 1999 to December 2009 were analyzed retrospectively. Among which, 71 patients received concomitant splenectomy with hepatectomy (splenectomy group), 106 patients only receive a hepatectomy (non-splenectomy group). The safety of operation, complications, liver function and WBC and PLT counts were compared between the two groups.Results:There was no significant difference of general conditions, counts of WBC and PLT between the two groups before operation. The counts of PLT at 1, 10, 30 day after operation were (88.4 ± 23.6) × 10⁹/L, (345.3 ± 98.2) × 10⁹/L and (210.8 ± 92.2) × 10⁹/L respectively in splenectomy group, which were significantly higher than that of non-splenectomy group (P Conclusion:Combined hepatectomy with splenectomy will be safe for hepatocellular carcinoma patients complied with cirrhosis and hypersplenism as if the operative indication and increase the ability of peri-operative treatment are strictly obeyed.
