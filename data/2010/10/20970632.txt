Introduction:Chronic end-stage liver disease is a difficult situation for the patient.Objective:The objective of this study was to analyze the disease coping styles of patients on the liver transplant waiting list.Materials and methods:The study included 50 patients on the liver transplant waiting list. The instrument used was the Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (Ferrero, 94). Coping scales were as follows: fighting spirit, hopelessness, anxious preoccupation, fatalism, and negation.Results:Only 6% of subjects adapted well, whereas 94% adapted badly: 89% poor fighting spirit, 32% hopelessness, 50% anxious preoccupation, 28% fatalism, and 30% negation. Of those who had a poor fighting spirit, 88% also used another type of maladaptive style. The associated statements were (P<.05) as follows: "I value my life more"; "I don't think about the disease"; "I think about people who are worse off." Regarding hopelessness, 100% of those who confessed hopelessness also showed maladaptive signs. The associated statements were (P<.05) as follows: "I cannot cheer myself up"; "I cannot help myself"; "I've given up." Regarding anxious preoccupation, nearly all of these patients (96%) provided dysfunctional answers. The most associated were (P<.05) as follows: "I don't have any plans"; "I feel a lot of anxiety"; "I'm very angry." Regarding fatalism, all of the patients also had maladaptive behavior. The main types were (P<.05) as follows: "Nothing will change things"; "I cannot control the situation"; "I don't need information." Regarding negation, Only 14% used this style, and in 86% negation was associated with other inadequate coping styles.Conclusions:Patients on the liver transplant waiting list were maladaptive to their disease. It is important to establish adequate psychological care for these patients, given the important repercussions in the posttransplantation phase.
