Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection is a substantial medical problem that leads to progressive liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to achieve sustained cellular immune responses in vivo to a HCV nonstructural protein using dendritic cell (DC)-based immunization approach. We targeted the HCV NS5 protein to DCs in vivo by injecting microparticles loaded with this antigen. The DC population was expanded in BALB/C mice (H-2(d) ) by hydrodynamic injection of a plasmid pUMVC3-hFLex expressing the secreted portion of the human Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 ligand (hFlt3). Mice were subsequently injected with microparticles coated with HCV NS5 protein via the tail vein. Cellular immune responses were determined with respect to secretion of INFÎ³ and IL2 by CD4(+) cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) assays in vitro; inhibition of tumour cell growth was employed for the assessment of CD8(+) generated activity in vivo. We found that Flt3L treatment expanded the DC population in the spleen to 43%, and such cells displayed a striking upregulation of CD86 as well as CD80 and CD40 co-stimulating molecules. Viral antigen-specific T(H) 1 cytokine secretion by splenocytes was generated, and CTL activity against syngeneic NS5 expressing myeloma target cells was observed. In addition, these cells inhibited tumour growth indicating that NS5-specific robust CTL activity was operative in vivo. Thus, the capability of activating DCs in vivo using the methods described is valuable as a therapeutic vaccine strategy for chronic HCV infection.
