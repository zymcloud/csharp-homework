Palladin is a scaffold protein involved in the formation of actin-associated protein complexes. Gene expression array analysis on the poorly metastatic HCT116 colon cancer cell line and a metastatic derivative cell line (E1) with EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) features showed a down-regulation of palladin gene expression in the latter. Knockdown of palladin expression in the HCT116 cells suppressed junctional localization of E-cadherin, reduced intercellular adhesion and collective cell migration, showing that palladin plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of adherens junctions. The acquisition of the EMT features by the E1 cell line was dependent on the Erk pathway. Inhibition of this pathway by U0126 treatment in E1 cells resulted in the re-expression of palladin, relocalization of E-cadherin to the adherens junctions and a reversal of EMT features. The re-establishment of intercellular adhesion was dependent on palladin expression. The down-regulation of palladin was also observed in poorly-differentiated tumor tubules and dissociated tumor cells that have undergone de-differentiation in human primary colon tumors. Our data show that palladin is an integral component of adherens junctions and plays a role in the localization of E-cadherin to the junctions. The loss of palladin may be an integral part of EMT, an early step in the metastatic spread of colon carcinoma.
