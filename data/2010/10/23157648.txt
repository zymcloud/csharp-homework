Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the ablative margin of radiofrequency (RF) ablation to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:RF ablation was performed in the livers of six pigs after the i.v. administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA 20 min before ablation. Three pigs were killed 2 h after administration (group A), and the other pigs were killed 7 days after ablation (group B). Thereafter, correlation between pathological findings and MRI was investigated. Moreover, the Gd concentrations were examined in ablated and non-ablated regions. An initial clinical evaluation was conducted for 28 HCC nodules. Percutaneous RF ablation was performed 20 min after administration, and T(1)-weighted images were taken 2, 24 and 72 h post-treatment.Results:On T(1)-weighted images of the porcine liver, the RF ablated lesions showed hyperintense regions with hypointense rims, which histopathologically corresponded to sinusoidal congestion. The Gd concentrations in ablated regions in group A were significantly higher than those in non-ablated regions, while the concentrations in both regions in group B fell to nearly undetectable levels. In 27 of the 28 HCC nodules, the treated area consisted of a hypointense region, indicative of the tumor, and a surrounding hyperintense rim 2 h after ablation. Subsequently, a thin hypointense region was observed in the outermost layer 24 and 72 h after ablation.Conclusion:Administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA in conjunction with RF ablation of HCC may be feasible for the assessment of an accurate ablative margin.
