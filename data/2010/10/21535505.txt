Hepatocarcinoma is a malignant cancer, which is threatening human lives. In order to disclose the immunizing effects of the cells and cartilage polysaccharide (CHCP) on liver cancer, murine H22 hepatocarcinoma model was set up. The survival time, life span, and survival rate of the CHCP group were better than model group or other groups which was immunized with cartilage short-chain polysaccharide (CPS) only or H22 cell lysate only. A series of experiments were proceeded and the results confirmed that the humoral immunity and cellular immunity were strengthened. HE staining, TUNEL assay, and Alcian staining were used to research the mechanism of the tumor specific antigen production which may be related to the apoptosis of H22 hepatocarcinoma cells induced by CPS or some new polysaccharide compound emerged. The animal experiment testified the relationship between H22 hepatocarcinoma cell apoptosis induced by CPS and the effect of murine H22 hepatocarcinoma immunoprophylaxis. Our data demonstrated that the coculture of cartilage polysaccharide and cancer cells may serve as a novel source of antihepatocarcinoma agent that may play an important role in future liver cancer immunoprophylaxis.
