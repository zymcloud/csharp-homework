Apart from viral conditions, host factors such as elevated bile acid concentrations are determinants of successful interferon-α (IFN-α) treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C or B. The present study demonstrates that hydrophobic bile acids inhibit Jak1- and Tyk2-phosphorylation, which lead to blockade of STAT1-mediated IFN-α-signaling in the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting peptide (NTCP)-transfected human hepatoma cell line HepG2, resulting in a decreased mRNA and protein expression of IFN-stimulated genes such as myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) or dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). In addition, hyperosmotic stress leads to an inhibition of IFN-α-induced Jak1- and Tyk2-phosphorylation, and STAT1/STAT2-phosphorylation and gene expression. This inhibitory effect of hydrophobic bile acids or hyperosmolarity is not due to caspase-mediated cleavage or lysosomal degradation of the cognate receptors or to the generation of oxidative stress, activation of p38- or Erk-mediated MAPK pathways or phosphatase activity. Preincubation with the organic osmolyte betaine blocked the inhibitory effect of bile acids or hyperosmolarity on MxA protein expression, but had no effect on transcript levels or activation of STAT1, suggesting that betaine mediates its effects on MxA expression at a translational or post-translational level. Our findings could provide a rationale for betaine use in cholestatic HBV/HCV patients undergoing interferon therapy.
