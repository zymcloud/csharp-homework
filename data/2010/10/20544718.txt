Background:The traditional treatment for stage IV colorectal cancer has changed from palliative chemotherapy toward an aggressive multimodality approach. In the current study outcome in patients who underwent surgery for synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CLM) in a single center was evaluated.Methods:From January 1991 to May 2008 all consecutive patients with synchronous CLM who underwent curative resection of both primary and metastatic disease were included. Date of resection was divided into two groups: date of hepatic resection before and after the year 2000.Results:Fifty patients (26%) with synchronous CLM were resected before 2000 and 142 patients (74%) underwent resection after 2000. The estimated 5-year disease-free survival before and after 2000 was 9% and 27%, respectively (P = 0.379). More patients who underwent resection after 2000 were treated with local therapy or underwent resection for intra-hepatic recurrence (62% vs. 28%, P = 0.033). The estimated 5-year survival before and after 2000 was 26% and 44%, respectively (P = 0.001).Conclusion:Survival rates in patients with synchronous CLM have been increased in the past decade. The introduction of new chemotherapeutic drugs and a more aggressive treatment approach in patients with liver recurrence were probably major factors in this progress.
