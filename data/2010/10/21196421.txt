Biobehavioral research is becoming more established in nursing. This research paradigm includes a focus on the interactions of biological and behavioral variables and their impact on health outcomes. Nurse researchers have incorporated genomics as a research focus. However, biobehavioral and genomic approaches have often been viewed as separate paradigms. This article provides research exemplars from the liver transplantation population to illustrate how genomics can be integrated into a biobehavioral model of nursing research. Examples of how this integrated approach may be utilized to address gaps of knowledge are provided.
