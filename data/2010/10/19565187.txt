Background:Darinaparsin is a novel organic arsenic that reaches higher intracellular concentration with decreased toxicity compared to inorganic arsenic. We conducted a multi-center phase II study with darinaparsin in patients with advanced HCC.Methods:Eligibility criteria included unresectable or metastatic measurable HCC, up to two prior systemic treatments, ECOG performance status Results:Among 15 patients in the first stage, no objective responses were observed. Two patients had stable disease. The median number of cycles on study per patient was 2 (1-6). The median progression free survival and overall survival were 55 days (95% confidence interval: 50-59) and 190 days (95% confidence interval: 93-227), respectively. No treatment related hospitalizations or deaths occurred. Treatment related grade 1-2 toxicities included nausea, vomiting (26.7% each), fatigue (20%), anorexia and diarrhea (13.3% each). Grade 3 anorexia, wheezing, agitation, abdominal pain and SGPT were observed in 1 patient each (6.7%). One patient experienced grade 4 hypoglycemia (6.7%).Conclusions:Darinaparsin could be safely administered with tolerable toxicity profiles, and no QTc prolongation in patients with advanced HCC. However, at this dose and schedule, it has shown no objective responses in HCC and this trial was terminated as planned after the first stage of efficacy analysis.
