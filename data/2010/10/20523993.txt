Objective:This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic factors and outcome of 438 Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent partial hepatectomy in a single center.Methods:Clinicopathological data of 438 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent partial hepatectomy at the author's hospital between 1991 and 2004 were reviewed retrospectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was adopted for evaluating survival. Prognostic factors were assessed by Cox proportional hazard model and logistic regression model.Results:The perioperative (30 days) mortality and morbidity were 7.5% (33/438) and 21.7% (95/438), respectively. The operative mortality decreased significantly from 10.6% (23/218) in 1991-2001 to 4.5% (10/220) in 2002-2004 (P = 0.019). Postoperative overall survival rates at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years were 72.2%, 53.5%, and 43.3%, respectively. Cox multivariate analysis indicated that Child-Pugh score, tumor size, capsular invasion, tumor stage, vascular invasion, and resection margin were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (P Conclusions:Tumor size, capsular invasion, vascular invasion, and resection margin were the main factors that may impact the overall survival and tumor recurrence. Because resection margin was the only factor that relates to the surgery, enough resection margin (>2 cm) should be obtained whenever possible.
