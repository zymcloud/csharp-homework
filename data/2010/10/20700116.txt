Objectives:Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis are difficult to treat and have a high risk of liver decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma. We sought to identify factors that could predict treatment response.Methods:Collaborating centers (n=26) provided data for patients (n=568) with HCV cirrhosis undergoing treatment with peginterferon-α plus ribavirin (RBV). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate factors predicting treatment outcomes.Results:Sustained viral response (SVR) in naive patients was 30.7%, with no significant differences between centers. Median follow-up was 35 months (range: 1-81). Factors predicting SVR were: non-genotype 1 (odds ratio (OR)=4.183; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.353-7.438) overall dose and ≥80% of the scheduled time of treatment (OR=3.177; 95% CI: 1.752-5.760); serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) Conclusions:SVR can be achieved in approximately one-third of patients with HCV-related cirrhosis. SVR independently reduces the likelihood of clinical decompensation and improves survival.
