Background:In 2005, the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD)-based allocation system was adopted to assess potential liver transplant (LT) recipients in Argentina. The aim of the present study was to revise the activity of the MELD Exception Experts Committee.Methods:Between 2005 and 2009, 1623 patients were listed for LT. Regulation provides extra-MELD points for amyloidosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and T(2) hepatocellular carcinoma (T(2) HCC). Centres could also request priority for other situations. Using a prospective database, we identified patients in whom priority points were requested. Pathology reports of explanted livers were analysed for patients with T(2) HCC.Results:From 234 out of 1623 (14.4%) requests, the overall approval rate was 60.2% including: 2 amyloidosis, 6 HPS, 111 T(2) HCC and 22 non-regulated situations. Of the 111 patients with T(2) HCC, 6 died (5.4%), 8 had tumour progression (7.2%), 94 were transplanted (84.2%) and 3 are still waiting. An explants correlation showed that presumed diagnosis of T(2) HCC was incorrect in 20/94 (22%) and was correct in only 41/94 (43%) cases being T(1) HCC in 9 and T(3) HCC in 23.Conclusions:MELD exceptions are frequently requested in Argentina. Unfortunately, most receiving priority points for T(2) HCC benefited by medical error or imaging limitations. An intense review process is urgently needed to maintain equity and justice in the allocation system.
