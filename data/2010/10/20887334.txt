Aim:This study explored recent improvements in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosed during surveillance.Methods:The subjects were 1074 patients with HCC, subdivided into three groups. Group A comprised 211 patients for whom HCC was detected during periodic follow-up examinations at Kurume University School of Medicine, Group B comprised 544 patients diagnosed with HCC during periodic follow-up examinations at other institutions, and, Group C comprised 319 patients with HCC detected incidentally or because of symptoms.Results:In 1995-2000 and 2001-2006, 91% and 91% of group A, 68% and 70% of group B, and 27% and 26% of group C patients with HCC, respectively, met the Milan criteria. For groups A and B, the proportions of patients with Child-Pugh class A and use of promising treatment increased in the later periods compared to those diagnosed during the earlier periods (group A, Child-Pugh class A, 72% vs 58% [P = 0.040], receiving treatment, 90% vs 70% [P Conclusion:The use of promising treatment and prognosis have improved in the last 6 years for patients with HCC diagnosed through surveillance relative to those identified in 1995-2000.
