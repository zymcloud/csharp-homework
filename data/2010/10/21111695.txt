In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of a tumor vaccine prepared from H22 hepatocarcinoma cells induced by cartilage polysaccharide. We found out there were specific antigens which combined with antigen-specific antibodies from immune murine serum. Results of western blot analysis showed that about 36 kDa make specific antibodies appeared specific antibodies in antiserum of immune mice, whereas the best immune effects became visible at the induction time of 48 h. Analyses of 2-dimensional electrophoresis identified the specific antigen was annexin A2, which was a glycosylated protein that contained a glycosylation site, closely related to oncogenesis, cancer development, invasion and metastasis. Proteomics indicated that both quantity and conformation of annexin A2 were changed after induced by cartilage polysaccharide. Lastly, we found there was a major increase of annexin A2 mRNA on H22 cells induced by cartilage polysaccharide. In summary, our data suggested that annexin A2, a specific antigen played a key role in antitumor immune response and activating the immune system. It would be a potential type of tumor vaccine which provided new ideas for tumor immunoprophylaxis.
