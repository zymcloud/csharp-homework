Background and aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and aggressive malignancies worldwide. Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted glycoprotein frequently associated with various tumors. This study aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of plasma OPN level as a biomarker for HCC among high-risk patients compared to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and to evaluate its relationship with clinicopathological features of HCC patients.Methods:Plasma levels of OPN and AFP were measured in 60 Egyptian patients with hepatitis C virus-related liver cirrhosis (30 with HCC, 30 without HCC) and 20 healthy controls.Results:Plasma OPN levels in cirrhotic patients with HCC were significantly higher than in those without HCC and controls (p Conclusions:Plasma OPN can be regarded as a promising diagnostic biomarker for HCC in the surveillance of Egyptian patients with HCV infection. It could also serve as an adverse prognostic factor for HCV-related HCC patients.
