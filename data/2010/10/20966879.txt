Following our studies on the gastroprotective effect and cytotoxicity of terpene derivatives, new amides were prepared from the diterpene 8(17)-labden-15,19-dioic acid (junicedric acid) and its 8(9)-en isomer with C-protected amino acids (amino acid esters). The new compounds were evaluated for their gastroprotective effect in the ethanol/HCl-induced gastric lesions model in mice, as well as for cytotoxicity using the following human cell lines: normal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), gastric adenocarcinoma cells (AGS) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2). A dose-response experiment showed that at 25 mg/kg the C-15 leucyl and C-15,19-dileucylester amides of junicedric acid reduced gastric lesions by about 65.6 and 49.6%, respectively, with an effect comparable to lansoprazole at 20 mg/kg (79.3% lesion reduction). The comparison of the gastroprotective effect of 18 new amino acid ester amides was carried out at a single oral dose of 25 mg/kg. Several compounds presented a strong gastroprotective effect, reducing gastric lesions in the 70.9-87.8% range. The diprolyl derivative of junicedric acid, the most active product of this study (87.8% lesion reduction at 25 mg/kg) presented a cytotoxicity value comparable with that of the reference compound lansoprazole. The structure-activity relationships are discussed.
