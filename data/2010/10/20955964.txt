In adults, elevated transaminases and hepatomegaly, often mild, with moderate to massive idiopathic splenomegaly might hint to a lysosomal storage disease (LSD). In most of these cases, hepatosplenomegaly does not eventually lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or cholestasis. Nevertheless, the hepatic clinical findings might be the incentive for the patient to present at the physician's office. Many of the currently known >50 lysosomal storage diseases might manifest in liver: out of these, the most important ones in adults are: Gaucher disease, cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD) and the Niemann-Pick diseases. An increase of plasma chitotriosidase should alert the physician for the presence of an LSD. For Gaucher's disease, enzyme supplementation and substrate deprivation constitute effective therapeutic options. Fabry's disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, does usually not affect the liver, but causes painful episodes of hands' or feet pain (acroparesthesias), left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, early stroke and decreased life expectancy. The emerging advent of effective therapeutic options and the cumulative prevalence of lysosomal storage diseases urge the hepatologist to add these diagnostic pathways to the clinical repertoire.
