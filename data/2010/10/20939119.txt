We reported two cases of liver metastasis with portal vein tumor thrombus that developed after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both the patients were women aged 43 and 55 years, who had liver metastasis and portal vein tumor thrombus formation after liver transplantations for HCC. For the treatment of portal vein tumor thrombus, (125)I seeds were implanted into the hepatic tissue under the guidance of preoperative computed tomography (CT) images with a total radiation dose of 130 Gy. Enhanced spiral CT scan was performed for evaluation of the liver at 12 and 16 wk after treatment. Thereafter, upper abdominal CT examination was performed every 2-3 mo. No severe complications associated with the (125)I seeds were seen in these two patients. The upper abdominal CT images (obtained after 3 and 4 mo of treatment) showed that the thrombosis reactions were complete reaction and restoration of the patency of the partially obstructed portal vein with partial obstruction. In the case with complete obstruction of the portal vein, the thrombosis was resolved completely, but blood flow could not be restored. After this treatment, one of the patients is still alive, while the other died within 6 mo after the treatment due to lung metastasis complicated with lung infection, leading to respiratory failure.
