Aim:Orthotopic models utilizing orthotopic implantation have been used for developing cancer models of multiple tumor entities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of orthotopic injection in establishing a model of esophageal cancer using a human green fluorescent protein (GFP) cell line of human esophageal carcinoma.Materials and methods:Nude mice were orthotopically injected in the abdominal esophagus with stably transfected GFP-PT1590 cells. Tumor progression was examined by fluorescence imaging.Results:Fifty percent of animals developed extensive peritoneal spread without a distinct primary tumor at the injection site. Continuous and metastatic spread to the liver, lungs, and lymph nodes was also observed. Fluorescence imaging enabled fast and specific visualization of tumor progression without the need for anesthesia. Intraperitoneal and metastatic tumor spread of GFP-PT1590 esophageal carcinoma demonstrated a highly aggressive but heterogeneous behaviour. Although injection of the esophageal carcinoma cell line GFP-PT1590 did not lead to primary esophageal tumor development at the site of injection, 50% of the mice developed extensive peritoneal spread, as well as lymph node and organ metastasis.Conclusion:The orthotopic cell injection model resulted in peritoneal carcinomatosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma, which could be visualized in real time using fluorescence imaging.
