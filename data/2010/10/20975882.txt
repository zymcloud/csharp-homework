Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has a dismal prognosis, with a median overall survival of 7.9 months if untreated and of 10.7 months if treated with sorafenib. We present a case of advanced previously unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in a 49-year-old man that achieved a pathologic complete response and was made amenable to surgery with sorafenib in combination with (90)Y radioembolization. The patient's survival was more than double the median for patients treated with sorafenib alone.
