Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) and its homologue in rodents (Nat2) are polymorphic xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and also seem to play a role in endogenous metabolism. NAT1 and Nat2 polymorphism was associated to cancers under xenobiotic procarcinogens metabolism as well as under endogenous substrate metabolism. This study investigated the p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) -Nat2 catalytic activity and its polymorphism in liver homogenates of adult sand rats Psammomys obesus Cretzschmar, 1828. These Saharian sand rats develop high incidence of spontaneous cancers under standard laboratory diet. The average value of PABA-Nat2 specific activity tested in nine sand rats was significant (2.96 ± 2.16 nmoles/min/mg). The N-acetylation exhibited a bimodal distribution. There was a significant difference (p<0.01) between PABA-Nat2 activity in the fast acetylators group (4.10 ± 1.67 nmol/min/mg) and slow acetylators group (0.7 ± 0.27 nmol/min/mg). The percentage of the fast acetylator group was 66.66%. These results support the presence of Nat2 polymorphism in the liver of the strain sand rats Psammomys obesus. This strain is useful for investigating the role of Nat2 polymorphisms in susceptibility to cancers related to arylamine carcinogen exposures as well as to endogenous substrate metabolism.
