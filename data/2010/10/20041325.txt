Purpose:Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not eligible for local therapies has limited chances of cure. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with proven activity in advanced HCC. Octreotide is used in this setting with conflicting results. Treatment with sorafenib and long-acting octreotide was tested in advanced HCC to evaluate safety and activity.Methods:Fifty patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh A or B, received sorafenib at a dosage of 800 mg/day for 28 days with a following week of rest and long-acting octreotide at a dose of 40 mg, administered every 28 days.Results:All patients were assessable for safety and efficacy. Sixteen patients out of 50 (34%) were na√Øve from other therapies, while all the others were previously treated with local and/or systemic treatments. We achieved 5 partial responses (10%), 33 stable diseases (66%) and 12 progressions of disease (24%). Median time to progression was 7.0 months (95% CI, 3.0-10.9 months), and median overall survival was 12 months (95% CI, 6.3-17.4 months). Treatment was well tolerated. Diarrhoea (6%) and hypertension (4%) were the most frequent grade 3 toxicities.Conclusions:Our data suggest that the combination between sorafenib and long-acting octreotide is active and well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC and could represent another efficacious chance for the management of this population.
