Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world especially in Asia. Radiofrequency ablation is now commonly use as either first line or in combination with other treatment modality for patients with HCC. It is the objective of this article to report our experience in a tertiary referral hospital.Methods:Patients who diagnosed with HCC and underwent RFA in Queen Elizabeth Hospital during the period from May 2002 to February 2009 were included and analyzed.Results:During this period, 138 sessions of RFA were performed in 117 consecutive patients with HCC. The calculated rate of primary (single attempt) successful ablation during this entire period was 89.2%. The in-hospital/30-day mortality rate was zero, and morbidity was 24.1%. Hospital stays were significantly longer in the open group (4.4 days versus 8.9 days, P = 0.000). Median follow-up in this study was 21 months. 11 (9.4%), 10 (8.5%) and 49 (41.0%) patients developed local tumor progression (LTP), systemic recurrence and Intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR), respectively. The mean and median times to recurrence were 15.4 and 11 months, respectively. Most patients (91%) with LTP developed in the first 24 months. Disease-free survival was 65% at 1 year, 40% at 3 years and 25% at 5 years. Overall survival at 1, 3 and 5 years was 85, 66 and 40%, respectively. Alpha fetoprotein, aFP > 1,000 ng/ml and multiple tumor ablation predicted increased risk of recurrence.Conclusion:Radiofrequecy ablation is useful tool in treating patients with HCC with high successful rate. However, intrahepatic recurrence is common and a well designed post ablation follow up protocol based on a sound knowledge of recurrence pattern is vital.
