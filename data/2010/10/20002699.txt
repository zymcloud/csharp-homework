Aim:The risk of local recurrence following curative surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) is up to 50%. A rigorous follow-up program may increase survival. Guidelines on suitable methods for scheduled follow up examinations are needed. This study evaluates a strict follow-up program including carcinogenic embryonic antigen (CEA), chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and (18)F-FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).Method:A cohort of 132 patients, treated by surgery with curative intent for CRC, was included. Patients were followed prospectively with scheduled controls at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after curative surgery. CEA, chest X-ray, US, CT and FDG-PET supplemented by clinical examination. The end-point was recurrence. Sensitivity and specificity was estimated 2 years after surgery.Results:Of the 132 patients included in the study, 25 experienced recurrence, detected at scheduled controls (n = 18) and at intervals between them (n = 7). The results of CT and FDG-PET were correlated with recurrence. CT combined with FDG-PET had the highest specificity and sensitivity.Conclusion:A total of 72% of recurrences were detected at scheduled controls. The findings supported a strict follow-up program following curative surgery for colorectal cancer. FDG-PET combined with CT should be included in control programs.
