Occult HBV infections (OHBI) are often associated with poor therapeutic response and increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite a decade of research, OHBI still remains an intricate issue and much is yet to be defined about their possible immune implications. As HBV is known to infect peripheral blood lymphocytes, the present study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA damage response triggered due to OHBI in host cells. The study was divided into three groups i.e. group A (OHBI patients n=30, viral load
