Primary hepatic lymphoma is extremely rare. Although the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) for imaging extranodal lymphoma has been reported, there is very little literature describing its use in primary hepatic lymphoma. This case report demonstrates the effect of FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT) in a case of unifocal primary hepatic lymphoma and its usefulness in the assessment of treatment response.
