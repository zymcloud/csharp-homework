Objective:To determine the association between elevated levels of serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 and hepatitis cirrhosis in different stage, and also to explore the clinical application value of serum CA-125.Methods:During June to December in 2008, 200 cases with hepatitis cirrhosis were random selected in our hospital. CA-125 levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunization assay in sera collected from these cases which were termed with Child-Paugh classification and analyzed by SAS.Results:Serum CA-125 levels were correlated closely with ascites, primary peritonitis and liver function Child-Paugh classification, but no associated with primary carcinoma of liver and other liver function index,such as ALT, AST, ALB, TBIL and PT.Conclusion:The levels of serum CA-125 in hepatitis cirrhosis patients were osculating correlating with lesion of liver and ascite degree, could serve as a sensitive and conventional laboratory index for liver lesion degree and monitoring ascite generation. It was necessary to further study on the association with serum CA-125 level with primary hepatic carcinoma.
