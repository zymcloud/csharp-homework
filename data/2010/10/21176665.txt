Objective:To establish a scoring system predicting the ascites postoperatively by analyzing the variant factors associated with massive ascites after hepatectomy in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From January 2005 to January 2010, 324 patients with HCC underwent hepatectomy were analyzed retrospectively. There were 282 male and 42 female, aging from 17 to 84 years (mean age, 54 years). They were divided into two groups according to the volume of ascites. Variant preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative factors were compared and a scoring system was established to predict the postoperative ascites.Results:The univariate analyses revealed that various preoperative factors including prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase had significantly difference in the two groups (P Conclusion:Variant factors are associated with postoperative ascites for hepatocellular carcinoma and the scoring system established can predict the ascites after hepatectomy accurately.
