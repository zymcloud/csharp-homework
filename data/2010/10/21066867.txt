A 56-year-old man receiving hemodialysis treatment was hospitalized for examination of a mass in the right middle lobe. Chest computed tomography showed a right hilar mass shadow accompanied by pleural effusion. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was diagnosed by cytological examination of the pleural effusion. No epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was found. He was treated with 6 courses of docetaxel as first-line chemotherapy. Docetaxel was administered on the same day as hemodialysis. Adverse events, including hematotoxicity, were managed safely and no delay in administration occurred. This chemotherapy resulted in a partial response. Because docetaxel is metabolized in the liver and does not affect renal function, it can be administered as a standard regimen. This suggests that docetaxel monotherapy is an efficient therapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving hemodialysis.
