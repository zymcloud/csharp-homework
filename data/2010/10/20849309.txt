Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer with high morbidity. (131)I-lipiodol is used clinically and has been found to be effective for the treatment of HCC. However, this preparation has its limitations, including compromised yield and stability of exchange labeling and unnecessary dose burden from gamma emissions. In the present study, (177)Lu-oxine in lipiodol was considered as a possible alternative for radioiodinated lipiodol. Oxine or 8-hydroxyquinoline was labeled with (177)Lu obtained by neutron irradiation of natural lutetium. Under optimized conditions, the radiolabeled complex was obtained with yields >98% and adequate in vitro stability. (177)Lu-oxine dispersed in lipiodol showed appreciable uptake into rat liver cells (normal and HCC-induced) in vitro. (177)Lu-oxine-lipiodol showed initial localization in the liver, but subsequent leakage of radioactivity with deposition in the skeletal tissue was seen. The studies suggest that (177)Lu-oxine dispersed in lipiodol might not be suitable for treatment of HCC.
