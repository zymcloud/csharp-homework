A 71-year-old man, whose chief complaint was a faecal occult blood, had gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastric cancer was diagnosed. CT scan and intraoperative findings revealed metastatic liver tumors. We performed total gastrectomy with D2 lymph dissection, partial hepatic resections and microwave coagulation therapy. Small cell carcinoma of the stomach was diagnosed by histopathological findings. We used combination chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, epirubicin, etoposide and 5-FU was performed. After one course, he suffered from leucopenia and agranulocytosis of grade 3, thrombocytopenia of grade 4, so we reduced the dose and performed 6 courses in total. The patient remains alive without recurrence 48 months after operation. We conclude that adjuvant chemotherapy was effective for small cell carcinoma of the stomach, which was to be considered to have a poor prognosis.
