Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignant tumors worldwide with poor prognosis. Based on high-throughput screening technology, we and others have identified factors and pathways that are pivotal for tumor progression including transcription factors and microtubule-interacting proteins. In addition, aberrant activation of the IGF signalling pathway is frequently observed in HCCs which is predominantly based on high level expression of its ligand IGF-II. Because protumorigenic effects of IGF-II such as proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and migration are transmitted through its receptor IGF-1R, selective inhibition of this tyrosine kinase by small molecule compounds might reduce IGF-II-driven tumor growth. Indeed, administration of IGF-1R-selective inhibitors reduces IGF-II-induced effects and was associated with a significant reduction of tumor growth in a xenograft transplantation model. In conclusion, the IGF-II/IGF-1R signalling pathway is critically involved in the regulation of tumor growth and tumor cell dissemination, representing a promising therapeutic target structure in the treatment of HCC.
