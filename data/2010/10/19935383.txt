Background:Although hepatic arterial chemoembolization (HACE) has been used for treatment of ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver, the prognostic indicators for survival after HACE have not been studied. We evaluated response rates and survival durations after HACE in such patients and analyzed factors affecting their survival.Methods:The medical records of patients with ocular melanoma metastatic to liver who underwent HACE at our institution from 1992 to 2005 were reviewed. The radiologic tumor response rates, and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival durations were calculated, and patient, tumor, and treatment variables were analyzed to identify factors influencing survival.Results:One hundred twenty-five patients underwent 265 HACE sessions. Of 105 patients in whom radiologic responses could be evaluated, 12 (11%) had partial responses, 17 (16%) had minor responses, 68 (65%) had stable disease, and 8 (8%) had progressive disease. The median OS and progression-free survival durations were 6.7 and 3.8 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that >75% liver involvement and high lactate dehydrogenase levels were associated with short OS. Patients who had radiologic responses to HACE had a longer median OS duration than did patients who did not (15.8 vs. 6.1 months; P = 0.0005). Patients with >75% liver involvement had a median OS duration of only 2.4 months.Conclusions:HACE resulted in radiologic response or disease stabilization in most patients with ocular melanomas metastatic to the liver. The extent of liver involvement, baseline lactate dehydrogenase levels, and response to therapy were found to be significant predictors of OS after HACE.
