In this study, the time-dependent changes on dynamic computed tomograph (CT) of radiation-induced liver injury in gastric cancer patients was examined. The CT images of 52 gastric cancer patients who had received chemoradiotherapies were reviewed on the PACS system. Dynamic CT scan was performed in all the subjects. Our results showed that 18 patients were found to have radiation-induced liver injury. The CT findings of radiation-induced liver injury in gastric cancer patients tend to show up one month after radiation treatment. The damaged area was of low density on all three phases, and then it was enhanced on portal vein phase or delay phase. The focal radiation reaction of liver without basic disease vanished 9-11 months later after treatment. We are led to conclude that dynamic CT is of help in the diagnosis of CRT-induced liver injury, and it may be the method of choice for following up the whole course of the CRT-induced liver injury, i.e., form hepatic damage to healing. The classification of CT findings we recommend can avoid the influence of technological factors, and thereby serve as a better guide for treatment of CRT-induced liver injury.
