Background:Bevacizumab has demonstrated antitumor activity in multiple diseases. This phase II study was undertaken to determine the effects of adding bevacizumab to a regimen of docetaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.Patients and methods:Previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease and a performance status (PS) of 0-1 were eligible for this study. Patients received bevacizumab at 7.5 mg/kg, docetaxel at 70 mg/m(2), and oxaliplatin at 75 mg/m(2) administered on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The primary end point of the study was progression-free survival (PFS).Results:A total of 38 eligible patients (median age 57 years, 45% gastric, 55% PS 0) were enrolled on to the study. Median PFS was 6.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4-10.5] and median survival 11.1 months (95% CI 8.2-15.3). Complete responses were documented in 2 (5%) patients, partial responses in 14 (37%), and stable disease in 14 (37%). No treatment-related deaths were observed. The most commonly reported grade 3-4 toxicity was neutropenia (34%), and gastrointestinal perforation occurred in three patients (8%).Conclusion:The combination of bevacizumab, docetaxel, and oxaliplatin has promising activity for further evaluation in randomized trials.
