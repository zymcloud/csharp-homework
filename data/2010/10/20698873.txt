Background:Physical activity has been associated with a lower risk of cancer, including melanoma, but the effect has not yet been assessed for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC).Objective:To determine whether the risk of skin cancer differs according to physical activity level in patients at high risk for NMSC.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study in kidney, liver, and pancreatic transplant patients via telephone interview. Physical activity scores were calculated for each patient using a previously validated questionnaire. Sun exposure history and skin type were also recorded. The outcome of interest was a biopsy-proven diagnosis of at least one NMSC.Results:Of 142 subjects, 45 (32%) developed NMSC. There was no significant effect of physical activity on the development of NMSC.Conclusions:Physical activity level may not be a major predictor of skin cancer risk in organ transplant patients. Controlled trials and population-based studies are needed to determine whether exercise can decrease the risk of NMSC in the general population. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.
