Objective:To evaluate the correlations between MELD score and left ventricular function in patients with end-stage liver disease.Methods:A total of 92 patients who prepared for orthotopic liver transplantation from January 2002 to May 2008 were enrolled in this study. Of these Patients, 75 were males and 17 were females, and the mean age was 50.3+/-9.5 years; 85 were cirrhosis, 7 were cirrhosis with primary liver cancer. Preoperative information, including biochemical parameters, coagulation parameters, indicators of hepatitis virology, two-dimensional echocardiography and electrocardiogram were collected. According to MELD (the Model for End-stage Liver Disease) scoring system, these subjects were categorized into three groups: MELD score is less than or equal to 9 points (31 cases, 33.7%); 10 is less than or equal to MELD score is less than or equal to 19 points (45 cases, 48.9%); MELD score is more than or equal to 20 points (16 cases, 17.4%). The relationships between MELD score and classification and cardiac function were determined by chi-square test, analysis of variance, rank sum test and correlation analysis, et al.Results:MELD score was significantly correlated with left atrial diameter (LAD), interventricular septum thickness (IVST), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), aortic flow (AF), cardiac output (CO), QRS interval (QRSI) and corrected QT interval (QTc) (r = 0.317, 0.341, 0.228, 0.387, 0.325, 0.209 and 0.347, respectively; P value less than 0.01, respectively); except QRSI, these variables and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) were also correlated with INR (a MELD component) (r = 0.282, 0.319, 0.322, 0.435, 0.275, 0.320 and 0.237, respectively; P value less than 0.01, respectively); LAD, LVEDD, AF, CO and QTc were correlated with serum total bilirubin (r = 0.241, 0.219, 0.357, 0.246 and 0.253, respectively; P value less than 0.05, respectively); IVST and E/A ratio (A blood flow [from left atrium to left ventricular] velocity ratio between early diastole [E wave] and late diastole[A wave] ) were correlated with serum creatinine (r = 0.216 and -0.343; P value less than 0.05 and 0.01); the proportion of E/A is less than or equal to 1 in all subjects was 46.7% (43/92), and 48.4% (15/31), 35.6% (16/45) and 75.0% (12/16) in each group, besides, there was statistically significant difference between 10 is less than or equal to MELD score is less than or equal to 19 points group and MELD score is more than or equal to 20 points group (X2 = 7.359, P = 0.009).Conclusions:There are different degrees of left ventricular structure, function and electrophysiological changes in patients with end-stage liver disease, these anomalies also will be increased with the MELD score increasing.
