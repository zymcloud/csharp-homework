Biliary hamartomas or von-Meyenburg complexes form part of a spectrum of ductal plate malformation that includes polycystic liver disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and Caroli disease. These lesions are known to have neoplastic transformation. Development of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is well described in these complexes. Rarely, hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) have been seen in association with bile duct hamartomas, however; it is not clear whether development of HCC is an epiphenomenon unrelated to the precursor lesion or biliary hamartomas may progress to liver cancers. We herein report 4 interesting cases of hepatitis C virus-, alcohol-, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-associated end-stage liver disease with coexisting HCC and multiple large von-Meyenburg complexes.
