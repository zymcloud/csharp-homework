Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths around the world; Asian countries account for nearly 78% of the roughly 600,000 cases of HCC reported globally each year. Europe, the US, Asian-Pacific nations, South Korea, and Japan have published evidence-based guidelines for the management of HCC. The management of HCC in Japan has achieved remarkable results, which are attributed to a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluation incorporated in the Japanese guidelines. However, many of the control methods and interventions in current HCC guidelines cannot be implemented in some Asian countries. The majority of HCC patients in Asia still present with advanced HCC and long-term outcomes following treatment are unsatisfactory because of a lack of effective adjuvant and systemic therapies. Asian countries should formulate evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and pay particularly close attention to combining quantitative and qualitative evaluation when drafting and implementing HCC guidelines. The guidelines should also be updated by incorporating new evidence.
