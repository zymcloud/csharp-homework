Hepatoma-derived growth factor-related proteins (HRPs) make up a family of six members. Hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein-3 (HRP-3) is the only family member whose expression is almost restricted to nervous tissue. Here we show that soluble HRP-3 acts as a novel neurotrophic factor for cultured primary cortical neurons. Antibody-mediated neutralization of HRP-3 function results in neuronal degeneration. In contrast, HRP-3 as the only addition to a culture medium not supporting neuronal survival rescues neurons to an extent comparable to the addition of FCS. Besides this neuroprotective capability, the protein exerts a neurite outgrowth-promoting effect when it is presented as a coated substrate but not as a soluble factor. This study points to an important role of HRP-3 during the development of the nervous system.
