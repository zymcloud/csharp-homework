It was recently shown that compound K (CK), an intestinal bacterial metabolite of ginseng saponin, exhibits antihepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) activity, and Bid is a potential drug target for HCC therapy. This paper reports a novel mechanism of CK-induced apoptosis of HCC cells via Bid-mediated mitochondrial pathway. CK dramatically inhibited HCC cells growth in concentration- and time-dependent manners, and a high dose of CK could induce HCC cell apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, the effective dose of CK potently attenuated the subcutaneous tumor growth and spontaneous HCC metastasis in vivo. At the molecular level, immunohistochemical staining revealed that Bid expression in subcutaneous tumor and liver metastasis tissues decreased dramatically in CK-treated groups compared to untreated controls, which also implies that Bid may play a critical role in the growth and progression of HCC. Further study shows that translocation of full-length Bid to the mitochondria from nuclei during cytotoxic apoptosis was associated with the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, indicating that full-length Bid is sufficient for the activation of mitochondrial cell death pathways in response to CK treatment in HCC cells. Taken together, the results not only reveal a Bid-mediated mitochondrial pathway in HCC cells induced by CK but also suggest that CK may become a potential cytotoxic drug targeting Bid in the prevention and treatment of HCC.
