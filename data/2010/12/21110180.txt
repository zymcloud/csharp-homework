Objective:To study the effect of Aidi Injection (艾迪注射液,ADI) applied in the bronchial artery, applied in the bronchial artery infused (BAI) neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III A non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before surgical operation.Methods:The 60 patients with NSCLC stage III A underwent two courses BAI chemotherapy before tumor incision were assigned to two groups, the treatment and the control groups, using a random number table, 30 in each group. ADI (100 mL) was given to the patients in the treatment group by adding into 500 mL of 5% glucose injection for intravenous dripping once daily, starting from 3 days before each course of chemotherapy, and it lasted for 14 successive days, so a total of 28 days of administration was completed. The therapeutic effectiveness and the adverse reaction that occurred were observed, and the levels of T-lymphocyte subsets, natural killer cell activity, and interleukin-2 in peripheral blood were measured before and after the treatment.Results:The effective rate in the treatment group was higher than that in the control group (70.0% vs. 56.7%, P<0.05). Moreover, as compared with the control group, the adverse reaction that occurred in the treatment group was less and mild, especially in terms of bone marrow suppression and liver function damage (P<0.05). Cellular immune function was suppressed in NSCLC patients, but after treatment, it ameliorated significantly in the treatment group, showing significant difference as compared with that in the control group (P<0.05).Conclusion:ADI was an ideal auxiliary drug for the patients in stage III A NSCLC received BAI neo-chemotherapy before surgical operation; it could enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy, ameliorate the adverse reaction and elevate patients' cellular immune function; therefore, it is worthy for spreading in clinical practice.
