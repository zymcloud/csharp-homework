Miriplatin, a cisplatin derivative with a high affinity for iodized oil, is a novel chemotherapeutic agent designed for use in the transarterial treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. This case report describes our experience with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using miriplatin in 2 patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases. A 38-year-old man with multiple neuroendocrine liver metastases was treated by whole liver chemoembolization, and a 35-year-old woman with a single hepatic lesion was treated by superselective chemoembolization. No serious adverse events were noted during the interventional procedures, or during the observation period of 3 mo in either patient. Sufficient iodized oil uptake was observed in the hypervascular lesions on the unenhanced computed tomography (CT) at 7 d after the procedure. Contrast-enhanced CT obtained at 3 mo after chemoembolization revealed that all hepatic lesions were substantially reduced in size irrespective of tumor vascularity or degree of cystic degeneration, although iodized oil accumulation was only marginal for lesions with cystic degeneration. Thus, TACE with miriplatin can be a safe and effective therapeutic option for the treatment of neuroendocrine metastases of the liver.
