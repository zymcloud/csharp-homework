Ever since its discovery two decades ago, the erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (EPH)-EPHRIN system has been shown to play multifaceted roles in human gastroenterological cancer as well as neurodevelopment. Over-expression, amplification and point mutations have been found in many human cancers and many investigators have shown correlations between these up-regulations and tumor angiogenesis. Thus, the genes in this family are considered to be potential targets of cancer therapy. On the other hand, the down-regulation of some members as a result of epigenetic changes has also been reported in some cancers. Furthermore, the correlation between altered expressions and clinical prognosis seems to be inconclusive. A huge amount of protein-protein interaction studies on the EPH-EPHRIN system have provided a basic scheme for signal transductions, especially bi-directional signaling involving EPH-ERPHRIN molecules at the cell membrane. This information also provides a manipulative strategy for harnessing the actions of these molecules. In this review, we summarize the known alterations of EPH-EPHRIN genes in human tumors of the esophagus, stomach, colorectum, liver and pancreas and present the perspective that the EPH-EPHRIN system could be a potential target of cancer therapy.
