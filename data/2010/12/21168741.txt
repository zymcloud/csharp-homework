Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent types of tumor. The aim of this study was to determine the survival of patients who had received liver transplants as a result of the disease.Methods:This observational follow-up study included 150 patients who received liver transplantations from June 1994 to December 2007. The study considered epidemiological and staging variables, tumor descriptions, and follow-up variables. We employed Kaplan-Meier methodology together with a Cox multivariate regression analysis.Results:The incidence of tumor relapse was 13.3%, with survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years of 89.3%, 73.1%, and 61.4%, respectively. Variables that showed an independent effect to predict mortality were the degree of histological differentiation and of macrovascular invasion. Patients with poorly differentiated HCC had a 4.03 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.61-10.06) greater possibility of dying. Macrovascular involvement increased the risk of death (relative risk = 2.23), an effect that was at the limit of significance (95% CI 0.99-5.04).Conclusions:The survival rate was consistent with the literature. Poor tumor differentiation and macrovascular involvement were independent predictors of mortality.
