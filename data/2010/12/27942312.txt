Hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare, benign, mesenchymal neoplasm found in both males and females, and most commonly encountered in adult females. These lesions are difficult to diagnose by imaging, especially when fatty component is scant or absent. Histomorphologically, they resemble hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor cells are strongly positive for homatropine methylbromide-45 (HMB-45) and smooth muscle actin by immunohistochemistry, which are the key markers for accurate pathological diagnosis. Hepatic AML should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a well circumscribed hepatic mass, even in the absence of an adipose tissue component.
