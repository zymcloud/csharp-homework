Background & aims:LIM-domain-binding (Ldb) proteins have been demonstrated to be essential not only to key embryonic developmental processes but also to carcinogenesis. We have previously demonstrated Ldb1 to be of high biological and developmental relevance, as a targeted deletion of the Ldb1 gene in mice results in an embryonic lethal and pleiotropic phenotype.Methods:We have now established a liver-specific Ldb1 knock out to investigate the role of Ldb1 in carcinogenesis, in particular in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, in vivo.Results:These mice demonstrated a significantly enhanced growth of liver cancer by means of tumor size and number, advocating for an essential role of Ldb1 in HCC development. In addition, proliferation and resistance against apoptosis were increased. In order to identify the functional disturbances due to a lack of Ldb1, we performed a 15k mouse gene microarray expression analysis. We found the Myc oncogene to be regulated in the microarray analysis and were able to further confirm this regulation by demonstrating an over-expression of its downstream target Cyclin D1. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate a down-regulation of the tumor suppressor p21. Finally, the liver stem cell marker EpCAM was also identified to be over expressed in Ldb1(-/-) knock out mice.Conclusions:We have established a significant role of Ldb1 in cancer development. Furthermore, we provided evidence for a myc/cyclin D1, p21, and EpCAM-dependent signalling to be key downstream regulators of this novel concept in HCC development.
