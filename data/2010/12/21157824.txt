Background:The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor, largely as a result of intrahepatic metastasis. Using a mouse model of intrahepatic metastasis, we investigated whether chemokine ligand 2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2/MCP-1) could potentiate the antitumor effects of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) system.Methods:Mouse hepatoma cells infected with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing HSV-tk, CCL2/MCP-1 and LacZ at multiplicities of infection of Ad-tk/Ad-MCP1 = 3/0.03 (T/M(Low)), 3/3 (T/M(High)) and Ad-tk/Ad-LacZ = 3/3 (T/L) were injected into BALB/c mice.Results:Intrahepatic tumor growth was significantly lower in T/M(Low) mice. By contrast, no tumor suppression was observed in T/M(High) mice. The tumor-specific cytolytic activities of splenocytes from T/M(Low) and T/M(High) mice were comparable. Immunohistochemical analysis of liver tissues showed similar infiltration by Mac-1(+) and T cells in these animals, whereas the proportions of classical activated (M1) monocytes/macrophages were significantly higher in T/M(Low) mice. In addition, interleukin-12 production was elevated in these tissues. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A expression and CD31(+) microvessels were increased in T/M(High) mice.Conclusions:Collectively, these results demonstrate that an adequate amount of CCL2/MCP-1, together with the HSV-tk/GCV system, may induce T helper 1-polarized antitumor effects without inducing tumor angiogenesis in the microenvironment of intrahepatic HCC progression.
