Resveratrol has been shown to possess anticancer, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective activities. In this study, we examined the antiproliferative properties of resveratrol and its molecular mechanism(s) of action in Huh-7 cells, a new human hepatoma cell line system for hepatitis C virus. Results showed that resveratrol significantly inhibited Huh-7 cell proliferation (50% inhibitory concentration = 22.4 Î¼g/mL) and effectively induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It up-regulated p21/WAF1 expression in a p53-independent manner, but the expressions of cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 were down-regulated. It also caused an increase in the ratio of pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic protein, which was associated with the mitochondrial membrane depolarization and the increase in caspase activity. Resveratrol showed no effect on Fas, Fas ligand, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and p38 expression but down-regulated phospho-ERK and phospho-p38 expression. In addition, resveratrol was noted to trigger autophagic cell death through the increased expression of autophagy-related Atg5, Atg7, Atg9, and Atg12 proteins. These results suggest that resveratrol could be an important chemoprevention agent for hepatoma of hepatitis C virus infection.
