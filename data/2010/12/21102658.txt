Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists such as clofibrate are known to affect liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) levels, which in turn influence hepatocellular oxidant status. The mechanism of clofibrate's modulation of L-FABP levels is not clear. In this study we used clofibrate (PPARα agonist), MK886 (PPARα antagonist), and GW9662 (PPARγ antagonist) in determining the regulating mechanism of L-FABP expression and its antioxidant activity in CRL-1548 hepatoma cells. Antioxidant activity was assessed by determining intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) using dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence. The effect of clofibrate on cytosolic activity of the intracellular antioxidant enzymes was also assessed. RT-PCR and mRNA stability assay showed that clofibrate treatment enhanced L-FABP mRNA stability, which resulted in increased L-FABP levels. A nuclear run-off assay and RT-PCR measurements of L-FABP mRNA revealed that clofibrate increased the L-FABP gene transcription rate. The increased L-FABP was associated with reduced cytosolic ROS. Levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase were not affected by clofibrate treatment. L-FABP siRNA knockdown studies showed that a reduction in L-FABP expression was associated with increased DCF fluorescence. We conclude that clofibrate enhanced L-FABP gene transcription and mRNA stability, thus affecting L-FABP expression and ultimately cellular antioxidant activity.
