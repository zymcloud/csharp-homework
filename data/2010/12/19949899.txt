The present study was designed to research on RNA interference hepatitis B virus x gene approach to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. Previously, we constructed and identified shRNA eukaryotic expression vectors (pshRNA-X220) specific to HBx gene, pshRNA-MOCK (control); and established HCC cell lines with stable expression shRNA eukaryotic vector targeting HBx gene-21543 cell lines (MHCC97-H of expressing shRNA against HBx), HK3 cell lines (MHCC97-H by transfected with pshRNA-MOCK). We examined the expression of HBx gene after RNA interference by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and assessed the effect of HBx knocked down on cell growth by proliferation assay using kit-8 (CCK8). As well as, we analyzed cell cycle distribution by flowcytometry and examined cell apoptosis using TUNEL assay. The HBx mRNA expression level is reduced, and cells growth was significantly stopped in 21543 cell lines. Cells with HBx knockdown were more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin. RNA interfering HBx induced an obvious time and dose-dependent inhibitory in comparison with the control cells. Meanwhile, RNA interferenced targeting HBx, in combination with chemotherapy can effectively induce apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and restricts cell proliferation.
