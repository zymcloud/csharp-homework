Surgical resection is the first-line curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However most patients are unable to undergo surgical resection because of advanced tumoral stage, severe liver dysfunction or poor clinical status. Therefore, image-guided tumor ablation techniques have been introduced for the treatment of unresectable HCC. Among them, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been demonstrated to be an effective alternative curative therapy. However, local ablative therapy for tumors located close to structures such as the diaphragm or gastrointestinal tract is technically challenging because of the risk of collateral thermal damage to nearby structures or incomplete treatment of the HCC resulting from poor visibility on sonography. The introduction of artificial ascites can separate adjacent organs from the tumor and improve the sonic window. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of RFA with artificial ascites for HCC adjacent to the diaphragm.
