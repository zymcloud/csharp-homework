Portal hypertension leads to serious complications such as oesophageal varices, ascites, and in some patients hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The importance of measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) has recently been substantiated as it independently predicts survival and development in connection with ascites, HCC and variceal bleeding. Measurement of HVPG is a simple and safe method and it can, moreover, be used to guide pharmacotherapy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Assessment of HVPG should be available in larger centres that manage portal hypertensive patients.
