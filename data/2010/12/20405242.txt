Introduction:The purpose of this paper is to illustrate contrast enhancement patterns of solid focal liver lesions on dynamic and late phase imaging with gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA).Imaging findings:Unenhanced T2- and T1-weighted, dynamic T1-weighted (arterial, portal-venous, and equilibrium) and late phase (1-3 h) Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MR imaging of different focal liver lesions (nodular regenerative hyperplasia, hepatic adenoma, liver adenomatosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, hypervascular metastases, and hypovascular metastases) are shown. Dynamic imaging was performed using GRE T1-w sequences after the bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-BOPTA; late-phase imaging was obtained at 1-3 h after contrast injection.Conclusions:Dynamic imaging with Gd-BOPTA provides the same information as with conventional gadolinium-based extracellular contrast agents, while late-phase imaging gives additional information for lesion identification and characterization.
