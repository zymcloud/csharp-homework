During the virus C infection the presence of cirrhosis is the major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the absence of cirrhosis the estimated prevalence hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 6.7% to 50.1%. We present the case of a 64 year-old-man admitted to the hospital with 3-days history of nespecific symptomatology. Screening abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged liver with 4 parenchimatous nodules in the right lobe and malignant thrombosis of the inferior vena cava. Chest CT revealed multiple metastasis in both lungs and left pulmonary arterial thrombosis. The patient died 5 weeks later. The particularity of the case is the presence of the end-stage hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with asymptomatic C virus infection.
