It was the aim of this study to develop a methodology for dissection in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy (D2 LDG) for gastric cancer. One-hundred and thirty-two patients with distal gastric cancer underwent D2 LDG with a novel sequence of lymph node dissection between August 2004 and June 2008. Live anatomy in each step was observed simultaneously to ensure and confirm the newly developed methodology. Dissections in LDG were standardized as sequential steps: Dividing the gastrocolic ligament and getting access to the prepancreatic space--lymph node dissection in the lower left area--lymph node dissection in the lower right area--lymph node dissection in the upper right area--lymph nodes dissection centrally--lymph node dissection between liver and stomach. All dissections were successfully performed in peripancreatic spaces and their extensions. Gastric vessels were located by special landmarks, traced along vascular trunks and bifurcations, and identified by fine dissection technique in vaginavasorum. Sequential dissection around the pancreas was an effective method for D2 LDG. It was ensured by anatomical knowledge in each step: Vessels and fascial spaces around a central landmark, the pancreas.
