Background:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3), des-Î³-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), and Golgi protein-73 (GP73) have been used or proposed as tumor markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:They were measured in 96 patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC to investigate their treatment response and association with variables linked with tumor invasiveness and/or prognosis. Values at 1 month post-surgery in the 77 patients without recurrence within 6 postoperative months were adopted as those after surgery.Results:GP73 levels did not change after hepatectomy, but levels of other markers decreased and areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (95% CI) were: 0.64 (0.56-0.72), 0.63 (0.55-0.71), 0.79 (0.73-0.86), and 0.63 (0.55-0.71) for AFP, AFP-L3, DCP, and combination of AFP and AFP-L3, respectively. Cutoff points giving specificities of 96.1% (sensitivities at these points) were: 124 ng/mL (28.1%), 10% (21.9%), and 60 mAU/mL (52.1%), for AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP, respectively. The combination of AFP and AFP-L3 provided a sensitivity of 26.0% at a specificity of 96.1%. The increased DCP value was, or tended to be, associated with a larger tumor, vascular invasion, intrahepatic metastases, and a lower grade of tumor cell differentiation. Although similar associations were found between AFP and vascular invasion as well as a lower grade of tumor cell differentiation, no such relationship was found with AFP-L3.Conclusions:DCP is a more effective tumor marker than AFP and AFP-L3. AFP-L3 showed comparable accuracy to AFP but no benefit was found in their combination. GP73 did not play a significant role in this context. Indices of tumor invasiveness were most closely associated with DCP.
