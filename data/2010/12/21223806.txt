Objective:The aim of this study was to determine if Golgi protein-73 (GP73) is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to explore the possibility of using GP73 in diagnosis and treatment of HCC.Methods:Serum GP73 was detected by a quantitative ELISA assay. A total of 372 serum samples were included, among them 43 from healthy donors (Normal), 110 from either chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis (CH/LC), and 219 from HCC patients. The levels of GP73 were compared among the 3 groups. The received operating curve (ROC), sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for HCC patients were calculated.Results:The average level of GP73 expression in normal, CH/LC and HCC groups were (22.1 ± 8.5) ng/ml, (81.4 ± 57.2) ng/ml and (271.5 ± 202.3) ng/ml, respectively. Serum GP73 levels were significantly higher in patients with HCC compared to those with CH/LC (P Conclusion:Higher level of GP73 can be found in the serum of patients with HCC than those without. GP73 is better than AFP for the diagnosis of early HCC and in evaluating treatment result in patients with normal AFP. Further studies may help to validate both the role and mechanism of GP73 in diagnosis of HCC.
