Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem worldwide, which causes high rate of chronic liver disease such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Plasma transforming growth factor Beta-1 (TGFB-1) is a member of large family of peptides, which has a major regulatory role in hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. The study evaluated the role of transforming growth factor Beta-1 (TGFB-1) in induction of fibrosis in liver parasites-free HCV patients with related steatohepatitis. Thirty HCV patients who were clinically and serologically positive were selected. They were diagnosed as fatty liver by abdominal ultrasonography; steatohepatitis and confirmed by histopathological biopsies examination. ELISA evaluated plasma transforming growth factor Beta-1 (TGFB-1) level. Also, 12 cross-matched subjects clinically, parasitologically and serologically free were used as a controls. The level of plasma transforming growth factor Beta-1 (TGFB-1) was highly elevated in the patients versus controls with mean +/- SD 18739.86 +/- 18539.46 and 6465 +/- 1142 respectively (P
