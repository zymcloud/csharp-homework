Objectives:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are important risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yet, there have been few studies on adherence to screening recommendations for groups at high risk for HCC. We assessed whether demographic factors or medical conditions affected screening participation among HBV/HCV carriers.Methods:The study population consisted of 15565 men and women who visited the National Cancer Center, Korea between August 2002 and July 2009. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, including chronic HBV and HCV infection, and health check-up history. HBV surface antigen and HCV antibody levels were measured in serum.Results:Among 781 HBV carriers, 596 (76.3%) were aware of their infection and 451 (57.8%) had ever been tested by ultrasonography. Among HCV carriers, 49 of 127 (36.6%) were aware of their infection and 61 (48.0%) had ever been tested by ultrasonography. Among HBV carriers, male sex (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.22-2.31), family history of liver disease (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.43-2.90), medical history of hyperlipidemia (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.36-5.33), and awareness of infection status (OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 2.99-6.17) were associated with being tested. Among HCV carriers, awareness of infection (OR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.72-8.26) was significantly associated with being tested by ultrasonography.Conclusion:Male sex, family history of liver disease, medical history of hyperlipidemia, and awareness of high risk status were associated with being tested by ultrasonography.
