Objective:While it is well known that patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) are predisposed to various malignancies, primarily non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and gastric carcinomas, to our knowledge no cases of hepatocellular carcinoma have been reported in the absence of preexisting liver disease.Method and results:We report a 50-year-old male patient with CVID with a B- and T-cell deficiency. The patient was on prophylactic intravenous gammaglobulin and had received several years earlier a course of rituximab for an autoimmune disorder. He had no history of hepatitis. The patient developed a rapidly progressing hepatocellular carcinoma within 3 to 4 weeks.Conclusions:Although patients with CVID are predisposed to malignancies such as lymphoma and adenocarcinoma of the stomach, rapidly progressive hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of any preexisting liver disease has not been described.
