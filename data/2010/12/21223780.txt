Objective:To summarize the experience of hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma fulfilling the Milan criteria and analyze the clinicopathological factors for patient survival and tumor recurrence.Methods:The clinicopathological data of 104 patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma fulfilling the Milan criteria and underwent hepatectomy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between April 2003 and June 2009 were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The median follow-up was 24 months. There were 54 recurrent cases. The 1-, 3- and 5-year cumulative disease-free survival rate were 63.0%, 32.6% and 22.4% respectively. Neither univariate analysis nor multivariate analysis indicated any factor significantly correlated with recurrence (P>0.05). The cumulative overall survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years were 88.8%, 68.1% and 68.1% respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that blood transfusion (P=0.000), involvement of hepatic capsule (P=0.000) and postoperative transarterial chemotherapy (P=0.049) were significantly correlated with survival. And multivariate analysis indicated that blood transfusion (P=0.001) and involvement of hepatic capsule (P=0.000) were independent prognostic factors for survival.Conclusion:For the patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma and compensated liver function fulfilling the Milan criteria, hepatectomy serves as the preferred treatment strategy.
