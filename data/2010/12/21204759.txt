Few options are available to treat patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It was tested whether the combination of iodine-131(¹³¹I)-metuximab with chemoembolization could improve outcomes in patients with intermediate HCC. Between April 2008 and April 2009, 110 patients with unresectable HCC were treated with 113 intra-arterial ¹³¹I-metuximab injections combined with chemoembolization (mean, 1.03 per patient; median, 1; range, 1-2), followed by 264 sessions of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (mean, 2.4 per patient; median, 3; range, 1-6). The survival rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 88.2%, 79.1%, and 57.4%, respectively, by the Kaplan-Meier method. Of these patients, 12% exhibited grade 3/4 bilirubin toxicity, 5% exhibited grade 3/4 white blood count toxicity, and 7% exhibited grade 3/4 platelet toxicity. Response rates based on World Health Organization and European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria were 42.73% and 61.82%, respectively. The combination of ¹³¹I-metuximab and chemoembolization appeared to extend survival in patients with unresectable HCC compared with historical controls, as well as being well tolerated by patients with Child-Pugh A and B. This combination may represent a promising treatment modality for patients with intermediate HCC.
