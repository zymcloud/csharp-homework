Background:This study was designed to define the diagnostic advantage of computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) combined with computed tomography-assisted hepatic arteriography (CTHA) for the preoperative detection of liver metastases secondary to pancreatic cancer compared with that of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT).Methods:From January 2002 to December 2007, we retrospectively studied 197 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer. MDCT was performed on 192 patients prior to preoperative visceral angiography; 153 patients underwent CTAP + CTHA at the time of preoperative angiography.Results:Liver metastases were identified in 39 patients by means of MDCT. Of the 153 patients who had no evidence of liver metastases on MDCT, 129 patients underwent CTAP + CTHA, and 53 of these 129 patients (41.1%) were diagnosed as having liver metastases that could not be detected by MDCT. These tumors missed by MDCT ranged from 3 to 15 mm in size. On CTAP + CTHA, a solitary nodule in the liver was detected in 11 patients, 2 nodules were detected in 6 patients, 3 lesions were detected in 2 patients, and â‰§4 lesions were detected in 34 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of CTAP + CTHA versus MDCT were 94.2 versus 48.4% and 82.7 versus 97.9%, respectively.Conclusions:The combination of CTAP and CTHA is useful to confirm liver metastases and can potentially offer more accurate staging of pancreatic cancer compared with MDCT.
