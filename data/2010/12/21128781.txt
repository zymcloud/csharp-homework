Context:It has been claimed that the Edmondson and Steiner grading system (EGS) values should be obtained preoperatively to select patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for liver transplantation. However, EGS reliability in biopsy specimens has been questioned.Objective:To verify the reliability of the EGS using core biopsy specimens and its reproducibility among pathologists.Design:Paired biopsy and surgical specimens obtained from 40 patients (subset 1) were retrieved by means of computer-aided search of the pathology records and blindly and independently reviewed. The EGS interrater agreement was measured using Îº statistics. After having held a consensus meeting, pathologists graded an additional 21 paired hepatocellular carcinoma specimens (subset 2).Results:Analyzing subset 1, pathologists gave significantly lower EGS grades to the biopsy specimens (P Conclusions:The EGS is easily underestimated in core biopsy specimens, and interrater disagreement between pathologists can be significant unless consensus meetings are held.
