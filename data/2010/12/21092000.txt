Background and aim:Little is known about the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) factors in the long-term prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after resection. The objective of the present study was to identify the changing patterns of HBV levels and its effect on outcome after resection.Methods:This study recruited 188 patients with HBV-related HCC who underwent curative resection. Among the 188 patients, 115 were alive without recurrence at 12 months, and had serial measurements of viral levels.Results:The mean age was 53 years and the mean follow-up period was 48.5 months. With multivariate analysis, tumor size > 5 cm (P = 0.047), Child-Pugh class B (P = 0.017), vascular invasion (P = 0.028), and HBV DNA > 10(4) copies/mL at the time of resection (P = 0.003) were independently predictive of HCC recurrence for the entire population. For the 115 patients with serial measurements of viral levels, tumor size > 5 cm, HBV DNA > 10(4) copies/mL at resection, and the absence of sustained HBV DNA level 40 IU/L) were marginally or significantly associated with HCC recurrence and overall survival. However, on multivariate analysis, sustained HBV DNA level Conclusions:A high HBV replication state is among the most important predictors of adverse outcome after resection of HBV-related HCC. The sustained suppression of HBV below 10(4) copies/mL is a strong protective factor for long-term recurrence-free and overall survival.
