Objective:To investigate the roles of p38 MAPK in apoptosis of the normal liver cell, the paratumor cirrhosis hepatocellular cell and the hepatocellular carcinoma cell.Methods:Three cell lines were adopted (the normal liver cell line HL-7702, the paratumor cirrhosis hepatocellular cell line QSG-7701 and the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line QGY-7703) and treated with Diamminedichloroplatin (DDP, cisplatin) and p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580. The apoptosis and cell cycles were detected by flow cytometry and electromicroscopy. The expressions of p38MAPK, CDC25B, p34cdc2 and cyclinB1 were detected by immunocytochemical staining , confocal microscopy and western blot.Results:The apoptotic rates in all three cell lines pretreated with DDP increased obviously and the rates in normal liver cells and HCC cells increased continuously even after SB203580 treatment, whereas in paratumor cirrhosis cells the rate decreased and the cell cycle stopped at S phase.Conclusion:Cisplatin induces apoptosis in the paratumor cirrhosis hepatocellular cell line QSG-7701 via activation of p38MAPK pathway and it differs in the normal liver cells from the hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
