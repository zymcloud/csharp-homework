Altered choline (Cho) metabolism in cancerous cells can be used as a basis for molecular imaging with PET using radiolabeled Cho. In this study, the metabolism of tracer Cho was investigated in a woodchuck hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line (WCH17) and in freshly derived rat hepatocytes. The transporter responsible for [(11)C]-Cho uptake in HCC was also characterized in WCH17 cells. The study helped to define the specific mechanisms responsible for radio-Cho uptake seen on the PET images of primary liver cancer such as HCC. Cells were pulsed with [(14)C]-Cho for 5 min and chased for varying durations in cold media to simulate the rapid circulation and clearance of [(11)C]-Cho. Radioactive metabolites were extracted and analyzed by radio-HPLC and radio-TLC. The Cho transporter (ChoT) was characterized in WCH17 cells. WCH17 cells showed higher (14)C uptake than rat primary hepatocytes. [(14)C]-Phosphocholine (PC) was the major metabolite in WCH17. In contrast, the intracellular Cho in primary hepatocytes was found to be oxidized to betaine (partially released into media) and, to a lesser degree, phosphorylated to PC. [(14)C]-Cho uptake by WCH17 cells was found to have both facilitative transport and nonfacilitative diffusion components. The facilitative transport was characterized by Na(+) dependence and low affinity (K(m) = 28.59 ± 6.75 μM) with partial energy dependence. In contrast, ChoT in primary hepatocytes is Na(+) independent and low affinity. Our data suggest that transport and phosphorylation of Cho are responsible for the tracer accumulation during [(11)C]-Cho PET imaging of HCC. WCH17 cells incorporate [(14)C]-Cho preferentially into PC. Conversion of [(14)C]-PC into phosphatidylcholine occurred slowly in vitro. Basal oxidation and phosphorylation activities in surrounding hepatic tissue contribute to the background seen in [(11)C]-Cho PET images.
