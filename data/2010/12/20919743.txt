Due to the lack of precise markers indicative of its occurrence, progression, and malignant stages, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently associated with high mortality. Given the fact that thrombocytopenia is associated with chronic liver diseases, and the multifunctional nature of platelets we reason that phenotype-specific platelets could be the systemic barometer for hepato-carcinogenesis. The mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic efforts to discover novel biomarkers in plasma or serum are largely compromised by a few of the overwhelmingly abundant proteins that comprise over 95% of the total protein mass of plasma or sera. Platelets however are free of these MS signal-suppressing proteins. On the basis of a HCC animal model where diethyl nitrosamine (DEN) administration on male rats specifically induces HCC, by using a multiplex quantitative proteomic approach, we profiled the phase-to-phase proteome changes in a series of viable phenotype-specific platelets along with the DEN-induced progressive liver transformation. The platelet proteome was found highly responsive to each physiological stage of liver inflammation or pathogenesis. Using data-dependent bioinformatics network analysis, we found that certain pathway modules involved in immune response, tissue wound repair, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and catabolism and metabolism were differentially regulated, which were uncovered by the DEN-induced differential expression of the corresponding pathway components. The phase-specific presentations of these pathways suggested that the DEN-induced progression of immune suppression and apoptosis resistance is dynamically coordinated in the platelets. These novel platelet signatures are interconnected in the dynamic networks along with HCC progression and could be identified noninvasively for HCC prognosis and early diagnosis.
