We aimed to study the prevalence and clinical implications of hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes in Chinese patients. A total of 4,300 patients, mainly from northern China, were enrolled, including 182 patients with acute hepatitis B and 4,118 patients with chronic HBV infection who had been exposed to nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. HBV genotypes/subgenotypes were determined by direct sequencing of the HBV S/Pol region. The prevalence rates were 0.40% for HBV/B1, 14.30% for HBV/B2, 0.25% for HBV/B3, 0.35% for HBV/B4, 1.05% for HBV/C1, 81.72% for HBV/C2, 0.93% for HBV/C3, 0.16% for HBV/C4, and 0.84% for HBV/D. In chronic HBV infection, patients with HBV/B2 were younger and had lower Î—BeAg positive rates than patients with HBV/C2. The incidence of lamivudine-resistant mutations was significantly higher in HBV/C2 compared to HBV/B2 (27.9% versus 19.8%; P
