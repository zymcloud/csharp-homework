A high total plasma cholesterol concentration is the most common abnormality found in patients with kidney disease, which may be associated with the increased hepatic synthesis of apoB containing lipoproteins. ApoB mRNA editing plays an important physiological role in mammalian lipid metabolism by modifying the distribution of apoB-100 and apoB-48. However, it is regretful that apoB mRNA editing cannot be found in human liver because of the absence of apobec-1 expression. In this context, we hypothesize that the recapture of hepatic apoB mRNA editing may be a promising strategy to relieve nephrotic dyslipidemia. The data presented below focus on those which support this hypothesis with regards to evidence in vitro and in vivo. (1) Human wild-type apoB mRNA can be edited only when both apobec-1 and ACF proteins are presented simultaneously in vitro. (2) Adenoviral vectors can produce short-term expression of exogenous apobec-1 in the livers and lower plasma apoB-100 and LDL levels transiently. (3) Apobec-1 transgenic animals exhibit massive hepatic editing of apoB mRNA and fundamental decreased plasma levels of apoB-100 and LDL, but are exposed to high risk of liver dysplasia and hepatocellular carcinomas. In summary, taking into account the therapeutic security, we put forward that apobec-1 recombinant adenoviral vectors can be used for the recapture of hepatic apoB mRNA editing with a transient low-level manner and may achieve satisfactory lipid-lowing effect in nephropathic animals.
