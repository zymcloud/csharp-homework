Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm that mostly occurs in young males. No curative treatment options currently exist for this type of tumor and long-term survival remains poor. In vitro rapamycin induces apoptotic death of JN-DSRCT-1 cells, a possible model for desmoplastic small round cell tumors in which the EWS gene is fused to the WT1 gene. We therefore demonstrate the prolonged activity of temsirolimus, an mTOR-inhibitor, in a patient with DSRCT.
