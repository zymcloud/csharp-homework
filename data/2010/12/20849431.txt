Background:Since hepatocellular carcinoma often recurs after surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation, we analyzed a retrospective large cohort of patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV).Methods:Among 379 patients with HCV RNA-positive small hepatocellular carcinoma (multiple up to three nodules, 3 cm or less each), 77 received interferon-alpha injection and 302 received no anti-viral therapy.Results:Four patients (5.2%) attained sustained virological response (SVR). Cumulative recurrence rates in the treated and untreated groups were 41.1% and 57.5% at the end of the third year, and 63.0% and 74.5% at the fifth year, respectively (P = 0.013). Fifth year-recurrence rates in treated group were 25.0% in SVR, 85.7% in biochemical response, 71.1% in no response, and 46.7% in patients with continuous administration. When four patients with SVR were excluded, recurrence rates in short-term interferon therapy (Conclusion:A long-term administration of low-dose interferon significantly decreased recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation.
