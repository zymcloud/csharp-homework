Objective:To explore the clinical value of Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein in the differentiation diagnosis between benign and malignant liver diseases, as well as the early warning of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Alpha-fetoprotein variants from 300 patients with liver diseases were isolated with micro-spin column equipped lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA). The AFP and AFP-L3 were detected by the electrochemical luminescence (ECL) method, and the proportions of AFP-L3 were calculated.Results:The positive rates of AFP-L3 of HCC patients and chronic liver disease patients were 95% and 64% respectively, there were significant difference in two groups (chi2 = 134.72, P 0.05).Conclusions:The detection of AFP-L3 by micro-spin column assay show great clinical value in the differentiation diagnosis of benign and malignant liver diseases, as well as the early warning of hepatocellular carcinoma.
