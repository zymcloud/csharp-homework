Objective:This study was designed to investigate the technical methods and clinical therapeutic effects of laparoscopy-assisted resection of gastric stump cancer (GSC).Methods:Laparoscopy-assisted resection was performed on 15 patients with GSC. The approach, method, difficult points, and techniques of the operation were analyzed, and its clinical therapeutic effect was evaluated.Results:With the help of laparoscopy, D2 radical resection of gastric stump was performed on 12 patients, and palliative gastric stump resection was performed on two patients. There was one case of conversion from laparoscopic surgery to open surgery. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed in all cases to reconstruct the alimentary tract. The mean operative time for laparoscopy-assisted resection was 205 ± 25 min. The mean intraoperative blood loss volume was 110 ± 40 ml. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 18 ± 5. A gastric tube was not placed in the patients after surgery. The mean time for the recovery of intestinal function was 2.5 ± 1 days, the mean duration of postoperative liquid diet was 2.5 ± 1 days, and the mean time for the recovery of ambulatory activity was 3 ± 0.5 days. There was one case of postoperative infection of the incision site. The follow-up time was 6-40 months, with 1 case of death due to liver metastasis, 1 case of death due to peritoneal metastasis, 1 case of death due to complications from lupus erythematosus, and survival for the remaining 12 cases.Conclusions:Laparoscopy-assisted resection of GSC is technically feasible; determination of the short- and long-term efficacies will require a larger and comparative sample study.
