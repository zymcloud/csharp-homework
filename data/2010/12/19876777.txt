The activation of Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) is involved in the formation of tumor cell pseudopodia, possibly resulting in their malignant potential. The clinicopathological significance of NHE1, however, is not yet well known in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we first analyzed the NHE1 expression in 100 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and found that NHE1, at both messenger RNA and protein levels, was over-expressed in majority of HCC tissues compared with matched non-cancerous tissue. In addition, the increased expression of NHE1 correlated with tumor size, venous invasion and advanced pTNM stage (P
