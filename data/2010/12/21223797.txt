Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in mTOR activity and survivin expression in liver cancer cell line HepG2 cells treated with tamoxifen.Methods:Survivin transcription level and p70S6K was demonstrated by PCR, dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis, respectively, and the apoptosis in the HepG2 cells was detected by flow cytometry.Results:Tamoxifen leads to apoptosis of the cells and reduction in survivin expression, as well as a dramatic reduction in the activated form of p70S6K. Treating HepG2 cells with rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, significantly reduced the survivin protein level but not affected the survivin transcription, indicating that tamoxifen and rapamycin were synergistic in regards to down-regulation of survivin expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Conclusions:Our results suggest that tamoxifen down-regulates survivin expression in HepG2 cells and it is mediated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional level via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to induce apoptosis.
