To develop a standardized and well-rounded material available for hepatology research, the National Liver Tissue Bank (NLTB) Project began in 2008 in China to make well-characterized and optimally preserved liver tumor tissue and clinical database. From Dec 2008 to Jun 2010, over 3000 individuals have been enrolled as liver tumor donors to the NLTB, including 2317 cases of newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and about 1000 cases of diagnosed benign or malignant liver tumors. The clinical database and sample store can be managed easily and correctly with the data management platform used. We believe that the high-quality samples with detailed information database will become the cornerstone of hepatology research especially in studies exploring the diagnosis and new treatments for HCC and other liver diseases.
