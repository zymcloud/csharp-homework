A 40-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of metastatic testicular cancer. Computerized tomography revealed multiple lung, liver, and retroperitoneal lymph node metastases. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple brain metastases. Induction chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin was started the day after a high orchiectomy. The pathological diagnosis of the surgical specimen was yolk sac carcinoma. The serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was markedly increased to 630,000 mIU/ml, which suggested the presence of a choriocarcinoma element at metastatic sites. The patient subsequently suffered respiratory failure due to pulmonary hemorrhage. Intensive supportive care prevented a fatal outcome. Physicians who treat advanced testicular tumors should be aware of the potential complication of acute pulmonary hemorrhage, called choriocarcinoma syndrome, in cases with a high hCG level, which indicates a rapidly progressive and high-volume choriocarcinoma.
