Upregulation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene is associated with many pathological conditions such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is critical in mediating ER-stress responsive genes, including iNOS. Nonetheless, the mechanism by which XBP1 regulates iNOS during ER stress remains unexplored. Here we show that the active/spliced form of XBP1 protein, XBP1S, directly binds to the AABS (A-activator-binding site) in the iNOS promoter in vitro and in living cells. XBP1S exhibits dose-dependent activation of iNOS-specific reporter gene activity and endogenous iNOS expression. XBP1S is elevated whereas the unspliced form of XBP1, XBP1U, reduced in ER stress in HepG2 cells. In addition, XBP1U binds to XBP1S and this complex is associated with the iNOS promoter in response to ER stress. Furthermore, XBP1U acts as a negative mediator and suppresses XBP1S-mediated induction of iNOS. Collectively, we present the first evidence demonstrating the regulation of iNOS gene induction by the interaction between the spliced and unspliced forms of XBP1 in response to ER stress.
