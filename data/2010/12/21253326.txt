Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is a rare form of primary liver cancer composed of cells with histopathologic features of both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). Because of its low incidence, the information on clinical outcomes of cHCC-CC is very limited and there are no published reports describing non-surgical treatment options for cHCC-CC. We report a case of cHCC-CC exhibiting a favorable response to systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cisplatin. A 62-year-old man who recurred after a right lobectomy for cHCC-CC received sorafenib for palliative systemic therapy, but follow up imaging studies showed disease progression. He received 2nd line chemotherapy with doxorubicin at 60 mg/m(2) together with cisplatin at 70 mg/m(2). After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, a computed tomography scan of the chest showed markedly decreased size and number of the multiple lung metastases. After completing 8 cycles of 2nd line therapy, we changed the regimen to a fluorouracil (5-FU) mono therapy because of the toxicities associated with doxorubicin and cisplatin. To date, the patient has completed his 15th cycle of 5-FU mono therapy with the disease status remaining stable during 18 months of follow-up.
