Background:Thrombomodulin (TM) is a key molecule mediating circulation homeostasis through its binding to thrombin. The TM-thrombin complex can activate protein C and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor to form a tight clot. In many cancer tissues, decrease of TM expression may correlate with cancer metastasis. However, the role of TM in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression is still unclear.Methods:We characterized TM expression in HCC cells (HepJ5 and skHep-1 cells) using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. We then manipulated TM expression using both TM-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and overexpressing it in HCC cells. Transwell migration assay was performed to monitor the migratory ability of HCC cells under different levels of TM expression.Results:We found that TM was ectopically highly expressed in skHep-1 at both transcriptional and translational levels. After silencing TM expression in skHep-1 cells, we found that metastatic capability was dramatically increased. Conversely, overexpression of TM in HepJ5 cells decreased metastatic ability. We investigated the possible mechanism and found that decreased TM-mediated enhancement of cell migration was dependent on upregulation of ZEB1, a repressor of E-cadherin.Conclusions:TM may be a modulator of cancer metastasis in HCC. Downregulation of TM expression may increase ZEB1 and decrease E-cadherin levels.
