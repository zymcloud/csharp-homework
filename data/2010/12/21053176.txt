Focal, segmental, and diffuse liver pathologies have been described in the literature. This article describes a pattern in which liver pathology is confined to a lobe. This lobar pattern has not been described previously to our knowledge. Herein, we illustrate computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of diffuse lobar involvement patterns in various liver conditions. Diffuse lobar involvement can be observed in benign (steatosis, hepatic iron overload, cholestasis, perfusion alterations, infarction, alveolar hydatid cysts, trauma, and hemangiomas) and primary malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma) pathologies. Diffuse lobar involvement in metastatic disease appears to be rare. Due in part to their potentially unusual appearances, the diagnosis of lobar pathologies using imaging can be challenging, and entities with lobar patterns can cause diagnostic confusion. Liver MRI can be used as a problem-solving tool for diffuse lobar pathologies detected on ultrasonography and CT. Inand out-of-phase MRI can help in the assessment of lobar fat accumulation.
