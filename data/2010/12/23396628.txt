Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with a high incidence of postoperative recurrence, despite high rates of complete necrosis with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and curative hepatic resections (HR). The aim of this study was to identify intraoperative ultrasound patterns observed during HR or RFA that predicting intrahepatic HCC recurrence.Materials and methods:From January 1997 through August 2008, we treated 377 patients with HCC (158 with HR and 219 with surgical RFA). All patients underwent intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) examination. Primary HCCs was classified according to diameter, HCC pattern (nodular or infiltrative), echogenicity (hyper- or hypo-), echotexture (homogeneous or inhomogeneous), capsular invasion, mosaic pattern, nodule-in-nodule appearance, and infiltration of portal vessels. Number of HCC nodules was also considered. Comparisons between the groups of possible factors for intrahepatic recurrence of treated tumors were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test.Results:Patients were followed for 9-127 months (median: 18.6 months), and intrahepatic recurrence was observed in 198 (52.5%). In 138 patients (36.5%), recurrences were located in different segments with respect to the primary tumor. In 60 HCC tumors (16%), local recurrences were found in the same segment as the primary tumor. At univariate analysis, primary HCC echogenicity and mosaic pattern were the only factors not significant associated with intrahepatic recurrences.Conclusion:IOUS is an accurate staging tool for use during "surgical" resection or RFA. This study shows that IOUS patterns can also be used to estimate the risk of post-treatment HCC recurrence. In patients at high risk for this outcome, closer follow-up and use of adjuvant therapies could be useful.
