We report a case of a 70-year-old man with a large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) containing two pseudoaneurysms measuring up to 2 cm in diameter. The pseudoaneurysms and part of the HCC were supplied by branches from the middle colic artery, which arises from the superior mesenteric artery. This complex arterial vasculature was visualised on CT and confirmed with conventional angiography.
