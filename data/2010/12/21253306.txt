Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that has shown a survival benefit in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, and is considered to be generally safe. We treated a patient with interstitial lung disease that was associated with sorafenib therapy for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. A 74-year-old man with hepatitis-C-virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma was treated with sorafenib. After 8 days of sorafenib administration, he received radiation therapy for an intrahepatic tumor located in segment eight. On the 24th day of sorafenib treatment, the patient developed acute interstitial pneumonitis that rapidly improved after the discontinuation of sorafenib and treatment with high-dose steroids. This case alerts physicians to the possibility of sorafenib-induced interstitial lung disease.
