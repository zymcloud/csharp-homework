Minimally invasive approaches for small liver tumors are desirable. We describe a single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy (SILH) using total laparoscopic surgery (TLS) technique. SILH was performed to remove a solitary 2-cm hepatocellular carcinoma located at segment 3. The technique included a one-inch skin incision with three ports (one 12 mm and two of 5 mm each). The liver was sealed and dissected by three different devices: Harmonic scalpel, TissueLink sealing dissector, and Endoclip. Operation time was 70 minutes and blood loss was trivial. The patient required no analgesia postoperatively and walked unaided the next day. Various aspects of the procedure were not different from TLS. SILH is a safe procedure with several advantages. The procedure is promising as minimally invasive liver surgery.
