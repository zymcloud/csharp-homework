Fluvastatin, a lipophilic statin, was known to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in many cancer cells. Its potential anticancer was evaluated in three hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H). Cells were treated with fluvastatin in vitro and its effect on cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasion and apoptosis was determined. Mechanism of apoptosis induced by fluvastatin on HCC cell lines was also investigated through western blotting and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis. It was observed that fluvastatin inhibited proliferation of HCC cells by inducing apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. The results of cell invasion assay revealed that fluvastatin significantly decreased the invasion potency of HCC cells. A mitochondria-operated mechanism for fluvastatin induced apoptosis might be involved and was supported by Western blotting and MMP analysis. After fluvastatin treatment, expression of Bcl-2 and procaspase-9 were downregulated, cytochrome c (cytosolic extract), Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression were increased. Furthermore, a breakdown of MMP in HCC cells was observed. To conclude, these results have provided a rationale for clinical investigations of fluvastatin in future as a potential anticancer reagent for growth control of HCC.
