Despite the fact that malignancies are associated with hematological abnormalities, some clinical studies have been unable to detect such a relation. The aim of our study was to detect the prevalence of pretreatment hematologic abnormalities in patients with common solid tumors and to determine if such a profile could be used for prognostic evaluations. We identified all patients in Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen University who were diagnosed as solid tumors (breast carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, gastric cancer, cervical carcinoma, endometrial cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer) between January 2000 and August 2009. All subjects were investigated regarding levels of white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin concentration. We identified 3,180 patients with solid tumors and 285 patients with benign diseases for the final analysis. The percentages of leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis in patients with solid tumors ranged from 4.0% to 25.6%, 3.3% to 29.2%, and 2.1% to 9.7%, respectively. The multivariate Cox analysis revealed that anemia was an independent prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer (P = 0.006), hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.002), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (P = 0.008), and esophageal carcinoma (P = 0.001). Leukocytosis was an independent prognostic factor in patients with cervical cancer (P = 0.007). The incidence of hematological abnormalities in Chinese patients with solid tumors was relatively lower than that of the counterparts in the Western countries. A pretreatment anemia or leukocytosis can serve as a useful marker to predict outcome of patients in some of the solid tumors.
