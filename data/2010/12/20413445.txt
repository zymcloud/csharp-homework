The purpose of this study was to determine the percentage of signal intensity loss (PSIL) threshold for the characterisation of focal liver lesions among patients with chronic liver disease. 55 nodules in 49 patients with chronic liver disease who underwent ferucarbotran-enhanced MR studies were included. Among the 49 patients, 40 had liver cirrhosis and 9 had chronic hepatitis. 8 haemangiomas, 3 focal nodular hyperplasia, 9 dysplastic nodules and 12 well, 19 moderately and 4 poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were revealed. The PSIL, signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio of each lesion type were calculated. The diagnostic performance of PSIL on ferucarbotran-enhanced T(2) weighted images (PSIL(T2WI)) and T(2) weighted fat-suppression images (PSIL(FS-T2WI)) that characterised hepatic tumours was compared with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Using ROC analysis, the diagnostic performance of PSIL(FS-T2WI) was superior to that of PSIL(T2WI) (p = 0.01). The mean PSIL(FS-T2WI) of the benign lesions was significantly higher than that of HCC (p
