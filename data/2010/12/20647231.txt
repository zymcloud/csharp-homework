The Japan Cancer Surveillance Research Group estimated the cancer incidence in 2004 as part of the Monitoring of Cancer Incidence in Japan (MCIJ) project, on the basis of data collected from 14 of 31 population-based cancer registries. The total number of incidences in Japan for 2004 was estimated as 623,275 (C00-C96). The leading cancer site according to the crude and age-standardized incidence rates was the stomach for men and breast for women. The apparent increase in age-standardized incidence rates in 2003 was calmed down in 2004.
