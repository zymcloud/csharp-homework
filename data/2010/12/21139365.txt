The patient was a 55-year-old man with a large hepatic tumor measuring 12 Ã— 12 cm in the left lobe. To obtain the histological diagnosis, the target liver biopsy was performed. Histologically, the tumor revealed as a neuroendocrine carcinoma. After the diagnosis, he received the chemotherapy (CTX) with etoposide and cisplatin. Serum levels of NSE and the tumor size were decreased after the first course of CTX. We here report a case of primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma treated with CTX following the diagnosis by the needle biopsy.
