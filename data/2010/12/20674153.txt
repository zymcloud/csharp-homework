In this study, the anticancer effect of icariin, a natural flavonol glycoside, against human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Icariin triggered the mitochondrial/caspase apoptotic pathway indicated by enhanced Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase cascade. Moreover, icariin induced a sustained activation of the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) but not p38 and ERK1/2, and SP600125 (an inhibitor of JNK) almost reversed icariin-induced apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. In addition, icariin provoked the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SMMC-7721 cells, while the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine almost completely blocked icariin-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that icariin induces apoptosis through a ROS/JNK-dependent mitochondrial pathway.
