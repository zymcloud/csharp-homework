The capacitive-resistive electric transfer (CRet) therapy is a non-invasive technique that applies electrical currents of 0.4-0.6 MHz to the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. Although this therapy has proved effective in clinical studies, its interaction mechanisms at the cellular level still are insufficiently investigated. Results from previous studies have shown that the application of CRet currents at subthermal doses causes alterations in cell cycle progression and decreased proliferation in hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) and neuroblastoma (NB69) human cell lines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antiproliferative response of HepG2 to CRet currents. The results showed that 24-h intermittent treatment with 50 ÂµA/mm(2) current density induced in HepG2 statistically significant changes in expression and activation of cell cycle control proteins p27Kip1 and cyclins D1, A and B1. The chronology of these changes is coherent with that of the alterations reported in the cell cycle of HepG2 when exposed to the same electric treatment. We propose that the antiproliferative effect exerted by the electric stimulus would be primarily mediated by changes in the expression and activation of proteins intervening in cell cycle regulation, which are among the targets of emerging chemical therapies. The capability to arrest the cell cycle through electrically-induced changes in cell cycle control proteins might open new possibilities in the field of oncology.
