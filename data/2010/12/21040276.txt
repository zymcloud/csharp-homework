Aim:The impact of serological HBsAg- and anti-HBc+ on the prognosis of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is unknown. We conducted a systematic review to analyze whether anti-HBc positivity imposes any effect on the course of HCV-related chronic liver disease.Methods:We retrieved references from online databases that included PubMed and EMBASE. Data were gathered with regard to demographic information, disease progression and prognosis, and the results of serological tests. The development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was the endpoint of follow-up of all cohort studies.Results:Eighteen references were included in this study, of which four were cohort studies. Twelve studies were retrospective, observational and non-interventional studies. According to our meta-analysis, the rate of serological HBsAg- and anti-HBc+ was higher among HCC patients compared with non-HCC patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.22-1.98). HCV patients that were anti-HBc+ had a greater chance of developing HCC than their anti-HBc- counterparts (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.34-3.47).Conclusions:The serological status of HBsAg- and anti-HBc+ appears to be correlated with a poor prognosis for chronic HCV infection. Though the general quality of these references was low, and multiple confounding factors existed, the likelihood of a poorer outcome of HCV patients that are positive for anti-HBc should be considered by their physicians.
