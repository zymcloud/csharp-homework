Breast cancer consists of a heterogeneous group of diseases, with a number of tumor-specific and patient-specific factors, which influence response to therapy and survival. Ixabepilone is a member of a novel class of antineoplastic agents, the epothilones, that has demonstrated activity in a number of human solid tumor types and is the first agent in this class to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer, that is resistant/refractory to anthracyclines, taxanes, and/or capecitabine. Both retrospective and prospective studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ixabepilone in various populations. The role of ixabepilone in poor prognosis subgroups of the metastatic breast cancer population is reviewed in this article.
