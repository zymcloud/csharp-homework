Objective:To explore the effect of neamine on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in H7402 human hepatoma cells.Methods:This study was conducted at the Institute of Genetics and Cytology, School of Life Science, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China between October 2008 and February 2010. First, we employed the MTT (thiazol blue tetrazolium bromide) and soft agar assay to detect the effect of neamine on cell proliferation, and investigated the migration and invasion by using a transwell assay in H7402 cells. We, then, investigated nuclear translocation of angiogenin by immunofluorescence staining. Finally, we stable transfected H7402 cells with the plasmids pCI-Ang (+) and pCI-Ang (-), which contain the entire coding region of human angiogenin in the sense and antisense orientations, to obtain angiogenin under-expressing/over-expressing transfectants, and investigated the effect of neamine on angiogenin induced cell proliferation.Results:The results showed that neamine positively inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of H7402 cells. Nuclear translocation of angiogenin was blocked by neamine, and angiogenin-induced cell proliferation was inhibited by neamine.Conclusion:Neamine positively inhibited H7402 cells. Since the toxicity of neamine is much less than neomycin, and is close to that of streptomycin and kanamycin, it may serve as a lead agent for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutics.
