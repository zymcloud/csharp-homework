Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are one of the representative components of host antitumor immune responses. Both the quality and quantity of TIL determine the effect of the antitumor immune reaction. Previous studies have indicated that patients with cancers showing massive infiltration of CD8(+) T cells generally have a better clinical outcome. Conversely, patients with marked infiltration of immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells tend to have a worse prognosis for several types of cancer. The density and distribution of TIL are also strongly affected by the trafficking route. Tumor-associated blood vessels in various cancers are structurally and functionally abnormal, and such abnormal vessels reportedly become an obstacle for infiltration of immune effector cells into tumors. Recently, understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lymphocyte trafficking has progressed rapidly. This review focuses on the mechanisms of lymphocyte trafficking to tumor cells and also discusses the importance of blood vessel for TIL trafficking, especially in relation to hepatocarcinogenesis.
