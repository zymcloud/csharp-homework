Sorafenib, a new antiangiogenic and antiproliferative agent, is currently used for hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma. We report here the case of a patient with two cancers, a locally advanced cancer of the piriform sinus and a hepatocellular carcinoma, who was given sorafenib. Tumor response of both cancers might suggest that sorafenib could be effective against head and neck cancer.
