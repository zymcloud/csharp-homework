The membrane traffic system has been recognized to be involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression in several types of tumors. α-taxilin is a newly identified membrane traffic-related molecule, and its up-regulation has been reported in embryonic and malignant tissues of neural origin. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of α-taxilin in relation to clinicopathological features of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and proliferative activity of the tumor determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index (PCNA-LI). Twenty-nine surgically resected nodules of HCC (8 well-, 11 moderately-, and 10 poorly-differentiated) were studied. Fifteen cases showed 'strong staining', while 14 cases showed 'weak staining' for α-taxilin. A significantly higher expression of α-taxilin was observed in less-differentiated (p=0.005), and more invasive (p=0.016) HCCs. The 'strong staining' group showed significantly higher PCNA-LI than the 'weak staining' group (the medians of PCNA-LI were 59.4% vs. 14.4%, p
