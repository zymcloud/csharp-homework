Objective:To explore the clinical values of laser ablation as a new treatment for portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).Methods:A total of 43 male patients with primary liver carcinoma (PLC)-associated PVTT were randomized into a laser ablation group and a radiotherapy group. The laser ablation group of 21 cases received direct percutaneous laser ablation under ultrasonographic guide, followed by direct injection into the portal vein with chemotherapy drugs including mitomycin C (MMC) and fluorouracil (5-Fu). The radiotherapy group of 22 cases was treated with X-ray in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) once a day for a total of 10 days course. After the treatment, all patients were followed for postoperative adverse reactions, changes of tumor thrombus, and survival time.Results:In comparison with the radiotherapy, laser ablation resulted in decreased postoperative complications such as limb fatigue, ascites, upper gastrointestinal ulcer, and bleeding. The overall remission rates (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR]) were 61.9% (13/21) and 31.8% (7/22) in the laser ablation and radiotherapy group, respectively, with a significant difference (P Conclusion:Percutaneous laser ablation to PVTT is an effective, safe, and simply procedure and has proven to offer significant clinical outcomes in the treatment of PLC-associated PVTT.
