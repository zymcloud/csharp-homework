The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic-assisted radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma above the age of 60 years. A single-center, retrospective study of a prospective dataset evaluated efficacy and morbidity of RFA in patients above 60 years of age. About 37% of patients had an intrahepatic recurrence 1 year after ablation. By multivariate analysis, only the number of lesions ablated was a predictor of recurrence (P=0.007). Overall mortality was 19% at 1 year and factors associated with mortality include elevated Î±-fetoprotein, number of lesions ablated, and platelet count. Complications occurred in 10% of our population with 1 death. RFA is well tolerated in patients of 60 years of age and above. The outcomes in this study validate a local ablative strategy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in the elderly and it is superior to no treatment alone.
