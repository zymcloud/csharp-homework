We have investigated the potential in vivo anti-tumour activity of corilagin using the Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and an athymic nude mice xenograft model. The purity of corilagin was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatographic analysis. Corilagin was administrated intraperitoneally for a continuous period of 7 days at a concentration of 15 mg/kg of body weight per day. A significant inhibition of tumour growth was observed when treated mice are compared with control groups. Furthermore, analysis of enzymes markers of liver function, including alanine aminotransferase and asparate aminotransferase, suggested that current therapeutic dosage of corilagin did not exert adverse effect on liver. Our observations support the view that corilagin is considerably effective to retard the in vivo growth of xenografted Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma.
