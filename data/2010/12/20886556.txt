Background and objectives:Identification and characterization of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can determine putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and provide a variety of molecular markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate LOH status on chromosomes 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 17p, and to explore their clinical significances in HCC post-liver transplantation.Methods:A total of 37 patients with HCC who underwent liver transplantation were enrolled. LOH was examined using 34 microsatellite markers located on 4q13-3q5, 6q27, 8p22-p23, 9p21-p22, and 17p12-p13.Results:The frequency of LOH at each microsatellite locus ranged from 23% to 75%, with a mean value of 53.1%. Frequencies of LOH on 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 17p were 62% (23 of 37), 30% (11 of 37), 49% (18 of 37), 46% (16 of 35), and 68% (25 of 37), respectively. LOHs on certain chromosomal regions were significantly associated with age, AFP level, tumor size, tumor multiplicity, histological grade, and metastatic recurrence.Conclusions:LOH on 17p13.1 correlated to metastatic HCC recurrence, while LOH on 4q and 8p was found to be associated with progression of HCC. Thus, potential novel biomarkers or TSGs for prognosis and treatment of HCC may harbor on these regions.
