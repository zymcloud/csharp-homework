A case is presented of a 67-year-old male patient with atypical non-small cell lung cancer, where inguinal lymph node metastases were the first sign of disease relapse. The patient had a long-term smoking history of 30 cigarettes per day, with no other important personal or family medical history data. Because of prolonged cough, the patient underwent diagnostic procedure, which revealed squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (stage IIIB, T3N2M0). Concomitant radiochemotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy according to PE protocol was administered. Multislice computed tomography performed upon chemotherapy completion showed almost complete tumor regression and withdrawal of mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and the patient felt well. However, in the next few months, enlarged lymph nodes appeared in both inguinal regions. Histopathologic analysis revealed metastatic lung cancer. Four months after the presentation of enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, lung cancer metastases were also diagnosed in the liver and lumbosacral spine. Despite additional treatments, the patient died four months later. Although it is well known that inguinal lymph nodes can harbor lung cancer metastases, in our patient inguinal lymph node metastases were the first sign of lung cancer relapse.
