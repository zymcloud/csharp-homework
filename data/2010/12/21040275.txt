Aim:We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the efficacy of combination therapy with radiotherapy (RT) and zoledronic acid for bone metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, we investigated the efficacy of zoledronic acid for non-irradiated bone metastases.Methods:This study consisted of 31 patients who had received RT for bone metastases. Twelve of these patients with 23 sites of bone metastases were also treated with zoledronic acid (Z group). In the Z group, 14 sites received RT and nine sites did not. Nineteen patients with 38 sites of bone metastases were not treated with zoledronic acid (non-Z group). In the non-Z group, 22 sites received RT and 16 did not. We compared survival, pain response, time to pain progression, radiographic response, time to radiographic progression, and safety between groups.Results:While pain response rates were similar between the two groups, time to pain progression rates of irradiated and non-irradiated bone metastases was significantly lower in the Z (0% and 20% at 6 months, respectively) than in the non-Z group (34% and 66% at 6 months, respectively) (P = 0.045 and P = 0.005). Further, while radiographic response rates were similar between the two groups, time to radiographic progression rate of non-irradiated bone metastases was significantly lower in the Z (29% at 3 months) than in the non-Z group (91% at 3 months) (P = 0.009). No significant side-effects were documented.Conclusion:Zoledronic acid delayed the pain progression of both irradiated and non-irradiated bone metastases and the radiographic progression of non-irradiated bone metastases from HCC.
