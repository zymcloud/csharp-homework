Purpose:To evaluate the origins of feeders of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the caudate lobe (S1).Materials and methods:Eighty-eight HCCs (mean diameter 21.4 mm) were treated by chemoembolization. The tumor-feeding caudate artery was confirmed when a tumor stain was demonstrated on angiogram and iodized oil was accumulated into the HCC and S1 on computed tomography (CT). The origins were divided into R(1) (right proximal), R(2) (right distal), L(1) (left proximal), L(2) (left distal), A (anterior segmental), P (posterior segmental), M (middle hepatic or medial segmental), Ph (proper hepatic), Ch (common hepatic), and Ex (extrahepatic). The origins of feeders supplying HCCs in the Spiegel lobe (SP; n = 36), the paracaval portion (PC; n = 38), and the caudate process (CP; n = 14) were also analyzed.Results:One hundred sixteen feeders were identified: 11 (9.5%) arose from R(1); 21 (18.1%) arose from R(2); nine arose (0.9%) from L(1); 15 (12.9%) arose from L(2); 24 (20.7%) arose from A; 25 (21.6%) arose from P; seven (6.0%) arose from M; one (0.9%) arose from Ph; and three (2.6%) arose from Ex. HCCs in the SP and the PC were fed by feeders from both hepatic arteries (the ratios of right to left were 3:2 and 3:1, respectively), and HCCs in the CP were dominantly fed by feeders from the right hepatic artery.Conclusion:The caudate artery most frequently arises from the right hepatic artery, followed with almost equal frequency by the left hepatic, the anterior segmental, and the posterior segmental artery. The origins of the caudate arteries differ according to the subsegmental locations.
