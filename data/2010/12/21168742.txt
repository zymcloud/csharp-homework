Sorafenib has been approved for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are no data reported on its use in HCC patients with localized disease who have undergone orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Herein, we have reviewed our initial experience with 7 HCC patients who were candidates for OLT and were treated with sorafenib. Treating liver transplant patients with sorafenib appeared to be safe based upon our limited experience. There is a strong need for clinical trials to comprehensively study the safety of sorafenib before OLT.
