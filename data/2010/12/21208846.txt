Purpose:This pilot clinical trial explored the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of regional hepatic therapy combined with systemic anticancer agents in patients with refractory solid tumors and extensive unresectable liver involvement, including those with compromised hepatic function.Patients and methods:Six patients with colorectal (N = 3), ovarian (N = 2), and hepatocellular carcinoma (N = 1) received intra-arterial hepatic oxaliplatin followed by intravenous 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and bevacizumab every 2 weeks until disease progression. All had extensive liver metastases; four had elevated baseline serum total bilirubin. Median total bilirubin was 2.8 mg/dL (range, 0.2-5.2 mg/dL). Median Child-Pugh score was 7 (range, 5-10).Results:Thirty treatments were delivered (2-7 per patient). Median age of patients was 57 years (range, 25-69 years). Three patients (1 with colorectal, 1 with hepatocellular, and 1 with ovarian cancer) attained partial responses. Two had failed previous oxaliplatin and cisplatin treatment. Some with elevated bilirubin at baseline had a significant drop in bilirubin with treatment (bilirubin 5.2 → 1 mg/dL, 4.8 → 1.1 mg/dL, and 5.2 → 1.8 mg/dL). The regimen was generally well tolerated; the most common side effects were grade 1 fatigue, anorexia, and/or hypertension. One patient died of enzyme-linked, immunoassay-confirmed, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia during the sixth cycle of therapy.Conclusion:At doses tested, this regimen was safe and demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with advanced refractory malignancies involving the liver, including those with hepatic insufficiency. Further study is warranted.
