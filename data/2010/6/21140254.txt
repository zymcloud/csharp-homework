We established an in vitro 3-D model of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by culturing MHCC97H cells on molecular scaffolds within a rotating wall vessel bioreactor. Morphological and biochemical analyses revealed that the 3-D HCC model mirrored many clinical pathological features of HCC in vivo, including cancer cell morphology, tissue ultrastructure, protein production and secretion, glucose metabolism, tissue-specific gene expression, and apoptosis. Xenografts into livers of nude mice resulted in tumorigenesis and distant metastasis. This 3-D HCC spheroid is a promising model for HCC tumor biology, anticancer drug screening, and for the establishment of HCC animal models.
