Background:The prognostic value of c-erbB-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is unclear. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship of c-erbB-2 and VEGF with the clinicopathological parameters and the survival results in CLM.Methods:For 44 patients who had undergone liver resection for CLM at Fudan University Cancer Hospital from 2000 to 2007, the expression of c-erbB-2 and VEGF in CLM and the corresponding primary cancer specimens were evaluated immunohistochemically. The correlations among c-erbB-2 and VEGF, clinicopathologic factors, and survival were then statistically analyzed.Results:Positive expression rates of c-erbB-2 and VEGF in CLM lesions were 38.64% and 52.72%, respectively. The expression of c-erbB-2 and VEGF in CLM were similar to that of corresponding primary tumor. c-erbB-2 expression correlated with number of metastatic lesions and the distribution of liver metastases. The expression of VEGF correlated with the size of liver metastatic lesion and distribution of liver metastases. A statistically significant association between the expression of c-erbB-2 and VEGF in both CLM and primary tumor was noted. Univariate analysis showed that VEGF was a prognostic factor. However, on multivariate analysis, expression of VEGF was not an independent prognostic marker. Patients with both negative expression of c-erbB-2 and VEGF expression had a better outcome than others.Conclusions:VEGF might be a statistically significant prognostic factor. The combined analysis of c-erbB-2 and VEGF is of added prognostic value. An association exists between c-erbB-2 and VEGF. However, further studies are required to confirm this issue.
