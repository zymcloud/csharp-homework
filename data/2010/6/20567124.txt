A 65-year-old woman who had diffuse hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)with tumor thrombus of right portalvein(Vp3) and lung metastases(Stage IVB)was treated by single-agent therapy with tegafur/uracil(UFT). As a result, primary and metastatic tumors were not recognized by diagnostic imaging, with a noted decrease of AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II. Generally, oral chemotherapy for HCC is not recommended because of the low response rate. However, there have been some reports including the present case which have showed a marked response with UFT. We thus conclude that UFT can be an option with low risk of crucial adverse effects in the treatment of selected HCC patients.
