Surgical resection has been considered to be the best treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, in recent years, there has been growing interest in the therapy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This meta-analysis is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of those 2 therapeutic methods. Outcomes evaluated were death rate, complications, survival rates, recurrence-free survival rates, and recurrence. Primary authors were contacted to retrieve further information if necessary. There is no significant difference in death rates of the treatment of HCC in the groups of hepatectomy and RFA, although the recurrence of HCC may be lower in the hepatectomy group. In the group of RFA, the recurrence rate in the previous site was higher but was lower in the new area, whereas it seems equal in the extrahepatic area. RFA may have comparable results with surgical resection in patients in the therapeutic effect of ablation for the treatment of HCC, if recurrence of HCC after RFA could be timely detected and effectively treated.
