We report a unique case of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in an ectopic liver rest in the left renal hilum masquerading as a left adrenal tumor. Adrenal tumors have been reported within adrenal rests inside the liver but hepatocellular carcinoma in ectopic liver rests in the adrenal area is an extremely rare entity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report from the Indian subcontinent to describe this event in the English literature.Our patient, a sixty-year-old, non-diabetic, non-hypertensive male, presented with a history of left flank pain for the past six months. He was a chronic smoker and also consumed excessive amounts of alcohol. He had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and was hepatitis B surface antigen positive. A contrast enhanced computer tomography scan of the abdomen showed an 8×8×8 cm, well-defined, heterogeneously enhancing mass with central necrosis, in the left suprarenal region. The provisional diagnosis of an adrenal tumor was made and open transperitoneal excision of the tumor along with two enlarged lymph nodes was done. Immunohistochemistry staining of the specimen revealed it to be a primary hepato cellular carcinoma. The patient died within six months of surgery owing to extensive metastases. We concluded that chronic hepatitis B infection and chronic and excessive alcohol consumption and/or chronic smoking may have been the predisposing factors for the occurrence of primary hepatocellular carcin oma in the liver rest in our patient. The prognosis appears to be poor despite surgical management.
