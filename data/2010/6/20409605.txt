Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis strongly depends upon nuclear grade and the presence of microscopic vascular invasion (MVI). The aim of this study was to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) that is able to predict tumour grade and MVI on the basis of non-invasive variables.Methods:Clinical, radiological, and histological data from 250 cirrhotic patients resected (n=200) or transplanted (n=50) for HCC were analyzed. ANN and logistic regression models were built on a training group of 175 randomly chosen patients and tested on the remaining testing group of 75. Receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) and k-statistics were used to analyze model accuracy in the prediction of the final histological assessment of tumour grade (G1-G2 vs. G3-G4) and MVI (absent vs. present).Results:Pathologic examination showed G3-G4 in 69.6% of cases and MVI in 74.4%. Preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), tumour number, size, and volume were related to tumour grade and MVI (pConclusion:ANN identifies HCC tumour grades and MVI on the basis of preoperative variables more accurately than the conventional linear model and should be used for tailoring clinical management.
