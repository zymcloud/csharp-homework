The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vivo antitumor effects of liquiritigenin (LQ) on H(22) Hepatocarcinoma. After mice were administrated liquiritigenin (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) intragastrically for 15 days, tumor volume, indices of thymus and spleen, MDA level in serum, optical microscopy, electron microscopy were determined. We have found that LQ had inhibitory effects on transplanted tumors and that the middle dose of LQ was more effective than the others. All LQ groups could increase thymus weight but it had no obvious effect on the spleen. MDA content decreased with LQ treatment but there wasn't a significant difference. In the group treated with LQ, we observed that the nuclei changed markedly and had ultrastructural morphological changes to apoptosis. The study supports that LQ significantly inhibits the growth of H(22) in vivo, and might be a promising antihepatoma agent.
