Background:Hepatic cryosurgery is an alternative therapeutic choice for patients who are not eligible for surgical liver resection. As this procedure sometimes causes postoperative bleeding tendency, we investigated indication of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) after this surgery.Methods:We measured pre- and postoperative platelet counts, coagulation profile and postoperative pain with IVPCA in 8 patients.Results:Platelet counts decreased from 9.83 +/- 5.38 (x 10(3) x ml(-1)) to 5.91 +/- 4.56 (x10(3) x ml(-1)) postoperatively (PConclusions:Considering the risk of bleeding tendency and epidural hematoma, we recommend IVPCA with opioid for postoperative pain in patients after hepatic cryosurgery instead of epidural analgesia and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
