Improvements in the field of transplant immunosuppression (IS) have led to significant advances in long-term survival of liver transplant recipients. Despite this progress, survival rates vary depending on recipient, donor and/or perioperative factors. Tailoring IS based on recipient factors is of growing interest among health care providers involved in the care of organ transplant recipients. To date there is no consensus document addressing individualized IS therapy for liver transplant recipients. This review will discuss the information available on the effect of the various IS drugs on recipient-based factors such as age, ethnicity, and liver disease etiology.
