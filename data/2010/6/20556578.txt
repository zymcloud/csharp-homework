The study investigated the effects of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN) on the proliferation and apoptosis of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (SMMC-7721 cells) in vitro. HSP70 oligonucleotide was transfected into SMMC-7721 cells by the mediation of Sofast transfection reagent. Inhibition rate of SMMC-7721 cells was determined by using MTT method. Apoptosis rate and cell cycle distribution were measured by flow cytometry. Immunocytochemistry staining was used to observe the expression of HSP70, Bcl-2 and Bax. The results showed that HSP70 ASODN at various concentrations could significantly inhibit the growth of SMMC-7721 cells, and the inhibition effect peaked 48 h after transfection with 400-nmol/L HSP70 ASODN. Cytometric analysis showed the apoptotic rate was increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in the HSP70 ASODN-treated cells. The percentage of cells in the G2/M and S phases was significantly decreased and that in the G0/G1 phase increased as the HSP70 ASODN concentration was elevated and the exposure time prolonged. Immunocytochemistry showed that treatment of SMMC-7721 cells with HSP70 ASODN resulted in decreased expressions of HSP70 and Bcl-2 proteins, and an increased expression of Bax protein. It was concluded that the HSP70 ASODN can inhibit the growth of the SMMC-7721 cells and increase cell apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of HSP70. HSP70 ASODN holds promise for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
