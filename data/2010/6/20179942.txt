Objective:To investigate the value of computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging for assessment of angiogenesis in liver cancer.Methods:Twenty-one patients with histologically proven liver cancer underwent CT perfusion examination. We compared the following perfusion parameters in the tumour area versus the non-tumour area: total blood flow (TBF), hepatic arterial perfusion (HAP), hepatic portal perfusion (HPP) and hepatic arterial perfusion index (HAPI). Slices of postoperative specimen were stained with haematoxylin-eosin and anti-CD34 immunohistochemistry. The slices were evaluated with emphasis on the CD34-positive neovasculature in the tumour parenchyma. Tumour microvascular density (MVD) was calculated according to the Weidner method. Pearson correlation was used to detect correlations between tumour MVD and tumour perfusion parameters.Result:TBF and HPP in the tumour area were lower than in the non-tumour area (P < 0.05). HAP and HAPI in the tumour area were higher than those of the non-tumour area (P < 0.05). TBF and HAP in the tumour area correlated with MVD in the tumour (P < 0.05), with correlation coefficients of 0.849 and 0.829, respectively.Conclusion:CT perfusion imaging can quantitatively assess the blood supply and its distribution in liver cancer. TBF or HAP may be a useful parameter in assessing angiogenesis of liver cancer.
