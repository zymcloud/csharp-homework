Background:Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is dependent on the presence of fiducial markers for target localization and tracking. EUS-guided placement of fiducial markers with a 19-gauge needle has been reported. However, the size and stiffness of the 19-gauge needle may compromise the safety and ease of fiducial placement.Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of EUS-guided placement of thin flexible gold coil fiducials by using a 22-gauge needle.Design:Retrospective study.Setting:Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, between December 2008 and November 2009.Patients:A total of 30 patients with GI malignancies of the mediastinum and upper abdomen who were to undergo IGRT.Interventions:EUS evaluation with a curvilinear-array echoendoscope was performed. The target lesion was identified, a 22-gauge needle preloaded with a gold coil fiducial was inserted into the lesion, and the fiducial was deployed under EUS guidance.Main outcome measurements:Technical success was defined as the ability to place fiducials in the desired location. Immediate and delayed complications were also noted.Results:A total of 69 fiducials were placed in 12 different sites in the mediastinum and upper abdomen. Technical success was achieved in 29 out of 30 cases (97%). No intraprocedural complications were encountered. One patient developed a fever and abnormal liver function tests 12 hours after fiducial placement.Limitations:Retrospective design, small case series.Conclusions:EUS-guided placement of thin flexible gold coil fiducials by using a 22-gauge needle is both safe and feasible for upper GI malignancies.
