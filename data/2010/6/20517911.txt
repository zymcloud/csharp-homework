(18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has recently been shown to be able to predict a poor outcome after liver transplantation (LT) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are few reports on the usefulness of PET during follow-up after LT. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the detection of HCC recurrence after LT. From February 2005 to December 2008, out of 93 adult LT cases (91 living donors and 2 deceased donors), 10 patients who showed HCC recurrence and received (18)F-FDG PET/CT during follow-up were included. The accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT was assessed with imaging and histological studies. The most common sites of recurrence were extrahepatic (60%). The most common extrahepatic sites were the lungs and bone (31.3% each). Among 4 patients with intrahepatic recurrence, 1 patient (25%) was positive according to (18)F-FDG PET/CT. The detection rate of (18)F-FDG PET/CT was 92.9% for extrahepatic metastases >or= 1 cm and 0% for lesions
