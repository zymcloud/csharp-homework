Objective:To study the anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo and mechanism of DHA compound.Methods:Cervical cancer cell line HeLa cells, glioma cell line U251 cells and mouse hepatoma H(22) tumor were used in this study. Transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were used to observe the morphological changes of cell apoptosis. Western blot was used to detect the expression of caspase-3. RT-PCR was used to determine the effect on Bcl-2 and Bax mRNA transcription in U251.Results:Antitumor effect was observed in vivo and in vitro. Typical morphological changes were seen in cancer cells. The level of caspase-3 was significantly increased and the content of Bcl-2 mRNA was decreased significantly, while the content of Bax mRNA was significantly increased in the U251 cells after treatment with DHA compound.Conclusion:DHA compound can inhibit the growth of some types of tumors and the increase of caspase-3 and Bax mRNA and decrease of Bcl-2 mRNA may be involved in its mechanism of action.
