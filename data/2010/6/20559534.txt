Cures for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) are rare and difficult. We report a case of pathologically confirmed complete remission of HCC induced by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). A 45-year-old male patient had a massive HCC in the right lobe of the liver and tumor thrombus in the right and main portal veins. He achieved a partial response after two cycles of HAIC with 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)). After the completion of six cycles he received a curative partial hepatectomy, and histopathology revealed complete necrosis without any viable tumor cell. He was in good health at a 4-month follow-up. These results suggest that this regimen is a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of advanced HCC with PVTT.
