Human nuclear respiratory factor 2 alpha subunit (NRF-2α) is fundamentally important to cell function and the development. We aimed to establish the monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the human NRF-2α protein and to investigate its distribution in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and tumor-adjacent tissues. The 6× His-NRF-2α fusion protein was successfully induced and purified. One monoclonal antibody (MAb) against human NRF-2α, 1-D10-E1-B11-G3 (IgG1), effective in detecting the recombinant and the cellular protein, was characterized. Using immunohistochemical analysis, the expression of NRF-2α was investigated in 38 cases of HCC specimens and 14 cases of tumor-adjacent specimens. Staining was found positive in 9 cases of HCC tissues (23.7%) and 8 cases of normal hepatic tissues (57.1%). The higher-grade frequency of expression of NRF-2α in tumor-adjacent tissues was significantly higher (P
