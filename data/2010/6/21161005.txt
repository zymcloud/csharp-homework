To investigate the simultaneous occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we report the case of a 70 year old patient with a primary diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2002. In a routine follow up investigation of his chronic lymphocytic leukemia a newly detected mass in the Couinaud's segments 2 and 3 was found. No hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus infection or cirrhosis was evident. After laparoscopic segmentectomy the histological examination revealed a hepatocellular carcinoma. While the relation between liver parenchyma damages and hepatocellular carcinoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is well known, only a few publications have focused on the coexistence of hepatocellular carcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. With this case we demonstrate the coexistence of these diseases without having a predamaged liver parenchyma.
