Hepatocellular carcinoma most often metastasizes to the lungs, abdominal lymph nodes, or bone. The identification of extrahepatic metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma to the sinonasal region has rarely been reported. We report a case of a 49 year-old man with a history of stage IV hepatocellular carcinoma presenting with two adjacent pigmented lesions on the tip of his nose. Initial pathological staining identified the lesion as a primary melanoma. However, upon further examination with the chemical markers CEA, CAM 5.2, and Keratin, it was determined that the lesions were consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. This case highlights a potentially rare situation of mistaking a liver metastasis for a malignant melanoma.
