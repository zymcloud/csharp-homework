Much research has been directed at improving the effectiveness of the radiofrequency (RF) ablation of hepatocellular carcinomas. In that point of view, this study was performed to provide comprehensive information of the relation between RF waveforms and thermodynamic response of the tissue with the consideration of four different types of RF waveforms (half-sine, half-square, half-exponential, and damped-sine) to maximize the amount of tumor tissue removed while maintaining the advantages of RF ablation. For the aim of this study, finite element models incorporating results from previous numerical models were used and validated with ex vivo experiments. From analyses of the entire results, we concluded that this study may prove valuable as a first step in providing comprehensive information of the relation between various RF waveforms and thermodynamic responses within the tissue during the RF ablation process. This study may also contribute toward studies to determine an optimum RF waveform capable of maximizing the amount of tumor tissue removed while maintaining the advantages of RF ablation.
