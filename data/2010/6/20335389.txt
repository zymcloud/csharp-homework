The EP1 prostanoid receptor is one of four subtypes whose cognate physiological ligand is prostaglandin-E2 (PGE(2)). It is in the family of G-protein-coupled receptors and is known to activate Ca(2+) signaling, although relatively little is known about other aspects of E-type prostanoid receptor (EP) 1 receptor signaling. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing human EP1 receptors, we now show that PGE(2) stimulation of the EP1 receptor up-regulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), which can be completely blocked by pertussis toxin, indicating coupling to G(i/o). This up-regulation of HIF-1 alpha occurs under normoxic conditions and could be inhibited with wortmannin, Akt inhibitor, and rapamycin, consistent with the activation of a phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, respectively. In contrast to the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of HIF-1 alpha, which involves decreased protein degradation, the up-regulation of HIF-1 alpha by the EP1 receptor was associated with the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), suggesting activation of the ribosomal S6 kinases and increased translation. Stimulation of endogenous EP1 receptors in human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells recapitulated the normoxic up-regulation of HIF-1 alpha observed in HEK cells, was sensitive to pertussis toxin, and involved the activation of mTOR signaling and phosphorylation of rpS6. In addition, treatment of HepG2 cells with sulprostone, an EP1-selective agonist, up-regulated the mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C, a HIF-regulated gene. HIF-1 alpha is known to promote tumor growth and metastasis and is often up-regulated in cancer. Our findings provide a potential mechanism by which increased PGE(2) biosynthesis could up-regulate the expression of HIF-1 alpha and promote tumorigenesis.
