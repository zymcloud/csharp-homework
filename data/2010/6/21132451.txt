Background:This study evaluated the efficacy of combined 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) α-2b in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Fifty patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis were enrolled. Of these, 21 patients were treated using subcutaneous administration of PEG-IFNα-2b and intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU (5-FU/PEG-IFN group), 12 patients were treated using intramuscular administration of IFNα-2b and intra-arterial infusion of 5-FU (5-FU/IFN group), and 17 patients received intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy with lipiodol-cisplatin (CDDP) suspension (CDDP group).Results:The objective early response rate was significantly higher in the 5-FU/PEG-IFN group than in the 5-FU/IFN or CDDP groups (71.4 vs. 8.3% and 17.6%, respectively; P Conclusion:Although a prospective randomized controlled trial using a larger population of patients with advanced HCC is needed to evaluate combination therapy with 5-FU and PEG-IFNα-2b, this new combination therapy may be useful for patients with advanced HCC.
