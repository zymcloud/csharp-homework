Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis associated with liver steatosis, commonly evolving to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there are around 170 million chronic HCV carriers worldwide. The virus has a highly variable sequence, allowing definition of seven genotypes with different geographical distributions. Both clinical outcome and response to antiviral therapy are strongly influenced by HCV genotype. Importantly, several recent papers have suggested that the lipid profile of infected patients is strongly indicative of the various clinical outcomes of HCV infection. Furthermore, viral molecular and cellular studies have shown a tight link between cellular lipid metabolism and almost every step of the HCV infectious cycle. In the present review we summarise the current knowledge establishing the interplay between the molecular features of HCV replication, the cellular lipid biology and the lipid profiles observed in the serum of infected patients.
