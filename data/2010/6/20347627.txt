Background:A common G to A polymorphism (G870A) in the splice donor region of exon 4 of cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene generates two mRNAs (cyclin D1a and D1b) through an alternative splicing at the site of this polymorphism. Cyclin D1a and b proteins differ in their COOH-terminus, a region involved in protein degradation. We examined the association between this CCDN1 genotype and the susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Turkish population.Methods:The genotype frequency of this polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Hospital-based case-control study was designed consisting of 160 diagnosis subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma and 160 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol status.Results:The allele frequencies of case subjects (A, 0.55; G, 0.45) were significantly different from those of control subjects (A, 0.42; G, 0.58) (p=0.002). The odds ratios (ORs) for the CCND1 870 GA and AA genotypes when compared with the GG genotypes were 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-2.36, p=0.22) and 2.52 (95% CI 1.38-4.62, p=0.003) respectively. The presence of at least one CCND1 870A allele was associated with increased risk for HCC (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.06-2.82, p=0.03). When combining the GG and GA genotypes as a reference genotype, we found that the OR for the AA genotype was 2.06 (95% CI 1.24-3.44, p=0.006).Conclusion:Our results suggest that the CCND1 G870A single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of HCC in our Turkish population.
