Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurs frequently after minimally invasive therapy. Adoptive immunotherapy is considered helpful in lowering recurrence and metastasis rates of malignant tumors. In this study, we report the combination of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and autologous RetroNectin activated killer (RAK) cells in the treatment of HCC patients with a tumor size less than 4 cm. Autologous RAK cells were transfused via an intravenous drip into the patients. Flow cytometry was used to assess the change of percentages of lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of the patients. Computed tomography was used to observe the tumor recurrent conditions of patients by every 2 m. During a seven-month follow-up, no severe adverse events, recurrences or deaths were observed in all 7 HCC patients. These preliminary results suggest the feasability and safety of the combined therapeutic regimen for HCC, and that the RAK cell adoptive immunotherapy might be helpful in preventing recurrence in HCC patients after RFA.
