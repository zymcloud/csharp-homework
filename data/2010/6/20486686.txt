Curcumin (CUR), a natural polyphenol isolated from tumeric ( Curcuma longa ), has been documented to possess antioxidant and anticancer activities. Unfortunately, the compound has poor aqueous solubility, which results in poor bioavailability following high doses by oral administration. To improve the solubility of CUR, we developed a novel curcumin nanoparticle system (CURN) and investigated its physicochemical properties as well as its enhanced dissolution mechanism. Our results indicated that CURN improved the physicochemical properties of CUR, including a reduction in particle size and the formation of an amorphous state with hydrogen bonding, both of which increased the drug release of the compound. Moreover, in vitro studies indicated that CURN significantly enhanced the antioxidant and antihepatoma activities of CUR (P
