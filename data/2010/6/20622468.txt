Rat hepatoma H4IIE cells were stimulated with dexamethasone and dibutyryl cAMP to increase gene expressions of gluconeogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Inclusion of catechin-rich green tea beverage (GTB) in the culture medium reduced the up-regulation of these genes as well as that of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha) gene. GTB was fractionated into chloroform-soluble (Fraction I), ethyl acetatesoluble (Fraction II), methanol-soluble (Fraction III) and residual (Fraction IV) fractions. Fractions II and III containing catechins caused an attenuation of the up-regulated expression of these genes as well as the down-regulation of HNF4alpha gene expression. Fraction IV had a synergistic effect on the up-regulation by dexamethasone/dibutyryl cAMP of the PEPCK gene expression and upregulated HNF4alpha gene expression. These results suggest that GTB down-regulated the expression of the HNF4alpha gene to cause the down-regulated gene expression of gluconeogenic enzymes. One reason why GTB did not down-regulate hepatic PEPCK gene expression in previous animal experiments may be that the component(s) acting to up-regulate PEPCK gene expression was more effective in vivo than in cultured cells.
