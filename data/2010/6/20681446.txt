Background and objective:Phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) is a newly identified protein-tyrosine phosphatase, which belongs to phosphatase of regenerating liver family, and plays a role in promoting tumor metastasis; Ras homologue C (RhoC) belongs to Rho subfamily of small-molecule G protein superfamily. However, the mechanisms of PRL-3 and RhoC are unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the expressions of PRL-3 and RhoC proteins and their correlation to invasion and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which may provide experiment evidence of the mechanism of PRL-3 in tumorigenesis and tumor-development.Methods:Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expressions of PRL-3 and RhoC in NSCLC in 92 cases, and statistical methods were used to analyse statistical significances of their expressions in different groups and their correlation.Results:The positive rates of PRL-3 and RhoC expressions in NSCLC were 69.6% (64/92) and 73.9% (68/92), respectively, and the expressions of PRL-3 and RhoC were closely correlated with TNM stage and lymphatic metastasis and pleural metastasis (P < 0.01), and they were correlated with each other (r = 0.754, P < 0.001).Conclusion:The expressions of PRL-3 and RhoC are higher in the higher TNM stage and lymphatic metastasis and pleural metastasis cases, and closely correlate with each other in NSCLC, which suggests that PRL-3 and RhoC might be in the same signal pathway and PRL-3 might promote the distant metastasis of cancer cell by RhoC and downstream factors.
