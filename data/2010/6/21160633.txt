Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has become one of the major research subjects in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology. The basic concept of CAD is to provide computer output as a second opinion to assist radiologists' image interpretations by improving the accuracy and consistency of radiologic diagnosis and also by reducing the image-reading time. To date, research on CAD in ultrasound (US)-based diagnosis has been carried out mostly for breast lesions and has been limited in the fields of gastroenterology and hepatology, with most studies being conducted using B-mode US images. Two CAD schemes with contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) that are used in classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) as liver metastasis, hemangioma, or three histologically differentiated types of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are introduced in this article: one is based on physicians' subjective pattern classifications (subjective analysis) and the other is a computerized scheme for classification of FLLs (quantitative analysis). Classification accuracies for FLLs for each CAD scheme were 84.8% and 88.5% for metastasis, 93.3% and 93.8% for hemangioma, and 98.6% and 86.9% for all HCCs, respectively. In addition, the classification accuracies for histologic differentiation of HCCs were 65.2% and 79.2% for well-differentiated HCCs, 41.7% and 50.0% for moderately differentiated HCCs, and 80.0% and 77.8% for poorly differentiated HCCs, respectively. There are a number of issues concerning the clinical application of CAD for CEUS, however, it is likely that CAD for CEUS of the liver will make great progress in the future.
