This study was designed to examine the anticancer, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from Lycopus lucidus Turcz. var. hirtus Regel. The essential oil treatment to six human cancer cell lines resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The cytotoxicity of the essential oil on liver carcinoma and breast cancer cell lines was significantly stronger than on other cell lines. The essential oil can induce apoptosis of the liver carcinoma cell line Bel-7402 and decrease the intracellular GSH level. The antioxidant effect of the essential oil was evaluated by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenging assays. The essential oil exhibited moderate antioxidant activity. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against eight microorganisms using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The essential oil also showed moderate antimicrobial activity. These suggest that the essential oil could hold a good potential for use in the pharmaceutical industry.
