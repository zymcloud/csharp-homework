Objective:To evaluate the value of the gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced hepatobiliary-phase magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the differentiation of scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) with or without HCC.Materials and methods:We retrospectively evaluated unenhanced and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced dynamic and hepatobiliary-phase MR images of five patients with scirrhous HCCs and 29 patients with 57 CCs with or without HCC with statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test.Results:Peripheral hyperintensity compared with the center on T2-weighted images was more frequent for scirrhous HCCs (n = 3, 60%) as compared to CCs with or without HCC (n = 7, 12%) (P = 0.026). There was no significant difference in the gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced dynamic imaging of both scirrhous HCC and CC with or without HCC (P > 0.05). On hepatobiliary-phase images, scirrhous HCC showed no target appearance as compared with that 50 (87.7%) CCs with or without HCC showed target appearance (P Conclusion:Although both scirrhous HCC and CC with or without HCC show similar imaging findings on unenhanced and gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced dynamic MR images, gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced hepatobiliary-phase MR images may be helpful to differentiate scirrhous HCC from CC with or without HCC.
