Background:Characteristics of glucose metabolism disorders (GMDs) in different cancers and the contributory role of GMDs in developing cancers are still not so clear.Methods:Two thousand four hundred and five patients with malignancy who had been hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University were pooled as case group. Two thousand and sixteen non-cancer people who finished health examinations in the Affiliated Yangcheng Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College were enrolled as control group. We compared glucose metabolism among patients with different kinds of malignancy. Based on logistic regression models, we analyzed factors that affect the development of carcinoma.Results:(1) Among 2,408 malignancy patients, the total prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) reached 28.0%. Pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, liver cancer, leukemia, and colorectal cancer showed most striking hyperglycemia. (2) Leukemia and esophageal cancer accounting for 12.5% and 12.1%, respectively, were the most likely to suffer from hypoglycemia. (3) Older cancer patients seem to be more vulnerable to hyperglycemia, while the younger tend to be more likely to develop hypoglycemia. (4) High level of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was associated with lung cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, thyroid cancer, bladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Patients with DM increased risks for developing colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, thyroid cancer, cervical cancer, and pancreatic cancer.Conclusions:GMDs are frequent events in malignancy patients. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are found in the same kinds or different kinds of cancers, and the incidence of hyperglycemia is higher than that of hypoglycemia. Characteristics of GMDs were dissimilar in different cancers and different ages. Hyperglycemia was a risk factor for many cancers.
