Liver cancer is one of the most common neoplastic diseases with high mortality in China. Currently, antimicrotubule drugs such as paclitaxel (PTX) and vincristine (VCR), are used as the common agents in the clinical chemotherapy for liver cancer. However, the responses of patients to these drugs vary markedly. Successful identification of intracellular factors influencing liver cancer's sensitivity to antimicrotubule drugs would be of great clinical importance. In this study, by engineering human hepatoma cell HepG2 to overexpress synuclein-gamma (SNCG), we investigated if SNCG is a molecular factor associated with the sensitivity to antimicrotubule drug treatment. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting assays showed SNCG was successfully overexpressed in HepG2/ SNCG cells compared with HepG2/Neo cells. The overexpressed SNCG altered the proliferation activity in HepG2 cells, which was 66% higher than that of HepG2/Neo cells through MTT method. The overexpressed SNCG also reduced sensitivity of HepG2 cells to antimicrotubule drugs: after PTX or VCR treatment, the proportion of HepG2/SNCG cells in G2/M arrest was significantly lower than that in HepG2/Neo cells. Correspondingly, HepG2/SNCG cells showed significantly lower mitotic index than HepG2/Neo cells. Meanwhile, HepG2/SNCG cells showed higher resistance to PTX and VCR than HepG2/Neo cells, with resistance index 21 and 15 respectively. Our studies suggested that the overexpression of SNCG could confer resistance to antimicrotubule drugs in hepatoma cells; and it indicated that SNCG may be as a potential response marker for antimicrotubule drugs in liver cancer chemotherapy.
