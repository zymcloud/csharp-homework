Objective:To probe the relationship of clinical and pathological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the blood oxygen level by the technique of noninvasive magnetic resonance multi-echo R2*.Methods:Multi-echo R2* sequence was carried out pre-operatively in a total of 46 patients with pathologically proved HCC. The T2* and R2* values of HCC, liver, spleen and paraspinous muscle on T2* and R2* maps and the ratios of HCC to liver (H/L), spleen (H/S) and muscle (H/M) were calculated. Different groups were defined according to such clinical parameters as the serum AFP level, lesion dimension, Edmondson's grade, ascites, capsula, liver cirrhosis, intrahepatic daughter foci or tumor-emboli in portal vein respectively. The differences in T2* and R2* values and the ratios between different groups were analyzed.Results:In contrast with T2* value, the R2* value of HCC was less than that of liver or spleen (P 0.05).Conclusion:The blood oxygen level parameters, R2* and T2* values and the ratios are related to some clinical and pathological features of HCC. And the blood oxygen level is affected by multiple factors.
