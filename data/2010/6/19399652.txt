Golgi protein-73 (GP73) is a newly identified candidate serum marker for HCC, but GP73 study now is lesser in Asian population. The aims of this study were to determine how GP73 is detected in the serum of healthy, hepatitis B, cirrhosis and HCC by western blotting and RT-PCR, and to establish the sensitivity and specificity of serum GP73 protein and RNA for diagnosing HCC. Serum GP73 was detected by western blotting and RT-PCR, and quantified by densitometric analysis. GP73 was measured in serum from 124 patients with various forms of liver. AFP was tested using commercially available electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The median sGP73 in patients with HBV-related HCC was significantly higher (P
