Purpose:Apoptosis ligand 2/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL)-a member of the tumor necrosis factor cytokine family-induces apoptosis by activating the extrinsic pathway through the proapoptotic death receptors DR4 and DR5. Recombinant human Apo2L/TRAIL (rhApo2L/TRAIL) has broad potential as a cancer therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-human clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of multiple intravenous doses of rhApo2L/TRAIL in patients with advanced cancer.Patients and methods:This phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study treated patients with advanced cancer with rhApo2L/TRAIL doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg/kg/d, with parallel dose escalation for patients without liver metastases and with normal liver function (cohort 1) and for patients with liver metastases and normal or mildly abnormal liver function (cohort 2). Doses were given daily for 5 days, with cycles repeating every 3 weeks. Assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, pharmacokinetics, and imaging to evaluate antitumor activity.Results:Seventy-one patients received a mean of 18.3 doses; seven patients completed all eight treatment cycles. The AE profile of rhApo2L/TRAIL was similar in cohorts 1 and 2. The most common AEs were fatigue (38%), nausea (28%), vomiting (23%), fever (23%), anemia (18%), and constipation (18%). Liver enzyme elevations were concurrent with progressive metastatic liver disease. Two patients with sarcoma (synovial and undifferentiated) experienced serious AEs associated with rapid tumor necrosis. Two patients with chondrosarcoma experienced durable partial responses to rhApo2L/TRAIL.Conclusion:At the tested schedule and dose range, rhApo2L/TRAIL was safe and well tolerated. Dose escalation achieved peak rhApo2L/TRAIL serum concentrations equivalent to those associated with preclinical antitumor efficacy.
