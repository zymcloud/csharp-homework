The thyroid hormone T(3) regulates differentiation, growth, and development. We demonstrated that methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A) was positively regulated by T(3) identified by cDNA microarray previously. The expression of the MAT1A was upregulated by T(3) in hepatoma cell lines overexpressing thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). Additionally, these findings indicate that MAT1A may be regulated by CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). The critical role of the C/EBP binding sites was confirmed by the reporter or chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assay. In addition, C/EBP was upregulated in hepatoma cells after T(3) treatment and ectopic expression of MAT1A inhibited cell migration and invasion in J7 hepatoma cells. Conversely, knockdown of MAT1A expression increased cell migration. Together, these findings suggest that the expression of the MAT1A gene is mediated by C/EBP and is indirectly upregulated by T(3). Finally, TR was downregulated in a small subset of hepatocellular carcinoma cells concomitantly reduced the expression of C/EBPalpha and MAT1A.
