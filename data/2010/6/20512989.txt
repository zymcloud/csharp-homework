Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist have been shown to inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development, the role of PPARgamma in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of PPARgamma against HCC. PPARgamma-deficient (PPARgamma(+/-)) and wild-type (PPARgamma(+/+)) littermates were used in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC model and treated with PPARgamma agonist (rosiglitazone) or the vehicle alone for 8 months. The effects of PPARgamma on HCC cell growth and apoptosis were examined using PPARgamma-expressing adenovirus (Ad-PPARgamma). PPARgamma(+/-) mice were more susceptible to DEN-induced HCC than PPARgamma(+/+) mice (94% versus 62%, P Conclusion:Loss of one PPARgamma allele is sufficient to enhance susceptibility to HCC. PPARgamma suppresses tumor cell growth through reducing cell proliferation and inducing G(2)/M phase arrest, apoptosis, and up-regulating growth differentiation factor-15. Thus, PPARgamma acts as a tumor-suppressor gene in the liver.
