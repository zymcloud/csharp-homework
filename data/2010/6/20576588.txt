Metastatic liver disease is a challenging and life-threatening situation often with dismal prognosis. Nearly half of the patients with colorectal cancer develop liver metastasis during the course of their diseases. Hepatic resection is the treatment of choice in patients with colorectal liver metastasis. This study was conducted to compare the results of patients undergoing simultaneous liver and colorectal resection for synchronous liver metastasis and of those for whom a colorectal and liver resection was made separately. A retrospective analysis was performed on 1597 patients who underwent surgery because of colorectal cancer between January 1999 and December 2008. The results of the treatment were separately evaluated in case of the 152 patients who had liver metastasis. The proportion of the liver metastasis was 9.52%. The metastases arose in 40.8% from the rectum and in 31.8% from the sigmoid colon. It proved to be inoperable in 109 (71.7%) of the 152 patients who had liver metastasis. Simultaneous liver resection was performed because of synchronous metastasis in 14 (32.6%) cases (Group 1) and two step resection in 29 (67.4%) cases (Group 2). In case of synchronous operations only minor liver surgery was done. The mean size of the metastasis was 2.6 cm in diameter in Group 1 and 4.6 cm in Group 2 (p<0.005). The transfused blood volume was 0.3 U/patient. Only minor complications could be observed in Group 1. The hospitalization was 13.1 days in Group 1 and 11.7 days in Group 2. The mean survival time was 37.3 and 47.9 months (p<0.005). Simultaneous liver resection seems to be a safe procedure on those patients who develop small metastases with a limited number. However, the optimal timing of the liver resection and the identification of patients who will have the greatest benefit in survival still remain obscure.
