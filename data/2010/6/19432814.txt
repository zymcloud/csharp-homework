Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is a novel mitogenic growth factor that has been implicated in many different carcinomas. Its role in keloid biology has not yet been investigated. The present study is aimed at examining the role of HDGF in keloid pathogenesis. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analyses were used to examine in vivo localization and expression of HDGF in keloid and normal skin tissue. This was followed by the detection of HDGF expression in fibroblasts cultured in vitro and fibroblasts exposed to serum. To investigate the effect of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, a two-chamber system was employed in which keratinocytes on membrane inserts were co-cultured with the fibroblasts. HDGF expression levels in all cell extracts and conditioned media were assayed through Western blot analysis. In another set of experiments, the effect of exogenous recombinant HDGF on keloid fibroblasts (KF) and normal fibroblasts (NF) was examined. Cell proliferation was assessed by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and by quantifying proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. Downstream targets of HDGF were identified by detecting their expression through Western blot analysis. Our results indicate that there was an increase in HDGF expression in the dermis of keloid compared with normal skin tissue. The application of serum and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions did not seem to have any effect on intracellular HDGF expression levels. However, co-culturing keloid keratinocytes with KFs resulted in increased HDGF secretion when compared with monoculture or normal controls. Furthermore, treatment with exogenous recombinant HDGF was found to increase the proliferation of KFs, activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and up-regulate the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
