MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs with regulatory functions as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Recent studies have implicated that the rs11614913 SNP in MIR196A2 was associated with susceptibility of lung cancer, congenital heart disease, breast cancer and shortened survival time of nonsmall cell lung cancer. To assess whether this polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to and clinicopathologic characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a total of 560 patients with chronic HBV infection and 391 healthy volunteers were enrolled, and MIR196A2 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR). In our study group, there was no significant association between MIR196A2 polymorphism and the risk of HBV-related HCC in all subjects, however, the risk of HCC was significantly higher with MIR196A2 rs11614913 CC genotype or C allele compared with those with the TT genotype or T allele in male patients. Furthermore, in a subsequent analysis of the association between this polymorphism and clinicopathologic characteristics, there was still no significant difference in both the distribution of genotype or allelic frequency. However, we observed that the T allele was significantly more frequent in male HCC patients with lymphatic metastasis. Our results suggested that MIR196A2 polymorphism was associated with susceptibility to HBV-related HCC in a male Chinese population.
