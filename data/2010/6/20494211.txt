Background:The necessity of preserving hepatic venous drainage in hepatectomy and liver transplantation has recently been accepted; however, the hepatic vein (HV) can be removed when an effective intrahepatic venovenous shunt (VV shunt) exists.Methods:Occlusion venography of the right HV (RHV) was performed in 51 patients to investigate the VV shunt characteristics.Results:Twenty patients had a shunt between the RHV and large HVs whose root diameters were >3 mm, such as the superficial or inferior RHV, or the middle HV. Twenty patients had a shunt between the RHV and small HVs with root diameters Conclusion:A hemodynamically significant VV shunt between the RHV and large HV was observed in fewer than half of the patients and less frequently in cirrhotic patients. Preservation of hepatic venous drainage should be considered in patients without a hemodynamically significant VV shunt in liver surgery.
