Sorafenib has recently been shown to be effective for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in randomized controlled trials. Here, we report the experience with sorafenib in 25 patients with advanced HCC under daily practice conditions. Tolerance to sorafenib was acceptable and side effects were manageable, although the ECOG performance status was reduced in all patients. The most prevalent grade 2/3 side effects were fatigue (40%) and diarrhea (24%), and withdrawal from therapy occurred in 29% of patients. Disease stabilization was documented in 60% of patients. The median treatment time was 2.7 months and overall survival was 11.0 months. No significant serum alpha-fetoprotein decline was noted at the time of the first radiological control in a subgroup of patients with baseline levels >50 ng/ml who achieved stable disease. In conclusion, in daily practice sorafenib is safe and disease stabilization can be achieved in the majority of patients. However, intolerance to sorafenib can affect treatment adherence substantially.
