Liver cirrhosis is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, hence the need to screen those patients by means of liver ultrasound every 6 months. The differential diagnosis between a regenerative nodule, a dysplastic one and hepatocellular carcinoma is made based on a contrast imaging method (CEUS, MRI or CT) as they all have comparative sensitivities.
