Purpose:The aim of this study was to compare the safety and short-term efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using cisplatin-Lipiodol suspension (CP/Lp) with that using epirubicin-Lipiodol emulsion (EP/Lp) in patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:A total of 28 HCC patients were enrolled prospectively and assigned to the CP/Lp group or EP/Lp group. Adverse effects related to TACE were graded; and the treatment effect (TE) on HCC nodules at 3 months and overall tumor response at 6 months were assessed as the endpoint.Results:No significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the frequency of adverse effects of grade 3 or less. The TE rates for 100% necrosis plus >50% necrosis in 62 HCC nodules in the CP/Lp group and 75 HCC nodules in the EP/Lp group were 72.6% and 66.7%, respectively (P = 0.894). Overall tumor response revealed that six patients (50.0%) in the CP/Lp group and six patients (37.5%) in the EP/Lp group had a partial response plus a complete response, with no significant difference (P = 0.615). TACE-free control curves for both groups revealed no significant difference (P = 0.513).Conclusion:No significant difference was found with regard to adverse effects, the treatment effect on HCC nodules, or overall tumor response between the CP/Lp and EP/Lp groups.
