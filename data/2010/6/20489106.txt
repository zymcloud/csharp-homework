Objective:The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and significance of extravascular findings on CT angiography of the abdominal aorta and lower extremities.Materials and methods:Reports of CT angiograms of the abdominal aorta and lower extremities for 275 patients (164 men and 111 women; mean age, 72 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were scanned from the level of diaphragm to toes. Extravascular findings were classified into three groups-low, moderate, and high importance-on the basis of clinical significance. Low-importance findings were defined as those with little, if any, clinical significance. Moderate-importance findings were those that may not be clinically apparent but recognition of which could be beneficial at a later time. Highly important findings were defined as previously unknown results requiring further imaging or investigation. For highly important findings, electronic chart review determined the subsequent clinical course.Results:Highly important extravascular findings were found in 40 (15%) patients. Of 462 findings overall, 43 (9%) were of high importance, 77 (17%) were of moderate importance, and 342 (74%) were of low importance. The most common highly important findings were indeterminate lesions of kidney (n = 9), lung (n = 7), and liver (n = 6). Overall, eight (3%) of the 275 patients had findings of high clinical significance that resulted in medical therapy or surgical intervention, including lung carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, colon carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.Conclusion:Of patients undergoing CT angiography of the abdominal aorta and lower extremities, 15% had previously undiagnosed, highly important findings. Radiologists and referring clinicians should be aware of the frequency of these clinically significant extravascular findings at CT angiography.
