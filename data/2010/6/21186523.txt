Objective:To analysis the relationship between HBV BCP A1762T/G1764A double mutation with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF).Methods:HBV BCP A1762T/G1764A double mutation was detected in 166 HBV chronic infection patients by nested PCR and direct DNA sequencing. The mutation rate was compared among the patients with different disease course.Results:Among 166 patients, 45 patients, 45 patients, 49 patients and 27 patients were diagnosed as chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC), ACLF and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. A1762T/G1764A double mutation rate was 40.0% (18/45), 84.4% (38/45), 73.5% (36/49) and 92.6% (25/27) respectively in different groups. However, A1762T/G1764A double mutation rate has no difference between ACLF based on CHB and LC (P = 0.502) and between patients with HBeAg positive and negative (P = 0.735). HBV DNA level (log) of patients with A1762T/G1764A double mutation was 5.68 +/- 1.36, lower than but having no significant statistic difference compared to patients without the double mutation (6.14 +/- 1.81, P = 0.075).Conclusion:A1762T/G1764A double mutation has a close relationship with the progress of HBV-infection diseases, but is not specific to patients with ACLF. And patients with BCP double mutation have similar HBV DNA levels and HBeAg status with patients without the double mutation.
