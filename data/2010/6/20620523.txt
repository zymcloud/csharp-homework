Background:Insufficient data exist on the clinical course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in heart transplant (HT) recipients. Our study reports the outcomes of heart transplantation in pretransplantation HCV-positive (HCV+) recipients.Methods:A retrospective analysis of the heart transplantation database at our institution was performed to identify HT recipients who were HCV+ prior to transplantation. Chart reviews yielded demographic features, liver function tests, graft function, incidence of posttransplantation acute hepatitis and transplant coronary artery disease, and patient survival data.Results:Between 1995 and 2006, 10 HCV+ patients underwent cardiac transplantation. The recipient mean age was 47 years (range, 23-69). Seven recipients were males and 3 were females. At listing 9 patients had no cirrhosis. One patient with Child-B cirrhosis was listed for combined heart-liver transplantation. Two of 10 donors were known to be HCV carriers. Posttransplantation in-hospital survival rate was 100%. At a mean follow-up of 58 months (range, 1.6-145), 3 deaths occurred, yielding an overall survival rate of 70%. Only 1 death (10%) was linked to accelerated acute hepatitis. Transplant coronary artery disease was detected in 2 patients (20%). Echocardiograms of survivors at last follow-up revealed normal ejection fractions. In addition, there were no cases of hepatocellular carcinoma; all survivors were without evidence of hepatic dysfunction.Conclusions:Transplanting recipients known to have HCV did not seem to affect overall posttransplantation survival or to increase the risk of liver dysfunction or graft-related complications.
