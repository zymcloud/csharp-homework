Aim:A late evening snack (LES) is recommended for protein-energy malnutrition in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study investigated energy metabolism in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the effects of LES using a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-enriched nutrient in cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC undergoing hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC).Methods:Energy metabolism was measured using indirect calorimetry for 10 cirrhotic patients without HCC and 36 patients with various stages of HCC. Next, in 23 cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC undergoing HAIC, 13 patients received LES (LES group), and 10 patients received ordinary food (control group). Changes in energy metabolism and glucose tolerance were examined using indirect calorimetry and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and after 1 cycle of treatment.Results:Non-protein respiratory quotient (npRQ) was significantly lower in patients with advanced HCC than in cirrhotic patients without HCC, or in patients with early-stage HCC. In cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC undergoing HAIC, npRQ, BCAA/tyrosine ratio (BTR), and prealbumin and ALT levels were significantly improved in the LES group, but not in controls. In addition, area under the concentration curve for glucose (AUC glucose) tended to be improved in the LES group.Conclusions:LES using BCAA-enriched nutrients appears to improve energy metabolism and glucose tolerance in cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC undergoing HAIC.
