The purpose of this study was to assess the value of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) in predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) and survival after curative resection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Expression of CK19 and MMP-2 in tumor tissue was assessed through immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays (TMAs), which were constructed using samples from HCC patients with (n = 123) and without (n = 145) LNM. Positive CK19 expression was correlated with LNM (P
