Brucea javanica oil-loaded liposomes (BJOL) were prepared through thin film hydration method and characterized by transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry. Acute toxicity of B. javanica oil (BJO) in liposomes was assessed by determining the number of deaths of Kunming mice over intravenous treatment for 2 weeks. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the main active component (oleic acid) was studied in SD rats. The pharmacodynamics of BJOL was investigated using MMC-7721 cell lines and mice with Lewis lung cancer. The commercial emulsion of BJO (BJOE) was used as a reference. The data showed that BJOL had an average diameter of 108.2 nm with a zeta potential of -57.0 mV, drug loading of 3.60%, and entrapment efficiency of 92.40%. The area under curve of BJO in liposomes and emulsions were 2.31 and 1.15 mg min/ml, respectively. Compared with BJOE, mean residence time and elimination half-time (t(1/2)) increased 2.8- and 4.0-fold, respectively, and the clearance (CL) decreased 0.5-fold. In the acute toxicity test, the median lethal dose (LD(50)) of BJOE was 7.35 g/kg. In contrast, all mice treated with liposomes survived even at the highest dosage (12.70 g/kg). The IC(50) value of BJOL group was one third of that of BJOE group (p
