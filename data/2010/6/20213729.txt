Background and objectives:Vascular infiltration (VI) is an important prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and predictive parameters are necessary to preoperatively decide treatment strategies in patients with HCC.Methods:Relationships between presence and degree of VI in the portal and hepatic veins and bile duct, and post-hepatectomy survival were examined in 271 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy.Results:VI was observed in 81 patients (30%). Disease-free and overall survival rates was significantly lower in patients with VI than in patients without VI, and became poorer according to the degree of infiltration (P 5 mm than with shorter margins in patients who underwent non-anatomical resection.Conclusion:Adequate extent of operative procedures, but not limited resection with short margins, is useful when predictive parameters associated with VI are observed.
