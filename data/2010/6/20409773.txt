Background:The immune modulating molecules cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) have regulatory roles in cancer progression. There are conflicting data regarding the roles of these molecules in prostate cancer. To elucidate the prognostic impact of these proteins and provide information on prognosis and treatment, we compared the expression of COX-2, TGF-beta, and IL-10 in prostate cancer specimens with or without metastases. Ki67 was included as a measure of growth fraction of tumor cells.Methods:Digital video analysis images from tumor cell areas and tumor stromal areas were analyzed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded and immunohistochemical stained cancer specimens from 59 patients: 32 patients with metastases and 27 patients without clinical, biochemical, or radiological evidence of metastases within 10 years after diagnosis. The expression of COX-2 was scored as negative, weak, moderate, or strong. The expressions of TGF-beta and IL-10 were assessed as proportions of moderately or strongly stained cells. Ki67 was detected as strong nuclear staining in proliferating cells.Results:In primary cancers in the metastatic group, COX-2, TGF-beta and Ki67 were stronger expressed in epithelial tumor cell and tumor stromal areas compared with non-metastatic cancers (for all markers, p<0.0001). High intensity of COX-2 staining in tumor areas was strongly associated with death from prostate cancer in univariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI, 4.0 (1.1-14.5)). In multivariate analyses, the risk estimate was strengthened but did not reach significance. No associations to death were found for the other markers.Conclusion:High expression of COX-2, TGF-beta and Ki67 were in metastatic primary prostate carcinoma compared to non-metastatic cancers. High expression of COX-2 was associated to death from prostate carcinoma.
