Background & aims:Although CD133 expression is identified as a cancer stem cell marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the detailed characteristics of HCC cells expressing CD133 remain unclear.Methods:We examined the malignant characteristics of CD133-expressing HCC cells.Results:CD133-expressing cells could be detected with low frequency in 5 HCC tissues. We derived two different HCC cell lines by (1) transfection of CD133 siRNA in PLC/PRF/5 cells in (CD133si-PLC/PRF/5), and (2) by a magnetic cell sorting method that allowed to divide Huh7 cells into two CD133 positive (+) and negative (-) groups. CD133 knockdown in PLC/PRF/5 cells resulted in a decrease of the mRNA and protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)9. We next examined the malignant characteristics related to decreasing MMP-2 and ADAM9 in HCC cells. In CD133si-PLC/PRF/5 cells and CD133- Huh7 cells, invasiveness and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production, which are both related to the activity of MMP-2, were inhibited compared CD133-expressing HCC cells. We previously demonstrated that ADAM9 protease plays critical roles in the shedding of MHC class I-related chain A (MICA) which regulates the sensitivity of tumor cells to natural killer cells (NK). Decreasing ADAM9 expression in CD133si-PLC/PRF/5 cells and CD133- Huh7 cells resulted in an increase in membrane-bound MICA and a decrease in soluble MICA production. Both CD133si-PLC/PRF/5 cells and CD133- Huh7 cells were susceptible to NK activity, depending on the expression levels of membrane-bound MICA, but CD133-expressing HCC cells were not.Conclusion:These results demonstrate that CD133 expression in HCC cells confers malignant potential which may contribute to the survival of HCC cells.
