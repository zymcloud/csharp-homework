Objective:To obtain clinical and epidemiological information that could be relevant for the purpose of screening and diagnostic strategies in colorectal cancer (CRC).Patients and methods:A retrospective, descriptive, observational study was performed during a three year-period at the Hospital Provincial del Centenario in Rosario, Argentina. A population of symptomatic patients referred for colonoscopic examination was evaluated after the histopathologic diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma was made. A total of 1.543 colonoscopies was evaluated. Relevant information was retrieved from clinical records, and endoscopic, pathologic and tomography examinations.Results:Eighty six cases of CRC were diagnosed, with an incidence rate of CRC in the study population of 5.6%. Eighty six percent of patients were older than 50 years. Seventy five percent of tumors were located in the sigmoid colon and rectum. Synchronic lesions were found in 5.8% of tumor cases. Type 2 stenotic lesions were preferentially found in the left colon, whereas the site of most type 1 lesions was within the right colon. Most tumors (89.70%) were moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. The most frequent site of metastases was the liver (64%).Conclusions:In this population of symptomatic patients, 75% of colorectal tumors were found in the sigmoid colon and rectum, with 5.8% of cases showing a second, synchronous tumor. More than 80% of neoplastic lesions occurred in patients aged 50 or older and almost 90% were moderately well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. These data suggest guidelines for a proper strategy to prevent CRC.
