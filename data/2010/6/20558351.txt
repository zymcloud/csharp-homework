Hepatitis B virus is one of the most important etiologic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma. The present review discusses the molecular mechanisms of virus-induced carcinogenesis, indirect and direct effects of the infection. The cell damage-evoked regeneration and proliferation, as well as the viral proteins that induce chromosomal, genetic and epigenetic changes, play a key role in the multistep process leading to malignant cell transformation. Integration of HBV DNA in to the host DNA, activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes are of basic significance. The hepatitis B virus related complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma can be prevented by vaccination or eradication of the virus with antiviral therapy.
