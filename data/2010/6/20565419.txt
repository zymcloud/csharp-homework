Treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a significant problem for clinicians. Sorafenib, the only approved agent, improves survival rate, but is associated with a low tumor response rate. Alternative approaches for the treatment of advanced HCC are urgently needed. Hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy (HAIC) is a promising modality for the treatment of advanced HCC. Since its introduction, there have been improvements in implantable pumps, in catheter implantation and in the convenience and safety of HAIC in general. Numerous clinical studies have shown that HAIC provides moderate therapeutic efficacy with substantially favorable toxicity profiles in selected patient groups with advanced HCC. However, the lack of large randomized studies means that HAIC is not yet a well-established treatment for advanced HCC. We believe there is an urgent need for the further investigation of HAIC for the treatment of advanced HCC.
