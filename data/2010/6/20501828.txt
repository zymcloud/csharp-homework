MicroRNAs (miRNA) have rapidly emerged as modulators of gene expression in cancer in which they may have great diagnostic and therapeutic import. MicroRNA-199a-3p (miR-199a-3p) is downregulated in several human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we show that miR-199a-3p targets mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and c-Met in HCC cells. Restoring attenuated levels of miR-199a-3p in HCC cells led to G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest, reduced invasive capability, enhanced susceptibility to hypoxia, and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These in vitro findings were confirmed by an analysis of human HCC tissues, which revealed an inverse correlation linking miR-199a-3p and mTOR as well as a shorter time to recurrence after HCC resection in patients with lower miR-199a-3p expression. These results suggest that tactics to regulate mTOR and c-Met by elevating levels of miR-199a-3p may have therapeutic benefits in highly lethal cancers such as HCC.
