Dolabellane diterpenoids, (1R,3E,7E,10S,11S,12R)-dolabella-3,7-dien-10,18-diol (1), (1R,3S,7E,11S,12R)-dolabella-4(16),7-dien-3,18-diol (2), (1R,7E,11S,12R)-18-hydroxydolabella-4(16),7-dien-3-one (3), (1R,3S,4S,7E,11S,12R)-3,4-epoxydolabella-7-en-18-ol (4), and (1R,3R,7E,11S,12R)-dolabella-4(16),7,18-trien-3-ol (5), were obtained from the ornamental plant Aglaia odorata. Their structures were characterized on the basis of spectroscopic analyses and further confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Compounds 1 and 5 showed weak cytotoxicity against the human myeloid leukemia HL-60, hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721, and lung cancer A-549 cells.
