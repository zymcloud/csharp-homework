Objective:To evaluated the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with intraperitoneal saline infusion.Background:Ultrasound-guided RFA is not always feasible due to the tumor location, possible adjacent tissue damage or poor sonographic identification.Patients and methods:Ultrasound-guided RFA with intraperitoneal saline infusion was performed in 116 patients between June 2001 and March 2008.Results:The overall technical feasibility of the intraperitoneal saline infusions was 90.5% (105 patients). The purposes of the intraperitoneal saline infusion were achieved in 100 patients (86.2%) by visualizing the tumor located in hepatic dome (47 patients), prevent adjacent organ damage (42 patients) and withdrawing overlying omentum (10 patients). Complete ablation of tumor was accomplished in 102 patients (87.9%). Complications associated with the treatment occurred in seven patients (6.0%). There was no case of adverse event directly related to intraperitoneal saline infusion.Conclusions:Intraperitoneal saline infusion is an effective and safe procedure that can be used to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound-guided RFA.
