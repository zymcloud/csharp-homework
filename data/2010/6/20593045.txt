Background and aims:The role of angiogenesis in progression and metastasis of gastric cancer has been studied over the last years. The aim of our study was to assess the microvessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in correlation with prognosis, survival and the risk for upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as well.Method:We prospectively assessed angiogenesis in 40 patients with gastric carcinoma. Microvessel density was calculated using CD31 and CD34 markers, and VEGF expression was assessed in biopsy samples. The tumor stage was established using imaging methods: CT scan for M and N stage and endoscopic ultrasound for T and N stages. The correlation between pathological markers and tumor stage, survival rate and risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was assessed.Results:The study included 40 patients with gastric cancer; among them 8 patients presented with upper GI bleeding. The average microvessel density was 10.21 for CD31 and 11.85 for CD34 in all patients VEGF was positive only in 45% of patients. The microvessel density was higher in patients with advanced TNM stage, and a correlation with the risk of UGIB and survival rate was also found. VEGF expression correlated with TNM stage and with the risk of upper GI bleeding.Conclusions:Microvessel density (estimated by CD34) was involved in locally advanced disease, while VEGF was correlated with loco-regional extension and distant metastasis in gastric cancer patients. There was a clear correlation between angiogenic parameters, survival rate and the risk of upper GI bleeding.
