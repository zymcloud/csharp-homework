Objectives:To screen differential proteins in serum from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients by Proteomic Technology and to purify and identify them.Methods:Surface enhanced laser desorption Ionization time of flight-mass spectrum (SELDI-TOF-MS) was employed to screen differential proteins in serum from 33 HCC patients and 33 control cases, and then to purify and identify them using isoelectric precipitation, Tricine sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE) and high performance liquid chromatography tandem Mass Spectrum (HPLC-MS).Results:65 protein peaks in the range of relative molecular weight from 2,000 to 10,000 were found significant difference (P less than 0.05) between the patient group and control group. Based on these differential protein peaks, diagnostic model for HCC detection was established and its sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 96.97% respectively. Proteins with 8,706.5 and 8,579.2 relative molecular weights (the t value was 2.562 and 2.783 respectively, and P value was 0.013 and 0.015 respectively) out of the 65 differential proteins were purified and identified, and then recognized as Apolipoprotein AII (Apo AII).Conclusion:Apo AII is probably a differential protein of HCC and maybe related to the pathogenesis of HCC.
