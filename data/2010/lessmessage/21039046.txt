Purpose:There is a lack of an overview of overall and site-specific cancer incidence time trends in Vietnam, especially for the period after the year 2000. This paper aims at describing the development of cancer incidence for some cancer sites during 1993-2007.Methods:The Age Standardized Rate (ASR) of cancer incidence data from population based cancer registries of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh and Cantho cities were used to analyze temporary trends of cancer incidence by site, age and sex group.Results:The ASR of cancer incidence increased from 151.1/10⁵ in the period 1993-1998 to 160.0/10⁵ in the period 2006-2007 for males and from 106.8/10⁵ to 143.9/10⁵ for females. By age, the highest ASR was found in the group of 75+ years in males and between 70-74 years in females, with ASRs of 1,109/10⁵ and 619/10⁵, respectively (2006-2007). Lung remains the most frequent site, followed by stomach and liver in males. In females, the most commonly affected site has shifted from cervix uteri in 1993-1998 to breast in recent years, followed by stomach and lung. Increasing trends were observed in incidence rates of 21 out of 34 cancer sites in males and 27 out of 35 cancer sites in females.Conclusion:Cancer incidences in general have continuously increased during 1993-2007. More efforts should be concentrated on developing and implementing tobacco-related cancer prevention interventions.
