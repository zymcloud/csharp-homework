Radiation therapy (RT) has been emerging as one of the palliative treatments for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, hepatic toxicity is a major obstacle in radiotherapy for HCC. The purpose of this study is to identify proteins indicating radiation-induced hepatic toxicity in cirrhotic rats, which can be used as possible biomarkers. Liver cirrhosis was induced in Wistar rats with thioacetamide (TAA) 0.3 g/L in drinking water for 9 weeks. The development of liver cirrhosis was observed histologically. Radiation hepatic injury was induced by treating 1/3 of the liver with 10 Gy single dose radiation. To find out commonly expressed proteins, liver tissue and serum were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. Identified proteins were validated using western blotting. Histological examination showed that the degree of hepatic fibrosis increased by radiation in liver cirrhosis. It was associated with a decrease in the proliferation of cell nuclear antigen and an increase of apoptosis. The proteomic analysis of liver tissue and serum identified 60 proteins which showed significant change in expression between the TAA-alone and TAA-plus-radiation groups. Among these, an increase of heparanase precursor and decrease of hepatocyte growth factor were shown commonly in liver tissue and serum following radiation. Hepatic fibrosis increased following radiation in cirrhotic rats. These proteins might be useful in detecting and monitoring radiation-induced hepatic injury.
