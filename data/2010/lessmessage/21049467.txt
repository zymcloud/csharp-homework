Introduction:Calcitonin is a very sensitive marker of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). High concentrations of basal or pentagastrin stimulated calcitonin in patients with MTC is a signal of recurrence or metastatic disease. Detection of metastatic foci remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of the study was to present examples of the use of ⁶⁸Ga-DOTA-TATE PET-CT examinations in the diagnosis of patients with MTC and concomitant elevated serum calcitonin concentrations. Initially the study involved eight patients with MTC and elevated basal or stimulated calcitonin, in which earlier diagnostic imaging was negative for metastasis: neck ultrasound, chest and mediastinal CT scan, liver MRI, bone scintigraphy, and ¹⁸F-FDG-PET. A total body scan was performed using ⁶⁸Ga-DOTA-TATE PET-CT. Two patients with positive diagnostic imaging tests were referred for surgery including resection of cervical lymph nodes with histopathological examination for assessment of metastases.Conclusions:On the basis of the presented cases we conclude that PET-CT scan with somatostatin analogue labelled with gallium (⁶⁸Ga-DOTA-TATE PET-CT) may be useful in the diagnostic imaging of patients with disseminated MTC.
