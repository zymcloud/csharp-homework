The incidence of obesity worldwide has increased dramatically during recent decades. As a consequence, obesity and associated co-morbidities constitute a serious threat in public health. Substantial epidemiologic evidence indicates that obesity is associated with increased risk of death, and increased incidence and progression of several cancers. Particular attention will be brought here to digestive and liver cancers. Plausible mechanisms by which obesity might participate to increased promotion and progression of cancer will be developed including hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and the pro-oxidative pro-inflammatory milieu characterizing the metabolic syndrome. We will focus on the specific case of hepatocellular carcinoma since the highest increase in mortality in obese individuals has been observed for this malignancy. Epidemiological evidence will be reviewed. We will next attempt to offer explanation for the higher risk of HCC in obese individuals although, at this point in time, we have insufficient knowledge to point towards the preeminence of factors directly related to obesity or more tightly linked to NASH itself, the underlying liver disease.
