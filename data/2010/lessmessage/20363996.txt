We describe the palliative therapy for multiple metachronous oral metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma in a 72-year-old patient with emphasis on maintaining oral functions by local debulking procedures in due consideration of the dissemination of the neoplasm to multiple organs. The first oral metastasis was the first evidence of multiple tumor spread after partial hepatectomy. Palliative chemotherapy with sorafenib was cancelled after three weeks due to tumor progression and hemiplegia following brain metastasis and stroke. Periodical screening of the patient for oral findings allowed the non-mutilating excision of further oral metastases at an early stage with no signs of local recurrence during the follow-up period. Oral metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma appear to occur more frequently than formerly supposed.
