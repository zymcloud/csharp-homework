Aims and background:Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is increasingly used in the clinic because it promotes the synthesis of proteins. However, rhGH is able to increase malignant transformation and tumor recurrence. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of rhGH on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells with positive and negative growth hormone receptors (GHR) in order to guide its clinical application.Methods and study design:Cells of the human HCC cell lines Bel-7402 (GHR+) and SMMC-7721 (GHR-) as well as human umbilical vein endothelial cell line ECV304 cells in the exponential growth phase were harvested and divided into experimental and control groups. After the human HCC cells were cultured alone or co-cultured with ECV304 cells under the different treatments, cell cycle phase, proliferation index, and expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and proteins were determined.Results:In the Bel-7402 GHR+ cells treated with rhGH, both the percentage of cell in G2-M phase and the proliferation index were higher than those of controls (P 0.05). Although there was no difference in the cell doubling times between ECV304 cells co-incubated with Bel-7721 GHR-cells treated with rhGH and without rhGH, the doubling times of ECV304 cells co-incubated with Bel-7402 GHR+ cells, when treated with rhGH, were significantly shortened compared to those of controls (P Conclusions:rhGH can induce VEGF secretion and stimulate proliferation of Bel-7402 GHR+ cells in vitro, but has little effect on the proliferation of SMMC-7721 GHR-cells, suggesting that rhGH may be applied safely to treatment for the catabolic state in patients with GHR-negative HCC.
