The case of a 72-year-old male patient with HCC is presented in whom percutaneous RFA was used as the sole first-line anticancer treatment, since he denied having partial hepatectomy. The patient underwent RFA two more times, at 1.5 years for treating a local tumor progression at the initial ablation site and at 11 years after the first session for treating a new remote intrahepatic recurrence. He revealed a long-term survival of more than 12 years so far and still remains in excellent clinical status.
