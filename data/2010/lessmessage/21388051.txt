Aims and background:The objective of this case-control study was to test the existing hypotheses about factors related to the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the population of Belgrade (Serbia).Methods and study design:The investigation was conducted between 2004 and 2007 and consisted of 45 newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma patients and 90 individually gender- and age-matched hospital controls. Conditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied.Results:A highly statistically significant association (P = 0.001) was demonstrated between hepatocellular carcinoma and HBsAg positivity and the presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies. Diabetes mellitus was significantly (P = 0.018) associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. A statistically significant inverse association was shown between low parity and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.033). The risk increased significantly with a longer history of cigarette smoking (P = 0.044), as well as the daily consumption of hard liquor (P = 0.049). A weekly intake of fish (P = 0.003) and yogurt (P = 0.003) and daily intake of boiled vegetables (P = 0.001) were reported more frequently by controls than hepatocellular carcinoma cases. In the current study, a high intake of salty food also significantly increased the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.027). Based on multivariate analysis, the presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies (OR = 24.6, P = 0.001) and duration of smoking > or =25 years (OR = 3.8, P = 0.020) were significantly related to hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas the daily consumption of boiled vegetables (OR = 0.1, P = 0.011) was inversely associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusions:The findings obtained in the current study support the hypotheses that non-viral factors, such as lifestyle factors, reproductive factors, and a history of diabetes, might be involved in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma.
