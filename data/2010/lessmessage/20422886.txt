Background/aims:The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of tumor size as a predictor of a tumor's biological behavior and to determine the optimal corresponding operative modalities.Methodology:The present study retrospectively evaluated the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic outcomes of 278 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who underwent liver resection (n = 176) or liver transplantation (n = 102; 92 of them were grafts from a living donor) between 1995 and 2007, based on tumor size.Results:The incidence of vascular invasion and high-grade histology increased with tumor size. Liver resection and transplantation were comparable in patients with tumors 10 cm sized tumors, both groups showed similarly poor survival. Lastly, in patients with tumors Conclusions:Tumor size can be a predictable surrogate of biological behavior in the preoperative period. When tumor size is 2.1-5 cm, transplantation should be considered first, irrespective of the underlying liver condition. In patients with tumors 5.1-10 cm in size, liver resection is preferred.
