Objectives:To present our experience in the use of microspheres preloaded with adriamycin (DC Bead(®)) in the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma, in a two-year prospective multidisciplinary study in consecutive patients to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of this procedure.Material and methods:From May 2007 to January 2010, we performed 30 TACE procedures in 17 patients (3 women and 14 men; mean age, 68 years; age range, 56-85 years). We performed a mean of 1.76 procedures per patient using the precision TACE protocol. Outcomes were evaluated using the RECIST-EASL criteria by clinical, laboratory, CT, and MRI follow-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.Results:The procedure was considered an initial technical success in all cases. The total dose was delivered in seven cases; in the remaining cases, the total dose was not reached (mean dose, 80mg). An objective response was observed in 64.7% of patients: a complete response was observed in 29.41% and a partial response in 35.29%. Disease was stabilized in 23.52% and progressed in 11.76%. We observed two cases of abscess/necrosis and one of ischemic cholecystitis. There were no deaths or cases of liver failure related with the procedure.Conclusions:TACE using microspheres preloaded with adriamycin (DC Beads®) is safe and effective, given the low rate of complications, good tolerance in patients, and increased tumor response.
