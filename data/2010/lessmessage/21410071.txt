Background/aims:The aim of this pilot study was to elucidate the efficacy and safety of systemic combination therapy with S-1 and cisplatin (CDDP) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with extrahepatic metastases.Methodology:Sixteen patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Two weeks of combination therapy represented one cycle, followed by two-to-four weeks rest. In each cycle, S-1 was administrated orally at 80-120 mg (depending on body surface area) every day and cisplatin was administrated intravenously at 60 mg/m2 on day 8. Response, overall survival and adverse effects were assessed. RESULT. No patient had intrahepatic HCC and all patients had a class A Child-Pugh score. Regarding overall response, 2 (13%), 0 (0%), 5 (31%), and 9 (56%) patients showed complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD), respectively, giving an overall response rate of 13% (2/16). The overall survival rate at 12 months was 77%. With regard to NCI-CTC grade-3 adverse reactions, 2 (13%), 2 (13%), and 6 (38%) patients developed nausea, anorexia, and neutropenia, respectively. No grade-4 adverse reaction or toxicity-related death occurred. CONCLUSION; S-1/CDDP is a potentially safe and effective combination therapy for HCC patients with extrahepatic metastases.
