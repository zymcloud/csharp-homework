Background:Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is disturbing because of its aggressive clinical path and high mortality rate. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of premalignant lesions and cancer of the esophagus in patients with a history of head and neck SCC.Methods:One hundred consecutive patients were investigated for diagnosis of superficial esophageal SCC. Lesions and their invasive depth for determination of the optimal method of treatment, and endoscopic examinations were carried out using Lugol chromoendoscopy. During endoscopy all abnormalities were investigated using approximately 10 ml of a 2% Lugol iodine solution sprayed over the entire esophageal mucosa using a spray catheter.Results:The mean±SD of age was 59.1±11.0 years. The tumor location in most patients (in both men and women)was the glottis. The statistical analysis showed significant differences between male and female in glottis and tongue. Twenty percent of patients reported the history of alcohol consumption and 22 percent were smokers, with 20.3% of men and 28.6% of women having digestive symptoms. The most common symptom in men was dysphagy and in women was odynophagy.Conclusion:In common, men are at high risk for ESCC and a high percent of current tobacco smokers, passive smokers and the history of alcohol intake were observed. In conclusion people in these high-risk groups would greatly benefit by acquisition of knowledge about and participating in a screening program.
