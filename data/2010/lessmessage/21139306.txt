We report a Japanese man who presented with multiple cranial nerve palsies with hepatitis B virus-related multiple hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He presented with right III, IV, VI, IX, X, and XII cranial nerve palsies. Metastases involving the clivus and the right occipital bone from HCC were diagnosed by the findings of magnetic resonance imaging of the head, cerebral angiography, and 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography. In this case, over one-year survival and improvement of neurological signs were achieved by radiotherapy in spite of multiple skull metastases, which are extremely rare.
