Elevated blood vitamin B(12) (VitB(12)) level has recently been identified as a prognostic indicator for advanced cancer patients. The predictive value of blood VitB(12) for survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Our objective was to examine the determinants of elevated serum VitB(12) levels and their associations with prognosis of patients with HCC. The cohort study included 90 HCC patients who were consecutively admitted to the Chi-Mei Hospital, Taiwan, from April 2005 to December 2006. Nutrition and clinical pathological data were collected. Serum VitB(12) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis of outcome predictors was assessed by Cox regression. Elevated serum VitB(12) levels of HCC patients were associated with reduced levels of albumin, hemoglobin, red blood cells count, and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) (P 200 mu g/l) and VitB(12) levels (> 1,500 ng/l; P 200 vs. 699 vs.
