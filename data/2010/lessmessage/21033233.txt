Background/aims:The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combined therapy with TAE and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for HCC with main portal vein thrombosis (MPVT).Methodology:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 18 patients who had an unresectable HCC with MPVT and underwent combined TAE and 3D-CRT. Treatment responses for the main tumor and the MPVT were assessed. In addition, patient survival and the prognostic factors associated with survival were analyzed.Results:The overall survival for the 18 patients was 13.0 +/- 8.5 months. For the main tumor response, 8 patients were responders and 10 were non-responders. For the MPVT, an objective response was observed in 10 out of the 18 cases. The univariate analysis revealed that the pretreatment AFP level, presence of regional lymph node metastasis, main tumor response and the MPVT response were prognostic factors for survival; however, these factors failed to reach significance on the multivariate analysis. Most of the treatment-related complications were resolved within 4 weeks. No patient had clinical evidence of progressive hepatic insufficiency related to the treatment.Conclusions:Combined therapy with TAE and 3D-CRT was safe and effective for the treatment of HCC patients with MPVT and might provide a survival benefit.
