Recently, new information relating to the potential relevance of chronic hepatic inflammation to the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been generated. Persistent hepatocellular injury alters the homeostatic balance within the liver; deregulation of the expression of factors involved in wound healing may lead to the evolution of dysplastic lesions into transformed nodules. Progression of such nodules depends directly on the development and organization of a vascular network, which provides the nutritional and oxygen requirements to an expanding nodular mass. Angiogenic stimulation promotes intense structural and functional changes in liver architecture and physiology, in particular, it facilitates transformation of dysplasia to nodular lesions with carcinogenic potential. HCC depends on the growth and spreading of vessels throughout the tumor. Because these vascular phenomena correlate with disease progression and prognosis, therapeutic strategies are being developed that focus on precluding vascular expansion in these tumors. Accordingly, an in-depth study of factors that promote and support pathological angiogenesis in chronic hepatic diseases may provide insights into methods of preventing the development of HCC and/or stimulating the regression of established HCC.
