Background & aim:Many liver staging systems have been proposed for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however it is still controversial which staging system is best. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of 7 different staging systems in predicting survival in an Indian cohort of patients with HCC.Methods:In this prospective study, 101 HCC patients were diagnosed and stratified according to 7 different staging systems; along with analysis of independent predictors of survival and their correlation with it (Kaplan-Meier analysis).Results:CLIP, Tokyo score and BCLC staging system showed a significant difference in the probability of survival. All other staging systems failed to show a significant difference in survival. Age, portal vein thrombosis, serum bilirubin, MELD score showed a significant difference with survival in univariate analysis. However, serum bilirubin was the independent predictor of survival with a hazard ratio of 1.609 (95% CI 1.015-2.553, p = 0.043).Conclusion:The CLIP, Tokyo score and BCLC are the most useful staging systems in an Indian cohort.
