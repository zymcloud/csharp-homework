Introduction:Cancer recurrence following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant obstacle in up to 10-20% of recipients. Recent evidence suggests that anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) therapy may be associated with increased rates of HCC recurrence.Methods:At the University of Colorado Transplant Center, 173 patients underwent OLT for end-stage liver disease with concomitant HCC between 1997 and 2008. Nine clinical and pathologic variables were analyzed to test the association between OKT3 therapy for steroid-resistant rejection (SRR) and HCC recurrence-free survival.Results:Overall, the rate of HCC recurrence in this cohort was low and comparable across treatment groups (8.7%). Multivariate analysis reveals that increasing tumor diameter and differentiation have a negative impact on HCC recurrence-free survival.Conclusions:While several pathologic variables appear to influence outcome, we found no association between OKT3 therapy for SRR and HCC recurrence or survival.
