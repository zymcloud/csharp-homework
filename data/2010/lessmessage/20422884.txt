Background/aims:The initiation, progression, invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma are closely associated with chronic inflammation caused by hepatitis virus infection, while tumor-associated macrophages are a major component of inflammatory infiltrates in intratumoral or peritumoral tissue of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methodology:Search MEDLINE, PUBMED databases, identify related articles and analyze related data.Results:Evidence indicated that tumor-associated macrophages play an important role in disease progression, recurrence and survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. However, recent study showed that Yondelis (ecteinascidin-743) can suppress tumor growth through attacking tumor cells, macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages.Conclusions:Owing to the importance of tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in inflammatory microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatocellular carcinoma by Yondelis seems to be a promising therapeutic strategy but requires further study.
