Distant metastases from laryngeal carcinoma are frequently seen in the lung, bone and liver, while skin metastases are rarely observed. In these cases presented as case reports in the literature, the supradiaphragmatic region is usually involved. Skin metastasis in lower extremity has only been reported in a few cases. While being an indicator of poor prognosis, skin metastasis is also considered as a messenger of distant organ metastasis. Survival is very short after development of skin metastasis. In our case, nodular skin metastasis was found both in the superior-lateral margin of the left patella and in the right heel. This is the first case reported in the literature on laryngeal carcinoma metastasizing to these localizations.
