Background/aims:Serum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9/ MMP-2 ratios are highly associated with alpha-fetoprotein levels in patients with chronic hepatitis B. In this study, we evaluate the clinical usefulness of this ratio as a biomarker in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:Serum samples from 181 chronic hepatitis B patients (52 healthy carriers, 47 chronic hepatitis patients, 50 cirrhosis patients, and 32 HCC patients) were collected. MMP-9/ MMP-2 ratio was determined by zymography. The results were analyzed using the Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.Results:Serum MMP-9/ MMP-2 ratios in HCC patients were significantly higher than those in healthy carriers, chronic hepatitis patients, and cirrhosis patients (p = 0.004, 0.034, and Conclusions:The serum MMP-9/ MMP-2 ratio can be used as an accessory diagnostic marker in hepatitis B virus-related HCC. This ratio is useful in distinguishing between patients with early stage HCC and those with advanced HCC.
