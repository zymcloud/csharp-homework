Occult HBV infection (OBI) is an increasingly reported form of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, With the current knowledge, in immunocompetent individuals, OBI is mainly a diagnostic challenge and has a very low probability of transfusion risk, controversial risk of liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma, etc. In immunosuppressed individuals, however, reactivation of OBI is a real concern even today. There are many controversies about the management of such cases, including anti-HBc and/or alanine aminotransferase monitoring, HBV DNA monitoring, vaccination or pre-emptive nucleoside analogs. We present here four OBI cases which reveal the difficulties in the diagnosis and management of OBI and include a discussion upon current literature.
