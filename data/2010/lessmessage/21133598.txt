Background:Survivin is specific antiapoptotic gene product expressed in a variety of human neoplasms whose overexpression might assist in early diagnosis and as a prognostic marker.Objectives:The aim was to evaluate the plasma levels of survivin and alpha fetoprotein in patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infection (HCV) with and without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Subjects:70 subjects were divided into: a control group (Group I) (20 healthy volunteers) and two patients groups: Group II, HCV group (20 patients); and Group III, HCC with HCV(30 patients).Methods:Thorough physical examination, ultrasonography of the abdomen, laboratory investigations (liver profile, anti-HCV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, Alpha fetoprotein (chemiluminometry) and Survivin (ELISA)) were performed.Results:There was a significant increase in survivin level in HCV patients (Group II) when compared to the control group (p=0.039), along with a significant increase in AFP in Groups II and III when compared to Group I (PConclusions:While survivin showed significant increase in the HCV group, its diagnostic performance was lower and it proved to be less reliable as a tumor marker for HCC than did AFP.
