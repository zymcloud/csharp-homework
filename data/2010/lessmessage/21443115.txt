Complete resection for colorectal metastases is the only treatment that can provide long-term survival and may lead to cure. Recent reports have shown that liver resection following systemic chemotherapy in patients with initially unresectable metastases from colorectal cancer may also result in a good long-term survival, and rescue surgery after chemotherapy has become a strategy of choice. A 29-year-old male and a 35-year-old female with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer underwent complete resection after administration of third-line combination therapy of cetuximab and irinotecan. Although systemic chemotherapy may decrease liver function, which may make liver resection unfeasible, in the two cases reported, liver function did not deteriorate after cetuximab plus irinotecan. The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes, which is useful in deciding the safe limit of hepatectomy, was optimal after the administration of cetuximab plus irinotecan in both patients. Cetuximab plus irinotecan may be beneficial as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, not only because of its oncological efficacy but also for preservation of liver function.
