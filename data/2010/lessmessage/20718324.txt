The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the optimal timing for removal of abdominal drainage after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 148 patients were divided into 2 groups. In Group I, drains were removed according to the judgment of the surgeon. In Group II, drains were removed on postoperative day (POD) 2, except in cases of bile leakage, purulent ascites, or hemorrhage. Postoperative complications were compared between the 2 groups. Postoperative hospital stay was shorter in Group II than in Group I. Six patients required drain reinsertion for abdominal abscess and massive ascites. The risk factor for drain reinsertion was volume of drain discharge greater than 450 mL on POD 2. Early removal of the drain is desirable after surgical treatment of HCC. Moreover, it seems preferable to determine the necessity of drain removal based on assessment of the volume and nature of drain discharge on POD 2.
