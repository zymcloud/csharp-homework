Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascular tumor which is poorly responsive to standard systemic chemotherapy. Recently, various antiangiogenic targeted agents have shown promising activity at different levels of evidence in patients with advanced HCC, suggesting that such treatments might be effective.Case report:Since chemotherapy administered with metronomic schedules inhibits angiogenesis, we treated a 64-year-old man with advanced HCC with metronomic capecitabine. After only two months of treatment the HCC nodules disappeared on ultrasonography. This finding was confirmed by a computed tomography scan. After more than three years the patient is still in treatment with minimal toxicity and maintains a complete remission.Conclusions:Our case report suggests that metronomic capecitabine may be effective in advanced HCC patients while being also well tolerated. This is important, given the frequent comorbidities of HCC patients.
