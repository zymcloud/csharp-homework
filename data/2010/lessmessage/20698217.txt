Background/aims:The presence of esophageal varices (EVs) is believed to be a factor that affects the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined whether the presence and severity of EVs affected either survival prognosis or the cause of death in HCC patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methodology:The study included 89 HCC patients treated with RFA who were endoscopically evaluated for EVs before treatment. To determine factors associated with survival, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses of variables including demographics, tumor stage, Child-Pugh class and status of EVs. Furthermore, we investigated the association between the presence of EVs and causes of death.Results:Multivariate analyses showed both Child-Pugh class B (odds ratio: 2.654; p = 0.017) and EVs (odds ratio: 3.18; p = 0.004) to be independent factors of poor prognosis. Of 34 patients who died during the period of observation, one died because of an EV rupture.Conclusions:The existence of EVs may affect survival prognosis of HCC patients treated with RFA independently of Child-Pugh status, but is not associated with hemorrhagic death.
