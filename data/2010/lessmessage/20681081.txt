Technetium-99m (99mTc)â€“labeled pentavalent dimercaptosuccinic acid ([99mTc]-(V)DMSA) has been used for renal scintigraphy (see below for references) as well as detection and postoperative evaluation of medullary carcinomas of the thyroid (MCT).[99mTc]-(V)DMSA has been shown to accumulate in breast tumors, head and neck cancers, osteosarcomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma (1). [99mTc]-(V)DMSA has been used for renal (2, 3) and metastatic tumor (4) scintigraphy in animals (2), adults (4), and children (3). The 99mTc in [99mTc]-DMSA has been shown to exist in a trivalent (III) or a pentavalent (V) state, depending on the pH at which the radiolabeled compound was prepared. [99mTc]-(III)DMSA is used as a renal imaging agent, whereas [99mTc]-(V)DMSA is suitable for imaging cancerous tumors (5). Recently, the European Association of Nuclear Medicine revised its guidelines for the use of [99mTc]-(V)DMSA scintigraphy in children. Also, several clinical trials approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to evaluate the use of unlabeled DMSA for the treatment of lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in children have been completed. The exact mechanism of [99mTc]-(V)DMSA uptake by the tumor cells is not clear, but a report suggests that cellular uptake of this radiotracer is mediated by the sodium phosphate co-transporter type III (NaPi type III) (6).The biodistribution of [99mTc]-(V)DMSA has been studied in rabbits (7) and mice (8). [99mTc]-(V)DMSA uptake has also been used to the evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma (9) or glioblastoma (10) and to investigate the correlation of breast cancer in women to breast density and expression of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (11).
