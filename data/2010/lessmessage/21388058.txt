Background:Patients with liver metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinomas have a dismal prognosis. Surgical resection remains the only curative option but is appropriate for only a minority of patients as a treatment option. This is the first study to examine the safety and efficacy of radioembolization with yttirum-90 microspheres for these patients.Patients and methods:All patients with histologically proven pancreatic carcinoma liver metastases referred to a single institution from 2006-2009 were included in the study. After radioembolization, follow-up abdominal computed tomography scans were performed to assess response according to the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors guidelines.Results:Seven patients were identified from our prospectively collected data base. Of the five patients with available computed tomography follow-up, 2 patients achieved a partial response and 1 patient had stable disease. One patient with partial response survived for nearly 15 months after radioembolization therapy. No patient experienced major post-radioembolization complications.Conclusions:Radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres may have a useful role in treating patients with pancreatic carcinoma liver metastases in a multimodality setting. Results of the current study warrant further investigation of this novel treatment.
