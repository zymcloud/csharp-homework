The study was concerned with laparoscopic liver resection for cancer (140) (1998-2009). Faulty intraoperative performance and postoperative complications were evaluated according to Clavien and Satava. 188 resections were performed in the course of 154 operations. Median operation duration and blood loss were 180 min and 300 ml, respectively. Most patients started taking water on the same day and eating the next day. There were 16 incidents including 6 (3.9%) cases involving change of surgical strategy. Surgical complications were reported in 22 (14.3%) cases including one death from multiple organ failure. Median postoperative intensive care duration and inpatient stay were zero and 3 days, respectively; median follow-up--24-105 months; 3-5 year survival--(68 +/- 6%) and (46 +/- 8%), respectively. 3-year survival in patients with colorectal metastasis to liver, metastasis of neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and those of hepatocellular carcinoma was 71, 50 and 47%, respectively. Laparoscopic liver resection is a safe and effective method of tumor treatment. It is least invasive and followed by good end results.
