Objective:To determine whether the presence of liver cirrhosis was related to the treatment options and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Design:Retrospective.Method:A status investigation of all HCC patients who were treated in the period 2000-2007 at the Erasmus MC Hospital, Rotterdam, was performed. The treatments were analysed and the disease-free and total survival rate were calculated.Results:HCC was diagnosed in 461 patients during the study period. Cirrhosis was present in 295 patients (64%). Treatment with curative intent was pursued in 184 patients through partial liver resection, orthotopic liver transplantation or radiofrequency ablation. The group of patients without cirrhosis contained significantly more women (38% versus 18%) (p Conclusion:The presence of liver cirrhosis was strongly associated with treatment options for patients with HCC but not with the prognosis for a recurrence of HCC or the survival rate following potential curative treatment.
