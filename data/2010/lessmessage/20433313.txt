Purpose:To compare the effectiveness of ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous 915 MHz microwave (MW) ablation with the 2450 MHz MW ablation for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (>4 cm in diameter).Materials and methods:Patients with HCC >4 cm in diameter who underwent US-guided percutaneous MW ablation with curative intention between March 2007 and December 2008 (39) were randomly divided into two groups, 915 MHz MW group and 2450 MHz MW group. We compared the results of ablation between the two groups.Results:Fewer antenna insertions for each tumour were required in the 915 MHz MW group (3.69 +/- 0.6) than in the 2450 MHz MW group (4.71 +/- 1.61) (p = 0.01). According to the follow-up contrast-enhanced imagings, technique effectiveness rate was 85.7% (18/21) and 73.7% (14/19) in the 915 MHz MW group and 2450 MHz MW group, respectively (p = 0.44). The rate of local tumour progression (LTP) was 14.3% (3/21) and 26.3% (5/19) in the 915 MHz MW group and 2450 MHz MW group, respectively (p = 0.44). There were no deaths and no thrombosis of major vessels in any patient.Conclusions:Compared with 2450 MHz MW ablation, our initial experience showed that percutaneous 915 MHz MW ablation with cooled-shaft antennae was safe and could achieve a high technique effectiveness rate with fewer insertion numbers in the treatment of large HCC. Therefore, percutaneous 915 MHz MW ablation may provide a new method for the treatment of large HCC.
