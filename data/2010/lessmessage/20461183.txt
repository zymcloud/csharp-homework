Objective:To evaluate whether the histopathological differentiation and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) do show correlation with the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).Materials and methods:Twenty-seven HCCs from 27 patients who had undergone preoperative liver MRI (1.5T) and surgical resection were retrospectively reviewed. DWI was obtained with a single-shot, echo-planar imaging sequence in the axial plane (b values: 0 and 1,000 sec/mm(2)). On DWIs, the ADC value of the HCCs was measured by one radiologist, who was kept 'blinded' to the histological findings. Histopathologically, the differentiation was classified into well (n = 9), moderate (n = 9) and poor (n = 9). The expression of VEGF was semiquantitatively graded as grade 0 (n = 8), grade 1 (n = 9) and grade 2 (n = 10). We analyzed whether the histopathological differentiation and the expression of VEGF of the HCC showed correlation with the ADC value on DWI.Results:The mean ADC value of the poorly-differentiated HCCs (0.9 +/- 0.13x10(-3) mm(2)/s) was lower than those of the well-differentiated HCCs (1.2 +/- 0.22x10(-3) mm(2)/s) (p = 0.031) and moderately-differentiated HCCs (1.1 +/- 0.01x10(-3) mm(2)/s) (p = 0.013). There was a significant correlation between the differentiation and the ADC value of the HCCs (r = -0.51, p = 0.012). The mean ADC of the HCCs with a VEGF expression grade of 0, 1 and 2 was 1.1 +/- 0.17, 1.1 +/- 0.21 and 1.1 +/- 0.18x10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively. The VEGF expression did not show correlation with the ADC value of the HCCs (r = 0.07, p = 0.74).Conclusion:The histopathological differentiation of HCC shows inverse correlation with the ADC value. Therefore, DWI with ADC measurement may be a valuable tool for noninvasively predicting the differentiation of HCC.
