Background and aim:The majority of patients who undergo orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a very good prognosis if the tumor is within the Milan criteria. However, 10-15% of patients will have reoccurrence after OLT. Currently, sorafenib is available for advanced HCC. The safety and efficacy of sorafenib in this population has not been reported.Methods:We retrospectively looked at 54 patients who received sorafenib for advanced HCC. Out of 54 patients, we analyzed 9 who received sorafenib after OLT for HCC reoccurrence at Cleveland Clinic.Result:The median age at the time treatment with sorafenib was initiated was 59 years (range 46-77). Two patients received prior local therapy. Most of the toxicity was expected side effects from sorafenib except in 1 patient who developed hematological toxicity. Six patients required dose reduction secondary to toxicity. There were no unexpected complications from interaction with immunosuppressive medication. One patient achieved complete radiographic remission. Median survival from the start of sorafenib had not been reached at the time of writing; however, the 4-month survival rate is currently estimated to be 84 Â± 15%, and 1 patient with lung reoccurrence has been treated for almost 18 months thus far.Conclusion:Sorafenib can be used in patients with recurrent HCC after liver transplantation with tolerable toxicity; however, dose adjustment may be required. A larger prospective study is necessary to determine the efficacy of sorafenib in this group of patients.
