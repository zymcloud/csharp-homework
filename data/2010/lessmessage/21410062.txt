Background/aims:The metastasis of hepatic carcinoma is correlated with the body's immune status. T lymphocytes play a big part role in tumor immune. The aim of the present study is to investigate the inhibition effects of metastatsis in nude mice bearing hepatic carcinoma after T lymphocytes reconstitution.Methodology:An immune reconstitution model was established in nude mice. Then, 42 nude mice were distributed into 4 groups for T lymphocytes reconstitution. The lymph nodes of each group were obtained to investigate the tumor metastasis. And the secretion of cytokines and the apoptosis of tumor cells in each group were also detected.Results:The ratio of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 in reconstituted groups were higher than controlled groups. The average time of tumor formation in Balb/c nu/nu mice was 7.7 +/- 0.6 days and in Balb/c mice was 11.5 +/- 1.3 days. After active T lymphocytes reconstitution, the extent lymph nodes metastasis in reconstitution groups was lower than control groups (p Conclusions:The metastasis of hepatic carcinoma can be inhibited by reconstitution of actived T lymphocytes in nude mice, which indicated that tumor metastasis can be affected by the immune status in host body.
