Results of surgical treatment of 109 patients with focal lesions of the liver were analyzed. Volume resection by malignant and benign liver lesions was defined, depending on size, localization, number of foci and functional liver reserve. Postoperative lethality of patients with colorectal cancer metastases was 4.3%. Method of surgical treatment depended directly on the tumor stage. Overall 5-year survival by stage IVA hepatocellular cancer was 48%, 3.5-year survival was 62%. Overall and disease-free survival by colorectal cancer metastases was 35.1 and 22.4%, respectively.
