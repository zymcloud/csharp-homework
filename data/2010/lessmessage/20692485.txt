Introduction:The survival rates among patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has increased to 83% and 75% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. However, these patients are at increased risk of long-term complications.Objective:To identify long-term complications and survivals among patients after OLT.Methods:From September 1999 to July 2009 we evaluated long-term complications among 78 consecutive patients after OLT including 46 males.Results:Complications de novo after OLT were metabolic (n = 38; 67%), infections (n = 13; 23%), recurrent liver disease (n = 12; 21%), osteopenia/osteoporosis (n = 10; 18%), acute/chronic rejection (n = 8; 14%), renal failure (n = 2; 4%) and Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 1). Their overall survival at 118 months was 55%.Conclusions:The most common long-term complications after OLT were metabolic, infections, and disease recurrence.
