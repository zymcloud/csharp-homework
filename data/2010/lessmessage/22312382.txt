Background and aims:The determination of the prevalence of cardiopulmonary complications at a liver transplant center in Iran.Methods:Ninety-nine patients (61 male and 38 female) with a mean age of 36.5 (15-66) years with proven cirrhosis were enrolled in this study. Patients with primary cardiac disease, current smokers, those with sepsis, hepatocellular carcinoma, recently ruptured esophageal varices and chronic pulmonary or renal diseases were excluded from the study. Sixty-nine patients had ascites. Forty-four patients had grade C Child-Pugh classification. All patients were evaluated for respiratory function by chest X-ray (CXR), room air arterial blood gas, simultaneous pulse oximetry, cardiac echocardiography and spirometry.Results:Sixty-one patients (66.1%) had a widened alveolar-arterial O2 difference ( > 20 mmHg); 14 (14.1%) had hypoxemia; 6 (6.1%) had mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) = 25-40 mmHg; 12 (12.1%) had tricuspid regurgitation; pleural effusion and lung restriction were detected in 4 (4%) and 50 (50.5%), respectively. P(A-a)O2 was negatively associated with pulmonary hypertension (P Conclusions:A widened alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was common in our patients, but hypoxemia occurred in 14% of patients. Portopulmonary hypertension was preponderant in those patients of male gender.
