Objective:The purpose of this community-based study was to determine factors associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening compliance and non-compliance among Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Cambodian adults with varying levels of English language proficiency.Methods:A cross-sectional design was used consisting of a sample of 1,603 Asian adult men and women.Results:Overall, 71.4% of the sample reported having never been screened and 28.6% reported being screened for HBV. Demographic, acculturation, and barrier factors were differentially associated with screening rates among the subgroups. Demographic factors associated with never-screened were: lower education, younger age, being male, and no insurance for Chinese; lower education, lower income and no insurance for Cambodians; younger age and unmarried for Koreans; and no health insurance for Vietnamese; Acculturation factors associated with never-screened were: not speaking English for Chinese; not speaking English, not reading newspapers in English, and watching TV in one's native language for Cambodians; not speaking English for Koreans; while no significant factors were found for Vietnamese. All barriers were associated with never-screened for Cambodians and Chinese. Those who lacked knowledge about HBV and had language and transportation barrier were more likely to be never-screened for Koreans. There were no significant relationships between the barriers and the screening status for Vietnamese.Conclusions:High incidence of HBV and liver cancer in Asian Americans mandates a more vigorous and more culturally and linguistically appropriate educational effort to increase screening and vaccination for HBV in these underserved and mostly uninsured populations.
