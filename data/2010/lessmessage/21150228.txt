Background:Hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) and sensory neuropathy are major complications of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Preplanned withdrawal of oxaliplatin after the first six cycles and reintroduction at the time of disease progression (stop-and-go strategy) may reduce neurotoxicity. However, the effect of an oxaliplatin-free interval on HSR occurrence remains poorly understood.Patients and methods:Data on patients with colorectal cancer who received FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) treatment between June 2005 and June 2009 were retrieved from the prospective cohort database of the Outpatient Oncology Unit of the Kyoto University Hospital. Factor analysis was performed.Results:Among patients who received six or fewer cycles of FOLFOX, the incidence of HSR was low (7/99, 7.1%). For patients who received more than six cycles, the incidence of HSR was higher among patients treated with stop-and-go FOLFOX than among patients treated with continuous FOLFOX (25/61, 41.0% vs. 13/63, 20.6%; p = 0.019). Interestingly, most cases of HSR during stop-and-go FOLFOX occurred during the second or third cycle of the reintroduction phase (21/25, 84%). Multivariate analysis identified undergoing an oxaliplatin-free interval as an independent risk factor (p = 0.016).Conclusions:An oxaliplatin-free interval may increase the risk of HSR. Special vigilance is needed during the second and third cycles after reintroduction of oxaliplatin.
