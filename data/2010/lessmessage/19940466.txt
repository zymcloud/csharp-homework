Angiogenesis is essential for normal tissue and even more so for solid malignancies. At present, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is a major focus of anticancer drug development. Bevacizumab, a humanized antibody against VEGF, was the first antiangiogenic agent to be approved for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. The most commonly observed adverse events are hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding and thrombosis. Sunitinib, a small molecule blocking intracellular VEGF, KIT, Flt3 and PDGF receptors, which regulate angiogenesis and cell growth, is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer (RCC) and malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The most frequent adverse events include hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis, diarrhea, fatigue, hypothyroidism and hypertension. Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, is approved for the second-line treatment of advanced RCC and upfront treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Most common adverse events with sorafenib are dermatologic (hand-foot skin reaction, rash, desquamation), fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, hypothyroidism and hypertension. More recently, cardiovascular toxicity has increasingly been recognized as a potential adverse event associated with sunitinib and sorafenib treatment. Elderly patients are at increased risk of thromboembolic events when receiving bevacizumab, and potentially for cardiac dysfunction when receiving sunitinib or sorafenib. The safety of antiangiogenic drugs is of special concern when taking these agents for longer-term adjuvant or maintenance treatment. Furthermore, newer investigational antiangiogenic drugs are briefly reviewed.
