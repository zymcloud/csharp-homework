Background:Radiofrequency (RF-) assisted liver resection devices like the Habib sealer induce a necrotic resection plane from which a small margin of necrotic liver tissue remains in situ. The aim of the present paper was to report our long-time experience with the new resection method and the morphological characteristics of the remaining necrotic resection plane.Methods:64 RF-assisted liver resections were performed using the Habib sealer. Followup was assessed at defined time points.Results:The postoperative mortality was 3,6% and morbidity was 18%. The followup revealed that the necrotic zone was detectable in all analyzed CT and MRI images as a hypodense structure without any contrast enhancement at all time points, irrespectively of the time interval between resection and examination.Conclusion:Liver resection utilizing radiofrequency-induced resection plane coagulation is a safe alternative to the established resection techniques. The residual zone of coagulation necrosis remains basically unchanged during a followup of three years. This has to be kept in mind when evaluating the follow up imaging of these patients.
