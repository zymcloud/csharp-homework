The involvement of cancer stem cells (CSC) in tumorigenesis has been studied in several malignancies, but their presence in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHCC) has not previously been evaluated. General characteristics of "stemness" include the expression of putative stem cell antigens, reduced cell cycle progression, and limited functional differentiation or dedifferentiation under the influence of the microenvironment. Immunohistochemical probes applied to 8 archival cases of FLHCC vis-Ã -vis contiguous non-neoplastic parenchyma, which was present in 5 cases, revealed such stemness characteristics by showing: (a) stem cell antigens, with moderate to intense expression of CD133 in the cytoplasm (6 of 8 FLHCC cases and comprising >40% of the tumoral areas) and of CD44 on the plasmalemmal aspect (7 of 8 FLHCC cases and comprising 50 to 95% of the tumor cells), vs foci of such overexpressions in only 1 of 5 of the contiguous liver parenchyma (p = 0.053 and p = 0.015, respectively); (b) limited G1 to S phase progression (
