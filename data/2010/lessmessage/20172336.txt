Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the liver. Liver transplantation is the best treatment for HCC; it improves survival, cures cirrhosis, and abolishes local recurrence. We describe the outcomes of patients with HCC who underwent liver transplantation in two liver transplantation centers in Chile.Methods:This study is a clinical series elaborated from the liver transplantation database of Pontificia Universidad Católica and Clínica Alemana between 1993 and 2009. The survival of patients was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The significant alpha level was defined as Results:From 250 liver transplantations performed in this period, 29 were due to HCC. At the end of the study, 25 patients (86%) were alive. The mean recurrence-free survival was 30 months (range 5 months to 8 years). The 5-year survival for patients transplanted for HCC was >80%; however, the 5-year overall survival of patients who exceeded the Milan criteria in the explants was 66%. There was no difference in overall survival between patients transplanted for HCC versus other diagnosis (P = .548).Conclusion:This series confirmed that liver transplantation is a good treatment for patients with HCC within the Milan criteria.
