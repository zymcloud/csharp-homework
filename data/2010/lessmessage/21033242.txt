Background/aims:Some hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases undergo surgery because tumor progression cannot be controlled by various non-surgical therapies. This retrospective study sought to clarify the clinicopathologic features of such HCC cases.Methodology:Among cases with solitary small HCCs (Results:In S group, the serum alpha-fetoprotein level was higher (p = 0.045) and macroscopic ductal invasion was more common (p = 0.028) at the time of the operation. Lobectomy was more commonly performed (p = 0.034) and curability B (No residual cancer, but Stage III or IV) was more frequent (p = 0.011). Other organ recurrence was more common (p = 0.0044). The survival time after the initial treatment (post-initial treatment survival) was worse (p = 0.028). Univariate analyses revealed that those with maximum tumor sizes of > 3.0 cm at the time of the operation were significantly worse compared with the other patients (p = 0.012).Conclusions:The timing for changing from a non-surgical treatment to a surgical treatment is important.
