Background:Golgi protein 73 (GP73) expressions have been detected in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and bile duct carcinoma.Aim:Our purpose was to determine the serum levels of GP73 in patients with HCC and to compare them with Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) levels.Materials and methods:Seventy-five patients with HCC, 55 patients with cirrhosis and 28 healthy controls were included.Results:The median serum GP73 levels were 0.27 ng/ml (range = 0.078-4.95) in controls, 0.32 ng/ml (range = 0.078-39.63) in cirrhotics and 0.21 ng/ml (range = 0.053-4.98) in those with HCC. The median serum AFP levels were 1.37 ng/ml (range = 0.61-6.89) in controls, 2.32 ng/ml (range = 0.61-85.24) in cirrhotics and 50.65 ng/ml (range = 0.8-37,642) in HCC patients (p Conclusions:GP73 has a lower diagnostic and prognostic value for HCC. AFP is superior to GP73 for diagnosis of early HCC.
