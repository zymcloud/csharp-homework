The aim of the present study was to analyze the mRNA and protein expression of glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its correlation with sonic hedgehog (Shh), one of the ligands of hedgehog (Hh) signaling, and two epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, E-cadherin and S100a4. We also investigated the potential crosstalk between Hh signaling and EMT in HCC. Paired HCC and normal tumor-adjacent tissues were freshly collected from 30 primary HCC patients. Gli1 expression at both the mRNA and protein level was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The protein expression of Shh, E-cadherin and S100a4 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry to identify correlations with Gli1. The mRNA and protein expression of Gli1 was significantly up-regulated in the HCC tumor tissues compared to the normal tumor-adjacent tissues (P
