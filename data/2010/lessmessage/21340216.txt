At diagnosis, females were older than males (median age: 62 vs. 59 years old respectively; pConclusion:The epidemiology, classification, and therapy selection for HCC varied among Brazilian regions. Hepatitis C infection was the most common etiology of liver cirrhosis; chemoembolization was the most common therapy employed. Liver cirrhosis was the main risk factor for HCC development in Brazil.
