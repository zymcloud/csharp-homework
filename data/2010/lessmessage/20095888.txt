Objective:To determine the risk factors for the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.Material and methods:A total of 620 patients who tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and were referred to Chiba University Hospital between February 1985 and March 2008 were included in the study and the following characteristics were analyzed: age, gender, status of hepatitis B e antigen, alanine aminotransferase level, HBV DNA level, and number of platelets (PLTs).Results:HCC was detected in 30 cases during the follow-up period (5.4 +/- 5.1 years). Multivariate analysis revealed that age > 40 years [compared with patients aged 40 years, the HBV DNA level (compared with 196,000/microl PLTs; OR = 15.6, 95% CI = 2.06-118.3) were predictive factors for HCC occurrence.Conclusions:Advanced age and low PLT level were risk factors for HCC occurrence in patients with HBV infection. In patients aged > 40 years, viral load was also a risk factor for HCC.
