Background and aim:Cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tumor growth, invasion, and remote metastasis in various cancers. Recently, functional gene polymorphisms in these cytokines and MMPs have been found, and some reports have revealed an association between these polymorphisms and the prognosis of various cancers. In this study, we examined the relationship between the gene polymorphisms of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1b), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 RN), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-b1), MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 and the prognosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We enrolled 92 HCV-related HCC patients in the study, and gene polymorphisms of IL-1b -31 C/T, IL-1 RN variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), TGF-b1 +869 C/T, MMP-1 -1,607 1G/2G, MMP-3 -1,171 5A/6A, and MMP-9 -1,562 C/T were analyzed.Results:In HCC clinical features, TGF-b1 C carriers and MMP-3 5A carriers had significantly larger HCC diameters than TGF-b1 T and MMP-3 6A homozygotes. In HCC prognosis, IL-1b T homozygotes and MMP-3 5A carriers had a significantly poorer prognosis than IL-1b C carriers and MMP-3 6A homozygotes. Those with a combination of IL-1b T homozygosity and MMP-3 5A had synergistically poorer HCC prognosis.Conclusion:The IL-1b -31 T allele and MMP-3 5A allele are cooperative risk factors for poor prognosis in HCC patients, suggesting that these gene polymorphisms might be potential markers for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients.
