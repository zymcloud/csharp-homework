Background:Liver transplantation has become the treatment of choice for chronic and acute end-stage liver failure as well as for selected cases of malignancies and metabolic disorders. We report our first experience of the orthotopic liver transplantation.Material/methods:Between 2005 and 2008 16 cadaveric orthotopic liver transplantations in 16 adults (12 males, 4 females, mean age 44 years) were performed. Main indications for orthotopic liver transplantation were cholestatic liver disease (31%), viral-induced cirrhosis (25%), alcoholic liver disease (19%), hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis virus infection (13%), autoimmune cirrhosis (6%), cryptogenic acute liver failure (6%). Mean follow-up was 15 month (range: 4 days - 43 month).Results:Intraabdominal haemorrhage was observed in 6 patients (37.5%). Vascular complications were observed in 3 patients (18.75%). Biliary complication were observed in 3 patients (18.75%). Overall 1 year patient survival was 87,5%. Four (25%) patients died during follow-up. All patients died because of sepsis and multiorgan system failure.Conclusions:Our first results showed that secret of successful liver transplantation is perfect interdisciplinary team approach, including selection of the recipient and timing of transplantation, the operative procedure itself, prevention and treatment of complications, the perioperative anaesthesiological and intensive-care management, and careful follow up after transplantation.
