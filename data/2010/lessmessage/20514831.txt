Purpose:To determine factors affecting the survival of colorectal cancer patients developing liver metastasis.Material and methods:850 colorectal cancer patients who had been operated on between 1995 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed and patients who developed liver metastases were selected. Patients' demographics and data regarding the characteristics and management of primary tumors and liver metastases were assessed. Survival data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard method to identify factors affecting prognosis of such patients.Results:154 (18.1%) patients developed liver metastasis; however, only 60 patients (39 males and 21 females; median age: 61 (31-77) years) had complete follow-up data, of whom 28 had undergone metastasis resection. The median survival time of patients who underwent resection and who did not was 42 (22-118) vs. 13 (2-52) months (p < 0.001). Curative resection of the primary tumor (p = 0.32; Exp(B) = 2.93), metastases that were less than 5 in number and localized to one of the right or left lobes (p = 0.004; Exp(B) = 3.38), and surgical resection of the metastases (p = 0.001 ; Exp(B) = 3.76) were independent risk factors.Conclusions:Patients with colorectal liver metastases that are less than 5 and confined into one lobe, could benefit from metastasis surgery most if the primary tumor is resected.
