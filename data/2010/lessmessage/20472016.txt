This study was aimed at investigating the phenolic constituents of methanolic and aqueous extracts of Vitex negundo in context of antioxidant potential and inhibition of oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity. Antioxidant efficacies of both extracts were estimated by their abilities to scavenge DPPH(*) and to reduce Fe(+3) to Fe(+2). Their protective potential against H(2)O(2)-driven oxidative damage to cells were evaluated by XTT assay in Hep3B (human hepatoma) cells. Total phenolic content of both extracts were estimated, and were tested for correlation with antioxidant potential and protection against oxidative cytotoxicity. Polyphenolic levels in both extracts showed significant (P<0.05) positive correlations with DPPH(*) scavenging, Fe(+3)-Fe(+2) reduction and percentage decrease in H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity. Major phenolic compounds in the extracts were identified by HPLC. It was concluded that both V. negundo extracts hold considerable potential as antitheses of free radical toxicity by virtue of their polyphenolic constituents, and might have significant clinical roles in prospect.
