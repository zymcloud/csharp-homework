Purpose:To show the feasibility of a combination of the advantages of modern contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with the technique of arterioportography to achieve the highest sensitivity of all different modalities.Material and methods:Ten patients (9 m, 1 f, age 52-73 years) with suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in liver cirrhosis (8 ethyl toxic, 2 hepatitis) were included before transarterial chemo-embolization (TACE). In all patients during a 6-week period a double enhanced MRI (Gd-DTPA and SPIO) was performed. Before TACE a bolus Result:In all 10 patients (100 %) US-AP was feasible. Diagnostic quality was in all cases between 1-2 for both modalities and readers (MRI standard deviation (SD) -0.51, Sono-AP SD -0.421). US-AP detected with 33.5 vs. 24.5 lesions, significant more lesions than double enhanced MRI (p Conclusion:US-AP for detection of liver lesions is feasible. Using this technique significantly more lesions in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma could be detected in comparison to MRI with liver-specific contrast agent.
