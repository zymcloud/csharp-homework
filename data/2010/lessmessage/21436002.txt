The main goal of our study was to evaluate cirrhosis course on one year. The study was prospective and longitudinal from January 2005 to December 2006 in the center of hepatology and gastro-enterology of CHU Gabriel Tour√©. The patients had one year follow up and examinated every three months. In this study 57 patients were included. Mean age was 41,5 + 15,3 years. Ascite and jaundice were the main clinical signs respectively 70.2% and 54.4%. Ascite or its increase was the most complication in 67.5% of cases (p = 0.002). The global mortality was 82.5% and it was high in the three first months, caused by hepatocellular carcinoma, digestive bleeding and hepatic encephalopathy respectively 33.3%, 27.3% and 15.2%. Abdomen pain, ascite and jaundice have an predictive value for high mortality (p between 3.10-3 et 10-7). Early examination, therapeutic observance and good management of cirrhosis complications could reduce the mortality.
