Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the commonest cancers worldwide, and more than half of HCC patients are attributable to persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. The best and cheapest way to prevent HBV-related HCC is the implementation of universal hepatitis B vaccination program, by which the incidence rates of childhood HCC have been reduced in several countries, including Taiwan. However, there are still hundreds of millions of HBV carriers in the world that remain a global health challenge. In the past decade, several hepatitis B viral factors such as serum HBV DNA level, genotype, and naturally occurring mutants have already been identified to influence liver disease progression and HCC development in HBV carriers. Several easy-to-use scoring systems based on clinical and viral characteristics are developed to predict HCC risk in HBV carriers and may facilitate the communication between practicing physicians and patients in clinical practice. In addition, the role of nonviral factors in HBV-related HCC has also been increasingly recognized. On the basis of these emerging data, it is recommended that HBV carriers should be screened and monitored to identify those who have a higher risk of liver disease progression and require antiviral treatments. Regarding the molecular carcinogenesis of HCC development, despite some progress in the research of cell biology of HCC in the past decade, aberrant pathways involved in maintaining HCC phenotypes have not been completely elucidated yet. In the future, through comprehensive and integrated approaches to analyze the genomes of human HCC, novel target genes or pathways critically involved in hepatocarcinogenesis may hopefully be identified.
