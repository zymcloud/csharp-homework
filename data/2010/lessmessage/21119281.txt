We describe a 45-year-old man, heavy smoker, presenting with 6.5 x 5.3 cm painless solitary growth over right temporal region. Chest radiograph showed opacity over left lung abutting mediastinum. Computed tomogram revealed homogenous ill-defined opacity indicative of bronchogenic carcinoma with metastases to right lung, liver and adrenal glands. The carina was involved with tumor along with partial obliteration of the left main bronchus over bronchoscopy; the biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. The biopsy from scalp lesion and cervical lymph node also established metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Although cutaneous metastasis with primary lung cancer has been reported, the scalp lesion as a sole presenting feature of underlying quiescent squamous cell lung cancer, which is described here, has not been reported frequently.
