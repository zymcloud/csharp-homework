Objective:Overexpression of phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis of gastric carcinoma. Here we examined what alterations occur in the phenotype of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo when PRL-3 expression is knocked down.Methods:We constructed a small interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing vector which stably interfered with PRL-3 expression and was transfected into SH101-P4 cells, which express the highest PRL-3 mRNA levels among 13 gastric cancer cell lines. The new SH101-P4 subclones, in which PRL-3 was stably reduced, were established and their in vitro growth, motility and abilities of liver metastasis from the injected spleen were analyzed in vivo.Results:PRL-3 knockdown effectively suppressed invasion and growth of SH101-P4 cells in vitro. Liver metastasis in vivo was significantly decreased when PRL-3 expression was suppressed. The primary tumor size in the injected spleen tended to be smaller in PRL-3 knockdown clones than in the controls. These findings suggest that PRL-3 expression may contribute not only to the establishment of metastasis but also to the growth of primary foci of human gastric cancer. Therefore, PRL-3 may be one of the target molecules in gastric cancer therapy.
