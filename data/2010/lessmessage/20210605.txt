Purpose:Optimal treatment for liver metastases from gastric cancer remains a matter of debate. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of liver-only metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma.Materials and methods:We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 29 patients who developed liver-only metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma and subsequently underwent gastric resection and RFA (n = 20) or gastric resection and systemic chemotherapy (n = 9) between January 1995 and February 2008. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and was compared using the log rank test to evaluate RFA efficacy.Results:Twenty patients who underwent RFA showed a median overall survival of 30.7 months (range: 2.9 to 90.9 months), a median progression-free survival of 6.8 months (range: 0.8 to 45.2 months), and median overall one-, three-, and five-year survival rates were 66.8%, 40.1%, and 16.1% respectively. The RFA group showed a 76% decreased death rate compared to the chemotherapy-only group (30.7 months versus 7 months, hazard ratio, 0.24; p = 0.004). Most patients tolerated RFA well, and complications were found to be minor (transient fever (20%) and/or right upper quadrant pain (25%)). One case of treatment-related death occurred due to sepsis that originated from a liver abscess at the ablation site.Conclusions:The data suggest that a use of RFA as a liver-directed treatment may provide greater survival benefit than chemotherapy and is an alternative option for the treatment of liver-only metastases from gastric cancer.
