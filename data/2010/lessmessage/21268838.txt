Tumor-associated antigens 45, 57, 80 and 130 kDa were detected using tumor-specific rabbit immune serum in the fraction enriched with plasma membrane of the rat Zajdela hepatoma cells and isolated on the immunosorbent. Revealed proteins were identified as integrin beta-1, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-3 (E-NPP3), basigin, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein chaperones--glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) A1 by mass spectrometry technique. Functions and characteristics of these proteins in tumor cells and some aspects of the Zajdela hepatoma cells origin are discussed.
