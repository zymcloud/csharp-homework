Using Seidel ascites hepatoma as a model, we studied in detail changes in cell population size and in the level of reactive oxygen species in the tumor growth zone and in the blood plasma of tumor carrier. It was found that reduction-oxidation conditions in the blood plasma and in the tumor growth zone were different. Thus, because of hyperactivity and increase in the number of leukocytes, the blood plasma exhibited strong oxidative stress inducing damage to healthy cells, whereas the tumor growth zone showed the decrease in macrophage concentration, as well as in oxygen and ROS levels. These conditions favor intensive growth of tumor cells.
