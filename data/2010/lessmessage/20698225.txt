Background/aims:Recent studies have shown that overexpression of c-jun activation domain binding protein 1 (JAB1) and reduced expression of p27(kip1) are associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis in several human cancers. Here, We investigated the functional role and correlation of JAB1 and p27(kip1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:Immunohistochemical study for JAB1, p27(kip1) was performed on 76 cases of HCC and adjacent nontumorous tissues. 6 Fresh specimens of HCC and the adjacent liver tissue were collected for Western blot analysis. The influence of As2O3 on HCC SMMC-7721 cells, was detected by flow cytometry and Hochest staining. The expression and subcellular localization of p27(kip1) and JAB1 were investigated by Western blot and immunofluorescence.Results:The expression of JAB1 was higher but p27(kip1) was lower in HCC than that in adjacent liver tissue. As2O3 treatment inhibited the growth of SMMC-7721 cells. In As2O3-treated cells, p27(kip1) expression was increased while JAB1 was decreased. The location of p27(kip1) and JAB1 were transferred from cytoplasm to nucleus.Conclusions:In HCC, JAB1 was inversely correlated with p27(kip1). As2O3 attenuated the expression of JAB1, disturbed the location and expression of p27(kip1), which may participate in regulating the growth of human hepatoma cells.
