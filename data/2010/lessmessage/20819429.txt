Ten rabbits implanted with VX2 liver tumours were investigated by perfusion computed tomography (PCT) imaging 1 week (early) and 2 weeks (late) after tumour induction; 10 other rabbits were non-implanted controls. Time-density curves, perfusion parametric maps and perfusion parameters were obtained for tumour rim and normal tissue surrounding the tumour, and for liver tissue from the controls. In addition, microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were studied by immunohistochemistry 2 weeks after tumour implantation. A deconvolution mathematical model was used to calculate hepatic blood flow (HBF), hepatic blood volume (HBV), mean transit time (MTT), capillary vessel surface permeability (PS) and hepatic arterial index (HAI). At the tumour rim on the early PCT scan, MTT was significantly lower whereas HBF, HBV, HAI and PS were significantly higher than in surrounding normal tissue. There were no significant changes in perfusion parameters on the late PCT scan compared with the early scan. Significant linear correlations of MVD and VEGF were found with HBF, PS and HAI, but not with HBV or MTT. It is concluded that PCT imaging is useful for the evaluation of tumour angiogenesis and for the early detection of liver tumours.
