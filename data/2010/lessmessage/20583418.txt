Background/aims:The survival duration for patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with main portal vein thrombosis (MPVT) was usually less than 3 months. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether treatment can prolong the survival for such patients.Methodology:Retrospectively we analyzed the clinical features and outcomes of 63 patients with HCC and MPVT over a 7-year period. Three therapeutic modalities--transcatheter arterial chemotherapy (TAC) with or without radiotherapy (RT), and systemic chemotherapy--were applied.Results:The patients were divided into two groups: 34 (54%) patients were treated, while the remaining 29 (46%) were not. Multivariate analysis revealed that Child-Pugh class, Okuda stage for HCC and the presence of treatment were the principal factors to predict survival. The survival was significantly longer in treated patients than those untreated both in the Child-Pugh class A or B patients. Significantly longer survival is evident in patients treated by TAC combing RT compared to those underwent TAC alone, systemic chemotherapy or no treatment.Conclusions:The survival of Child-Pugh class A or B patients can be extended by the use of an appropriate therapeutic modality. TAC combined with RT did the best benefit to prolong survival in such patients.
