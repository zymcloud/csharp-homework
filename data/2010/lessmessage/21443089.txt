Background/aims:Chemoembolization in the presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is thought to be hazardous and such patients are regarded as prognostically poor.Methodology:One hundred sixty two patients with biopsy-proven and unresectable HCC were treated with chemoembolization (TACE). We retrospectively analyzed these patients according to presence or absence of PVT.Results:We found the 2 groups were similar with respect to tumor and liver parameters. Survival was 22.3 months in responders and 6.6 months in non-responders, p Conclusions:In this series, response was a major determinant of survival, regardless of the presence or absence of PVT. Thus, branch PVT was not a contraindication to chemoembolization.
