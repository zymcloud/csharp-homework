Background:Gastric cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies worldwide. More than 50% of all patients present with advanced stage of disease, with long-time survival of less than 5%. In selected subgroups, palliative gastric resection seems to be beneficial for survival and improved quality of the remaining life time, but is still controversially discussed.Patients and methods:We report 3 cases of patients with intestinal-type advanced gastric cancer. All patients presented preoperatively with stage IV disease with liver metastases. The patients underwent palliative gastric resection and subsequent palliative chemotherapy. We performed a genome-wide DNA analysis of 9 gastric cancer tissue specimens using the DNA microchip array technique.Results:4 and 6 years after palliative surgery and chemotherapy, 2 of the patients show no signs of recurrence, while the third patient shows stable disease under third-line chemotherapy 4 years after the initial diagnosis. Comparative genetic analysis of 9 gastric cancer tissue specimens suggested that the degree of chromosomal aberration was closely related to survival for intestinal-type gastric cancers.Conclusions:Palliative gastric resection is beneficial for survival and quality of life in selected patients. Determination of the degree of chromosomal aberrations might be helpful in predicting the response on multimodal treatment in intestinal-type gastric cancer. A better understanding of molecular biology is needed to define prognosis markers and molecular targets.
