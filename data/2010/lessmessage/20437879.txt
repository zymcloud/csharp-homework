Bone metastases account for 10% to 30% of secondary tumors in all cancer types. In patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bone metastases are usually treated by nonoperative procedures including pain medication, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and bisphosphonates. Surgical treatments include vertebrectomy, reconstruction with a cage or polymethylmethacrylate bone cement, and stabilization with pedicle screws. Sacroplasty to treat bone metastases from HCC has been rarely reported in the literature. We describe the case of a patient with vertebral metastases of HCC treated by this approach. A 65-year-old man had undergone a hepatic segmentectomy in 2004. In May 2008, after several weeks of back pain and bed rest, the patient underwent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the abdominal and pelvic spine, which revealed metastatic lesions in S1-S5 on the right and S1-S2 on the left. Sacroplasty was performed on all lesions without complications. The patient was discharged from the hospital the same day of the procedure. Two months later, he reported pain relief and improvement in walking. Due to the technical feasibility, low complication rate, and immediate relief of symptoms, sacroplasty for HCC metastases of the sacrum may be considered a valid therapeutic option.
