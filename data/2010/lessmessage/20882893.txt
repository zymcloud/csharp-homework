Ovarian borderline tumor (BOT) with noninvasive implants traditionally is considered to be non-aggressive. Recurrences are delayed and transformations to high-grade carcinoma are rarely documented. We report on a patient with BOT with early recurrence and high-grade carcinoma transformation in a short interval after complete laparoscopic staging. A 27-year-old unmarried woman presented with a 26 cm in size ruptured left ovarian mass. Laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy with right ovarian biopsies, multiple peritoneal biopsies, omental biopsy and washing cytology were performed. FIGO Stage I ovarian serous borderline tumor with microinvasion was confirmed. About ten months later, a 15 cm in size left BOT recurred and was resected by laparoscopic cystectomy including staging surgery. Seven months after the second surgery, we found a pelvic mass by sonogram and elevated CA125. A third diagnostic laparoscopy revealed invasive serous carcinoma with multiple peritoneal implants. In spite of radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient died of a progressive metastatic liver tumor. A case of early recurrence with malignant transformation of BOT is presented together with a brief review.
