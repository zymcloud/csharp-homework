Objective:The objective of this study was to determine the sequential CT findings of controlled hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with main portal vein (MPV) thrombosis with the use of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and additional intra-arterial cisplatin infusion.Materials and methods:From January 2004 to September 2006, 138 patients with HCC invading MPV were referred to the angiography unit of our institution for chemoembolization and additional intra-arterial cisplatin infusion. Until August 2008, seven (5%) of 138 patients were followed-up and found not to have tumor recurrence. CT scans were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists, focusing on the following parameters: the extent of portal vein thrombosis, the diameter of the affected portal vein, and enhancement of portal vein thrombosis.Results:THE EXTENT OF PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS AT THE INITIAL PRESENTATION WAS VARIABLE: left portal vein (LPV) and MPV (n = 1), right portal vein (RPV) and MPV (n = 3), as well as RPV, LPV and MPV (n = 3). The extent and diameter of the affected portal vein decreased during follow-up examinations. In addition, the degree of enhancement for tumor thrombi and serum alpha-feto-protein levels decreased after the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Portal vein thrombosis was found to be completely resolved in one patient, whereas residual thrombus without viability was persistent in six patients.Conclusion:If chemoembolization is effective in patients with HCC that invades the portal vein, the extent and enhancement of portal vein thrombosis is reduced, but residual thrombosis frequently persists for months or years, without evidence of a viable tumor.
