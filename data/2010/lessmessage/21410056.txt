Background/aims:To investigate in patients the relationship between hepatocellular carcinoma and expression levels of cytochrome P450 IIE1 and glutathione S-transferaseP1Methodology:Peripheral blood was collected from 65 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 65 healthy controls. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used in this research.Results:The average mRNA levels of CYPIIE1 in HCC and healthy controls are 11.09% and 2.13%, respectively, while the average mRNA levels of GSTP1 in HCC and healthy controls are 0.61% and 2.34%, respectively. The mRNA level of CYPIIE1 was higher, and that of GSTP1 was lower, in patients with HCC compared to healthy controls. The difference of the mRNA levels of two enzymes in HCC has a statistical significance (p Conclusions:In this group of HCC patients and healthy controls, we found that patients with HCC tended to have higher expression of CYPIIE1 and lower expression of GSTP1. Our study indicate that CYPIIE1 is maybe the ruinous gene that results in an increased incidence of HCC, while GSTP1 is maybe the protection gene for hepatic cells during the whole course of metabolization.
