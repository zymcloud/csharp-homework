Background and aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a well-known consequence of chronic liver disease (CLD). The aim of this study was to extract the HCC incidence rate in the province of Kerman, located in southern part of Iran, and compare the data with other parts of the country.Materials and methods:All medical records related to HCC were collected through hospitals or outpatient services in public or private centers. The records of all oncology, radiotherapy, and pathology centers in Kerman province were actively searched between 1999 and 2006. The annual incidence of HCC around the country was calculated, using the national cancer registry database provided by the Health Ministry of IR Iran from 2005 to 2006. Using Stata version 8, the crude and age-sex-standardized annual incidence rates were computed.Results:The crude annual incidence rates of HCC per 100,000 persons in Kerman and Iran were 0.522 (95% CI = 0.238- 0.88) and 0.199 (95% CI = 0.167-0.234), respectively. When adjusting for age and sex, the annual incidence rates of HCC in Kerman and Iran were 0.7 (95% CI = 0.4-1.1) and 0.2 (95% CI = 0.2-0.3) per 100,000 persons, respectively (PConclusions:In general, the incidence of HCC is not very high in Iran; however, the higher incidence of HCC in Kerman and also the lower age of onset mandates further research to detect HCC's risk factors in this part of country.
