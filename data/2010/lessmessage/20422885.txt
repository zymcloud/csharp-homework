Background/aims:The aim of this study is to elucidate the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of metastatic liver cancers.Methodology:From 74 patients with metastatic liver cancers treated by RFA, 40 patients including 23 colon cancer who had received curative resection of the primary tumor were analyzed.Results:Recurrence of the tumor was observed in 29 (72.5%) patients. The most prevalent site of recurrence was the liver in both colon cancer (10/15, 66.7%) and non-colon cancer patients (12/14, 85.7%). Among the recurrence in the liver, the rate of intrahepatic distant recurrence (recurrence outside of the RFA-treated segment) was high in both colon cancer (55.6%) and non-colon cancer patients (69.0%). Local recurrence (recurrence at the RFA-treated segment) rate was low (32.6% and 32.9%, respectively) and none of single tumor less than 2 cm in diameter showed local recurrence. The intrahepatic recurrence was single in 67.6% of the patients and 59.1% of the patients were re-treated by RFA.Conclusions:RFA is a less-invasive method for the treatment of metastatic liver tumors and can be performed repetitively. Although the rate of intra-hepatic distant recurrence and extra-hepatic recurrence was high, good local control can be achieved by RFA.
