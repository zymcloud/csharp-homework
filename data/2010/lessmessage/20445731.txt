The peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare pathology with unspecific symptoms reason to be a difficult diagnosis. We report a case of a 58 year old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, arterial hypertension and smoking; without precedent of asbestos exposure. The patient presented a one month history characterized by progressive increase of the abdominal volume and sensation of fullness; three weeks later they added breathlessness and hyporexia. The patient was in regular general condition; he was not presenting hepatic stigmas, edema or adenomegalies. The examination of thorax and cardiovascular it was normal. The abdomen distended by ascites, not painful, liver and spleen not examined. Laboratory: Hemoglobin 11,9 gr/dl, WBC 6840/mm3 Bands 1 %, lymphocytes 10 %, platelets 620000/mm3, PT 12 seconds, PTT 34 seconds, glucose 158 mg/dl, BUN 20,5 mg/ dl, creatinine 1,2 mg/dl, proteins 6,1 gr/dl, albumin 2,6 gr/dl. LDH 316 U/l, beta2microglobulin 2,2 mg/l (0.83-1.15 mg/l). HBV and HCV negative. Ca 19.9, CEA, AFP and PSA negative. Hemocultive negative. Ascitic fluid: ADA 20,3 U/l, serum-ascitic albumin gradient (SAAG) 1,1. Leukocytes 2237 cells/mm3, PMN 6 %, lymphocytes 90 %, mesothelial cells 4 %, proteins 4,6 gr/dl, albumin 2,34 gr/dl, glucose 44 mg/dl, LDH 1918 U/l. Gram and cultive: negatives. BAAR and cultive: negative . Cytology: mesothelial cells with changes of type reagent, Block cell for tumour cells: negative. Abdominal US: increased peritoneum and abundant ascitic fluid. Thoracic-abdominal CT: left side pleural effusion, severe ascites with thick epyplon. Upper GI endoscopy: moderate gastritis. Colonoscopy: two small sessile polyps in sigmoid colon. The finds of the laparoscopy were interpreted like carcinomatosis or peritoneal tuberculosis. The report of the peritoneal biopsy was informed as suggestive of undifferentiated carcinoma; the reappraisal with inmunohystochemic (calretinin +,cytokeratin +, vimentin +) indicated malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, type epithelial. The evolution was torpid. The patient was transferred to the Service of Oncology where they initiated chemotherapy with Cysplatin (CDDP) and died 20 days later. The malignant mesothelioma peritoneal is a unfrequent entity, with limited therapeutic options; generally detected late, with a palliative treatment.
