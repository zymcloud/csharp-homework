Aim:Application of a drug delivery device for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Clinical and radiological treatment assessment.Patients and methods:24 patients with liver cirrhosis and uni- or multifocal HCC underwent TACE with doxorubicin beads (DC Bead). The underly-ing cause of liver cirrhosis was hepatitis (A: n = 7; B: n = 10) or alcohol consumption (n = 7). Patients presented with Child Pugh stage A (n = 15) and B (n = 9). The mean intrahepatic tumor size, considering the sum of diameters of all lesions treated, was 3.83 cm (+/-2.4). Liver function and hematological parameters were documented before and after each TACE. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before and 4 weeks after TACE. The T1-w 3D volume-interpolated breathhold exam (VIBE) sequence was applied for evaluation of the therapy response.Results:24 patients received a total number of 69 TACE treatments with DC beads (mean dose 160 mg). The elevation of liver function parameters after treatment did not affect the patients' clinical condition. The T1-w VIBE sequence proved very valuable for assessment of the intrahepatic tumor spread. Post-contrast images enabled delineation of the viable HCC lesions, hence facilitating the selective transcatheter approach. The tumor marker a-fetoprotein (AFP), available in 19/24 patients, dropped from 347.5 to 299.5 ng/ml, without being a reliable predictor of treatment response. A decrease of tumor size after TACE from 3.83 (+/-2.40) to 3.01 cm (+/-2.67; p Conclusion:TACE with DC beads in HCC offers a safe and efficient treatment resulting in tumor response within a very short time.
