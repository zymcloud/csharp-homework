Background/aims:The incidence of local recurrence of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (15 mm or less) was compared retrospectively between a group treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using cool-tip (Radionics, USA) 10-mm electrodes and a group treated with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI).Methodology:There were 23 patients who were treated for a total of 25 tumors during a 3-year period at our hospital. Ten of the tumors (11.1 +/- 2.7mm) were treated with RFA using cool-tip 10-mm electrodes and 15 tumors (10.6 +/- 2.7 mm) were treated with PEI. After treatment, progression was evaluated in enhanced CT scans every 3-6 months to confirm presence or absence of local recurrence.Results:The number of recurrences, mean observation period, and mean recurrence period in the RFA group were 2 (20%), 6.6 months, and 6 months. The number of recurrences, mean observation period, and mean recurrence period in the PEI group were 2 (13.3%), 19.1 months, and 18 months. The period between treatment and recurrence tended to be longer in the PEI group than in the RFA group to be significant p Conclusions:The results suggest that PEI treatment is more effective in local treatment of hypervascular HCC with tumor diameters of 15 mm or less.
