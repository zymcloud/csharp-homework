Deregulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several malignancies. This study aimed to investigate the association of changes in circulating IGF-1 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The radioimmunoassay was used to analyze serum IGF-1 levels of 65 HCC patients and 165 healthy subjects. Serum IGF-1 levels were significantly decreased in the HCC patients as compared with the healthy subjects (158.46+/-105.07 vs. 247.63+/-149.96 ng/mL, P
