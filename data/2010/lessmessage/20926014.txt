This study was designed to investigate the in vivo growth inhibitory effects of celecoxib, a cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, and fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line, BEL-7402. Athymic nude mice implanted with BEL-7402 cells were given celecoxib and fluvastatin, either alone or in combination, and the effect of treatment on tumour growth was evaluated after 6 weeks. The combination of celecoxib and fluvastatin enhanced inhibition of tumour growth, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of tumour cell proliferation, and inhibition of tumour angiogenesis compared with either treatment alone. The combination of celecoxib and fluvastatin also increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1), decreased levels of p-Akt, myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) and survivin protein, but had no effect on Akt protein levels in tumours. These results suggest that celecoxib combined with fluvastatin would be more efficacious for the treatment of HCC than either treatment alone and this combination of therapy warrants further research.
