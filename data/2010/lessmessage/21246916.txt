Introduction:Hepatic resection is the accepted treatment for various liver tumors. Increasing evidence suggests that two factors significantly influence outcome and successfulness of the hepatic resection in patients with HCC in cirrhosis. There are liver function recovery and the degree of inflammation during early postoperative period.Objective:Aim of this study was to determine whether probiotic use influences on liver function recovery, degree of inflammation during early postoperative period, intraoperative risk, type and frequency of intraoperative and postoperative complications, morbidity, intraoperative and early postoperative mortality and a one-year survival rate in patients who have been used probiotic, and underwent the hepatic resection due to HCC in cirrhosis.Patients and methods:Study was conducted on 120 patients underwent the hepatic resection due to HCC in cirrhosis. This study has been done in University Clinical Centers Tuzla, Maribor and Strasbourg from October 2006 till February 2008. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) patients with liver cirrhosis and histologically verified HCC whom underwent liver resection surgery (segmentectomy/ bisegmenctetomy, right and left hemihepatectomy/extended hemihepatectomy) that used preoperatively and postoperatively probiotics (n = 60), 2) a control group of patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC, which did not use preoperative and postoperative probiotics (N = 60). Treatment with probiotics was conducted 3 days preoperatively and postoperatively with 7 day's oral supplementation.Results:This study have shown next: patients underwent to the hepatic resection due to HCC in cirrhosis who have been used preoperatively and postoperatively probiotic had liver function recovery better and faster, acute immune response better, serum level of tumor markers lower, intraoperative and postoperative complications were less frequent, and morbidity and mortality rates were lower than in those who have not been using probiotic.Conclusion:Probiotic use may make liver function recovery better and increases immune response in early postoperative period and positively influences outcome and successfulness of the hepatic resection in patients with HCC in cirrhosis.
