Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a serological marker currently available for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (CHC). Its poor sensitivity renders it unsatisfactory for this purpose and suggests the need for additional biomarkers. Squamous cell carcinoma associated antigen (SCCA) is physiologically present in the skin and was recently detected in patients with CHC. Additionally, circulating immunoglobulin M complexes associated with SCCA (CICSCC) and AFP (CICAFP) have been identified in the blood of these patients.Material and methods:The accuracy of the new biomarkers in detecting CHC was evaluated in 72 patients using an ELISA test. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for each marker alone and all markers combined for their ability to detect CHC and discriminate between CHC and hepatic cirrhosis (CH).Results:The median AFP was 402.000 ng/mL (IQR 23.267-1210.000) in CHC and 4.950 ng/mL (IQR 3.213-11.678) in CH patients (p Conclusion:This study suggests that using a combination of AFP, SCCA, CICSCC, and CICAFP in clinical practice may provide a new test which could increase accuracy ofCHC noninvasive diagnosis.
