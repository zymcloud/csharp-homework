Purpose:To describe a case of uveal metastasis secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The authors present a 57-year-old man with known diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, with progressive visual problems in his right eye. Work-up including indirect ophthalmoscopic examination, ocular ultrasonography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a dome-shaped choroidal mass abutting the optic disk with surrounding shallow exudative retinal detachment.Results:A fine-needle biopsy of the lesion confirmed the presence of malignant cells suggestive of metastatic disease from hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was subsequently treated with brachytherapy. The patient died 3 weeks after the treatment due to pneumonia, which was felt to be unrelated to his ocular disease.Conclusion:This is a report of a very unusual case of hepatocellular carcinoma with metastasis to uveal tract.
