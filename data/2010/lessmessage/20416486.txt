Purpose:The objective of this study was to investigate the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging features of focal liver lesions (FLLs) in fatty liver.Method:One hundred FLLs in 98 patients with fatty liver were evaluated with real-time CEUS.Results:All malignant FLLs showed hyperenhancement in arterial phase and contrast washout in portal and late phases. Among the FLLs, 3.3% of hemangiomas, 12.5% of focal nodular hyperplasias (FNHs), and 2.5% of focal fatty sparing lesions showed contrast washout in the late phase. The sensitivity and specificity for the characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma, metastasis, hemangioma, FNH, and focal fatty sparing lesions were 100% and 95.6%, 60% and 100%, 93.3% and 98.6%, 87.5% and 97.8%, and 92.6% and 100%, respectively.Conclusions:Correct characterization of FLLs in fatty liver by CEUS is possible based on their typical enhancement patterns.
