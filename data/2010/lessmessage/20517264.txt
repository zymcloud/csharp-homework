The purpose of this study was to prove the use of interventional radiological procedures before and after liver transplantation (LT). Between 1998 and 2009 years, 54 LT were performed in 52 patients. 18 patients received 19 interventional radiological treatments including 11 preoperative (trans-catheter oily chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma, n=3; transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, n=8) and 8 postoperative (drainage or stenting of biliary strictures, n=4; balloon dilatation and/or stenting of inferior vena cava or cava-caval anastomosis, n=3; splenic artery embolization in sleal syndrome, n=1). It is concluded that before LT, trans-catheter embolization delays the growth of hepatoma and prolongs time for donor liver waiting. Transjugular portosystemic shunt decreases the risk of fatal variceal bleeding. Post-LT complications such as vascular or biliary strictures and steal syndrome can be also effectively corrected by methods of interventional radiology.
