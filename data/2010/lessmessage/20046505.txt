We report a case of an adenoma arising from an ectopic adrenal gland mimicking a hepatocellular carcinoma in a heavy alcohol abuser. A MDCT showed a 2.7 low-attenuating nodule in segment VII of the liver through all CT phases. Compared to a precontrast image, however, a subtle enhancement was noted on the arterial phase CT image. On T1 weighted in- and opposed-phase MR images, an abundant fat component within the lesion was seen. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR images after administration of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) more clearly depicted hypervascularity and wash-out of the lesion on arterial and portal phases, respectively. On delayed hepatobiliary phase MR images, obtained 20 minutes after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration, subtle uptake or retention of the contrast agent by the lesion was suspected. A tumorectomy was performed and adrenal adenoma from an ectopic adrenal gland within the liver was confirmed.
