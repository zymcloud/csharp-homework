A large cohort of unresectable and untransplantable biopsy-proven HCC patients was rank-ordered for survival. Non-random clustering by age was noted, with 3 sub-cohorts of younger patients with survival in the range of 90-360 days. One sub-cohort had a predominance of females. Tumor numbers were well monitored by serum AFP, but tumor mass was better monitored by serum GGTP. In contrast to the older patients, the probability of hepatitis appeared to have a major impact on their survival and these patients tended to have larger numbers of smaller tumors, consistent with the idea of a hepatitis-mediated carcinogenic field defect.
