The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic features and Hepatitis B virus genotypes in HBV-infected patients in the Upper Egypt. Eighty-three HBsAg-positive patients (28 carriers, 14 with chronic hepatitis, 32 with liver cirrhosis and 9 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were enrolled. Blood was collected and serum samples obtained were screened for Hepatitis markers genotyping was conducted for 6 HBV genotypes (A through F) using a method for genotyping HBV by primer specific polymerase chain reaction. Genotype D was the only genotype detected in different clinical forms of chronic HBV infection (carriers, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) and, in all patients who had elevated or normal alanine aminotransferase levels and in all ages. HBeAg was absent in 78 patients suggesting the presence of pre-core or core mutations. Positive correlation was found among serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), histological activity index and grade of hepatitis. This study provides the first indication about the clinicopathologic features of HBV-infected patients in the Upper Egypt. It also reports the predominance of genotype D in this region.
