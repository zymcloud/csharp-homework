Endocan plays a role in tumour angiogenesis and tumour growth. The aim of this study was to detect the expression of endocan in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumour-associated endothelial cells and to correlate endocan expression with clinicopathological parameters and tumour angiogenesis. Tumour tissues and surrounding non-cancerous hepatic parenchyma from 42 primary HCC patients were studied. Endothelial cells were isolated using magnetic microbeads conjugated with anti-CD31 and endocan expression was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Endocan was significantly over-expressed in endothelial cells isolated from HCC tumours compared with corresponding non-cancerous liver tissues. In addition, the endocan mRNA level was significantly correlated with the serum alpha-fetoprotein level, intra-tumoural microvessel density, vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA, and vascular and venous invasion. The over-expression of endocan in tumour endothelial cells was closely related to the process of angiogenesis and pathogenesis in HCC, and suggests that endocan might be a useful marker for HCC progression.
