Background:The clinical course of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection varies with ethnicity. Little is known about the clinical presentation of chronic HBV infection in Asian Americans.Objectives:To define the clinical presentation of chronic HBV infection in Asian Americans.Methods:This is a retrospective study that used systematic chart review and statistical analysis to investigate 213 Asian-American patients with chronic HBV infection who presented to a university medical center.Results:This cohort included 55.8% male patients, 97.9% were born outside the US, and 52.3% reported a family history of HBV infection. Of the 56 patients with liver biopsy, 34.0% had stage 3 to 4 fibrosis. In patients with available data, 21.5% were hepatitis B e antigen positive [HBeAg (+)] and 31.1% had HBV DNA levels >1 x 10(6) copies/mL. Patients with HBeAg (+) HBV infection were diagnosed at a younger age (P=0.002) and with higher alanine aminotransferase (P=0.001) and HBV DNA (P=0.001) levels. Although only 3.3% presented with obesity (ie, body mass index >or=30 kg/m2), 43.4% had evidence of hepatic steatosis. Presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma was associated with an older age at diagnosis (PConclusions:Chronic HBV infection in foreign-born Asian Americans was characterized by a low rate of HBeAg (+) and male predominance as well as high rates of family history of HBV infection, hepatic fibrosis, and hepatic steatosis.
