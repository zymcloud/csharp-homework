Background:Eosinophilic hepatic pseudotumors (EHP) are known complications of visceral larva migrans (VLM). By radiologic studies, EHP can be suspicious for primary or metastatic hepatic neoplasia. Diagnosis of an EHP by fine needle aspiration (FNA) led to the diagnosis of Toxocara VLM in a patient with suspected hepatic neoplasia.Case report:A 38-year-old Cambodian man had hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis with grade III portal fibrosis diagnosed in 2003. He had had negative routine alpha-fetoprotein and radiologic screening for hepatic neoplasia until 2006 when abdominal computed tomography revealed a 1.6 x 1.2-cm, ill-defined hypodense lesion in segment VII. Biopsy was recommended in order to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma. FNA of the lesion contained abundant Charcot-Leyden crystals, degenerating eosinophils and necrotic debris. Work-up for nematode larva migrans was recommended. Toxocara antigen IgG titer was significantly elevated leading to a presumptive diagnosis of VLM, and therapy for Toxocara-induced VLM was given.Conclusion:Identification of abundant Charcot-Leyden crystals and necrotic eosinophils in an FNA of the liver led to appropriate ancillary diagnostic tests and therapy for visceral larva migrans.
