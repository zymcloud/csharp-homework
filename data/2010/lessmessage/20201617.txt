Chronic hepatitis caused by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the main source of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and extra-hepatic diseases. After treatment-induced resolution of hepatitis C, the persistence of HCV RNA in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is often observed. An expression of the precursor of microRNA-155 (miR-155) called BIC can be the factor responsible for a course of HCV infection. Therefore, we assessed the relationship between BIC expression and HCV RNA status in sera and PBMCs samples of 64 hepatitis C patients treated with interferon alpha(IFN-alpha)+ribavirin. High expression of BIC in PBMCs was determined in 100% of patients that harbored HCV RNA in serum and PBMCs. Further, we found that 83% of PBMCs samples were BIC-positive in a group of patients that eliminated HCV RNA only from serum. The lowest expression of BIC was found in patients that eliminated HCV RNA from both serum and PBMCs.
