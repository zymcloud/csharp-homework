Purpose:Many human blood proteins are synthesised in the liver. Their serum levels may decrease or increase due to liver disorders and some of them serve as useful biomarkers. Determination of serum concentration of different biomarkers has important role in diagnosis of liver diseases and in monitoring the course of disease. In this work 3 serum markers associated with liver disorders were compared. The aim was to assess whether these biomarkers exhibit specific distribution pattern in different types of liver disease: liver neoplasia (primary hepatocellular carcinoma [HC] or metastatic liver disease [MLD] from colon cancer), viral hepatitis C (HCV) and the parasitic infection echinococcosis.Methods:Serum concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), ferritin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were determined in patients with liver disease and compared between patient groups and with healthy persons.Results:Serum AFP and ferritin levels exhibited similar pattern of change in patients with liver neoplasia or HCV, and concentrations of these 2 markers were significantly increased compared to the control group (p Conclusion:The results have shown that each hepatic pathology studied exhibited specific profile of the analysed set of biomarkers. Therefore, the simultaneous determination of the 3 mentioned biomarkers may help in differential diagnosis of liver diseases.
