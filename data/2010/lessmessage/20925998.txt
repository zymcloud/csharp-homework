Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with iodized oil and anticancer agents is widely used for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. To assess C-arm angiographic computed tomography (CCT) for detecting iodized oil retention during TACE, CCT images were obtained of 40 tumours (24 HCC patients). The primary CCT images showed complete iodized oil retention patterns (type I) in 29/40 (73%) tumours, at which point embolization was terminated; incomplete iodized oil retention requiring further iodized oil embolization occurred in 11/40 (28%) tumours and, of these, complete iodized oil retention patterns were achieved in eight tumours. Conventional CT scanning employed 1 week later showed the same iodized oil retention patterns as demonstrated in the latest CCT images (37/40 [93%] tumours). In 24 additional HCC patients who underwent TACE but not CCT (control group), conventional CT scans obtained 1 week after TACE showed complete iodized oil retention in 32/42 (76%) tumours. The rate of complete iodized oil retention pattern was significantly higher in patients undergoing CCT. It is concluded that the distribution of iodized oil within HCC lesions can be demonstrated on CCT images during TACE, helping to achieve complete iodized oil filling of tumours and, thereby, improving therapeutic effects.
