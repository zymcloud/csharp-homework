Purpose:This study evaluated the usefulness of regular check-ups by ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced imaging for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a retrospective analysis.Patients and methods:From April 2001 to March 2007, 240 consecutive patients with HCC who were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) were divided into three groups. Patients diagnosed with HCC by repeated imaging constituted Group A (surveillance group). Group B comprised patients in whom HCC was detected during scheduled doctor visits for liver disease or other diseases such as diabetes. Group C comprised non-screened patients.Results:The prevalence of solitary tumors decreased from Group A through Group B to Group C (66, 48 and 24%, respectively, P Conclusions:Regular surveillance with ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced imaging is useful for detecting early-stage HCC and increase chances for curative treatments in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease.
