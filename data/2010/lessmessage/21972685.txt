Aim:We present a rare case of concomitant echinococcus and hepatocellular carcinoma in a single lesion, and discuss the possible pathogenesis.Material and methods:A 64-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with a few months' history of weakness, weight loss and abdominal discomfort. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a cystic lesion measuring 10 cm in diameter in the segments 2 and 3 and multiple well-enhanced nodules adjacent to the cystic portion in the segments 4,5,8.Results:The diagnosis was confirmed intraoperativelly--a hepatocellular carcinoma complicated with echinococcal cyst of the liver. A left trisectionectomy was performed. Mebendazole treatment was begun.Conclusion:The simultaneous occurrence of echinococcosis disease and hepatocellular carcinoma is quite rare. Both of these diseases are chronic processes, and this further raises the possibility that echinococcosis could have had a role in the development of the liver cancer.
