Merkel cell carcinoma is a primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. It is a highly aggressive tumor which commonly metastasizes to lymph nodes, liver, lung and bone. The diagnosis is based on histology and immunohistochemistry. Renal metastasis, with sparing of other common sites of hematogenous spread (lung and liver), is a unique feature of this case.
