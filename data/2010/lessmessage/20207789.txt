Background:Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (UES) is the fourth most common hepatic malignancy diagnosed in children, but is extremely rare in older patients. Classification of the tumor is difficult because of its unknown etiology.Purpose:The purpose of this study is to describe a case of UES in a 19-year-old pregnant woman with UES who delivered a stillborn fetus and passed away because of UES, and how medical imaging can be used to help differentially diagnose UES.Conclusion:A multiphase liver computed tomography protocol best demonstrates all forms of liver cancers and lesions; therefore, it is the scan of choice when a liver abnormality is suspected but the type of lesion is unknown.
