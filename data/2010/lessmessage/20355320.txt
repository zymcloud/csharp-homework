Lichen phenolic compounds exhibit antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiproliferative, and cytotoxic activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anticancer activity of lecanoric acid, a secondary metabolite of the lichen Parmotrema tinctorum, and its derivatives, orsellinates, obtained by structural modification. A cytotoxicity assay was carried out in vitro with sulforhodamine B (SRB) using HEp-2 larynx carcinoma, MCF7 breast carcinoma, 786-0 kidney carcinoma, and B16-F10 murine melanoma cell lines, in addition to a normal (Vero) cell line in order to calculate the selectivity index of the compounds. n-Butyl orsellinate was the most active compound, with IC50 values (the concentration that inhibits 50% of growth) ranging from 7.2 to 14.0 microg/mL, against all the cell lines tested. The compound was more active (IC50 = 11.4 microg/mL) against B16-F10 cells than was cisplatin (12.5 microg/mL). Conversely, lecanoric acid and methyl orsellinate were less active against all cell lines, having an IC50 value higher than 50 microg/mL. Ethyl orsellinate was more active against HEp-2 than against MCF7, 786-0, or B16-F10 cells. The same pattern was observed for n-propyl and n-butyl orsellinates. n-Pentyl orsellinate was less active than n-propyl or n-butyl orsellinates against HEp-2 cells. The orsellinate activity increased with chain elongation (from methyl to n-butyl), a likely consequence of an increase in lipophilicity. The results revealed that the structural modification of lecanoric acid increases the cytotoxic activity of the derivatives tested.
