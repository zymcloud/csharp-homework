Aim:Patients were analyzed who underwent treatment of liver metastases from pancreatic cancer.Methods:Selection criteria were the possibility of R0 resection of the primary and/or the liver metastases, no other sites of metastases, and the presentation of liver metastases. A comparison of treatment by surgery versus chemotherapy regarding overall survival and disease-free interval was performed.Results:Between 1996 and 2008, a total number of 23 patients were retrospectively identified from a prospective database of 193 cases of pancreatic cancer. In 14 cases, liver metastases were found simultaneously, and in 9 cases metachronously, fulfilling the abovementioned selection criteria. Of these, 13 patients underwent surgery and 10 were treated by gemcitabine. There were no differences in survival in patients with synchronous liver metastases of pancreatic cancer treated by resection of the primary combined with partial hepatectomy versus treatment by gemcitabine (8 vs. 11 months). In patients with metachronous liver metastases, the median survival was increased after liver resection compared to patients who were treated with gemcitabine (31 vs. 11 months).Conclusions:Simultaneous resection of pancreatic cancer and liver metastases cannot be recommended. Resection of metachronous liver metastases of pancreatic cancer seems to improve survival in highly selected patients.
