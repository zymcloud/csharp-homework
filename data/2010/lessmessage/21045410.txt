We report the postmortem findings in a 28-year-old immunocompetent male patient, a rare case of tuberculous liver abscesses with concomitant pericardial abscess in the absence of pleuropulmonary or splenic involvement, who continued to be a diagnostic dilemma. This case report illustrates the difficulty in reaching the correct diagnosis in case of hepatic masses, which are most often confused with carcinoma of the liver, primary or metastatic and, hence, have been aptly referred to as pseudotumoral hepatic tuberculosis in the past.
