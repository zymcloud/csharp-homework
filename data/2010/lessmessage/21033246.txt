Very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) belongs to the low density lipoprotein receptor family, it is divided into two subtypes according to forms with an absence (type II) or a presence (type I) of the O-linked sugar domain. VLDLR have been detected in kinds of cancers so far; however, the subtype of VLDLR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and hepatoma cell lines has yet to be reported. We detected the VLDLR expression in 39 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and in three kinds of hepatoma cell lines: HepG2, HBV transfected HepG2.2.15, SMMC-7721 and normal human fetal liver cell line LO2 using RT-PCR and western blotting. The results showed that both type I and type II VLDLR were detected in HCC tissues and hepatoma cell lines, and the type II VLDLR expression was significantly higher than that of type I in cell lines. We inhibited the type II VLDLR expression by shRNA-mediated RNA interference in HepG2, SMMC-7721 cell and then subsequently found the cell proliferation slowed down. The cyclinD1 expression confirmed the cell cycle was arrested at the G0/G1 phase, suggesting that inhibiting the type II VLDLR expression may have a positive impact on carcinogenesis of HCC.
