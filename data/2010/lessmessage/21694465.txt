In this study, we examined the level of Golgi protein 73 (GP73) in the serum of 9 patients as a function of anti-liver cancer treatment. Although the numbers are small, a clear trend was observed. Patients who remained tumor free (up to 6 years post-treatment) showed reductions in GP73 at the first time point available post-treatment. In contrast, patients who had high levels GP73 post treatment all had re-occurrence within a 5 year period. These data are preliminary but dramatically imply that this marker may have value in the monitoring of HCC patients and may be elevated even when small, undetectable tumors are present.
