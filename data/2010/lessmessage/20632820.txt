Aims:Recent study indicates that the binding of caveolin-1 (CAV1), the essential constituent of caveolae, to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) prevents nitric oxide (NO) production in cirrhotic human liver. However, their interplay in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undetermined.Methods:Paraffin-embedded sections from 73 HCC patients were included in this study. The expression patterns of CAV1 and eNOS determined by immunohistochemistry were correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival.Results:Although CAV1 expression did not correlate with any clinicopathological characteristic, increased CAV1 expression was associated with prolonged overall survival (p = 0.021), even when using the multivariate Cox's regression model (OR = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.08-0.72, p = 0.011). eNOS expression was correlated with an increased histological grade (p = 0.002) and intriguingly, the patients had a decreased overall survival when their lesions presented with high eNOS but low CAV1 expression concomitantly (p = 0.003). Meanwhile, the increased CAV1/eNOS merged level determined by immunofluorescence was significantly associated with a decreased histological grade and better overall survival (p = 0.023 and 0.001, respectively).Conclusions:Our results suggest CAV1 may play a tumour-suppressive role and can serve as a predictive biomarker in HCC. The impacts of CAV1 on hepatocarcinogenesis may occur partly through its modulation of eNOS.
