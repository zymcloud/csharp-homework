Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor efficacy of treatment, identify prognostic factors, and construct a prognostic index in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated by transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) using cisplatin suspended in lipiodol.Methods:We analyzed the outcomes in a total of 94 consecutive patients with previously untreated hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated by TAI using cisplatin suspended in lipiodol.Results:Twenty-seven patients (29%) showed complete response and 21 patients (22%) showed partial response, with an overall response rate of 51% (95% confidence interval, 41-61%). The median survival time was 2.5 years and the proportions of survivors at 1, 2, and 5 years were 81.6, 65.2, and 18.3%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis indicated a significant association of serum albumin > or =3.0 g/dL, maximum tumor size Conclusions:TAI with cisplatin suspended in lipiodol exhibited favorable tumor efficacy and survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognostic factors identified and the index proposed based on these factors may be useful for predicting life expectancy, determining treatment strategies, and designing future clinical trials.
