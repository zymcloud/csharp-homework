Liver transplantation is an important treatment option for selected patients with nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several reports have suggested a lower risk of posttransplant tumor recurrence with the use of sirolimus and a higher one with calcineurin inhibitors, but the selection of an ideal immunosuppression protocol is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to define the immunosuppression associated with the best survival after liver transplantation for HCC. It was based on the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and included 2,491 adult recipients of isolated liver transplantation for HCC and 12,167 for non-HCC diagnoses between March 2002 and March 2009. All patients remained on stable maintenance immunosuppression protocols for at least 6 months posttransplant. In a multivariate analysis, only anti-CD25 antibody induction and sirolimus-based maintenance therapy were associated with improved survivals after transplantation for HCC (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-0.9, P Conclusion:According to these data, sirolimus-based immunosuppression has unique posttransplant effects on HCC patients that lead to improved survival.
