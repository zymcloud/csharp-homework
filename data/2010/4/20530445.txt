Aim:To analyse the prognostic factors for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy with third generation agents or epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) for recurrence.Patients and methods:Between 1997 and 2005, 479 patients underwent a complete resection for NSCLC. Of these, 112 patients underwent chemotherapy for postoperative recurrence.Results:Median postrecurrence survival time for these 112 patients was 25.6 months. Univariate analysis showed female gender, age younger than 65 years, ECOG performance status of 0-1, never-smoker status, and adenocarcinoma prolonged survival, whereas metastasis to the liver or adrenal gland shortened survival. Multivariate analysis revealed age, performance status, cell type and metastasis to the adrenal gland to be independent prognostic factors.Conclusion:Age, performance status, cell type, and metastasis to the adrenal were independent prognostic factors in NSCLC patients treated with third-generation agents or EGFR-TKI for recurrence.
