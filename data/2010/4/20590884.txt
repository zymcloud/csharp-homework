Background:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads (DEB) is a new treatment modality. Little is known about prognostic factors affecting survival after DEB TACE for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients who underwent TACE with doxorubicin DEB for unresectable HCC during 2006-2008 were studied. Survival was calculated from the day of first transcatheter therapy. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimations. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test.Results:Fifty patients underwent chemoembolization with doxorubicin DEB. They included 39 women and 11 men, with a median age of 57.5 years (range 28-91 years). Eighteen patients died during the study period and 32 remained alive. Overall survival rates at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years from the first administration of doxorubicin DEB TACE were 71%, 65% and 51%, respectively. Prognostic factors found to be significant on univariate analysis were Child-Pugh class, Okuda staging, bilirubin > 2 mg/dl, albumin Conclusions:Child-Pugh class, Okuda staging, bilirubin > 2 mg/dl, albumin
