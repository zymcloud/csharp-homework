Objective:To identify the clinical features, diagnostic approach, and treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in young adult patients.Methods:A retrospective review was made of the clinical histories of patients under 50 years of age diagnosed with prostate cancer at the urology department of the National Institute for Neoplastic Diseases from 1952 to 2005. Demographic characteristics and data on history, symptoms, diagnostic procedures, treatment, and disease course were collected. Data were statistically analyzed and compared to information obtained from a literature search.Results:There were 69 patients aged less than 50 years who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, 60% of whom had metastatic tumors. Mean patient age was 45.5 years, with a lower range of 29. All patients reported bone pain, associated to other signs and symptoms such as spinal cord compression (19.5%), lower limb edema (17%), peripheral adenopathies (36.5%), and abdominal tumor (2.4%). All patients had bone metastases, of which 14.6% were in solid organs (lung and liver), 48.7% in retroperitoneum, and 7.3% in mediastinum. Initially, three patients were diagnosed a lymphoproliferative syndrome, one patient a retroperitoneal tumor of unknown etiology, and four patients a metastasis from an unknown primary tumor. Mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 795 ng/mL (3-6500). All pathologies were reported as poorly differentiated or undifferentiated. Mean survival was 16.1 months (1-84), and all patients died due to disease progression.Conclusions:Advanced prostate cancer is an uncommon condition in young adults. Its clinical presentation is atypical, as metastases may mimic other diseases. The course of disease is indolent, and prognosis is poor. In patients with risk factors, PSA testing should be started before 50 years of age.
