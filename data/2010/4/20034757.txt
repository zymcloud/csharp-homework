Background:Traditionally, a staged operative approach has been used for patients with synchronous colorectal cancer and liver metastases in the U.K. With improved outcomes from hepatic resection the role of a synchronous operative approach needs re-evaluated.Methods:32 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases that underwent a synchronous operative approach were individually case matched (according to: age; sex; ASA grade; type of hepatic and colonic resection) with patients that had undergone a staged approach. The following variables were analysed: operative blood loss; in hospital morbidity and mortality; duration of hospital stay; disease free and overall survival.Results:Operative blood losses were: synchronous group, median 475mL (range 150-850mL) vs median 425mL (range 50-1700mL), (p>0.050). There were no significant differences in morbidity: (34% synchronous group vs 59%, p=0.690) with no recorded mortality. Synchronous group had a shorter hospital stay (median 12 days [range 8-21] vs 20 [range 7-51], p=0.008). There were no statistical differences between synchronous and staged patients for disease free and overall survival: 10 months (95% CI 5.8-13.7) versus 14 (95% CI 12.2-16.3; p=0.487) and 21% versus 24% at 5 years (p=0.838).Conclusion:This present study provides supporting evidence for synchronous operative procedures in patients with colorectal liver metastases.
