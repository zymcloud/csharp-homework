Transplantation is the treatment of choice for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) meeting the Milan criteria. HCC and chronic liver diseases have distinct natural histories for which an equitable transplant policy must account. We enrolled and prospectively followed at a single center 206 consecutive HCC patients that presented within the Milan criteria. Patients were treated per the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) algorithm; 95% received resection, ablation, or transarterial chemoembolization. The median follow-up was 16 months. Progression occurred in 84 patients, and 8 patients died. Risk factors for the time to disease progression (death or progression beyond T2) were analyzed in 170 patients with a complete data set. Risk factors with the strongest relationship to progression included tumor diameter and tumor persistence/recurrence after local therapy (hazard ratios of 1.51 and 2.75, respectively, when transplanted patients were censored at the time of transplantation and hazard ratios of 1.53 and 3.66, respectively, when transplantation was counted as an event; P
