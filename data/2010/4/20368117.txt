Aim:To investigate the expression of JAK/STAT signal pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma, and to evaluate its clinical significance in the progression and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:196 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were examined for the expression of JAK-1 protein and STAT-3 protein by SABC immunohistochemistry.Results:The positive expression rates of JAK-1 protein and STAT-3 protein in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were significantly higher than those in 20 cases of normal liver tissue (P=0.02 and 0.01, respectively). There was no significant relation between the positive expression rates of JAK-1 protein and STAT-3 protein and patients'sex, age, tumor size, and cirrhosis of the hepatocellular carcinoma tissues (all P>0.05). The JAK-1 protein and STAT-3 protein were expressed more frequently in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues with incomplete capsule (P=0.01 and 0.008, respectively), venous tumor emboli (both P=0.02), poorly differentiated (P=0.01 and 0.009, respectively) or clinical III-IV stage (P=0.02 and 0.008, respectively) than in those with complete capsule, no venous tumor emboli, maturely differentiated or clinical I-II stage. Cox proportional hazard regression model analysis indicated that the expression of JAK-1 protein and STAT-3 protein was significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:The results suggest that the over-expression of JAK/STAT signal pathway may be an important feature of hepatocellular carcinoma.
