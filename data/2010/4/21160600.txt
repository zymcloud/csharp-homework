Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant tumor and extrahepatic metastasis is not rare. The most common organ of HCC metastasis is lung, followed by bone and adrenal gland. To the best of our knowledge, isolated pancreatic metastasis of HCC that developed after curative resection has not been described previously. We report a case of solitary pancreatic metastasis of HCC, which was found 28 mo after left hemihepatectomy for HCC. The lesion was successfully resected with the pancreas, and no other metastatic lesions have been found in follow-up.
