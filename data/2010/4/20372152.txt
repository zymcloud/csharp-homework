Background:Few studies have investigated incidence trends in the Philippines.Methods:From the databases of the Manila Cancer Registry, cumulative cancer incidence rates were determined for the five most common cancers for both sexes combined. Using joinpoint analysis, incidence trends for 1983-2002 were estimated.Results:Among females, increasing trends were found for breast, 5% annual change, lung (0.5%) and colorectal (1.5%) cancers. Decreasing trends were found for cancers of the liver (-1.2%) and cervix (-1.9%). Among males, increasing trends were found for lung cancer (0.5%), whereas liver cancer rates have been decreasing (-1.0%). Colorectal cancer rates fluctuated.Conclusion:Certain sites showed declining incidence trends, but incidence trends for lifestyle-related cancers continue to rise. The prevention of infection-related cancers should also receive priority, particularly by vaccination programmes.
