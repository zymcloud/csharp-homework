Objective:T To explore the relationship between the expression of SOX4 gene and early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection.Methods:SOX4 expression was detected immunohistochemically in 60 HCC patients including 30 with and 30 without early recurrence after curative resection, with 30 normal liver specimens as the control.Results:The expression of SOX4 was significantly higher in HCC than in normal liver (41.7% vs 16.7%, PConclusion:SOX4 is closely associated with early recurrence of HCC after curative resection, and its overexpression may contribute to early recurrence of HCC. SOX4 may serve as a new molecular indicator for evaluating the prognosis of HCC.
