A 53-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma underwent living donor liver transplantation. After transplantation, her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels decreased to 6.3 g/dl and 18.5%, respectively, during the course of 3 days. A contrast-enhanced abdominal computed axial tomography (CAT) scan showed a hemoperitoneum in the right perihepatic space with no evidence of abdominal wall hematoma or pseudoaneurysm formation. An angiogram of the deep circumflex iliac artery (DCIA) showed extravasation of contrast media along the surgical drain, which had been inserted during the transplantation procedure. Transcatheter embolization of the branches of the DCIA was successfully performed using N-butyl cyanoacrylate.
