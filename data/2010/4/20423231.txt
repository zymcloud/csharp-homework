There is no established systemic therapy for patients with stage IV melanoma refractory to prior systemic treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is capable of inducing T-lymphocyte cytotoxicity against melanoma in vitro and in vivo. Famotidine may enhance the activity of T-cells further by allowing for increased IL-2 internalization by the IL-2 receptor on lymphocytes. Cyclophosphamide may decrease the immunosuppressive effects of regulatory T-cells. Daily short intravenous (i.v.) infusions (pulses) of IL-2 were used to treat 14 patients with metastatic melanoma, all of whom had experienced disease progression despite prior systemic therapy. The patients received 21.6 million IU/m(2) of pulse IL-2 i.v. for 15-30 minutes, preceded by 20 mg of famotidine i.v. (13) patients received 350 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide i.v. on day 1 (1 patient did not). Eight (8) patients were treated in an oncology inpatient unit while, most recently, 6 patients have received therapy on an outpatient basis. The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression occurred. The patients included 10 males with a median age of 56 (range 31-87) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of -1 (range 0 - -1). Common metastatice sites included lymph nodes (13), lungs (8), liver (4), and subcutaneous (4). Prior systemic therapy included IL-2 (11), interferon (7), and chemotherapy (7). The median number of cycles the patients underwent was 3 with a range of 1-7. The most common toxic reactions were fever, rigors, nausea/emesis, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. One complete response and four partial responses were observed (response rate, 36%; 95% confidence interval: 14%-64%). Responses occurred in the lungs, liver, lymph nodes, and subcutaneous sites. The median response duration was 3.4 months, with a median survival of 8.3 months for the entire group. Six (6) patients remain alive with a median survival of 10.3 months. Pulse IL-2 with famotidine and cyclophosphamide produced activity in previously treated patients with melanoma and may be given on an outpatient basis to selected individuals.
