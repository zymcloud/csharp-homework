Pim-3, a proto-oncogene with serine/threonine kinase activity, was enhanced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. To address the roles of Pim-3 in HCC development, we prepared transgenic mice that express human Pim-3 selectively in liver. The mice were born at a Mendelian ratio, were fertile and did not exhibit any apparent pathological changes in the liver until 1 year after birth. Pim-3-transgenic mouse-derived hepatocytes exhibited accelerated cell cycle progression. The administration of a potent hepatocarcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), induced accelerated proliferation of liver cells in Pim-3 transgenic mice in the early phase, compared with that observed for wild-type mice. Treatment with DEN induced lipid droplet accumulation with increased proliferating cell numbers 6 months after the treatment. Eventually, wild-type mice developed HCC with a frequency of 40% until 10 month after the treatment. Lipid accumulation was accelerated in Pim-3 transgenic mice with higher proliferating cell numbers, compared with that observed for wild-type mice. Pim-3 transgenic mice developed HCC with a higher incidence (80%) and a heavier burden, together with enhanced intratumoral CD31-positive vascular areas, compared with that observed for wild-type mice. These observations indicate that Pim-3 alone cannot cause, but can accelerate HCC development when induced by a hepatocarcinogen, such as DEN.
