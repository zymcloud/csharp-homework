Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and one of the few malignancies with an increasing incidence in the USA. Imaging plays a crucial role in early detection, accurate staging and planning management strategies. Contrast material-enhanced MRI or computed tomography (CT) are the best imaging techniques currently available for the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC. The diagnosis of HCC is strongly dependent on hemodynamic features (arterial hypervascularity and washout in the venous phase) on dynamic imaging, and biopsy is no longer recommended for tumors with classical imaging features prior to treatment. The major challenge for radiologists in imaging cirrhosis is the characterization of hypervascular nodules smaller than 2 cm, which often have nonspecific imaging characteristics. In this review, we discuss the role of CT and MRI in the diagnosis and staging of HCC. The strengths and current limitations of these imaging modalities are highlighted.
