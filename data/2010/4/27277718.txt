Purpose:To clarify the usefulness of parametric imaging using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US) with Sonazoid by comparing parametric images of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with histopathological findings.Methods:Two patients with HCCs underwent CE-US with Sonazoid before surgical resection. A single focus point was set at the lower margin of the tumor, and a bolus intravenous injection of Sonazoid (0.5 ml) was administered. Images of the ideal scanning plane were displayed in real-time mode for the early vascular phase. We analyzed these images using prototype PC software. The software watches, pixel by pixel, the increase in the intensity due to the inflow of the microbubbles, and displays colors if the intensity becomes larger than a certain threshold. Parametric images were compared with histopathological findings.Results:The level of blood flow in the tumor could be visually evaluated using a single image by expressing the detailed hemodynamics of the tumor in terms of differences in color using a time axis appropriate for each case.Conclusions:Parametric imaging is a very useful way of facilitating straightforward visualization of the level of blood flow within HCC and the distribution of histopathological findings in single static images.
