Objectives:To describe clinical, biological characteristics and virological aspects of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Sera obtained from consent patients with clinical suspicion of HCC. Routine biochemical tests and serological markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis D virus (HDV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were searched. A hepatic ultrasound scan was realized and, when a suspected mass lesion was observed, ultrasonographic-guided fine needle aspiration of the hepatic mass lesion was made to ascertain the diagnosis of HCC.Results:One hundred and seventy-five sera were collected from 99 men and 76 women. Approximately 96.6% (169/175) of them had previous contact with HBV. HBs surface antigen was positive in 41% (69/169) of whom 53.6% (37/69) were co-infected by the HDV. Three patients (1.71%=3/175) were positive for anti-HCV antibodies. The other three patients (1.71%=3/175) did not present any markers for HBV or HCV. At the time of diagnosis, right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, cachexia, were present in all patients. An increase in serum transaminases (70%), high bilirubin concentrations (40%), high AFP levels (40%) and low prothrombin levels (52%) were the most frequent biological abnormalities. Only 17 guided fine needle aspirations of mass lesions were realized. The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by cytopathological examination for 14 of them.Conclusions:HCC is a frequent pathology in the Central African Republic (CAR). According to the ultrasound imaging data, patients consult at terminal stage of the disease. This study confirms also the association between HBV and HCC in CAR. Moreover, in 26.5% of patients HDV is associated with severe forms of the disease.
