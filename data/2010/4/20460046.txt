Objective:To investigate whether the polymorphism of DNA repair genes XPC (Ala499Val and Lys939Gln) and XPG (His1104Asp) is associated with the susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in 500 cases with HCC and 507 controls. Genotypes of XPC and XPG were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction with the TaqMan MGB probe.Results:Compared to the CC genotype, the CT genotype and the TT genotype of XPC Ala499Val were not associated with the susceptibility to HCC (adjusted OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.85-2.12; adjusted OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.68-2.51, respectively). Compared to the AA genotype, the AC genotype and the CC genotype of Lys939Gln were not associated with the susceptibility to HCC (adjusted OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.78-1.85; adjusted OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 0.88-3.73, respectively). Compared to the CC genotype, the CG genotype and the GG genotype of XPG His1104Asp were not associated with the susceptibility to HCC (adjusted OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.56-1.27; adjusted OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.67-1.87, respectively) However, the stratified analysis revealed that the females with the AC+CC genotype of XPC Lys939Gln had increased risk of HCC compared to those with AA genotype (OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.01-4.64).Conclusion:Our results suggest that XPC and XPG polymorphisms do not independently affect on the susceptibility to HCC, but the joint effect of C allele of XPC Lys939Gln and female may modify the risk of HCC.
