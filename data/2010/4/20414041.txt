Malignant transformation of an ovarian mature cystic teratoma is very rare; it arises in about 1-2% of all dermoid cysts. No standard treatment has been established for advanced and recurrent disease. In Case 1, a 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma arising from a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary after undergoing right salpingo-oophorectomy (RSO). She was treated with chemotherapy(TC), but the carcinoma recurred 2 months after completing first-line chemotherapy. She began second-line chemotherapy (PEC: CBDCA+PEP+etoposide), but became disoriented on the second day of treatment, and could not complete the schedule. She died 2 months after the recurrence. Case 2 was a 60-year-old woman diagnosed with stage Ic disease when she underwent a computed tomography scan during chemotherapy for breast cancer recurrence in her liver. She underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and was treated with chemotherapy (TC+trastuzumab). She received 5 courses, but the breast cancer metastases enlarged and her chemotherapy regimen was changed. Five months later, after completing 5 courses of TC+trastuzumab, she had disseminated recurrence in the pelvis and also had a mass. She developed ileus and underwent a colostomy. She then underwent transcatheter arterial embolization via the inferior mesenteric artery and received cisplatin (100 mg/body) as second-line chemotherapy. The tumor was reduced in size about 30%, for a partial remission. However, her breast cancer recurrence was exacerbated and she died. The results of TAE, however, showed that it may be an effective second-line therapy for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma arising from a mature cystic teratoma.
