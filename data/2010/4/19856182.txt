Background:Hepatoid carcinoma (HC) of ovary is a rare type of epithelial tumor composed mainly of epithelioid cells with abundant acidophilic cytoplasm, histologically indistinguishable from hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a previously unrecognized case of HC of ovary concurrent with a Sertoli cell tumor.Case report:A 42-year-old woman patient with a long-term history of hepatitis C presented with a mass of left ovary without evidence of hepatic tumor. After initial diagnosis of primary ovarian carcinoma (FIGO Stage I), she had experienced a first recurrence in upper abdomen. Histologically, the primary tumor was composed of epithelioid cells with "hepatoid features" in association with a sex cord stromal tumor of Sertoli-type. Immunohistochemistry hepatoid cells stained positively for hepatocyte paraffin-1, alpha-fetoprotein and alpha-1 antitrypsin; moreover, Sertoli-type cells were positive for alpha-inhibin, calretinin and CD99. A final diagnosis of HC concurrent with Sertoli-type tumor was made.Conclusion:The occurrence of this unreported association of HC with Sertoli-like tumor, the problems of differential diagnosis and therapeutic management of these tumors are the subject of this presentation. A diagnosis of ovarian metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma is easy in patients with known primary tumor of liver and should be always excluded in these cases as an hepatoid variant of yolk sac tumor. Immunohistochemistry is not useful in these cases. However, a combination of clinical and pathological features is necessary for a correct diagnosis.
