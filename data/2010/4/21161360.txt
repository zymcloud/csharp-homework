Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a major causative agent of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), encodes an oncogenic X protein (HBx) that transcriptionally activates multiple viral and cellular promoters. The present study aimed to identify the specific gene mutation related to the clinical outcome of HCC. Seventy-two HBV-infected patients (38 with chronic HBV infection and 34 with HCC) with well-characterized clinical profiles were enrolled. The HBx region was amplified from patient serum samples and analyzed by sequencing. Genotypes were determined using the National Center for Biotechnology Information genotype tool. All isolates were genotype B or C. Enhancer II nucleotide substitutions in the HCC group were significantly different from those in the chronic hepatitis B (CHB) group (Ρ 10(6) copies/ml) than in the low viral load group (≤10(6) copies/ml) (P = 0.03). The 1762/1764 double mutations may be related to the genotype and viral load. We found significantly more direct repeat sequence 1 (DR1) nucleotide substitutions in the HCC group (32.4%, 11/34) than in the CHB group (10.5%, 4/38) (Ρ
