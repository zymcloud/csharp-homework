Cancer chemotherapy in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers occasionally leads to acute hepatic failure (AHF) from viral reactivation resulting in an high mortality rate. In this situation, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) can be life saving. Herein we have reported 2 cases of successful LDLT performed for AHF caused by reactivation of HBV infection during chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. In case 1, a 38-year-old male HBV carrier with a neck mass was hisopathologically diagnosed as Hodgkin's lymphoma. During 4 cycles of chemotherapy he developed right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. Laboratory data (alanine amino transferase, 701 U/L, total bilirubin: 7.92 mg/dL, positive hepatitis B e antigen showed that he had experienced an acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis. Soon, he developed grade IV hepatic encephalopathy with a total bilirubin level of 50.56 mg/dL and a model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 40. After LDLT, he has been free of relapse for 52 months so far. In case 2, a 49-year-old male HBV carrier was diagnosed in the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. The patient had been under Imatinib treatment for 1 year until he was admitted for AHF. He developed grade II encephalopathy with a total bilirubin of 50.8 mg/dL. We performed LDLT; the patient has been free of relapse for 17 months. LDLT was a life-saving procedure for AHF caused by reactivation of HBV during chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. It can provide long-term survival if the coexistent hematologic malignancy has been controlled.
