A 75-year-old man received lung radiofrequency (RF) ablation to treat lung metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma. Massive hemoptysis occurred 1 week after lung RF ablation. Emergent contrast-enhanced CT and pulmonary arteriography revealed a pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm, which was embolized with coils. The postembolization course was uneventful. Hemoptysis did not recur for 5 months.
