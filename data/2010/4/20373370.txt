Liver problems caused by infection, cholestasis and sinusoidal liver injury in the months following HCT have become less frequent because of preventive and pre-emptive strategies. When patients develop jaundice after transplant, the time to search for treatable causes is early in the course of jaundice, as the risk of mortality rises steeply with small increments of serum bilirubin above normal. Chronic hepatitis C, persistent GVHD, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are significant liver problems in the longest-lived survivors of HCT.
