Background:Locoregional treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have evolved over the past 20 years. Interventional radiologists have developed an important role in the palliative and curative treatment of the disease. This review summarizes commonly used interventional radiological treatment protocols to assist practitioners in understanding the techniques used to treat HCC.Methods:Various searches were performed to evaluate recent publications regarding systemic treatments of HCC as well as transplant/surgery, chemoembolization, yttrium-90 radioembolization, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI).Results:No standard for chemoembolization was found. Two studies evaluating survival with chemoembolization vs medical therapy found benefits with the former. PEI offers favorable outcomes in small HCC but has increased recurrence and decreased long-term survival compared with RFA. Local recurrence, response rates, and mortality from RFA rival surgical resection in HCC less than 3 cm. Cryoablation appears to be effective, and yttrium-90 radioembolization is an additional tool.Conclusions:Chemoembolization improves survival and offers improved tumor response compared to systemic treatment. More studies are needed to standardize chemoembolization preparations and techniques. RFA provides better results than PEI but has not been compared with cryoablation. Radioembolization appears to be as effective as chemoembolization, but the preprocedure evaluation and costs may limit its use.
