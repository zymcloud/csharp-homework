Objective:The present study is a summary of syndrome types of gastric cancer in order of priority based on clinical practical situations, routine clinical syndrome differentiation and a large-sample clinical survey in 767 patients with gastric cancer.Methods:Based on the six-type classification of gastric cancer in a previous study, a bedside syndrome differentiation diagnosis was made simultaneously by two attending doctors of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM to avoid possible diagnostic bias. A clinical differentiation survey form designed under the direction of epidemiologists was filled out by patients with gastric cancer in multiple centers, and the results were digitally valued and statistically analyzed.Results:The symptoms and signs in each syndrome type of gastric cancer were ranked in order of priority as follows: distended pain, stringy pulse, eructation, mood-related pain, susceptibility to anger, acid regurgitation, hiccup, fullness sensation or distension after eating just a little, dizziness, thin pulse, abdominal enlargement, obstruction sensation after eating, moving pain, and uneven pulse in disharmony between liver and stomach; dark red tongue with little fur or a smooth surface, burning pain, rapid pulse, associated burning heat in anus, dry mouth, fissured tongue, thin pulse, tidal fever in the afternoon, nausea and vomiting, and night sweating in impairment of yin due to stomach heat; slender tongue fur, obstruction after eating, slow pulse, moderate pulse, rapid and irregular pulse, normal mood, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cold extremities, lower-extremity edema, cold intolerance, pale complexion, dizziness, emaciation, hiccup, silence, nausea, uneven pulse, acid regurgitation, fullness sensation or distension after eating just a little, vomiting, and constipation in deficiency-cold in spleen and stomach; uneven pulse, stabbing pain, tortuous sublingual vein, blue or purplish tongue, fixed pain, tarry stool or dark red stool, vomiting of dark red fluid, pale complexion, dry mouth without desire to drink, stringy pulse, white tongue fur, nausea, thin tongue fur, colic pain, hiccup, dizziness, acid regurgitation, bitter taste in mouth, slow pulse, rapid and irregular pulse, thin pulse, and pain relief by pressing in interior retention of toxin stagnation; slippery pulse, greasy and thick tongue fur, dry mouth without desire to drink, vomiting of bilious fluid, nausea, bitter taste in mouth, fullness sensation or distension after eating just a little, colic pain, and hiccup in stagnation of phlegm-dampness; abdominal pain relief by pressing, map-like tongue, thin pulse, weakness, yellowish complexion, dizziness, spontaneous sweating, fissured tongue, epigastric discomfort, night sweating, emaciation, cold intolerance, constipation, nausea, and dry tongue in deficiency of both qi and blood.Conclusion:The summarized syndrome types of gastric cancer from this study are consistent with the clinical situations and would prove to be more referential for TCM syndrome differentiation diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.
