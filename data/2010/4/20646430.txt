Objective:To evaluate the effect of technical improvements of transperitoneal radical nephrectomy on the patients with large renal cell carcinoma.Methods:From May 2002 until May 2009, 45 patients with large (> 12 cm) renal cell carcinoma underwent transperitoneal radical nephrectomy. A subcostal incision was selected to expose the extraperitoneal area. The modified operative methods included exposing the operative field via a liver retractor and initially ligating renal artery to block the blood supply of kidney and tumor. The method of tumor-free tissue dissociation was applied. Hem-o-lock was employed for clipping so as to avoid hemorrhage. This modified technique was evaluated in respects of operating time, estimated blood loss, intra-operative complications, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and pathological diagnoses.Results:The tumor diameter was from 12.2 cm to 28.3 cm with a mean of 14.5 cm. The mean operative time was (150 +/- 58) min and the average estimated blood loss (350 +/- 180) ml. Three cases received blood transfusion. The average length of hospital stay was (12 +/- 6) days. Three cases developed complications, including spleen injury in 2 and pancreatic injury in 1. The treatment modalities were splenectomy and resection of pancreatic tail respectively. The pathological diagnoses were all of renal cell carcinoma. The pathological stage included T(2)N(0 approximately 1)M(0 approximately 1)(n = 13), T(3)N(0 approximately 1)M(0 approximately 1)(n = 23), T(4)N(0 approximately 1)M(0 approximately 1)(n = 9). After a follow-up period of 3 - 63 months, 3 cases of tumor recurrence were found in primary renal clutch.Conclusion:Improved radical nephrectomy is feasible for large renal cell carcinoma. And it can reduce the volume of blood loss and decrease the occurrence of complications.
