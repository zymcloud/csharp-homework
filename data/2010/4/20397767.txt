Background:The purpose was to analyze the behavior of male breast cancer.Methods:Fifty-eight male breast cancer patients were treated at the HUCH during 1981-2006. Data on risk factors, tumor characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment and survival were obtained by chart review.Results:Presentation occurred at a median age of 63 years, most often due to a self-detected lump. The median size of the primary tumor was 1.8 cm and 14% were T4 tumors. Forty-seven percent had lymph node metastases and 4% distant metastases at diagnosis. Ductal carcinoma was the most common tumor type. All tumors with known receptor status were positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and 79% for progesterone receptor (PgR). Her-2 overexpression was found in 2/19 patients (11%). A family history of breast cancer, obesity, high alcohol intake and liver cirrhosis were the most often seen risk factors. Nineteen percent had one or two other malignancies, the most common second malignancy being prostate cancer in 7%. Ninety-seven percent were operated by mastectomy and 90% by axillary evacuation while sentinel node biopsy alone was done only in 7%. Sixty percent of the patients received radiotherapy, 64% adjuvant hormonal treatment, 20% adjuvant chemotherapy, and 2% adjuvant trastuzumab. Fourteen patients (25%) experienced a relapse of which 60% were distant, bone being the most common site. During follow-up 21 patients (37%) died, of whom nine of breast cancer and 12 due to other causes. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 75%.Conclusions:Male breast cancer behaves and is today treated in many respects like postmenopausal breast cancer. However, due to rudimentary breast tissue the symptoms, diagnosis and especially a higher amount of T4 tumors differ from that of females. Also the risk factor profile and histologic subgroups seem different. The 5-year OS of 75% is clearly higher than 44% reported at our institution in 1982.
