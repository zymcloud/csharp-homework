Objective:To investigate the risk factors and prognosis of patients with residual tumor after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The clinicopathological data of 114 patients with HCC undergoing RFA in our hospital from May 2000 to March 2007 were retrospectively studied, and the prognostic factors of residual tumor were analyzed.Results:After one session of RFA, 90 patients had complete ablation and 24 had residual tumor. The median overall survivals in the complete ablation group and residual tumor group were 40 and 29 months, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between those two groups (P = 0.242). 24 patients with residual tumor were re-treated by RFA or hepatectomy or TACE. Among them 11 patients achieved complete response and 13 incomplete response, their median overall survival were 53 and 28 months, respectively. There was no significant difference between first complete ablation group and second complete response group (P = 0.658). However, compared with the first complete ablation group, the incomplete response group had poor prognosis (P = 0.012). Multivariate analysis showed that tumor size > 3 cm (P = 0.007) and proximity to a large vessel (P = 0.042) were independent risk factors for residual tumor after RFA.Conclusion:Tumor size > 3 cm and proximity to a large vessel are independent risk factors for residual tumor after RFA. Further treatment of residual tumor is necessary to eliminate the tumor and improve prognosis.
