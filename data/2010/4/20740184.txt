Bladder cancer usually spreads via the lymphatic and hematogenous routes, the most common sites of metastases of urinary bladder cancers being the regional lymph nodes, liver, lung, bone, peritoneum, pleura, kidney, adrenal gland and intestines. Generalized lymph node metastasis of transitional cell cancer of the bladder is extremely rare. According to our literature search, there has been no case report of transitional cell cancer of the bladder that manifests as an extensive large lymph node metastasis involving the intraparotid, supraclavicular thoracic inlet, axillary and regional abdominal and pelvic lymph nodes without bone or visceral organs involved. Such a presentation could be mistaken as malignant lymphoma and the importance of a biopsy of the lymph nodes is emphasized. The clinical course of rapid progression of the disease and the presence of wild-type p53 with rapid response to chemotherapy and a short remission may represent a unique case, which is discussed here.
