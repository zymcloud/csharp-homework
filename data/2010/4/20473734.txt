Objective:To observe the clinical combination effect of Jinlong Capsule (JLC) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on the patients with primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) and JLC' s influence on serum osteopontin (OPN) expression and elucidate the correlation between the serum OPN level and curative effect of JLC and TACE.Methods:A total of 98 patients with PHC were observed in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). They were assigned to the Chinese medicine (CM) group (53 patients who were treated with TACE and JLC) and the intervention group (45 patients who were treated with TACE only). The serum OPN levels were measured before and after treatment by quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Forty healthy people were assigned to the control group. The clinical efficacy was observed and Karnofsky score (KPS) was graded.Results:The clinical efficacy of the CM group (60.38%) was better than that of the intervention group (40.00 %), and the KPS (84.35+/-12.19) was higher than the intervention group (69.86+/- 11.58) (PConclusions:The short-term clinical efficacy and the quality of life of patients with PHC can be improved by combining JLC with TACE. The serum OPN levels in PHC patients can reflect the curative effect of treatment and the prognosis of the disease.
