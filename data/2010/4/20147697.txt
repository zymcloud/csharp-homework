Objectives:We sought to identify cross-sectional hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV prevalence among Asian Americans at a community health fair and to assess referral rates.Methods:We determined HBV prevalence with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). We determined HCV prevalence with hepatitis C antibodies. Successful referral occurred when participants with HBV or HCV were contacted, medically evaluated, and given contact information of liver specialists for care.Results:Of 202 people screened, 118 were Asian Americans (65 Chinese and 39 Vietnamese). Twelve had chronic HBV with positive HBsAg. However, chronic HBV prevalence increased from 10.2% to 13.6% by concomitant HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs testing. Prevalence of HCV was 6% overall but 15.4% among Vietnamese. Overall, 83% of patients with chronic HBV and 100% of patients with occult HBV or HCV were successfully referred.Conclusions:Concomitant HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs testing permits diagnosis of chronic, occult HBV infections missed by testing with HBsAg alone. Persons identified with HBV or HCV at community health fairs can be successfully referred.
