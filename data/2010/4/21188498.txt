Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been associated with the clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which range from spontaneous recovery to hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study involving subjects from eastern Turkey, the frequencies of HLA-B35, HLA-CW4, HLA-DQ2, and HLA-DQ8 were markedly higher in the chronic HBV group than those in the spontaneously recovered group; the frequencies of HLA-A11 and HLA-A24 in the nonresponsive HBV vaccine group were markedly higher than those in the responsive HBV vaccine group; and the frequency of HLA-CW6 in the nonresponsive HBV vaccine group was significantly lower than in the responsive group. A complete understanding of HLA types associated with the progression to chronic HBV infection and their effects within the cell at the molecular level will be an important contribution in the development of new HBV vaccines and new treatment strategies for chronic HBV infection.
