Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is an uncommon clinicopathological variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The etiology of FL-HCC is unknown, but FL-HCC is not associated with hepatic viruses or alcohol. Hepatocellular carcinoma usually occurs in cases of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, whereas FL-HCC predominantly occurs in a normal liver and in younger adults. Fibrolamellar HCC shows relatively slow growth, and late recurrence is common. Repeated resections for recurrences should be considered not only because there is a lack of other effective treatment options but also because FL-HCC shows a relatively better prognosis after a resection in comparison to common HCC. This report presents a case of a rare mediastinal metastasis from FL-HCC in a patient who had undergone a previous resection for retroperitoneal metastasis after the initial hepatic operation. This is the second report of the same case. This patient also had a mediastinal neurogenic tumor, and these mediastinal tumors were concurrently resected.
