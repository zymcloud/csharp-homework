Background:The active form of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is involved in the initiation, generation, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and is up-regulated in inflammation-associated malignancies. We investigated the dynamic expression of NF-kappaB and its influences on the occurrence of HCC through antiangiogenic (thalidomide) intervention in NF-kappaB activation.Methods:Hepatoma models were induced with 2-fluorenylacetamide (2-FAA, 0.05%) in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and thalidomide (100 mg/kg body weight) was administered intragastrically to intervene in NF-kappaB activation. The pathological changes in the liver of sacrificed rats were assessed after hematoxylin and eosin staining. NF-kappaB mRNA was amplified by RT-nested PCR. The alterations of NF-kappaB and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting.Results:Rat hepatocytes showed denatured, precancerous, and cancerous stages in hepatocarcinogenesis, with an increasing tendency of hepatic NF-kappaB, NF-kappaB mRNA, and VEGF expression, and their values in the HCC group were higher than those in controls (PConclusion:NF-kappaB is overexpressed in hepatocarcinogenesis and antiangiogenic treatment down-regulates the expression of NF-kappaB and VEGF, and delays the occurrence of HCC.
