The sodium iodine symporter (NIS) or mutant Herpes-simplex virus type1 sr39 thymidine kinase (HSV1-sr39tk) gene is used for in vivo imaging and cancer therapy. Transfection of both NIS and HSV1-sr39tk genes to hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7/NTG) could enhance intracellular accumulation of therapeutic radionuclides and guanosine nucleoside analogue prodrugs to produce better outcomes than single gene therapy. Non-invasive imaging with I-124, F-18 FHBG and combination therapy with I-131 and GCV were performed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells transfected with NIS, HSV1-sr39tk and GFP. Our results show that: (1) all three genes are stably expressed in Huh-7/NTG cells, (2) I-125 and H3-PCV uptake were markedly increased in the Huh-7/NTG cells in vitro, (3) cellular survival and tumor growth of Huh-7/NTG was inhibited by I-131 or GCV both in vitro and in vivo, and was much prominent with combination therapy, (4) in vivo imaging with I-124 and F-18 FHBG revealed increased uptake in the Huh-7/NTG tumor. Our results demonstrated the potential of combination gene therapy using NIS and HSV1-sr39tk followed by radioiodine treatment and chemotherapy in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
