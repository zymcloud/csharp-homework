Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), one of the most advanced loco-regional ablative therapeutic methods, is widely utilized in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of its minimal invasiveness and high efficacy, RFA has been regarded as a curative therapy as alternative to surgical resection and liver transplantation. It brings new hope and a new treatment pattern for small HCC. In this article, we summarize the important role of RFA in the treatment of small HCC according to our clinical experience over six years. The prognosis of small HCC after RFA is comparable to that of surgical resection but with higher safety, less complications, wider applicability, and good long-term survival. RFA will play a more and more important role in the clinical treatment of small HCC.
