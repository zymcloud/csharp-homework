Hepatic resection remains the only curative option for the majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who do not meet criteria for transplantation or local ablative options. As the majority of patients with HCC also have underlying chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, post-hepatectomy complications can be significant, and in some prohibitive. The technique of portal vein embolization (PVE) has evolved to increase the candidacy of patients for major hepatectomy, as well as improve postoperative outcomes and safety. This review will focus on PVE and discuss our institution's experience with uses and limitations of this technique for HCC.
