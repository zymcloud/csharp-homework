Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have shown to benefit from tamoxifen treatment. The mechanisms of tamoxifen effects in HCC, however, are not yet clearly understood. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway is involved in cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. Over-expression of survivin has played an important role in leading to antiapoptosis. The current study investigated changes in mTOR pathway and survivin expression in hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 treated with tamoxifen. We detected apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma cells by flow cytometry assay. Survivin transcription level and p70S6k was demonstrated by PCR, dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis respectively. Our results are showed as follows: tamoxifen leads to apoptosis of the cells, and reduction in survivin expression, as well as a dramatic reduction in the activated form of p70S6 kinase. Twenty micromoles tamoxifen treatment significantly depresses transcription of survivin mRNA. Treating HepG2 cells with rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, significantly reduce survivin protein level but did not affect survivin transcription, which indicated that tamoxifen and rapamycin were synergistic in regards to down-regulation of survivin expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results suggest that tamoxifen down-regulate survivin expression in HepG2 cells is mediated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional level via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to induce apoptosis.
