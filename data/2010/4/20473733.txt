Objective:To observe the efficacy of Chinese medicine comprehensive therapeutic project in treating the middle/late stage primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC).Methods:With prospective randomized controlled design, 97 patients with PHC were assigned to the test group (49 cases) treated with Chinese medicine comprehensive therapy using Oleum fructus bruceas intervention combining oral intake of Ganji Decoction and external application of Ailitong, and the control group (48 cases) treated with chemotherapeutic agents combining iodized oil chemo-embolization and analgesics. The immediate and long-term efficacy, adverse reaction, pain-relieving initial time (PRIT) and pain-relieving sustained time (PRST) of the treatment, as well as the change in relieving patients' quality of life (QOL) were observed.Results:The difference between the two groups in illness control rate was statistically insignificant (P>0.05), but the adverse reaction occurrence rate in the test group was lesser than that in the control group (P0.05), but the PRST was significantly superior in the test group than that in the control group (10.37+/-2.18 h vs 7.78+/-1.95 h, PConclusion:Chinese medicine comprehensive therapy is an effective treatment for the middle/late stage patients of PHC, and it could extend the PRST, improve the patients' QOL and long-term survival with less adverse reaction.
