Polarized epithelial cells develop and maintain distinct apical and basolateral surface domains despite a continuous flux of membranes between these domains. The Na(+)/H(+)exchanger NHE6 localizes to endosomes but its function is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that polarized hepatoma HepG2 cells express an NHE6.1 variant that localizes to recycling endosomes and colocalizes with transcytosing bulk membrane lipids. NHE6.1 knockdown or overexpression decreases or increases recycling endosome pH, respectively, and inhibits the maintenance of apical, bile canalicular plasma membranes and, concomitantly, apical lumens. NHE6.1 knockdown or overexpression has little effect on the de novo biogenesis of apical surface domains. NHE6.1 knockdown does not inhibit basolateral-to-apical transcytosis of bulk membrane lipids, but it does promote their progressive loss from the apical surface, leaving cells unable to efficiently retain bulk membrane and bile canalicular proteins at the apical surface. The data suggest that a limited range of endosome pH mediated by NHE6.1 is important for securing the polarized distribution of membrane lipids at the apical surface and maintenance of apical bile canaliculi in HepG2 cells and hence cell polarity. This study underscores the emerging role of the endosomal recycling system in apical surface development and identifies NHE6 as a novel regulatory protein in this process.
