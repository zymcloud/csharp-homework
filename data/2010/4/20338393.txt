Aim:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemo-lipiodol infusion (TACL) in high-risk patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:From January 2005 to April 2009, 96 patients underwent TACL. All patients had diffuse, infiltrative or multifocal tumours. Twenty-nine (30%) patients had an increased serum bilirubin level (>or=2mg/dl), and 75 patients (78%) had a low serum albumin level (Results:TACL was technically successful in all patients. After TACL, 18 (19%) of the 96 patients showed tumour response using computed tomography (CT) criteria. The 30 day mortality and morbidity rates were 1 and 2%, respectively. The median survival period was 8.6 months, and the overall 6 month, 1, 2, and 3 year survival rates were 59, 44, 26, and 15%, respectively. Portal vein occlusion (pConclusions:TACL can be performed safely in high risk HCC patients resulting in a median survival rate of 8.6 months in the present series.
