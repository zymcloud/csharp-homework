The importance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a subject of debate. This study sought to identify independent risk factors involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection who have normal ALT values. Data from 381 consecutive hepatitis B patients were analyzed with average ALT integration values 3 years. Integration values were calculated from biochemical tests, and serological markers associated with the cumulative incidence of HCC were analyzed. HCC developed in 17 of the 381 patients (4.5%) during the follow-up period. Male sex (hazard ratio, 6.011 [95% confidence interval: 1.353-26.710], P = 0.018), high HBV-DNA levels (> or = 5.0 log copies/ml; 5.125 [1.880-13.973], P = 0.001), low platelet counts (
