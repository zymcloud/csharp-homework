Background:Prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor because of high recurrence rate. We examined preoperatively the methylated CCND2 gene levels present in the serum following release from HCC cells as a prognosis predictor in patients undergoing curative hepatectomy.Methods:Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and quantitative methylation-specific PCR were used to measure methylated CCND2 gene and its mRNA levels.Results:The CCND2 mRNA levels were down-regulated in HCC with early intrahepatic recurrence (IHR) within 1year of curative hepatectomy. We also identified that this down-regulation was due to promoter hypermethylation. In 70 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy, 39 patients sero-positive for the methylated CCND2 gene (>70pg/ml serum) exhibited a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) period (P=0.02) than the 31 patients who were sero-negative for the methylated CCND2 gene. None of the sero-negative patients demonstrated early IHR, and this method of serum testing did not produce any false-negative predictions for early IHR. Multivariate analysis showed that the serum level of methylated CCND2 was an independent risk factor for DFS (hazard ratio of 1.866, 95% CI: 1.106-3.149).Conclusion:Methylated CCND2 gene in the serum serves as a prognosis predictor of HCC after curative hepatectomy.
