Objective:To observe the effect of ultrasound microbubble carrying herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.Methods:Kunming mice were inoculated subcutaneously with H22 tumor cells. 40 male mice bearing subcutaneous hepatoma were randomized into 4 groups: PBS (group A), HSV1-TK (group B), HSV1-TK (group C), and microbubble carrying HSV1-TK (group D) were injected into the tail vein every 3 days. Mice in group C and D were exposed to ultrasound. The expression of TK protein was detected by western blot. Ganciclovir (GCV) was intraperitoneally injected at a dose of 100 mg x kg (-1) x d(-1) in group B, group C and group D. The tumor size was measured every 2 days.Results:TK gene could be injected precisely into hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasound monitor, and the expression of TK protein was found in all 4 groups. Expression in group D was higher than others (P Conclusion:Ultrasound microbubble not only improve target gene therapy, but also enhance transfection efficiency.
