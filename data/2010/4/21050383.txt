Voriconazole is a second-generation triazole antifungal approved for the treatment of invasive fungal infections, particularly with Aspergillus, Candida, Fusarium, and Scedosporium spp. Frequently reported adverse effects of voriconazole include visual disturbance (21 %), elevated liver enzymes (15.6 %) and rashes (7 %), which are largely attributable to drug-induced photosensitivity. We report a case of serious phototoxicity in a 8 year old boy who underwent chemotherapy for AML. He received voriconazole for the treatment and subsequent re-infection prophylaxis after pulmonary aspergillosis. One year after the start of therapy he developed blistering eruptions on his face after minimal sunlight exposure. Recent reports about the development of squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, respectively, in children during and after oral therapy with voriconazole seem to warrant systematic follow-up investigations of all voriconazole-treated patients.
