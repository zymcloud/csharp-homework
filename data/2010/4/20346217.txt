Background and objective:Single mode of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) often leads to limited ablation in the zone of necrosis. This study clarifies the efficacy of combining temperature- and power-controlled RFA for malignant liver tumors.Methods:Between April 2008 and August 2008, 58 patients with malignant liver tumors received RFA at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. The patients were divided into 2 groups using a random number table: one group received combined temperature- and power-controlled RFA (the combination group), and the other group received power-controlled RFA alone (the control group).Results:Three patients were lost to follow-up and 55 patients were included for evaluation. Twenty-five patients with 29 tumors were treated by the combination RFA, and 27 tumors (93.1%) achieved either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). One patient had a seriously decreased heart rate. In the control group, 30 patients with 32 tumors received power-controlled RFA, and 29 tumors (90.6%) achieved CR or PR. There were no serious complications. There was no difference between the combination and control groups in treatment time ((13.3 +/- 1.3) min vs. (10.2 +/- 2.3) min, P = 0.459). The number of sessions of RFA for the combination group was less than that of control group (1.3 sessions vs. 2.4 sessions), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.579).Conclusion:RFA controlling both temperature and power is effective and safe for patients with malignant liver tumors, and the number of sessions of RFA for the combination group was less than that of the control group.
