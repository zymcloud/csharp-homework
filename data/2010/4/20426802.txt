Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is increasingly regarded as a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, and the severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease seems to increase in parallel with other features of metabolic syndrome. Excess lipid accumulation in the liver cells is not only a mediator of Metabolic Syndrome and indicator of a lipid overload but also accompanied by a range of histological alterations varying from 'simple' steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, with time progressing to manifest cirrhosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma may also occur in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis -related cirrhosis with a mortality rate similar to or worse than for cirrhosis associated with hepatitis C. This review summarizes the knowledge about the causal relationship between hepatic fat accumulation, insulin resistance, liver damage and the etiological role of hepatic fat accumulation in pathogenesis of extra- and intra-hepatic manifestations. Special emphasis is given suggestions of new targets treatment and prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
