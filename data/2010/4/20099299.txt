No adequate randomized trials have been reported for a comparison between hepatic resection (HR) versus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of patients with very early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), defined as an asymptomatic solitary HCC 0.3%. The 95% confidence intervals for the difference in overall survival were -0.18-0.18 years between group I and II, 0.06-0.36 years between group I and III, and 0.13-0.30 years between group II and III, respectively.Conclusion:Primary percutaneous RFA followed by HR for cases of initial local failure was nearly identical to HR for the overall survival of compensated cirrhotic patients with very early stage HCC.
