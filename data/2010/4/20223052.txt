Introduction:In 2004, an audit in our unit demonstrated wide variation in liver resection rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) metastases within the cancer network. Subsequently, a network-wide CT-based follow-up and referral policy was introduced for all patients. A second audit was performed to assess the impact of the guidelines on liver resection rates.Subjects and methods:Analysis of prospective liver resection database between 1997 and 2004 and after the introduction of standardised guidelines between January 2005 and April 2008.Results:A total of 362 patients underwent liver resection for CRC metastases between 1997 and 2008, 237 prior to the introduction of the referral guidelines and 125 after. Liver resection rates according to referring hospital varied from 0.92 to 2.32 per 100,000 population before guidelines were introduced. After 2005, resection rates from the four district hospitals standardised (1.68-1.84 per 100,000 population), but the central unit rate (Sheffield) remained significantly higher (2.67 per 100,000 population). No significant difference in 1-year disease-free survival between patients from Sheffield and the out-lying hospitals was found (P = 0.553).Conclusions:Introduction of a referral protocol standardised resection rates from the four district hospitals, but these remain lower compared to the specialist centre. The wide-spread adoption of a policy to discuss all patients with liver metastases at an advanced disease multidisciplinary team meeting, in the presence of hepatobiliary specialists, may further increase resection rates across the UK.
