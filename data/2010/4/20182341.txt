The novel stem cell marker SALL4 has been identified as a diagnostic marker of germ cell tumors, especially yolk sac tumors, in gonadal organs. To clarify the significance of SALL4 as an oncofetal protein, we investigated SALL4 expression by immunohistochemistry in non-neoplastic stomach and gastric carcinoma with particular emphasis on รก-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric carcinoma, as AFP-producing gastric carcinoma shares expression of AFP and glypican 3 (GPC3) with yolk sac tumors and hepatic neoplasms. A total of 338 gastric carcinomas, 60 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 48 cholangiocellular carcinomas were studied by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. In addition, more detailed whole tissue section immunohistochemistry was performed on non-neoplastic gastric tissue from 5 adult and 8 fetal specimens, 6 hepatoblastomas, and 31 cases of AFP-producing gastric carcinomas. SALL4 expression was observed in the neofetal stomach in gestational week 9 and disappeared thereafter. It was also identified by tissue microarray study in a fraction of gastric carcinomas (51 of 338, 15%), associated with older age (P=0.0001), male sex (P=0.0033), intestinal-type histology (P=0.0001), and synchronous liver metastasis (P=0.0047). AFP and GPC3 were closely associated with SALL4 expression in gastric carcinoma (both, P
