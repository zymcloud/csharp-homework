Background:Current chemotherapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is insufficient; only sorafenib has been proven to provide a modest survival benefit. A future direction of chemotherapy is to tailor treatment based on the chemosensitivity of each individual tumor. By doing so, only patients who stand to benefit from therapy will be exposed to potential side-effects and morbidity. Although the use of docetaxel (DTX) for the treatment of lung, breast and gastric cancer has been reported, there are few reports about its use in the setting of HCC.Methods:To examine the efficacy of DTX for HCC, we established a human hepatoma cell line (TK cell) from the patient's malignant ascites from peritoneal carcinomatosis and treated it with DTX in vitro.Results:After we confirmed the efficacy of DTX in vitro, we treated our patient with DTX with positive results.Conclusion:In this study, we present a therapeutic approach by using DTX that supports the potential usefulness of personalized medicine in vitro and demonstrates it clinically.
