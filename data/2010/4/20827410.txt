Purpose:Hepatitis B viral markers may be useful for predicting outcomes such as liver-related deaths or development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We determined the frequency of these markers in different clinical stages of chronic hepatitis B infection.Methods:We compared baseline hepatitis B viral markers in 317 patients who were enrolled in a prospective study and identified the frequency of these tests in immune-tolerant (IT) patients, in inactive carriers, and in patients with either hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.Results:IT patients were youngest (median age 27 years) and HBeAg-negative patients with cirrhosis were oldest (median age 58 years) (p = 0.03 to Conclusion:Differences in baseline hepatitis B viral markers were detected in patients in various clinical stages of hepatitis B virus infection. HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with cirrhosis accounted for the majority of the liver-related fatalities.
