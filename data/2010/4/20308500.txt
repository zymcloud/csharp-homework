Objective:The objective of our study was to determine the role of negative enhancement (washout), its presence and timing, in the differential diagnosis of hypervascular liver masses on contrast-enhanced ultrasound.Materials and methods:One-hundred forty-six hypervascular liver lesions (mean size, 3.9 cm; range, 1.0-17.0 cm) were evaluated with contrast-enhanced ultrasound over a 6-month period. Seventy-four were benign (29 hemangiomas, 31 focal nodular hyperplasia [FNH] lesions, seven adenomas, five inflammatory lesions, two other) and 72, malignant (41 hepatocellular carcinomas [HCCs], 25 metastases, six other). Two independent reviewers retrospectively recorded the presence and timing of washout in the portal venous phase, observing until 4 minutes after injection, of a contrast agent (perflutren microspheres). Diagnoses were confirmed by histopathology (n = 68) or clinicoradiologic follow-up (n = 78). Timing of washout was compared between types of lesion using Fisher's exact test.Results:Washout occurred in both benign (27/74, 36%) and malignant (70/72, 97%) lesions but was more frequently seen in malignancy (p Conclusion:Hypervascular malignant lesions show washout except infrequent cases of HCC. Rapid washout characterizes metastases, whereas HCCs show variable, often slow, washout. However, washout is not unique to malignancy and may be seen in benign lesions.
