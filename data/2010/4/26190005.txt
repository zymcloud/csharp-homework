A rare case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a 78-year-old woman with a 10-year history of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) without liver cirrhosis and no history of alcohol abuse, drug injection, or blood transfusion is presented. At the time HCC was diagnosed, based on imaging studies showing a 5-cm-diameter S6 liver tumor, she had normal liver function, positive anti-nuclear antibodies, negative hepatitis B and C markers, and elevated alfa-fetoprotein (AFP; 169 ng/ml) and protein-induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II; 721 mAU/ml) levels. Following subsegmental S6 resection, no evidence of fibrosis or cirrhosis was observed.
