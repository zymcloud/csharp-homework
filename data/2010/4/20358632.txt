Background:LAPTM4B-35 is a 35-kDa tetra-transmembrane protein overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and promotes cell survival, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. However, the potential clinical implications of LAPTM4B-35 in HCC are still unclear. This study is aimed to investigate the correlations between LAPTM4B-35 expression and prognosis in patients with HCC.Methods:Western blot and immunohistochemistry assays were used to determine the expression of LAPTM4B-35 in HCCs and their paired noncancerous liver tissues from 65 patients. The correlations of LAPTM4B-35 expression with clinicopathological parameters were assessed by Chi-square test. Patient survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox regression was adopted for multivariate analysis of prognostic factors.Results:LAPTM4B-35 overexpression occurred in 76.9% of HCC tissues, while only in 4.6% of noncancerous liver tissues. Overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 was significantly associated with TNM staging and invasive tumors. Patients with higher LAPTM4B-35 expression had significantly poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (both P Conclusions:LAPTM4B-35 overexpression is an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS of HCC.
