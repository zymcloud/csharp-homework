Objective:To analyze the survival status and prognostic factors of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.Methods:The survival rate and prognostic factors of 112 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, who had complete follow-up data, were retrospectively assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate regression analysis.Results:The median survival time of the 112 patients was 18.25 months. The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 60.8%, 35.0%, 20.3% and 4.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that gender, age, primary tumor site, chemotherapy and pathological types had no significant correlation with the overall survival. But the treatment of primary tumor, time of liver metastasis, gross type of tumor, resection of liver metastases and clinical stage status were all independently related with the prognosis of patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed that resection of liver metastases, gross type of tumor and clinical stage were key factors affecting the prognosis of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.Conclusion:Patients with advanced stage, infiltrative gross type of colorectal cancer should be followed-up closely so that liver metastases from the cancer can be diagnosed and treated early. Resection of both the primary tumor and liver metastasis may improve survival of the patients.
