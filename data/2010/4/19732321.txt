Various clinical studies have indicated that interferon (IFN)-alpha treatment prevents the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in people chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. However, it has been controversial whether IFN-alpha treatment prevents HCC recurrence. The aim of this study was to identify the preventive effect of IFN-alpha treatment after curative therapy of primary tumours within the Milan criteria (three or fewer nodules 3 cm or less in diameter or a single nodule of 5 cm or less) on HCC recurrence. We conducted a meta-analysis of five trials including 355 patients (167 patients received IFN-alpha treatment after curative therapy of primary tumours) and estimated relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect of IFN-alpha on HCC recurrence according to the DerSimonian and Laird method. IFN-alpha treatment after curative therapy of primary tumours significantly prevented HCC recurrence (RR 0.33; 95%CI 0.19-0.58, P 30% (RR 0.20; 95%CI 0.05-0.81, P = 0.02) and in three studies achieving SVR rates
