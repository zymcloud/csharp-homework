Background:Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is one of the key enzymes in DNA repair. This study was designed to investigate the correlation between ERCC1 expression and chemosensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Eighty-seven HCC samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for ERCC1 and chemosensitivity was assessed by the succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (SDI) test for four anti-cancer agents, including CDDP. The ERCC1 expression was examined in HCC cell lines. ERCC1 siRNA was transfected to PLC/RPF/5 to investigate the correlation of ERCC1 expression and CDDP sensitivity.Results:ERCC1 expression was observed in 33% of nuclei in immunohistochemical examination. Patients were divided into two groups as follows: ERCC1 high expression group (n = 43): more than 33% of the nuclei were stained; ERCC1 low expression group (n = 44): 33% or fewer of the nuclei were stained. Tumor size of low expression group was larger than that in the high expression group (p = 0.02). The succinic dehydrogenase (SD) activity only for CDDP was significantly higher in the high expression group than that in the low expression group (p = 0.02). An increased expression of ERCC1 was shown by immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses in PLC/RPF/5. ERCC1 expression was inhibited by ERCC1 siRNA transfection and the LC50 value (nM) of CDDP was reduced from 25.7 to 12.5 (p = 0.01).Conclusions:Increased ERCC1 expression is associated with CDDP resistance in HCC specimens and cell lines. Therefore, immunohistochemical analysis for resected HCC tissues may be a useful predictor for the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy, using CDDP.
