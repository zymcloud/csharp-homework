Background:The management of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) continues to be refined. However, several issues remain unresolved, primarily as a consequence of the low incidence of the disease. This factor has contributed both to a lack of understanding of and a paucity of large scale clinical trials involving therapeutic agents.Aim:To summarize the latest evidence regarding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, therapy and long-term management of AIH with a focus on clinical aspects of the disease.Method:We searched PUBMED for articles pertaining to AIH, its pathogenesis, treatment and clinical outcomes, combined with the authors' own knowledge of the literature.Results:Standard therapy (corticosteroids and azathioprine) is effective in more than 80% of patients which renders study of novel agents difficult. Budesonide appears to show equivalence to prednisolone. Available, but limited, data suggest that mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and ciclosporin are all variably effective second line agents. Patients with AIH and cirrhosis are at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and require screening. Patients with end stage liver disease represent excellent candidates for liver transplantation.Conclusions:Despite ongoing limitations in the understanding of pathogenesis and difficulties in evaluating novel therapies, the management of AIH continues to evolve slowly. Multi-centre collaboration is necessary to obtain sufficient patient numbers to undertake good quality therapeutic studies.
