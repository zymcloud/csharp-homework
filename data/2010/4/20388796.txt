Our recent findings show that astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) is overexpressed in >90% of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, and AEG-1 plays a central role in regulating development and progression of HCC. In the present study, we elucidate a molecular mechanism of AEG-1-induced chemoresistance, an important characteristic of aggressive cancers. AEG-1 increases the expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) protein, resulting in increased efflux and decreased accumulation of doxorubicin, promoting doxorubicin resistance. Suppression of MDR1 by small interfering RNA or chemical reagents, or inhibition of AEG-1 or a combination of both genes, significantly increases in vitro sensitivity to doxorubicin. In nude mice xenograft studies, a lentivirus expressing AEG-1 short hairpin RNA, in combination with doxorubicin, profoundly inhibited growth of aggressive human HCC cells compared with either agent alone. We document that although AEG-1 does not affect MDR1 gene transcription, it facilitates association of MDR1 mRNA to polysomes, resulting in increased translation, and AEG-1 also inhibits ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of MDR1 protein. This study is the first documentation of a unique aspect of AEG-1 function (i.e., translational and posttranslational regulation of proteins). Inhibition of AEG-1 might provide a means of more effectively using chemotherapy to treat HCC, which displays inherent chemoresistance with aggressive pathology.
