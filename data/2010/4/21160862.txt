Partial hepatectomy has long been the standard treatment modality for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although the majority of patients with HCCs are not candidates for curative resection. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely used as the preferred locoregional therapy. RFA and hepatectomy can be complementary to each other for the treatment of multifocal HCCs. Combining hepatectomy with RFA permits the removal of larger tumors while simultaneously ablating any smaller residual tumors. By using this combination treatment, more patients might become candidates for curative resection. For treating recurrent tumors involving the liver after hepatectomy, RFA has been performed recently instead of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization or ethanol ablation. Many retrospective studies on the combination of RFA and hepatectomy demonstrate favorable results of effectiveness and safety. However, further investigation of prospective design will be needed to confirm these encouraging results.
