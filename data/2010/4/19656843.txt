Objective:This study evaluates the burden of pediatric malignant solid tumors (PMST) in southeastern Nigeria.Methods:Analysis of 174 cases of PMST managed at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu, from January 2002 to November 2007.Results:PMST comprised 2.8% of pediatric admissions. Tumors encountered were lymphomas 77 (44.3%), Wilms' tumor 35 (20.1%), sarcomas 20 (11.5%), neuroblastoma 15 (8.6%), retinoblastoma 14 (8.0%), teratomas 8 (4.6%) and hepatoma 5 (2.9%). Mean time for diagnosis was 3.3 +/- 2.4 months. Advanced disease occurred in 135 (77.6%), while 39 (22.4%) had early disease. Only 166 (95.4%) commenced planned therapy, with 67 (40.4%) lost to follow-up. Of 99 children available for evaluation, 43 died (11 treatment related and 32 from relapse). Overall, 56 (56.6%) were alive after a mean follow-up of 20.7 +/- 10.5 months.Conclusion:PMST are enormous challenge in our setting. Delayed presentation, poor treatment compliance and healthcare funding have to be addressed to improve outcomes.
