Objective:Our previous work indicated that overexpression of imprinting gene PEG10 is associated with malignant phenotype of hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study is to explore whether disregulation of PEG10 leads to dysregulation of microRNAs.Methods:In silico analysis using TargetScan indicated that miR-122 could regulate the expression of PEG10. The expression of miR-122 in three hepatoma cell lines, Huh7, Hep3B and HepG2 and in primary human normal liver cell were compared using real time RT-PCR. After pre-miR-122 was transfected into HepG2 cell, the levels of PEG10 mRNA and protein were measured.Results:In silico analysis revealed that miR-122 could regulate the expression of PEG10. Real time RT-PCR indicated that miR-122 was not expressed in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, and only weakly expressed in Huh7 cells, but highly expressed in primary human normal liver cells. The expression of miR-122 was negatively correlated with the expression of PEG10. After pre-miR122 was transfected into HepG2, the mRNA level of PEG10 was not increased, whereas the protein level of PEG10 was increased.Conclusion:miR-122 may be involved in regulation of PEG10 expression.
