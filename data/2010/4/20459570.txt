Aims:To study the relevance of periostin, known to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in hepatocellular and bile duct cancer.Methods and results:Immunohistochemical periostin expression was semiquantitatively analysed in normal liver tissue (n = 20), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 91), liver-cell adenoma (n = 9), focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 13) and bile duct carcinomas (BDC; n = 116) using tissue microarrays. Normal bile ducts, gallbladder epithelium and hepatocytes showed weak cytoplasmic periostin expression. In HCC, there was strong epithelial periostin expression in 19/91 (20.9%) and strong stromal periostin expression in 10/91 cases (11%). Epithelial expression in tumour cells was significantly associated with a higher tumour grade (P Conclusions:The EMT protein periostin is expressed in the stroma and epithelium of a subset of BDC and HCC. Epithelial periostin expression is a marker for malignant transformation of hepatocytes and a novel prognostic marker in BDC.
