In order to evaluate the biological activity in vitro and the antitumor effects of 131I-conditionally replicating oncolytic adenovirus KH901 on HepG2 human hepatoma xenografts, the leves of GM-CSF expression were determined by ELISA method. A panel of tumor and normal cells was infected with recombinant adenovirus KH901 at MOI of 10 PPC. The medium was harvested to determine the bioactivity of GM-CSF after 24 hours. Nude mice bearing HepG2 human hepatoma xenografts were given 131-KH901. Antitumor effects were assessed using endpoints of tumor growth delay. The data showed that after 24 hours 131-KH901 replicated hugely in tumor cells and produced significant amount of GM-CSF 183.27 +/- 6.90 pg/ml, while producing very small amount of GM-CSF 20.44 +/- 0.77 pg/ml in normal cells. In the treatment of tumor, 131I-KH901 showed higher restraint rate (71.3%) compared to 131I (22.7%) or KH901 (52.7%). Therefore, 131-KH901 can inhibit the growth of human hepatoma cell in nude mice and it may be a potential drug for treating liver cancer.
