Background:Primary analysis of the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial showed long-term peginterferon therapy did not reduce complications in patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.Aim:To assess the effects of long-term peginterferon therapy and disease progression on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), symptoms and sexual health in HALT-C patients.Methods:A total of 517 HALT-C patients received peginterferon alfa-2a (90 microg/week); 532 received no additional treatment for 3.5 years. Patients were followed up for outcomes of death, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic decompensation. Sexual health, SF-36 scores and symptoms were serially assessed by repeated-measures analyses of covariance.Results:Patients with cirrhosis (n = 427) reported lower general well-being and more fatigue (P Conclusion:Clinical progression of chronic hepatitis C and maintenance peginterferon therapy led to worsening of symptoms, HRQOL and, in men, sexual health in a large patient cohort followed up over 4 years (NCT00006164).
