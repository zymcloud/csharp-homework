Background and objectives:Laparoscopy is gaining acceptance as a safe procedure for resection of liver neoplasms. The aim of this study is to evaluate surgical results and mid-term survival of minor hepatic resection performed for HCC.Methods:Data of 16 patients with HCC, undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy from September 2005 to January 2009, were compared to a control group of 16 patients who underwent open resection (OR) during the same period. The two groups were matched in terms of type of resection, tumor size, and severity of cirrhosis.Results:One patient underwent conversion to an open approach. Laparoscopic approach resulted in shorter operating time (150 min, P:0.044) and lower blood loss (258 ml, P:0.008). There was no difference in perioperative morbidity and mortality rate; laparoscopic approach was associated with a shorter hospital stay (6.3 days, P:0.039). After a mean follow up of 32 months, disease free survival and overall survival were 40.2 and 23.3 months for laparoscopic group, and 47.7 and 31.4 months for OR group (P NS).Conclusion:Laparoscopic resection of HCC is feasible and safe in selected patients and can result in good surgical results, with similar outcomes in terms of overall and disease-free survival.
