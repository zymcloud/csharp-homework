Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of measuring the Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) for prognostic predictor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 477 HCC patients who underwent percutaneous ablative therapy or hepatectomy were enrolled. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were respectively evaluated retrospectively and prospectively. Multivariate analyses of clinical prognostic factors were performed by Cox's stepwise proportional hazard model.Results:AFP-L3 status was a statistically significant independent prognostic factor of long-term survival (P = 0.013) and recurrence-free survival (P = 0.006) in patients who underwent percutaneous ablative therapy. In contrast, AFP-L3 did not affect prognosis in patients who underwent hepatectomy.Conclusions:AFP-L3 had different impacts on prognosis in patients with HCC who underwent percutaneous ablative therapy and hepatectomy. Our results suggest that AFP-L3 positivity (>or=15%) might be a promising indicator for choosing therapeutic modalities in HCC patients.
