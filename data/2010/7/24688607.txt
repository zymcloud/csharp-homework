Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in humans is remarkably efficient in establishing viral persistence, leading to the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. CD8+ T cells are involved in controlling HCV infection; but, in chronic HCV patients, severe CD4+ and CD8+ T cell dysfunction has been observed. This suggests that HCV may employ numerous mechanisms to counteract or possibly suppress the host T cell responses. The primary site of HCV replication occurs within hepatocytes in the liver. As a result of liver enodothelial cells perforated by fenestrations, parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) are not separated by a basal membrane, and thereby HCV-infected hepatocytes are extensively capable of interacting with innate immune cells including NK, DC. Recent studies reveal that the function of NK and DC function is significantly impaired in chronic HCV patients. Given a critical role of NK and DC in limiting HCV replication at the early phase of viral infection, it is likely that HCV-infected hepatocytes might be responsible for impairing NK and DC function by enhancing the expression of immunoregulatory molecules (either soluble or cell surface). Thus, this impairment of innate immunity attributes to the failure of generating effective T cell responses to clear HCV infection. In this article, we will review studies highlighting the regulation of innate immunity by HCV and crosstalk between hepatocytes and NK/DC in the hepatic environment.
