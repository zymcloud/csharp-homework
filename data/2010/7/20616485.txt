A 50-year-old man underwent radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for a hepatocellular carcinoma, located in the S8 area adjacent to the diaphragm. 20 months later, he was admitted because of severe right hypochondralgia and dyspnea. Computed tomography revealed a prolapsed large intestine through a defect on the right diaphragm, and emergency surgery was performed. Patients who have undergone RFA for a hepatic tumor adjacent to the diaphragm should be carefully followed up for possible diaphragmatic hernia, even after a long postoperative interval.
