Background:Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1), one of the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, has an important role in cancer progression through regulation of the activity of hepatocyte growth factor. HAI-1 is expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to various degrees. Investigation of the relationship between HAI-1 expression and clinicopathological features of HCC may contribute to improved treatment outcomes for HCC through understanding the mechanism of tumor progression or improvement in the prediction of tumor malignancy.Methods:The study included 121 HCC patients treated surgically from 1996 to 2005. We performed immunohistological examination for HAI-1 in resected HCC specimens by use of anti-human HAI-1 monoclonal antibody. Clinicopathological features, including postoperative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates, were compared between the immunoreaction positive and negative groups.Results:The immunoreaction positive group included 38 patients (31%), and the negative group included 83 patients (69%). OS and DFS rates were significantly higher in the HAI-1 negative group than in the positive group. HAI-1 positivity related to multiplicity, vascular invasion, and characteristics of advanced tumor stage. In multivariate analysis, expression of HAI-1 was a significant independent prognostic tumor factor.Conclusions:Expression of HAI-1 in HCC cells is associated with poor prognosis for HCC patients. HAI-1 may be important in HCC progression and may be a new prognostic factor for HCC.
