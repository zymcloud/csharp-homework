This review article provides an overview of the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in China. Currently, the only licensed contrast agent is SonoVue, a sulfur hexafluoride-filled microbubble contrast agent. In combination with a low mechanical index contrast-specific imaging mode, SonoVue-enhanced CEUS can be used to visualize the micro and macro-vasculature continuously. Since 2004, CEUS has been widely used in China in various clinical scenarios. The authors compared CEUS with baseline ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography with regard to characterization of focal liver lesions (FLLs). On CEUS, heterogeneous or homogeneous hyperenhancement during the arterial phase and washout in the portal/late phase are typical findings for hepatocellular carcinoma. The enhancement features of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, infected FLLs, focal fatty infiltration, focal fatty sparing, complex cystic FLLs, and uncommon benign FLLs were carefully depicted. CEUS was also used for patient selection in ablation therapy and evaluation of response to ablation for liver cancer. The utility of three-dimensional CEUS of the liver was also explored. In non-liver use, CEUS in hilar cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder, breast, and prostate was initially investigated. In addition, CEUS was used in interventional procedures such as CEUS-guided hemostatic injection, intraoperative CEUS in neurosurgery, and evaluation of response to high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of uterine fibroids. The Chinese experience has resulted in increased use of CEUS.
