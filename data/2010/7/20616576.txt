Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor responsible for approximately 600,000-700,000 deaths worldwide, and is becoming more prevalent not only in South-East Asia and Africa, but also in Western countries; therefore, interest in hepatocellular carcinoma has mounted in recent years in the West, where little or no interest was evident 10-20 years ago.
