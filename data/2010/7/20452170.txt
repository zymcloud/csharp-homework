Aim:To better define the indications for adrenalectomy for adrenal metastasis we have analysed factors predicting survival in our institutional series.Methods:A consecutive series of 30 patients undergoing adrenalectomy for metastasis (1996-2007), excluding patients with simultaneous ipsilateral renal cell carcinoma (RCC), was studied. Metastases were regarded as synchronous (6 mo), depending on the interval after primary surgery. Survival was calculated from time of adrenalectomy and factors influencing survival were identified.Results:The tumour diagnoses were RCC n = 9, malignant melanoma n = 5, non-small-cell lung cancer n = 5, colorectal carcinoma n = 4, foregut carcinoid n = 2, adrenocortical carcinoma, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and liposarcoma (one each); nine adrenal metastases were synchronous and 21 metachronous. Ten patients had undergone previous surgery for extra-adrenal metastases. Out of 30 adrenalectomies 10 were laparoscopic (LAdx) and 20 open (OAdx) procedures without surgical complications. The local recurrence rate was low: LAdx 1/10, OAdx 1/20, and the median survival was 23 months. Independent prognosticators of favourable survival were adrenalectomy for potential cure (p = 0.01), no previous metastasis surgery (p = 0.02), and tumour type (p = 0.043), with better prognosis for patients with adrenal metastasis from colorectal carcinoma and RCC and worse prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer and malignant melanoma.Conclusions:Surgery for adrenal metastasis is safe and the indication for this procedure in an individual patient can be supported by several prognostic factors. The survival benefit in patients with adrenalectomy for potential cure indicates a therapeutic value of adrenalectomy in selected patients.
