A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection. A total of 317 patients who had received curative resection of pathologically proven small HCC ( or = 400 ng/mL, HBV DNA level > or = 4 log(10) copies/mL, prolonged prothrombin time, tumor size > or = 2 cm, microvascular invasion, absence of capsular formation, moderate/poor tumor differentiation, and absence of postoperative interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment were associated with increased cumulative risk of HCC recurrence. By multivariate analysis, HBV DNA level > or = 4 log(10) copies/mL (P or = 400 ng/mL (P = 0.011, HR 1.574), microvascular invasion (P 2 years) were older age and HBV DNA level > or = 4 log(10) copies/mL. Patients with persistent HBV DNA level > or = 4 log(10) copies/mL at resection and follow-up had the highest recurrence risk (P or = 4 log(10) copies/mL at the time of resection was the most important risk factor for recurrence. Postoperative IFN-alpha treatment significantly decreased the recurrence risk after resection.
