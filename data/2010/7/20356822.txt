Delta-like 1 protein (Dlk-1), also known as preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1), is a transmembrane and secreted protein with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats. Dlk-1 is known to be expressed in foetal liver, but absent in neonatal and adult liver in mice and rats. Dlk-1 is also expressed in a subpopulation of hepatic oval cells, which are considered as stem/progenitor cells in rat adult liver. In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies against human Dlk-1 (hDlk-1) and investigated hDlk-1 expression in human liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Like rodent livers, hDlk-1 was detected in foetal liver, but not in adult liver. In HCC, hDlk-1 was positive for 20.5% of the cases examined and was localized in both cytoplasm and cell membrane, whereas hDlk-1 was undetected in viral hepatitis, nodular cirrhosis. Interestingly, hDlk-1 positive HCC was found more frequently in younger patients and its expression was correlated with alpha-fetoprotein expression. Furthermore, hDlk-1 was also detected frequently in colon adenocarcinomas (58%), pancreatic islet carcinoma (50%), and small cell lung carcinoma (50%). Thus, hDlk-1 is a cell surface protein expressed in many carcinomas including HCC and may be a potential target for monoclonal antibody therapy for carcinomas.
