Objective:To explore the relationship between expressions of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors and syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in gastric carcinoma and to establish prognostic indicators for gastric carcinoma.Methods:A total of 72 patients with gastric carcinoma were divided into six groups according to TCM syndrome differentiation. Specimens were collected after operation and ER and PR protein expressions were detected by EnVision immunohistochemical method.Results:The common syndromes in female patients with gastric carcinoma were disharmony between liver and stomach, yin impairment due to stomach heat, and insufficiency of both qi and blood; while in males, interior retention of stagnant toxin, interior retention of phlegm and dampness, and deficiency-cold in spleen and stomach were common. Different TCM syndromes were related with gender (P<0.01), pathology (P<0.01), cell differentiation (P<0.05), infiltration depth (P<0.01), lymphaden metastasis (P<0.05), distant metastasis (P<0.05), and TNM stage (P<0.01). Deficiency and excess syndromes were associated with gender (P<0.05), pathology (P<0.05), tumor location (P<0.01) and TNM stage (P<0.05). The deficiency syndromes were common in female patients. The total positive rates of ER and PR expressions were 8.33% and 37.5% respectively. There was a significant difference in PR expression among different TCM syndromes (P<0.01). PR expression was significantly higher in the syndrome of yin deficiency due to stomach heat than in the other syndromes. The PR expressions in deficiency syndromes were significantly higher than those in excess syndromes (P<0.01). No correlation was found between ER expression and different TCM syndromes.Conclusion:There is a correlation between PR expression and different TCM syndromes in gastric carcinoma.
