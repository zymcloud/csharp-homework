Long term survival of single nodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) measuring 2-5 cm in size treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was compared between 157 HCCs treated with RFA and 89 HCCs treated by operation. The 5 year survival rate was not significantly different between RFA and operation. In addition, the 17th nationwide survey of the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan clearly showed that 5 year survival rate in 858 HCCs measuring 2-5 cm in size treated with RFA was similar to that in 6,574 HCCs measuring 2-5 cm in size treated by operation. In conclusion, RFA achieves outcomes similar to those of operation for Child-Pugh A patients with HCCs measuring 2-5 cm in size.
