Background:Although hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using low-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (low-dose FP) is commonly used for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with vascular invasion in Japan, few reports have investigated the efficacy and safety of this approach. We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of HAIC using low-dose FP for patients with advanced HCC as a phase II trial.Methods:Low-dose FP consisted of a continuous arterial infusion of 5-FU (250-500 mg/day, 5 days/week, for the first 2 weeks) and cisplatin (10 mg/day, 5 days/week, for the first 2 weeks). Then, 5-FU (1,000 mg/body for 5 h) and cisplatin (10 mg/body) were administered once weekly.Results:In these patients treated with low-dose FP, the response rate was 38.5%, the median time to progression was 4.1 months (95% CI 2.1-6.1 months) and the median survival time was 15.9 months (95% CI 9.8-22.0 months). The most frequent adverse events were myelosuppression such as neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.Conclusions:HAIC using low-dose FP is an effective treatment option for locally advanced HCC. However, it is not well tolerated hematologically because of potent pancytopenia and poor hepatic reserve. Therefore, this regimen should be performed carefully with regular monitoring of hematological function.
