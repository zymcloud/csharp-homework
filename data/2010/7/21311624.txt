Osteoradionecrosis of the cervical spine is a rare complication of radiation treatment of head and neck tumors that requires a multidisciplinary approach to management and reconstruction. The case of a 57-year-old man with osteoradionecrosis of the cervical spine secondary to radiation for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma is presented. Operative debridement of the necrotic bone was performed and the nasopharyngeal soft tissue defect was reconstructed with a radial forearm free flap. The management and reconstruction options for osteoradionecrosis of the cervical spine are discussed.
