Hepatoid adenocarcinoma (HAC) is a rare type of extrahepatic cancer, whose pathologic features are indistinguishable from those of hepatocellular carcinoma. About thirty cases, nearly half of which occurring in the lung, have been described in patients with a normal liver. No imaging features are typical enough to allow a correct diagnosis. A localization of HAC in the soft tissues of the shoulder with invasion of the scapula in a woman without other symptoms is reported in this paper; soft-tissue HACs have never been described to date. An associate pulmonary HAC was eventually found in this patient.
