Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising in noncirrhotic and nonfibrotic liver (NC-HCC) is a rare type of malignancy frequently found in healthy young individuals. Partial liver resection is the treatment of choice with expected 5-year survival rates between 40% and 70%. As a result of absence of any symptom, a considerable number of patients are diagnosed when the malignancy has progressed to an advanced stage and the tumor has turned already unresectable. Some other patients suffer from intrahepatic recurrence after previous liver resection that cannot be re-resected or locally ablated. In these situations, liver transplantation (LT) may be the only potentially curative treatment. The indication for LT in NC-HCC patients, however, is not well established. The preliminary results of recent analysis of the European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR) together with a literature review identified over 150 patients transplanted for NC-HCC during the last 15 years. In contrast to the historical data, these studies showed 5-year survival rates at 50-70% in well-selected patients. Important determinants of poor outcome are macrovascular invasion, lymph node involvement, and time interval of
