Purpose:To evaluate the effect of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:The phantom signal intensity was measured. We also evaluated 72 patients including 30 patients with HCC. T2WI and DWI were obtained before and then 4 and 20 min after injecting the contrast medium. The signal to noise ratio (SNR), contrast to noise ratio (CNR), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated in the tumor and liver parenchyma.Results:The phantom signal intensity increased on T2WI at a concentration of contrast medium less than 0.2 mmol/L but decreased when the concentration exceeded 0.4 mmol/L. SNR of the liver parenchyma on T2WI was significantly different between before and 4 min after injecting the contrast medium, while there were no significant differences between before and 4 and 20 min after injection. On T2WI, SNR, and CNR of HCC showed no significant differences at any time. SNR, CNR, and ADC of the liver parenchyma and tumor on DWI also showed no significant differences at any time.Conclusion:It is acceptable to perform T2WI and DWI after injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA for the diagnosis of HCC.
