Two new isoprenylated flavonoids, artotonins A and B (1 and 2), along with 13 known compounds (3-15), were isolated from the roots of Artocarpus tonkinensis A. Chev. ex Gagnep. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods. Cyclocommunol (6), isocyclomulberrin (7), cudraflavone C (11), and morusin (13) exhibited cytotoxicity against hepatocellular carcinoma (SMMC-7721) and gastric carcinoma (BGC-823 and SGC-7901) cell lines.
