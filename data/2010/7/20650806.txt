Objective:To investigate the indication and effect of the application of Ligasure vessel sealing instrument in laparoscopic hepatectomy for liver cancer.Methods:Eleven patients with liver cancer undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy were analyzed for the tumor size and location, operation time, volume of intraoperative bleeding, postoperative hospital stay and short-term clinical outcomes.Results:All the operations were performed successfully in the 11 cases. All the tumors were less than 7 cm in diameter, locating at the segments II, III, V, VI and VII. The mean operation time was 91 min (80-126 min), and the intraoperative blood loss averaged 82 ml (20-200 ml). The average postoperative hospital stay of the patients was 8 days (7-9 days). No complications were observed in these cases.Conclusion:Ligasure vessel sealing instrument in laparoscopic hepatectomy is applicable in cases of perimeter liver cancer. This instrument can decrease the operation time, reduce the intraoperative blood loss and postoperative hospital stay with good safety and minimal invasiveness.
