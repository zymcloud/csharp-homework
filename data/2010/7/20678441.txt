Objectives:To investigate the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and the association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or basal core promoter (BCP) mutation in Qidong, China.Methods:The whole genome of HBV or X gene sequences were obtained from serum samples of HBV infected patients by using PCR and direct sequencing methods. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the genotypes or subgenotypes of HBV.Results:According to the phylogenetic tree constructed from full-length sequence of HBV, genotype C2 was predominant in Qidong area. It was prevalent in 44 out of the 48 cases (91.7%), whereas genotype B2 only existed in 4 cases (8.3%). No other genotypes or recombinant types were found in Qidong patients. The result of genotyping based on X gene sequence confirmed the above observation. In a total of 182 samples, 169 (92.9%) showed genotype C2 and 10 (5.5%) showed genotype B2. There were 3 (1.6%) patients showed a coinfection with C2 and B2. The infection rate of genotype C in Qidong was significantly higher than that in neighboring city Shanghai (chi(2) = 12.252, P less than 0.01). There was no significant difference of genotype distribution between HCC and chronic hepatitis groups (P is more than 0.05). The frequency of T1762/A1764 double mutation in genotype C2 (70.3%) was significantly higher than that in genotype B2 (30.8%, P less than 0.05). The other two types of point mutation which also occurred in BCP, i.e. T1766 and A1768, were only seen in genotype C2.Conclusion:(1) Genotype C2 is the predominant genotype in Qidong, China. (2) There is no association between genotype C and HCC in Qidong. (3) Genotype C has a higher prevalence of BCP mutation than genotype B.
