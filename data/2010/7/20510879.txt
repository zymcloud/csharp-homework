PON1 is a high density lipoprotein-associated enzyme that plays an important role in organophosphate detoxification and prevention of atherosclerosis. In vivo animal and human studies have indicated that estradiol (E2) supplementation enhances serum PON1 activity. In this study, we sought to determine if E2 directly up-regulates cell-associated PON1 activity in vitro and to characterize the mechanism of regulation. In vitro E2 treatment of both the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 and normal rat hepatocytes resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in cell-associated PON1 catalytic activity. E2 potently induced PON1 activity with average EC(50) values of 15nM for normal hepatocytes and 68nM for Huh7. The enhancement of PON1 activity by E2 was blocked by the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182,780 indicating that E2 was acting through the ER. The up-regulation of PON1 activity by E2 did not involve enhancement of PON1 mRNA or protein levels and did not promote secretion of PON1. Thus, E2 can enhance cell-associated PON1 activity in vitro without altering PON1 gene expression or protein level. Our data suggest that E2 may regulate the specific activity and/or stability of cell surface PON1.
