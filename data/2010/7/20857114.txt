Purpose:We have previously shown that continuous intra-arterial combination chemotherapy (IACC) might be more effective for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) in patients with HCV-related liver cirrhosis (C-LC) or alcoholic liver cirrhosis (A-LC) than in patients with HBV-related LC (B-LC). However, it is still unknown whether IACC actually improves the prognosis of aHCC patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), because it is difficult to perform a randomized controlled trial for patients with a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the influence of IACC on the prognosis of aHCC.Methods:Fifty-eight adult Japanese patients who had aHCC and LC underwent repeated trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) without IACC between 1990 and 1997 at our hospital (group T), while 43 patients with aHCC and LC received IACC between 2000 and 2008 after undergoing several TACE sessions (group R). The Japan Integrated Staging score (JIS score) of each patient was â‰¥ 3 at the time of presentation, except for patients with tumor thrombi involving the first or subsequent portal vein branches or those with tumor invasion of the inferior vena cava. The same IACC regimen was repeated for as long as possible in group R.Results:In group T, 13 patients had B-LC, 37 patients had C-LC, and 8 patients had A-LC, while the respective numbers were 14, 21, and 8 in group R. The median survival time (MST) was 248 days for patients with C-LC in group T and 708 days for those in group R, while it was 253 days for patients with A-LC in group T and 593 days for those in group R. There were significant differences of survival between the two groups. However, MST was 369 days for patients with B-LC in group T and 782 days for those in group R, without a significant difference. In group R, a complete or partial response was achieved after 4 weeks of chemotherapy in 14.3% of patients with B-LC versus 42.9% of patients with C-LC and 37.5% of patients with A-LC.Conclusions:In LC patients with a JIS score > 3 at diagnosis, multimodal therapy with IACC after TACE prolongs the MST of C-LC or A-LC patients compared with TACE alone, although it does not improve the MST of patients with B-LC.
