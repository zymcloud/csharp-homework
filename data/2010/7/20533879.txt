Background:HBcAg-specific regulatory T (T(reg)) cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B. Soluble heat shock proteins, especially soluble heat shock protein 60 (sHSP60), could affect the function of T(reg) cells via Toll-like receptor.Methods:We analyzed the relationship between soluble heat shock protein production and hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication with both clinical samples from HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B (n= 24) and HBeAb-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B (n= 24) and in vitro HBV-replicating hepatocytes. Thereafter, we examined the biological effects of sHSP60 with isolated T(reg) cells.Results:The serum levels of sHSP60 in patients with chronic hepatitis B were statistically significantly higher than those in patients with chronic hepatitis C (PConclusion:The function of HBcAg-specific T(reg) cells was enhanced by sHSP60 produced from HBV-infected hepatocytes. Entecavir treatment suppressed the frequency and function of T(reg) cells; this might contribute to the persistence of HBV infection.
