Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatoblastoma (HB) are the most common primary tumors of liver in children. The management of patients with locally advanced, unresectable disease or those with extra-hepatic distant metastases provides substantial challenges to pediatric oncologists, hepatologists, and surgeons. Herein, we critically debate the two sides of three specific controversies: (1) the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced pediatric HCC; (2) the indications for liver transplantation in children with HCC, specifically, the appropriateness of using adult Milan criteria; and (3) the role of liver trasplantation in children with unresectable HB that present with metastatic disease.
