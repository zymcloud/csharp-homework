We evaluated the effect of hepatic arterial infusion(HAI)chemotherapy for liver metastases from colorectal cancer. A total of 65 patients received HAI chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of weekly 5-FU (1, 500 mg/body) or 5-FU (400 mg/mm2) and l-LV (200mg/mm2). The survival and response rates were assessed according to RECIST. Median survival time with HAI chemotherapy was 13. 5 months, 5-year survival rate 8% and response rates 55%. There was no evidence of myelosuppression, and HAI could be continued for a long time even for poor PS patients. There were no differences in survival time between synchronous, metachronous and postoperative metachronous liver metastases. In the patients who underwent curative hepatectomy after HAI chemotherapy, the 5-year survival rate was 21%, which was better than in patients with HAI chemotherapy alone. HAI chemotherapy could thus be an option for unresectable liver metastases, which could be well tolerated.
