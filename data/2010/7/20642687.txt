Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is generally preventable by prophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and lamivudine (LAM). However, HBV recurrence sometimes develops despite prophylaxis. This study assessed posttransplant outcomes and identified predictors of HBV recurrence. We analyzed the outcomes of 209 consecutive patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen who underwent OLT, who received either combination prophylaxis with HBIG and LAM (89.0%) or HBIG monoprophylaxis (11.0%). The median follow-up was 36.8 months (range, 1.0-84.4). Posttransplant HBV recurrence occurred in 22 patients (10.5%), including 13 patients with drug-resistant mutations. HBV recurrence was observed in six patients after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence. Independent predictors of HBV recurrence were recurrent HCC (p 1.5 years (p = 0.001) and high HBV DNA titers (> or =10(5) copies/mL) at OLT (p = 0.036). In conclusion, high viremia at OLT and prolonged exposure to LAM should be further stressed as main predictors of HBV recurrence.
