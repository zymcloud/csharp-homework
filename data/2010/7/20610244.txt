Background:Some series have suggested that laparoscopy is beneficial for resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. This has to be confirmed in larger series. The aim of this study was to analyze the results of 3 European surgical centers on laparoscopic liver resections for hepatocellular carcinoma.Study design:Prospective databases of 3 European centers involved in the development of laparoscopic liver surgery were combined. Between 1998 and 2008, 163 liver resections for hepatocellular carcinoma were performed. Liver parenchyma was cirrhotic in 120 (73.6%) patients. Liver resection was anatomic in 107 (65.6%) patients and was a major resection (>or=3 segments) in 16 (9.8%). A totally laparoscopic approach was used in 155 (95.1%) patients.Results:Median surgical duration was 180 minutes. Median operative blood loss was 250 mL, and 16 (9.8%) patients received blood transfusion. Conversion to open surgery was required in 15 (9.2%) patients. Median tumor size was 3.6 cm and median surgical margin was 12 mm. Liver-specific and general complications occurred in 19 (11.6%) and 17 (10.4%) patients, respectively. Hospital length of stay was 7 days. A further analysis of early (n = 75) and recent (n = 88) experiences showed improved results in the latter group. Overall and recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 92.6%, 68.7%, 64.9%, and 77.5%, 47.1%, 32.2%, respectively.Conclusions:This study demonstrates that laparoscopic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma is feasible in selected patients, with good operative and oncologic results. Laparoscopy should be routinely considered in centers experienced in liver surgery and advanced laparoscopy.
