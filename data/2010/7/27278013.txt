Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common neoplasms worldwide. Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is a common complication of advanced HCC, and the prognosis of advanced HCC with PVTT is extremely poor. We report a case of HCC with PVTT evaluated by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) before and after hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). A 59-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C was admitted to our hospital. CEUS clearly showed the thread and streaks sign in a solid lesion that occupied the right main branch of the portal vein. HAIC was performed, and CEUS after HAIC clearly showed disappearance of the thread and streaks sign. CEUS was very useful in diagnosing PVTT and in evaluating the effectiveness of HAIC in this case.
