Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is believed to facilitate invasion and metastasis formation of epithelial tumour cells. SERPINB3 is a serine protease inhibitor, physiologically found in normal squamous epithelium but over-expressed in epithelial tumours and known to inhibit apoptosis. We tested the hypothesis that SERPINB3 has a role in invasion by modulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition programme, using morphological, molecular and cell biology techniques on HepG2 cell clones transfected with the human SERPINB3 gene. The paracrine effect of this serpin was determined by the addition of exogenous recombinant SERPINB3 protein to HepG2 and MDCK cell line. SERPINB3 expression leads to changes in transfected cells morphology, characterized by clusters of loosely connected cells with elongated shape. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the decrease of desmosomal junctions and widening of intercellular spaces. These alterations were associated with a reduction of E-cadherin and an increase of beta-catenin, with a parallel increase of cell proliferation. SERPINB3 clones, untransfected HepG2 and MDCK cells treated with exogenous SERPINB3 expressed vimentin, undetectable in controls. SERPINB3 induced significant cell scattering, migration and invasiveness in untransfected cells. These effects were not dependent on the anti-protease activity of the protein, as documented by the results obtained with an active loop-deleted recombinant SERPINB3 protein. Scatter activity was inhibited by an anti-SERPINB3 antibody in a dose-dependent manner and SERPINB3-transfected cells formed a significantly higher number of colonies on soft agar than controls. In conclusion, the observed results indicate that SERPINB3 induces deregulation of adhesion processes and increases the invasiveness potential supported by features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, acting at both the autocrine and the paracrine level.
