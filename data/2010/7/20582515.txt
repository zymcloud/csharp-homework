Purpose:Hepatectomy is feasible for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are eligible for liver transplantation according to the Milan criteria if they have good hepatic function. This retrospective study investigates the prognostic factors of hepatectomy in HCC patients meeting the Milan criteria.Methods:Between 1991 and 2005, 175 patients underwent hepatectomy for HCC at our institute; 111 met and 64 exceeded the Milan criteria. The prognostic factors for hepatectomy were investigated using a Cox regression model.Results:Operative mortality and morbidity were significantly lower in the patients who met the criteria than in those who exceeded the criteria. After a median follow-up of 51.5 months, the 5-year survival rate was significantly better for the patients who met the criteria than for those who exceeded the criteria (77.8% vs 35.7%; P 100 mAU/ml) for the patients who met the Milan criteria; and only the presence of a microsatellite lesion for the patients who did not meet the Milan criteria.Conclusions:Hepatectomy is safe and beneficial for HCC patients who meet the Milan criteria, but a high preoperative serum DCP level may be predictive of a poor prognosis.
