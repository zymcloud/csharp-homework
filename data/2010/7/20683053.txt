Aim:To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of combination chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and doxifluridine through hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) in patients with unresectable liver metastases of colorectal cancer.Patients and methods:Individual patients were treated through the tumour-blood supplying arteries with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and doxifluridine and chemoembolised with irinotecan and lipiodol for the detected hypervascular lesions.Results:A total of 173 cumulative cycles of chemotherapy were performed for the 32 patients, with a median of 5.0 cycles, including 96 chemoembolisations. Fifteen patients reached partial remission, 14 patients had stable disease and only 3 patients had progressive disease. The overall response rate was 46.9%. Of the 32 patients, 18 patients received first-line treatment with an overall response rate of 61.1%. The remaining 14 patients received second-line treatment, with an overall response rate of 28.6%.Conclusion:Combination chemotherapy through HAI is well tolerated and highly effective in patients with unresectable liver metastases of colorectal cancer.
