A dimeric 70-kDa chymotrypsin inhibitor with substantial N-terminal sequence homology to serine protease inhibitors was isolated from Acacia confusa seeds. The chymotrypsin inhibitor was purified using a protocol that entailed ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose and fast protein liquid chromatography-gel filtration on Superdex 75. The chymotrypsin inhibitor was unadsorbed on both Q-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose. Its chymotrypsin inhibitory activity was stable from pH 3 to 10 and from 0 to 50 degrees C. It exerted antiproliferative activity toward breast cancer MCF-7 cells with an IC(50) of 10.7+/-4.2 microM. It inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC(50) of 8+/-1.5 microM. It was devoid of antifungal activity toward a variety of fungal species. The distinctive features of the chymotrypsin inhibitor included dimeric nature, a high molecular mass, lack of trypsin inhibitory activity, highly potent HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, specific antitumor activity and relatively high pH-stability.
