Background & aims:The expression of biliary lineage markers such as cytokeratin (K) 7 by hepatocytes is thought to reflect an altered regeneration pathway recruiting a stem cell compartment, more prone to carcinogenesis. We aimed to investigate the presence of these so-called intermediate hepatobiliary cells (IHC) in liver biopsies of patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis and their potential influence on the subsequent occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From a cohort of patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis, prospectively screened for HCC, we retrospectively selected those with a liver biopsy performed for the initial diagnosis of cirrhosis. Presence of IHC was recorded when foci of K7-positive, intermediate-sized hepatocytes were detected.Results:A total of 150 patients were included (87 men; mean age, 57 y; range, 19-84 y; body mass index, 25 kg/m(2)). After a median follow-up period of 4.85 years, HCC was diagnosed in 36 patients (24%). Baseline liver biopsy showed intermediate hepatobiliary cell foci in 61 patients (41%). Intermediate cells co-expressed both hepatocytes markers and the progenitor cell markers Ep-CAM and K19. The presence of intermediate hepatobiliary cells was associated independently with HCC occurrence (Fine and Gray model; hazard ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-4.96; P = .01). Other predictors of HCC were diabetes and low platelet count. The HCC annual incidence rate was significantly higher in patients with IHC compared with patients without (8.14% vs 3.12%, Gray's test, P = .003).Conclusions:The aberrant expression of biliary K by hepatocytes in patients with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis is related independently to HCC occurrence.
