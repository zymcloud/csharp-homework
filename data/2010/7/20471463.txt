Therapeutic effects of hybrid liposomes (HL) composed of l-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and polyoxyethylene (23) dodecylether (C(12)(EO)(23)) on the metastasis of colon carcinoma (Colon26) cells were examined in vivo. Fluorescent labeled Colon26 cells were observed in the liver tissue of hepatic metastasis mouse models after the intrasplenic inoculation of the cells. Remarkably high therapeutic effects were obtained in the hepatic metastasis mouse models after the treatment with HL on the basis of relative liver weight and histological analysis of the liver tissue sections of mouse models with hematoxylin-eosin staining, Masson trichrome staining, and CEA immunostaining as a histochemical marker of metastatic colon carcinoma. Furthermore, no toxicity was observed in the hepatic metastasis mouse models after the intravenous injection of HL. Therapeutic effects of HL without any drugs on the hepatic metastasis were revealed on the basis of histological analysis for the first time in vivo.
