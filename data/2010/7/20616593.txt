Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was introduced in Japan in 1999. It has been established as a main local treatment method worldwide including Japan. On comparing outcomes between resection and RFA, they were comparable when cases were limited to those with 3 or fewer tumors 3 cm or smaller in many reports, based on which RFA has become the main treatment for small HCCs. The 5-year survival rate following RFA was as high as 57% in patients registered in the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan, 73% when cases were limited to liver damage A (Child-Pugh A), and 83.8 and 76.3% in liver damage A (Child-Pugh A) cases with a single 2-cm or smaller and 2- to 5-cm liver tumor, respectively, showing outcomes equivalent to those of resection. The outcomes at our facility were also favorable: the 5-year survival rates of Child-Pugh A liver function HCC cases with 3 or fewer tumors 3 cm or smaller following RFA and resection were 84 and 78%, respectively. Various complications and limitations of RFA have previously been reported, but the advances of physicians' skills and development of various techniques have reduced complications and expanded the indications for RAF. TACE-combined, artificial pleural effusion- and ascites-combined, and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography-guided RFAs are good examples. Adjuvant therapy, such as interferon and molecular targeted therapies following curative therapy, is expected to further improve survival after RFA.
