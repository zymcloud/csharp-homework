We used a retrospective non-randomised study to investigate the clinical effect of selective embolisation of the right gastric artery before hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using a port-catheter system. We evaluated whether the hepatic artery or the left gastric artery is the better approach for selecting the right gastric artery. A total of 367 patients (244 men and 123 women; mean age, 64.1 years) with unresectable advanced liver cancer underwent percutaneous implantation of a port-catheter system. In 294 of these patients, right gastric arterial embolisation with microcoils was attempted before placement of the port-catheter system to prevent gastric mucosal lesions. Approach was either through the hepatic artery (175 patients) or through the left gastric artery (119 patients), with success rates in catheterising the right gastric artery of 78.3% and 77.3%, respectively. If the attempt was unsuccessful, the catheter was redirected to the alternative approach, which increased the final success rate to 96.3%. Only seven patients experienced gastroduodenal mucosal lesions acutely after HAIC, as revealed by endoscopy. Embolisation of the right gastric artery is a feasible procedure that can reduce the incidence of gastric mucosal lesions associated with HAIC. Approach through either the hepatic artery or the left gastric artery is equally acceptable.
