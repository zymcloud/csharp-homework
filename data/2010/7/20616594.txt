Here we described our strategies to attain a better prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients by surgery. Among a variety of attempts conducted to date, we focused on anatomical resection and intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. There are still controversies with respect to the significance of anatomical resection. We analyzed the significance of this surgical procedure in 207 patients without macrovascular invasion. These patients underwent either anatomical resection or non-anatomical resection. We found that the patients with anatomical resection had higher recurrence-free survival rate than those with non-anatomical resection. Univariable analysis showed that liver damage, the serum level of alpha-fetoprotein, tumor number, surgical margin, and type of surgery (anatomical or non-anatomical resection) were significant predictive factors for intrahepatic recurrence. Multivariable analysis revealed that multiple tumors, alpha-fetoprotein, and non-anatomical resection were independent risk factors for recurrence. We conclude that anatomical resection is a recommendable surgical procedure in patients without macrovascular invasion. A recent innovation is the development of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. Then we have applied this to liver surgery intraoperatively. We confirm that vascular images contribute to a precise diagnosis and the detection of small portal tumor thrombi, and that Kupffer images are useful to discover the minute tumors. In addition, by clarifying the relationship between tumors and the vascular architecture, real-time 3-dimensional images using Kupffer imaging are a promising guide during the surgical procedures, although further development is needed.
