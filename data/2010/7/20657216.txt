Objectives:To evaluate the diagnostic value of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) for the characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and dysplastic nodule (DN) in cirrhotic liver, compared with contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI).Methods:A total of 54 patients with 40 HCC and 19 DN lesions were included in our study, and all lesions were histopathologically confirmed. All lesions were evaluated with CE-MRI, and breath-hold DWI was performed with b = 500 s/mm. The signal intensity (SI) of the lesions were classified as low, iso-, slightly high, and strongly high SI compared with that of the surrounding liver parenchyma on DWI for qualitative assessment. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and lesion-to-liver ADC ratio of HCCs and DNs were measured and compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test. The lesions were characterized with the use of CE-MRI criteria and DWI, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic value of DWI, CE-MRI, and these techniques combined in the differentiation of HCCs from DNs.Results:In the qualitative analysis, among 40 HCCs, 39 (97.5%) had slightly high or strongly high SI on DWI, and 1 (2.5%) had low SI; only 4 (21.5%) of 19 DNs had slightly high SI, and 15 (78.95%) had iso-SI or low SI. The mean (SD) ADC and ADC ratio for HCCs (1.28 x 10 [0.25] mm/s and 0.88 [0.15], respectively) were significantly lower (P Conclusions:Diffusion-weighted MRI can provide additional information to differentiate HCC from DN. Combined with CE-MRI, DWI allows improved characterization of HCC versus DN in cirrhotic liver.
