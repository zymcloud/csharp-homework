Objective:To investigate the inhibitory effect of diallyl disulfide (DADS) on transplantation tumor from hepatic carcinoma HePG2 cells in nude mice and its mechanism.Methods:Hepatic carcinoma HePG2 cell transplantation tumor model in nude mice was established and the effect of DADS on the growth of transplantation tumor was observed. Cell apoptosis and proliferation associated protein expressions were assayed by immunohistochemical method and Western blot. Cell apoptosis was assayed by TUNEL.Results:DADS could inhibit HePG2 cell transplantation tumor growth in nude mice. TUNEL showed that DADS enhanced the cell apoptosis and apoptosis-promoting protein caspase-3 expression, decreased apoptosis-inhibiting protein bcl-2 expression, and also inhibited proliferation associated protein PCNA expression.Conclusion:DADS may inhibit HePG2 cell transplantation tumor growth in nude mice and involve in the inhibition of cell proliferation and enhancement of cell apoptosis.
