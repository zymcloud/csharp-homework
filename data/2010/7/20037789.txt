Purpose:First-line chemotherapy (Cx-1) in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) provides survival benefit. However, it is unclear who should proceed to second-line chemotherapy (Cx-2).Methods:We reviewed patients who received Cx-2 for AGC following progressive disease after Cx-1 from 2000 to 2005 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo. To evaluate the prognostic factors in Cx-2, Cox regression multivariate analysis was performed.Results:Of 995 patients who received Cx-1 in this study period, 466 met the eligibility criteria. The median progression-free survival in Cx-1 (PFS-1) was 133 days. The median survival time from the date of starting second-line chemotherapy (MST-2) was 207 days. Multivariate analysis revealed that the factors affecting short survival time in Cx-2 were poor performance status (> or = 2), low serum albumin level (<3.5 mg/dL), elevated C-reactive protein level (> or = 1.0 mg/dL), patients with bone, liver or peritoneal metastasis, and patients without previous gastrectomy (p < 0.01). PFS-1 was an independent prognostic factor for survival (PFS-1 <120, MST-2 133 days, PFS-1 > or = 120, MST-2 258 days, hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.86, p < 0.01). The Cx-2 regimen (irinotecan vs. taxane) did not correlate with survival.Conclusion:PFS-1 is one of the prognostic factors of Cx-2 in patients with AGC.
