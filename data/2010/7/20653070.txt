The overall survival for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still limited. Although the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib has recently been approved for this disease, response rates are still low and patients often face dose-limiting toxicities which lead to a reduction in prognosis and treatment success. We here report a patient with metastasized HCC who shows a sustained response for more than 30 mo to sorafenib therapy after failure of a first line therapy with gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab.
