A 61-year-old woman with a hepatocellular carcinoma located in the subphrenic region was treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) under artificial pleural effusion. During RFA, B-mode ultrasonography showed a swirling high echoic lesion in the artificial pleural effusion. A real-time scan performed using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) revealed a jet-like extravasation of contrast medium and pooling of microbubbles in the pleural cavity, which were confirmed by angiography. CEUS successfully identified the site of bleeding and can be regarded an effective tool for detecting active bleeding in an emergency.
