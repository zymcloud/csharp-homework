Anatomic hepatic resection is considered now a "gold standard" in the treatment of patients, suffering metastatic colorectal cancer (CRR) because it secures 23-35% survival solely and 35-58% in combination with chemotherapy. The immediate results of cornbined treatment and its impact on survival of patients, suffering CRR with hepatic metastases, were studied up. In Lvivskiy Oncological Centre and Zaporizhskiy Oncological Dispensary in 2000-2009 yrs there was conducted combined treatment of 60 patients, suffering metastatic CRR. Combined treatment consisted of the large bowel tumor extirpation, hepatic resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). Median of overall survival in patients after combined treatment conduction had constituted 24.1 mo. The trustworthy improvement of late follow-up results was stimulated by combined application of hepatic resection with ACT. Small rate of complications and low postoperative lethality were noted.
