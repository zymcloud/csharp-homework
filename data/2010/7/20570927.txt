Purpose:To investigate the role of macrophages in tumor progression under sorafenib treatment and to explore whether combination of drugs that deplete macrophages improved the antitumor effect of sorafenib.Experimental design:Tumor growth, lung metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis were observed in HCCLM3-R and SMMC7721, two human hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft nude mouse models, when treated with sorafenib (30 mg/kg daily, n = 6 per group) or a vehicle as control. Macrophage infiltration was measured in the peripheral blood and in sorafenib-treated tumor by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry with F4/80 antibody and CD11b antibody. The effect of macrophage depletion on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis after sorafenib treatment, using two drug target macrophages, zoledronic acid (ZA) and clodrolip, was measured in the two models of hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Although sorafenib significantly inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis, it induced a significant increase in peripheral recruitment and intratumoral infiltration of F4/80- and CD11b-positive cells, which was accompanied with elevation of colony-stimulating factor-1, stromal-derived factor 1alpha, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the tumor and elevation of plasma colony-stimulating factor-1 and mouse vascular endothelial growth factor in peripheral blood, suggesting the role of macrophages in tumor progression under sorafenib treatment. Depletion of macrophages by clodrolip or ZA in combination with sorafenib significantly inhibited tumor progression, tumor angiogenesis, and lung metastasis compared with mice treated with sorafenib alone. ZA was more effective than clodrolip.Conclusions:Macrophages may have an important role in tumor progression under sorafenib treatment. ZA is promising when combined with sorafenib to enhance its antitumor effect.
