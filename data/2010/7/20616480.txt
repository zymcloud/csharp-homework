We conducted transhepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (TAI) was on 62 patients with highly advanced hepatocellular carcinoma without distant metastases and therapeutic outcome was compared with 18 who were untreated. TAI significantly prolonged the survival of the patients, and was the most important prognostic factor on multivariate analysis. The following 3 regimens for trans-arterial injection were compared: A, a combination of a bolus hepatic artery injection of 3 agents (cisplatin, mitomycin-C and epirubicin)+low dose 5-fluorouracil+cisplatin (FP); B, low-dose FP alone; and C, bolus intrahepatic artery injection of the above 3 agents combined without FP. Regimen A yielded in the most effective survival rate, with an efficacy rate of 41.6% and a CR of about 20%. These results indicate that TAI is an effective therapeutic modality, and the dose FP combined with a bolus intrahepatic arterial infusion may improve outcomes in advanced liver cancer.
