Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related death worldwide. The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) system consists of a group of proteins which may induce cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis through several signal pathways, leading to transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. However, the impact of genetic polymorphisms of the IGFs system on HCC has not been clarified.Methods:In this case-control study, a total of 102 HCC patients and 306 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. The genetic polymorphisms of the IGFs system genes, including IGF-1, IGF-2, IGF-1receptor (IGF-1R), IGF-2R, IGF binding protein (IGFBP-3), and insulin (INS) genes, were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and real-time PCR genotyping analysis.Results:A significant difference (p = 0.02) between case and control group in the distribution frequency of IGF-2 +3580 polymorphism was observed. Multiple regression model analysis showed that the presence of AA or AG at IGF-2R may exhibit a potential protective effect against hepatitis C [odds ratio (OR) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.82]. The combination of IGF-2 +3580 AA genotype and IGF-2R GG genotype may present a significantly lower risk of HCC (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.05-0.87). Additionally, no polymorphisms of any IGFs system genes were associated with liver-related clinicopathological markers in serum.Conclusions:Among IGFs system genes, IGF-2 and IGF-2R gene polymorphisms and combination could be considered as the most important factors contributing to increased susceptibility and pathological development of HCC.
