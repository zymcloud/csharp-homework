We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma of the iliac bone in which the primary tumor was not detected. No malignant primary lesions such as hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoid carcinoma were detected at the time or during 10 years' follow-up. In this case, transcatheter arterial chemo-embolization and radiation therapy resulted in complete regression of the iliac bone tumor and in long-term survival. We focus in particular on the clinical, histological, and therapeutic aspects of the presented case, as well as the imaging and diagnostic aspects.
