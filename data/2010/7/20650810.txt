During the last years, interventional radiological treatment of hepatocellular cancer has changed dramatically. The percutaneous ethanol infiltration is partly replaced by thermoablative methods, mainly by radiofrequency ablation. Cooled-tip electrodes and volumetric therapy planning increased the treatment success. Embolisation beads made vessel occlusion more precise and predictable, while the development of the drug eluting beads led to the most effective way of chemoembolisation. The so called radioembolisation with Yttrium 90 isotopes filled into glass microbeads is slowly gaining acceptance worldwide. Thermoablation and embolisation or chemoembolisation are the main tools for downstaging tumors, or avoiding disease progression in liver transplant recipients on the waiting list. All of these therapeutic options have their well established places in well known and worldwide accepted protocols, such as the algorithm of the Barcelona group (BCLC). In the near future, further results can be expected from the combination of available treatments, including sorafenib medication.
