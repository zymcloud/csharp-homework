The combination of irinotecan and erlotinib has been evaluated in clinical trials, although toxicity has been significant. We aimed to investigate the effect of erlotinib on SN-38 glucuronidation and the association between UGT1A polymorphisms and SN-38 glucuronidation activity in the presence of erlotinib. The inhibitory effect of erlotinib on SN-38 glucuronidation was determined by measuring the formation rates for SN-38 glucuronide, using recombinant human UGT1A1, pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs) and 52 Caucasian liver microsomes in the absence or presence of erlotinib. Inhibition kinetic studies were conducted. AUC ratios were used to predict the risk of potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) in vivo. Our data showed that erlotinib exhibited potent non-competitive inhibition against SN-38 glucuronidation in pooled HLMs and UGT1A1. Using the physiological and pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the literature, we estimated the in vivo concentrations of unbound erlotinib available for UGT1A1 active site and thus the AUC ratios of SN-38 were also quantitatively predicted. It is estimated that erlotinib administered at 50mg/day or higher doses may result in at least a 24% increase in SN-38 AUC. Significant correlations were observed between SN-38 glucuronidation activity in the presence of erlotinib and UGT1A1*28 in 52 Caucasian liver microsomes. Our results suggest that erlotinib is a potent inhibitor of SN-38 glucuronidation via UGT1A1 inhibition. The coadministration of erlotinib with irinotecan may result in clinically significant DDI. UGT1A1*28 polymorphism correlates with erlotinib's effect on SN-38 glucuronidation. The present findings shed light on the development and optimisation of combinations involving irinotecan and erlotinib.
