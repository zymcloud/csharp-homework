Krukenberg tumor is a well-known ovarian metastasis, usually of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma in female patients. Although gastric carcinoma is more frequent in men, to our knowledge, only few cases of counterpart testicular metastases have been described as yet. We report a 64-year-old patient who complained of right testicular pain. Right-sided orchiectomy was performed, and metastatic signet ring cell carcinoma of spermatic cord and testis was diagnosed through histological examination and immunohistochemistry. The following stomach biopsy confirmed the primary signet ring cell carcinoma in the stomach. This extremely rare form of metastatic dissemination resembles the Krukenberg tumor of ovaries. Immunohistochemical staining plays an important role in the differential diagnosis of spermatic cord enlargement.
