Background:The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of F-18 sodium fluoride (NaF) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) relative to Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) planar bone scintigraphy with no CT (BS) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with suspicious bone metastasis.Methods:Both Tc-99m MDP BS and F-18 NaF PET-CT were performed for 34 consecutive Taiwanese HCC patients (five female and 29 male; mean age, 61.0+/-12.0 years) within a time span of 1 month (mean: 11.3+/-10.4 days). The accuracies of BS and PET-CT were determined by comparing their results with the finalized clinical data in a lesion-by-lesion manner.Results:According to the pathological and/or follow-up results, the accuracy for detecting metastatic bone lesions by Tc-99m MDP BS is 75.4% and that by F-18 NaF PET-CT is 95.7%, respectively. F-18 NaF PET-CT is significantly more accurate than Tc-99m MDP BS (P=0.0001). Furthermore, there is a significant correlation between the presence of F-18 NaF PET-CT-positive bone lesions and the survival time of HCC patients. On the other hand, the diagnostic results from BS are not correlated with the survival time of these HCC patients.Conclusion:F-18 NaF using PET-CT system has significantly better sensitivity and specificity than conventional Tc-99m MDP BS in detecting metastatic HCC bone lesions that are predominantly osteolytic. The diagnostic result of PET-CT also serves as a more effective prognostic indictor for HCC patients.
