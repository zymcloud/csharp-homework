Aim:To evaluate the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) using a suspension of a fine-powder formulation of cisplatin (DDPH) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The study population was comprised of 164 patients who were treated by TACE alone. Of these patients, 76 underwent TACE using a suspension of DDPH in lipiodol (LPD) (DDPH group), and the remaining 88 underwent TACE with an emulsion of doxorubicin (ADM) with LPD (ADM group). We compared the DDPH group with the ADM group in terms of the objective early response rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results:The objective early response rate in the DDPH group was significantly higher than that in the ADM group (54% vs 24%, P Conclusion:We conclude that TACE using a suspension of DDPH in LPD could be a useful treatment for HCC.
