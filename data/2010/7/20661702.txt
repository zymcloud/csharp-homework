The purpose of this report was to describe pseudolesions of the liver that mimicked residual hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as observed on gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) obtained shortly after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Between June 2008 and December 2008, three patients underwent MRI within 12 days after TACE to rule out remaining viable cancerous tissue or to assess the treatment effect. In all three patients, nontumorous liver tissue adjacent to the treated HCC exhibited focal arterial enhancement on dynamic phase and subsequent diminished uptake of gadoxetate disodium on hepatocellular phase images, which mimicked residual HCC. All three patients had mild postembolization syndrome at the time of EOB-MRI and showed no evidence of residual or recurrent tumors on follow-up. The findings of these areas may represent transient focal hyperemia and damage to the liver cell function caused by TACE. Radiologists should be aware that EOB-MRI obtained shortly after TACE may show pseudolesions around the treated tumors and should not mistake them for residual or recurrent tumors.
