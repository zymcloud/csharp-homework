Background:Postoperative gastroparesis syndrome (PGS) is a common complication after abdominal surgery in patients with primary liver cancer. However, surgeons usually do not have effective treatment for them.Objective:To explore the effects of acupuncture applied to Zusanli and other acupoints on PGS in patients after abdominal surgery.Design, setting, participants and interventions:Sixty-three PGS patients of abdominal surgery, from Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgical Hospital, were randomized into acupuncture group (32 cases) and metoclopramide group (31 cases). The patients in acupuncture group were treated with acupuncture applied to Zusanli and other acupoints once a day, while the patients in metoclopramide group were intramuscularly injected 20 mg metoclopramide three times a day.Main outcome measures:Volume of gastric drainage, number of treatment and cure rate in the two groups were measured and evaluated.Results:Acupuncture and metoclopramide could significantly reduce gastric drainage volume. In acupuncture group, the cure rate was 90.6% and the number of treatment was 6.58+/-4.26, while in metoclopramide group, the cure rate and the number of treatment were 32.3% and 10.13+/-3.60 respectively. There were significant differences in gastric drainage volume, cure rate and number of treatment between the two groups (P<0.05, P<0.01).Conclusion:Acupuncture is a good treatment for PGS, with fewer treatments, high cure rate and rapid effect.
