Ciliated hepatic foregut cyst (CHFC) is a rare foregut developmental malformation usually diagnosed in adulthood; however, rare cases have been reported in the pediatric population. CHFC can transform into a squamous cell carcinoma resulting in death despite surgical resection of the isolated malignancy. We report the presentation, evaluation, and surgical management of a symptomatic 17-year-old girl found to have a 6.5 x 4.5 cm CHFC and suggest that all patients with suspected CHFC undergo prompt evaluation and complete cyst excision.
