Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has broad impacts on an array of diverse cellular functions including cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. Perturbations of the TGF-β signaling pathways are involved in progression of various tumors. Autophagy is a pivotal response of normal and cancer cells to environmental stresses and is induced by various stimuli. Otherwise, autophagy has an intrinsic function in tumor suppression. Recently, we demonstrated that TGF-β induces autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and mammary carcinoma cells. Autophagy activation by TGF-β is mediated through the Smad and JNK pathways. We show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of autophagy genes suppresses the growth inhibitory function of TGF-β and that autophagy activation potentiates TGF-β-mediated induction of proapoptotic genes, Bim and Bmf, in hepatoma cells. In this context, the autophagy pathway might contribute to the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β, in conjunction with other anti-proliferative pathways downstream of TGF-β signaling. The context and manner by which the TGF-β signaling pathway regulates autophagy have implications for a better understanding of pathological and bidirectional roles of TGF-β signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.
