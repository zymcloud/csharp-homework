In the EASL and AASLD guidelines, hepatic resection (HR) is considered the first option for patients in stage 0 (very early HCC). This statement was not based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) versus other therapies, but on the oncological assumption that HR is the better procedure for obtaining complete tumor ablation including a safety margin. Subsequently, three RCTs compared percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus HR in patients with early HCC. All failed to demonstrate better survival in favor of HR, even though the larger size of the early stage needs a larger area of necrosis. A recent study focused on stage 0 demonstrated a sustained local complete response after RFA comparable with that of HR. All these trials established that RFA is less invasive and associated with lower complication rates and lower costs. These data suggest that RFA can be considered the first option for operable patients with very early HCC. Other options (HR, PEI, selective TAE/TACE) can be used as salvage therapy for the few cases in which RFA is unsuccessful or unfeasible.
