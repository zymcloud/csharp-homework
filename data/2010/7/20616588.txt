In Japan, more than 70% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) develop from hepatitis C virus infections and 15% are derived from hepatitis B infections. Since most have received close observation with e.g. ultrasound or enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan every 3-6 months before development of HCC, the HCC nodule was detected in the early stage in more than 60% of the patients. An algorithm for the HCC surveillance was shown as a Japanese clinical guideline of a scientific-based research group. At the joint symposium with JSH and the International Liver Cancer Association (ILCA), the algorithm of diagnosis and treatment for HCC was discussed using Answerpad. Several important discussions are described in this article.
