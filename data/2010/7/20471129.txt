Background & aims:To assess the risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the underlying liver status and on-treatment viral response during long-term lamivudine therapy in patients with hepatitis B virus-related liver disease.Patients and methods:Between March 1997 and February 2005, a total of 872 patients were treated with lamivudine for more than one year. Between 1983 and 1998, a total of 699 patients were enrolled as historical controls.Results:For patients with compensated cirrhosis, HCC occurred in 4.9% (5/103) of cases with sustained viral suppression (persistently Conclusion:Lamivudine therapy reduced the incidence of HCC in patients with compensated cirrhosis when the viral suppression was sustained.
