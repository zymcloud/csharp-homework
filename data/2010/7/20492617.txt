Endocrine tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of rare neoplasms. Liver metastatic endocrine tumors (MET) are amenable to various therapeutic modalities including liver transplantation (LT). However, LT for MET remains controversial because of the lack of clear selection criteria. The purpose of this study based on thorough perusal of English and French literature since 1989 was to identify prognostic factors and propose recommendations for selecting patients most likely to benefit LT for primary and secondary endocrine tumors.
