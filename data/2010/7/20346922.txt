In this study, the apoptotic effect of alpha-bisabolol, a sesquiterpene, against human liver carcinoma cell line HepG2 was investigated. MTT assay showed alpha-bisabolol could effectively induce cytotoxicity in several human cancer cell lines (PC-3, Hela, ECA-109 and HepG2). The results of nuclei morphology examination, DNA fragmentation detection, flow cytometry analysis and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspases indicated alpha-bisabolol might induce dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Western blot data also showed a cascade activation of caspases-8,-9,-3 and promoted expression of Fas, implying caspase-8 might function as an upstream regulator, and the Fas-related pathway might be involved in this process. Preparation of mitochondrial/cytosol fraction followed with immunoblot analysis showed the release of chromosome c from mitochondria, down-regulated expression of Bcl-2 and translocation of Bax, Bak and Bid, suggesting the mitochondrial-related pathway might be involved in alpha-bisabolol-induced apoptosis either. Detection of accumulation of nuclear wild-type p53 and up-regulated expression of NFkappaB indicated these two key regulator with transcriptional decision-making function in various signaling pathways might also play a role in alpha-bisabolol-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells.
