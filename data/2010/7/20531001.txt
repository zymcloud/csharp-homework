Objective:To outline our experience with hepatectomy with simultaneous resection of the portal vein and hepatic artery for advanced perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, and to discuss the clinical significance of this challenging hepatectomy.Summary background data:Only a few authors reported negative results for this surgery in a very limited number of patients.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 50 patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma who underwent hepatectomy (left trisectionectomy in 26, left hepatectomy in 23, and right hepatectomy in 1) with simultaneous resection and reconstruction of the portal vein and hepatic artery, focusing on surgical outcome and survival.Results:The operative time was 776 +/- 191 minutes, and blood loss was 2593 +/- 1890 mL. Time of vessel resection and reconstruction was 25 +/- 19 minutes for the portal vein and 119 +/- 56 minutes for the hepatic artery. A total of 27 (54.0%) patients developed several kinds of complications, including intra-abdominal abscess (n = 13), wound infection (n = 9), bile leakage from liver stump (n = 9), and liver failure (n = 7). Relaparotomy was necessary in 5 (10.0%) patients. One (2.0%) patient died of a postoperative complication. Microscopic cancer invasion of the resected portal vein was found in 44 (88.0%) patients, while that of the resected hepatic artery was found in 27 (54.0%). The distal bile duct margin, proximal bile duct margin, and radial margin were positive for cancer in 2 (4.0%), 4 (8.0%), and 17 (34.0%) patients, respectively. Consequently, R0 resection was achieved in 33 (66.0%) patients. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 78.9%, 36.3%, and 30.3%, respectively. Survival for 30 patients with pM0 disease who underwent R0 resection was better, being 40.7% at the 3- and 5-year time points.Conclusion:Major hepatectomy with simultaneous resection and reconstruction of the portal vein and hepatic artery is technically demanding. However, this surgery can be performed with acceptable mortality by an experienced surgeon and offers a better chance of long-term survival in selected patients.
