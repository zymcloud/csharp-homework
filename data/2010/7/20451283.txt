Background & aims:The currently used staging systems for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not satisfactory. The optimal prognostic model for HCC is still under intense debate. This study aimed to propose a new staging system for HCC based on total tumor volume (TTV) and to compare it with the currently used systems.Methods:A total of 2030 HCC patients undergoing different treatment strategies were retrospectively analyzed. TTV was defined as the sum of the volume of each tumor [(4/3)x3.14x(radius of tumor in cm)(3)]. The discriminatory ability of the TTV-based staging system and the four current systems, including the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), Japan Integrated Staging system, and Tokyo system, was examined by comparing the Akaike information criterion (AIC) using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:A higher TTV correlated well with the decreased survival in HCC patients (pConclusions:TTV may be a feasible tumoral prognostic predictor for HCC. In this single-hospital study that included patients with early to advanced cancer stages, the TTV-CTP-AFP model provides the best prognostic ability among 12 TTV-based and currently used staging systems.
