Transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis is initially a slow growing tumor arising from the transitional epithelium of the mucous membrane of the renal pelvis. Recurrences occur in two forms: superficial bladder cancer and distant metastases. The common metastasis is in the lung, liver, brain and bone. Oral metastasis is seldom reported. The authors report an unusual case of transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis metastasized to the oral cavity and lung simultaneously in a 74-year-old man, which occurred 1 year after a left nephroureterectomy. The patient underwent six courses of chemotherapy (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and nedaplatin), and received radiotherapy for the oral lesion. The symptoms were alleviated, but the tumor recurred in the oral cavity 2 years later. Brain and liver metastases were confirmed by CT. Repeated radiotherapy for oral metastasis was performed, but the patient died 4 years after the initial nephroureterectomy due to multiple metastases.
