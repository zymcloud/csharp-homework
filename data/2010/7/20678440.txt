Objective:To investigate the dynamic expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and its clinical values in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The dynamic changes of liver pathology, HIF-1alpha transcription and expression were observed through the hepatoma model. The self-control specimens from 35 human HCC patients were collected and the expression, cellular distribution, and clinicopathological features of HIF-1alpha and its gene was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and nested- PCR, respectively.Results:Both levels of hepatic HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha mRNA expression increased during the HCC development course. The incidence of HIF-1alpha and the ratio of HIF-1alpha to beta-actin was 0% and 0.16+/-0.02 in the control rats, 77.8% and 0.29+/-0.04 in the denatured rats, 88.9% and 0.52+/-0.03 in the precancerous rats, and 100% and 0.84+/-0.02 in the cancerous rats respectively, with significant difference between the control group and any of the experimental groups (P = 0.000). The positive HIF-1alpha was brown and granule-like and mainly presented in cytoplasm and few in nucleus. The incidence of HIF-1alpha was 80% (28/35) in HCC and 100% (35/35) in its surrounding tissues. The clinical pathological features indicated HIF-1alpha expression associated with tumor size and differentiation degree the of HCC. No correlation was found between HIF-1alpha and tumor numbers or positive-HBsAg.Conclusions:HIF-1alpha expression is associated with occurrence and development of HCC, and is perhaps a target molecule for HCC therapy.
