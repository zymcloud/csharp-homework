Background:Imatinib 400 mg daily is the standard treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The safety and efficacy of imatinib in CML patients with pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction has not been analyzed.Methods:The authors analyzed the outcome of 259 patients with early chronic phase CML treated with imatinib (starting dose 400 mg in 50, 800 mg in 209). Pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction was seen in 38 (15%) and 11 (4%) patients, respectively.Results:Dose reductions were required in 91 (43%) of 210 patients with normal organ function, compared with 8 (73%) of 11 (P = .065) with renal dysfunction, and 19 (50%) of 38 (P = .271) with liver dysfunction. Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities including anemia (29%, 10%, and 7% of patients with renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, and normal organ function, respectively), neutropenia (57%, 30%, and 30%), and thrombocytopenia (43%, 30%, and 26%) were more frequent in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction treated with high-dose imatinib. Grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicities were observed at similar frequencies. Complete cytogenetic response rates, event-free survival, and overall survival were similar in all groups.Conclusions:Although patients with pre-existing liver and/or renal dysfunction might have a higher rate of hematologic toxicity and require more frequent dose reductions, most patients can be adequately managed, resulting in response rates and survival similar to those without pre-existing organ dysfunction.
