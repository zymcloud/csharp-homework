Littoral cell angioma is a rare vascular tumor of the spleen. An increased association with concomitant malignancies has been described. We report the case of a 67-year-old man suffering from colon carcinoma and presenting with a tumor of the spleen which could be seen using radiography. Splenectomy was performed and histology revealed a 2.1 cm vascular tumor with a characteristic immunophenotype (CD31/68+). In addition a hepatocellular carcinoma was found. Due to the relationship with malignant tumors littoral cell angioma should be considered in every case of a splenic tumoral space-occupying mass, particularly in carcinoma patients.
