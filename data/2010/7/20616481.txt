We report a rare case of resected endocrine cell carcinoma in the remnant stomach. A 68-year-old man had undergone laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Eleven months later, postoperative endoscopy survey showed a flat, depressed lesion in the posterior wall of the remnant gastric cardia. After 3 months, endoscopic re-examination indicated that the tumor had grown rapidly and had changed in shape. Endocrine cell carcinoma was diagnosed by biopsy. He then underwent total resection of the remnant stomach with lymph node dissection. Although adjuvant chemotherapy was given, multiple liver metastases and lymph node recurrence were found 13 months after the second surgery. A new regimen of chemotherapy was not effective and he died 18 months after surgery.
