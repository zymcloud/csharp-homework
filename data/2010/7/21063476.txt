Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is naturally resistant to radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, leaving surgery as the mainstream therapeutic approach. However, the 5-year recurrence rate after curative resection is as high as 61.5%. The background hepatitis B- or C-induced cirrhosis and the presence of micrometastases at the time of surgery have been regarded as two main causes of recurrence. Recently, accumulating evidence suggests that growth factors and cytokines released during the physiological process of post-surgical liver regeneration could induce the activation of dormant micrometastatic lesions. The establishment of neovasculature to support either liver regeneration or HCC growth involves multiple cell types including liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells, and circulating endothelial progenitors. The crosstalks among these cells are driven by multiple molecules and signaling pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factors and their receptors, platelet-derived growth factor, the angiopoietin/Tie family, hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met signaling, and others. Anti-angiogenic agent targeting liver cancer vasculature has been reported to be able to generate limited survival benefit of the patients. In this review, discussions are focused on various angiogenic mechanisms of HCC and liver regeneration, as well as the prevailing anti-angiogenic strategies.
