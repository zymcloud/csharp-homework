The advances in imaging techniques and establishment of screening and surveillance protocols for high-risk populations for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have led to the detection of small hepatic nodules in patients with chronic liver diseases, but in general the prognosis for HCC remains poor. Early detection of HCC or detection of small/early HCC followed by appropriate treatment is the key to significantly alter the prognosis and significantly decrease tumor-related deaths. Recent advances in gene profiling have led to a better understanding in early hepatocarcinogenesis and have suggested several possible molecular signatures which are able to separate early HCCs from their precursors, the dysplastic nodules. The continued search for new and more accurate molecular signatures must be translated into the clinical setting, where they can advance screening and surveillance of high-risk patients in the detection of early HCC.
