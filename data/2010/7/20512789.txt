In this review, the role of dietary antioxidants in the prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis is examined. Both human and animal models are discussed. Vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium are antioxidants that are essential in the human diet. A number of non-essential chemicals also contain antioxidant activity and are consumed in the human diet, mainly as plants or as supplements, including beta-carotene, ellagic acid, curcumin, lycopene, coenzyme Q(10), epigallocatechin gallate, N-acetyl cysteine, and resveratrol. Although some human and animal studies show protection against carcinogenesis with the consumption of higher amounts of antioxidants, many studies show no effect or an enhancement of carcinogenesis. Because of the conflicting results from these studies, it is difficult to make dietary recommendations as to whether consuming higher amounts of specific antioxidants will decrease the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.
