Objective:To investigate the role of histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) in the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:HepG2 cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) were divided into 3 groups after transfection pSUPER-HDAC7 retroviral interference plasmid: a pSUPER(HDAC7RNAi+) group, a pSUPER(HDAC7RNAi-) group, and a pSUPER group as the control group. The expression of HDAC7, p21, cyclin E, matrix metalloproteinases 10 (MMP10), and hypoxiainducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) were detected by Western blot. The expression of HDAC7 in cell lines was determined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry, the nude mice modle, and vascular endothelial cells 2-dimensional tubulogenesis in vitro and in vivo.Results:Compared with the control group and the pSUPER(HDAC7RNAi-) group, the expression of HDAC7 was downregulated, the rate of cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in the pSUPER(HDAC7RNAi+) group increased more significantly; the expression of p21 and HIF-1alpha was increased significantly, while the expression of cyclin E and MMP10 in the pSUPER(HDAC7RNAi+) group was downregulated (PConclusion:The expression of HDAC7 protein plays an important role in the apoptosis and vascular tubulogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma by the upregulation of p21 and HIF-1alpha and the downregulation of cyclin E and MMP10.
