Background:The aim was to compare short-term results of right hepatectomy using the anterior approach (AA) and liver hanging manoeuvre with the conventional approach (CA) for large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:This was a retrospective review of 71 consecutive patients with HCC at least 5 cm in diameter who underwent curative right hepatectomy using either the AA with the liver hanging manoeuvre (33) or the CA (38) between January 2004 and December 2008. Clinical data, operative results and survival outcomes were analysed.Results:The groups had similar clinical, laboratory and pathological parameters. The AA group had larger tumours than the CA group (P = 0.039), but comparable grade and stage distribution. The operative results were similar except for an increased blood transfusion requirement with the conventional procedure (P = 0.001). The AA group had a lower recurrence rate (P = 0.003) and better disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.001) than the CA group, but overall survival rates were not significantly different (P = 0.091). Presence of tumour encapsulation, absence of tumour microvascular invasion and AA were predictive of DFS, whereas tumour stage was the only independent predictor of overall survival.Conclusion:The AA right hepatectomy with liver hanging manoeuvre for large HCC is associated with reduced blood transfusion requirement and lower recurrence rates in the short term.
