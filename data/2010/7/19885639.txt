Superselective TACE is defined as TACE from the distal portion of the feeding subsegmental hepatic artery to evoke strong ischemic effects on a small area of the liver, thus avoiding damage to liver function. Lipiodol (iodized oil) is semi-fluid, and it can flow into the surrounding portal venules and hepatic sinusoids through peribiliary plexus (PBP) and the drainage route from the hypervascular HCC. Therefore, the reversed flow from the hepatic sinusoids and portal venules to the peripheral portion of the tumor and daughter nodules can be blocked by Lipiodol injected before a particulate embolus (such as gelatin sponge particles). Common complications of superselective TACE are mild local pain and fever and temporary minimal changes of liver function. Reported CR ratio of definitely hypervascular HCC are around 30-60% by superselective TACE with Lipiodol for hypervascular HCC less than 5 cm. According to a nationwide survey by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan (LCSGJ), overall 5-year survival rate was 26% in patients with HCCs not indicated for surgery or RFA (PEI), mainly treated by segmental or subsegmental TACE using Lipiodol. Therefore, this TACE technique should be widely introduced as the first line technique for TACE therapy of HCC.
