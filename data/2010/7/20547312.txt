The most utilized staging system for establishing the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and concurrently supporting the choice of best treatment strategy is the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), which includes 4 disease stages (early, intermediate, advanced, terminal). The BCLC intermediate stage (BCLC-B) consists of patients in Child-Pugh A or B with multinodular large HCC and preserved performance status. This definition is rather broad and includes a heterogeneous patient population, according to either tumor extension (from bifocal HCC to subtotal tumor replacement of liver parenchyma) or liver function (from Child-Pugh compensated A5 to decompensated B9). The recommended treatment modality for this HCC stage is, in general, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, according to the heterogeneity of the intermediate population, patients are best served when the treatment decision is individualized and taken within a multidisciplinary team. For instance, patients in Child-Pugh B may not benefit at all from TACE or even suffer detrimental effects. TACE achieves complete radiological necrosis in about 35-60% of cases (after 2-3 courses). Patients not achieving complete necrosis and patients with early large recurrence should be managed individually, taking into consideration systemic treatments, which usually are reserved for advanced cases.
