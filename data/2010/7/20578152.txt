The approval of sorafenib as the first effective drug for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a milestone in the treatment of this disease. A better understanding of HCC pathogenesis has led to the development of several novel targeted treatments. HCC is treated in a uniquely multidisciplinary way requiring surgeons, hepatologists, interventional radiologists, and oncologists. This review describes the molecular pathogenesis of HCC, explores current and future treatments based on these pathways, and describes how these new therapies may augment existing approaches to HCC treatment.
