Background:Sunitinib has shown single-agent activity in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer (MBC). We investigated the safety of the combination of sunitinib and paclitaxel in an exploratory study of patients with locally advanced or MBC.Methods:Patients received oral sunitinib 25 mg/day (with escalation to 37.5 mg/day as tolerated) on a continuous daily dosing schedule and paclitaxel 90 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Study endpoints included safety (primary endpoint), pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity.Results:Twenty-two patients were enrolled. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were fatigue/asthenia (77%), dysgeusia (68%), and diarrhea (64%). Grade 3 AEs included neutropenia (43%), fatigue/asthenia (27%), neuropathy (18%), and diarrhea (14%). No drug-drug interaction was observed on the basis of pharmacokinetic analysis. Of 18 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 7 (38.9%) achieved objective responses (including 2 complete and 5 partial responses). Clinical responses were observed in three of nine patients with triple-negative receptor status (estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative).Conclusions:These data indicate that sunitinib and paclitaxel in combination are well tolerated in patients with locally advanced or MBC. No drug-drug interaction was detected and there was preliminary evidence of antitumor activity.
