Background:The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Rapamycin (=sirolimus), a specific mTOR inhibitor, leads to G(1) arrest of many malignant cell lines and currently, analogues of rapamycin are being investigated as a cancer chemotherapeutic adjuvant.Aim:To study the toxicity and tolerability of rapamycin therapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between June 2005 and February 2007, patients with advanced HCC, not eligible for any established therapy, were included in the study.Results:Eighteen patients (F/M: 5/13) with compensated liver cirrhosis (Child A n = 11, Child B n = 5, Child C n = 2) and histologically proven HCC were included in this study. According to the BCLC staging system, most of the patients enrolled had an advanced HCC: BCLC stage B: n = 2, Barcelona Clinic Liver-Cancer (BCLC) stage C: n = 14, BCLC stage D: n = 2. Overall, therapy with rapamycin was well tolerated. Most common toxicities were thrombocytopaenia and anaemia. We did not observe any partial or complete tumour response. At 3 months, two patients had stable disease and at 6 months, all patients had progressed. The median overall survival was 5.27 months, median time to progression was 3 months.Conclusion:Rapamycin is well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC, but only minimally effective.
