Purpose:To determine histological and MR imaging differences between areas with Gd-EOB-DTPA (gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid) uptake and without in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) as seen on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced hepatobiliary-phase MR images.Materials and methods:This study included nine patients with nine histopathologically proven HCCs (mean size, 1.9 cm) that consisted of two portions of a non-hypointense (Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake) and hypointense area (no Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake) in one tumor as depicted on hepatobiliary-phase MR images. Two radiologists and one pathologist compared the histological and MR finding differences between the two portions in consensus.Results:In eight specimens, non-hypointense areas of six specimens showed a green color and two specimens did not show a green color. Microscopically, two of nine showed a higher percentage of bile pigments in the non-hypointense area as compared to the hypointense area and the remaining seven showed no difference. Six were homogeneous Edmondson-Steiner grade II, and one was grade I. In two, non-hypointense areas were grade II and hypointense areas were grade I. No difference between the two portions was found for necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrosis, and a fibrous capsule. Seven on T1/T2-weighted images and eight on arterial and portal phase images showed no different signal intensity between the two portions.Conclusion:Although macroscopically, a non-hypointense area of an HCC seen on GD-EOB-DTPA-enhanced hepatobiliary-phase images may be associated with the area with a green color, no definite microscopic and MR imaging findings that could discriminate a non-hypointense from a hypointense area of an HCC was found.
