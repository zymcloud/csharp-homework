The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates cell survival signaling and supports tumor progression in multiple tumor types. We identified a spectrum of inhibitory IGF-IR antibodies with diverse binding epitopes and ligand-blocking properties. By binding distinct inhibitory epitopes, two of these antibodies, BIIB4 and BIIB5, block both IGF-I and IGF-II binding to IGF-IR using competitive and allosteric mechanisms, respectively. Here, we explored the inhibitory effects of combining BIIB4 and BIIB5. In biochemical assays, the combination of BIIB4 and BIIB5 improved both the potency and extent of IGF-I and IGF-II blockade compared with either antibody alone. In tumor cells, the combination of BIIB4 and BIIB5 accelerated IGF-IR downregulation and more efficiently inhibited IGF-IR activation as well as downstream signaling, particularly AKT phosphorylation. In several carcinoma cell lines, the antibody combination more effectively inhibited ligand-driven cell growth than either BIIB4 or BIIB5 alone. Notably, the enhanced tumor growth-inhibitory activity of the BIIB4 and BIIB5 combination was much more pronounced at high ligand concentrations, where the individual antibodies exhibited substantially reduced activity. Compared with single antibodies, the BIIB4 and BIIB5 combination also significantly further enhanced the antitumor activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Moreover, in osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft models, the BIIB4 and BIIB5 combination significantly reduced tumor growth to a greater degree than each single antibody. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting multiple distinct inhibitory epitopes on IGF-IR may be a more effective strategy of affecting the IGF-IR pathway in cancer.
