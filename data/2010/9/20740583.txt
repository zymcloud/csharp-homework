Background and objectives:There were no comprehensive studies on the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of alpha-protein-producing gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic factors of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing gastric cancer.Methods:Among 4,426 gastric cancer patients receiving surgery in the Cancer Hospital of Fudan University from 1996 to 2007, there were 111 patients with elevated serum level of AFP preoperatively after excluding chronic hepatitis, hepatocirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Primary lesions of 104 patients were stained positively for AFP. The clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic factors of AFP-producing gastric cancer were analyzed. Additionally, 208 stage-matched AFP-negative gastric cancer patients were selected as control.Results:There was a significantly higher incidence of vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis in AFP-positive group than in the negative group. The overall 5-year survival rates of AFP-positive and negative groups were 28% and 38%, respectively. The AFP-positive group had a significantly poorer survival in comparison to the stage-matched negative group. The independent prognostic factors of AFP-positive group included liver metastasis and pathological stage.Conclusions:AFP-positive gastric cancer had more aggressive behavior than that of AFP-negative gastric cancer. In addition to surgery, multimodal therapy should be considered.
