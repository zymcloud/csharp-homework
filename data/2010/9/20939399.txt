Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a subviral agent which depends on the envelope proteins (HBsAg) of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Therefore, hepatitis D is observed only in patients infected with HBV. Chronic hepatitis D is the least frequent albeit most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis. A resurgence of chronic hepatitis D has been observed in Northern and Central Europe, mainly due to immigration of patients from regions with high prevalence. Every HBsAg-positive patient should be screened for concurrent HDV infection. Standard treatment consists of pegylated interferon-alpha for at least one year. Sustained virological response rates are approximately 20%. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with advanced cirrhosis or limited hepatocellular carcinoma. Preventive measures for hepatitis D are the same as for hepatitis B.
