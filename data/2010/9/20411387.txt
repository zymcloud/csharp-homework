Background:The aim of this study was to ascertain the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients who had undergone previous liver resection (LR) for HCC.Methods:A case-control study (1:2) was designed to compare patients who underwent LT due to HCC recurrence with a previous LR for HCC (study group) with those who underwent LT for primary HCC but without previous LR (control group).Results:From January 1990 to December 2007, a total of 303 cirrhotic patients with primary HCC were evaluated for surgery. Primary LT was performed in 191 and LR in 100. When HCC recurrence was diagnosed after LR (69/100), 17 of the 69 (25%) patients underwent LT (study group). The median follow-up was 70 months (12.7-203.0 months). Disease-free survivals at 1, 3, and 5 years in the study group versus the control group were 86%, 68%, 58% vs. 97%, 93%, 89%, respectively (p 1 year. Recurrence after LT was 75% in group 1 vs. 15.4% in group 2 (p Conclusions:Liver transplantation can be safely performed after a previous LR for HCC. Patients with recurrence during the first year after hepatectomy have a poor prognosis after LT.
