Importance of the field:With the recent advances in the knowledge of molecular biology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there have been encouraging developments in targeted therapy for advanced HCC.Areas covered in this review:This review discusses the development of targeted therapy for advanced HCC patient since 2006. Among the newly identified targets, promising results have been shown in targeting the anti-angiogenic pathway. Pure anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab and PTK 787 demonstrate modest activity in treating patients with advanced HCC. Sorafenib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with both anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects, has been shown to prolong the overall survival of patients with advanced HCC in two Phase III randomized trials. Like sorafenib, other anti-angiogenic multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib, pazopanib, brivanib and linifanib, also show promising activity in various stages of clinical trials. Other on-going early-phase studies are exploring the activities of drugs targeting novel pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/m TOR, hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal epithelial transition factor and insulin-like growth factor.What the reader will gain:After reading this review, the reader should have an in-depth understanding of the latest developments in the molecular targeted therapy of advanced HCC.Take home message:The development of sorafenib in the treatment of advanced HCC proves the concept that molecular targeted therapies, especially anti-angiogenic agents, play a pivotal role in the treatment of this otherwise chemoresistant neoplasm. Future progress depends on further unraveling more molecular mechanisms of HCC for therapeutic intervention.
