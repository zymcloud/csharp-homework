We performed percutaneous microwave co-agulation therapy (PMCT) using a new microwave electrode and microwave generator to lessen the number of microwave electrode insertions for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) measuring 2 to 2.5 to or=5 mm on dynamic computed tomography. Necrosis of HCC and the non-cancerous area surrounding the tumor was obtained by a single needle insertion in 23 patients (tumor size: 2 to 2.5 to 2 to 2.5 to or=5 mm, we have not detected local recurrences. On the other hand, 4 of the 10 patients who could not obtain the treated margin of >or=5 mm, experienced a local recurrence. No fatal complications were observed. However, bile duct stricture was observed in 2 patients. The new microwave coagulation system can induce extensive necrosis with a small number of microwave electrode insertions. This system may enhance the efficacy of PMCT for HCC measuring
