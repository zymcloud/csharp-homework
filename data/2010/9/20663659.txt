The purpose of this study is to evaluate high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) in the treatment of larger hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Eighty-nine (89) patients with unrespectable larger HCC were randomised into a TACE group (n=45) and a TACE plus HIFU group (n=44). Therapeutic effects were assessed at follow-up with physical examination, level of serum alpha-fetoprotein and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients were followed up to observe long-term therapeutic effects and evaluated prognostic factors for survival. No severe complication was observed. Follow-up images showed that total effective rate in tumour response accounted for 72.8% in the TACE-HIFU group, which were significantly higher than that of TACE group (44.5%, P
