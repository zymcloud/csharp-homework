Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increases worldwide. 600 new cases may occur in Hungary yearly, but statistical data show much fewer patients seen in hepatological care units. Despite of new drug sorafenib or ablative techniques, surgical methods remain the most effective treatment of HCC. Results of orthotropic liver transplantation (OTLX) in selected HCC cases have been becoming promising lately. Hungarian transplant capacity and HCC stadium levels in the majority of diagnosed cases exclude OTLX for all patients. Surgical resection is determined by the functional liver remnant (FLR). Cirrhotic patients tolerate left lateral segmentectomy. Tumors of the right lobe after occlusion of right main portal branch - if left lobe regeneration is satisfying - might be resected even in cirrhotic liver. Intra-operative preconditioning significantly diminishes serum levels of ischemia-reperfusion markers and operative risk. At the First Department of Surgery of Semmelweis University, 2167 liver tumors were operated between 1996 and 2009, including 254 HCC cases. Radical resection was performed in 211 (82.7% resection rate). Laparoscopic liver resection is becoming popular all over the world, representing less surgical injury compared to open procedure. Indication of minimal invasive liver resection is therefore specifically important in cirrhotic patients.
