Callus and differentiated shoots initiated from Solanum tuberosum L. on MS media containing BA, IAA, and Kin. Glycoalkaloids are produced in callus and shoots in concentrations higher than original tubers using HPLC. Callus methanolic extract had promising anticancer activity with low IC(50) values against human carcinoma cell lines of breast, lymphoplastic leukemia, larynx, liver, cervix, colon, and brain, IC(50) (microg/mL) were 2.7, 3.7, 6, 6.7, 10, 13.6, and 22.3 respectively. Antioxidant capacity of the extract (76.4%) performed using ESR. Preliminary screening showed that the extract exhibited in vitro virucidal activity against Herpes simplex. The extract possessed in vitro schistomicidal and fasciolicidal activity.
