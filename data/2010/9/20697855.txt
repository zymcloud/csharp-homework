As a novel human cytokine found recently, IL-24 could selectively kill tumor cells by multiple ways. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the major antigen-presenting cells. Recent studies have revealed that IL-24 can promote the antigen-presenting function of DCs. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor effect and mechanism of co-cultured cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells and autologous DCs modified with IL-24 gene on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. DCs and CIK cells were prepared routinely from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recombinant adenovirus AdVGFP/IL-24 (Ad-IL24) was constructed expressing IL-24. IL-24 gene was transduced into DCs via Ad-IL24, the cells obtained were named DC-IL-24. We demonstrated that the expression rates of CD80, CD83, CD1a, HLA-DR, CD40, CXCR4 on DC-IL-24 were significantly increased compared with those of the control group. DC-IL-24 produced markedly higher levels of IL-24, IL-12 and TNF-alpha as compared with those of DCs. On comparison with non-transfected DCs co-cultured with CIK cells, transfected DCs co-cultured with CIK cells had a significant higher lytic activity against SMMC7721 cells, a HCC cell line.
