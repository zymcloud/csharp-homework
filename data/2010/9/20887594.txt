Aim:With the recent advances in medical or surgical treatments in chronic hepatic disorders, the indications for splenectomy in hepatic disorders have greatly expanded. We performed splenectomy for cirrhotic patients and investigated the effects of splenectomy on hepatic functional reserve and nutrition metabolism.Methods:Eighteen patients (Child-Pugh B/C: 12/6; Child-Pugh A: excluded) who underwent splenectomy at our institute between 2005 and 2008 were enrolled. Twelve patients (67%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), eight of whom met the Milan criteria.Results:Overall survival rate was 83.3% at 1 year and 62.7% at 2 years. The survival rate of six patients with liver cirrhosis classified a Child-Pugh C was 80.0% at 1 year and 60.0% at 2 years. Three patients underwent hepatic resection and nine patients received ablation therapy against hepatocelluar carcinoma. Portal pressure decreased after splenectomy in most patients (mean decrease, 4.7 mmHg). Four weeks after the operation, the markers of hepatic functional reserve, indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) and Technetium-99m-galactosyl human serum albumin value ((99m)Tc-GSA), improved from 38.5% to 35.1% and from 0.773 to 0.788 (LHL15), respectively. The non-protein respiratory quotient (npRQ) did not change in short period after the operation. Other outcomes, including liver function test in cirrhotic patients with long-term (1 year) follow-up after splenectomy (n = 7), did not improve significantly. Post-operative complications included portal thrombus (n = 2), ascites (n = 2) were observed in six patients (33%).Conclusion:Splenectomy improved hepatic functional reserve and nutritional metabolism in some cases. However, the long-term outcomes should still be evaluated.
