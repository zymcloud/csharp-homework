Background:Compared to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), stage B in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification, the role of hepatic resection remains unclear. The present study compared the long-term outcome of hepatic resection with TACE in the treatment of BCLC stage B HCC.Methods:A total of 171 patients with BCLC stage B, Child's classification A (Child A), HCC were included in this retrospective study. Of these, 93 patients underwent hepatic resection (group I) and 73 patients received TACE (group II). We evaluated the long-term outcome and therapy-related mortality in both groups. The risk factors of mortality were assessed. The survival curve was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates for the two groups after hepatic resection and TACE were 83%, 62%, 49% and 39%, 5%, 2%, respectively (P Conclusions:Our study demonstrated that hepatic resection for BCLC stage B, Child A HCC patients had better survival rates than TACE group. Thus, hepatic resection is indicated in selected patients with BCLC stage B.
