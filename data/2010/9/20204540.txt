Background:Hypoglycemia is extremely uncommon as the first presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma, and it occurs predominantly as a paraneoplastic manifestation.Methods:We report a case of a 38-year-old-man positive for hepatitis B surface antigen with high-serum viremia who presented with symptoms of acute severe hypoglycemia.Results:Laboratory tests confirmed hypoglycemia (serum glucose 1.54 mmol/L) with undetectable serum-C peptide (Conclusions:These findings indicate that hepatocellular carcinoma-associated hypoglycemia may be due exclusively to increased glucose utilization by the tumor mass.
