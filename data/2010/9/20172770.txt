Objectives:At presentation, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs) frequently show prognostically negative hepatic involvement. The aim of this study was to characterise hepatic metastases of GEP NETs as revealed by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS), which allows the fine definition of the microvascular system, and to correlate these findings to the biological behaviour of the tumour.Methods:Eighteen out of 62 GEP NET patients examined between January 2007 and September 2008 had histologically proven hepatic metastases from primary ileal (#6), gastric (#1) or rectal (#1) carcinoids, pancreatic tumours (#7), or primary duodenal (#2) or occult gastrinomas (#1), and all underwent low mechanical index real-time CEUS with SonoVue injection.Results:Strong early enhancement in the arterial phase was observed in 15 cases (83%), and a rapid wash-out in the portal venous phase in 14 (78%). In the late venous phase, the lesions were hypoechoic in 12 cases (67%), isoechoic in five (28%), and hyperechoic in one (0.05%). The time of arterial enhancement correlated with the Ki-67 proliferative index (r(s)=0.516; p=0.028).Conclusions:Most of the neuroendocrine liver metastases showed increased arterial enhancement at CEUS, a behaviour that is similar to that of hepatocellular carcinomas and the opposite of that of other metastases. CEUS can be a useful diagnostic means of characterising such metastases.
