Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common neoplasm worldwide, with more than half of the tumors associated with regional metastasis. Extrahepatic metastasis is also common, and the most frequently affected sites are the lungs, abdominal lymph nodes, diaphragm, and bone. However, HCC metastasis to the mandible is rare, with approximately 50 cases reported in the literature.Methods:In this report, we describe a case of HCC metastasis to the mandible at the apex of #18 root in a 62-year-old man. This patient had already been diagnosed with metastasis to pancreatic caput lymph node. The radiographic features of the mandible resembled radicular cyst and did not show typical findings of malignancy.Results:Under the first diagnosis of radicular cyst, root canal treatment was initially performed, and then surgical treatment of the removal of the cystic lesion and #18 extraction were performed. Finally, the lesion was diagnosed as HCC metastasis from pathological examination. Consequently, he received constitutional chemotherapy in the hepatitis unit and is now in remission.Conclusion:This case shows the importance of considering the differential diagnosis of malignancy.
