Objective:To discuss the proper surgical management of pancreatic benign and low-grade malignant potential neoplasm.Methods:The experience of 72 cases who accepted organ preserving pancreatectomy from January 1990 to May 2010 was analyzed retrospectively. There were 24 male and 48 female, aged from 15 to 68 years with mean age of 46 years. There were 9 cases underwent duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas, 29 cases underwent spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, 11 cases underwent middle segmental pancreatectomy, 23 cases underwent tumor extirpation of huge pancreatic cancer in pancreatic head and body.Results:Pancreatic fistula and biliary fistula in 1 case respectively were cured among who accepted duodenum-preserving resection of the head of the pancreas. Pancreatic fistula was found in 3 cases who accepted spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Pancreaticobiliary anastomotic bleeding in 1 case was cured among who accepted middle segmental pancreatectomy. Pancreatic fistula was found in 5 cases among who accepted tumor extirpation of huge pancreatic cancer in pancreatic head and body, and liver metastasis was found in 3 cases at 6, 12, 16 months after surgery respectively.Conclusions:Organ preserving pancreatectomy can obviously reduce operative injury to patients, its therapeutic effect is similar to that of classical operation, it is the first option of benign and low-grade malignant potential neoplasm.
