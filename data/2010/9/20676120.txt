Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most lethal of human malignancies. During human multistep hepatocarcinogenesis, genomic gain represents an important mechanism in the activation of proto-oncogenes. In many circumstances, activated oncogenes hold clinical implications both as prognostic markers and targets for cancer therapeutics. Gain of chromosome 1q copy is one of the most frequently detected alterations in HCC and 1q21 is the most frequent minimal amplifying region (MAR). A better understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological roles of target genes within 1q21 amplicon will significantly improve our knowledge in HCC pathogenesis, and may lead to a much more effective management of HCC bearing amplification of 1q21. Such knowledge has long term implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment. Our research group and others, focused on the identification and characterization of 1q21 target genes such as JTB, CKS1B, and CHD1L in HCC progression. In this review, we will summarize the current scientific knowledge of known target genes within 1q21 amplicon and the precise oncogenic mechanisms of CHD1L will be discussed in detail.
