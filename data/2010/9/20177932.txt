Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate the role that laparoscopy plays in the management of gallbladder cancer.Method:From August 2005 to March 2009, 23 patients affected by gallbladder cancer detected after the study of a cholecystectomy specimen underwent laparoscopy as part of their management.Results:Among the patients, 5 underwent only an exploratory laparoscopy, while 11 were converted due to the existence of dense adhesions that precluded a complete exploration. Of the patients with adhesions who underwent conversion, three were unresectable. The remainder underwent a lymphadenectomy and liver resection after conversion. Of the seven who underwent a complete laparoscopic exploration, five had a lymphadenectomy and liver resection done completely by laparoscopy while conversion was needed for two. Conversion was required due to lymphatic metastasis at the hepatic pedicle and the presence of a bile leak. Postoperative time was uneventful, with patients discharged within 3 days of the operation.Conclusions:Laparoscopy may be employed in the management of patients with early forms of gallbladder cancer undergoing reoperation. Although the presence of adhesions may result in inadequate exploration, there is a subset of patients for whom it is possible to perform a complete exam. Furthermore, laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and gallbladder bed resection is a promising technique in well-selected patients.
