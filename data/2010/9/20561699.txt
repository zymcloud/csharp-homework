Background & aims:Studies investigating the associations between glutathione S-transferase (GST) genetic polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk have reported controversial results. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to clarify the effects of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms on HCC risk.Methods:We identified 132 relevant records through a literature search up to November 22, 2009, and 24 individual case-control studies from 23 publications were finally included, involving a total of 3349 HCC cases and 5609 controls. Subgroup analyses were performed by ethnicity, or by area according to the incidence rate and hepatitis virus status.Results:Analyses of total relevant studies showed an increased HCC risk was significantly associated with null genotypes of GSTM1 (OR=1.26, 95% CI 1.03-1.54, p(OR)=0.027) and GSTT1 (OR=1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51, p(OR)=0.002). In addition, the GSTM1-GSTT1 interaction analysis showed that the dual null genotype of GSTM1/GSTT1 was significantly associated with increased HCC risk (OR=1.89, 95% CI 1.38-2.60, p(OR)Conclusions:This meta-analysis suggests null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 are both associated with increased HCC risk in Asians, and individuals with the dual null genotype of GSTM1/GSTT1 are particularly susceptible to developing HCC.
