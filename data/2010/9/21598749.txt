Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, HCC is the main cause of death in patients with cirrhosis, and the incidence of this malignancy is on the rise. Because HCC is associated with a particularly poor prognosis, emphasis is placed on surveillance of high-risk patients. Early detection allows a greater chance of diagnosing HCC before it has spread, thus increasing the chances that the patient can be potentially cured with surgical techniques such as resection and transplantation. However, most cases of HCC are not diagnosed until at least some of the cancer has spread or multiple nodules exist. For these patients, treatment options include percutaneous and transarterial ablation, as well as systemic chemotherapy. Systemic therapy is now considered the standard of care for patients with advanced tumors. Traditional treatment was based on cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin. This approach was associated with minimal benefit and a high rate of toxicity. Recently, targeted agents have proven more effective and safer in this setting. The oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is now approved for the treatment of unresectable HCC and is currently the only approved agent for advanced HCC. In order to maximize the benefit of sorafenib and other investigational agents for patients with advanced disease, effective interventions have been designed to mitigate their associated adverse events, such as hand-foot skin reactions and hypertension.
