Entirely new classifications are those for gastrointestinal stromal tumours, gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and perihilar extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas. Major and praxis-relevant alterations concern colorectal tumours and include new classifications of carcinomas and carcinoids of the appendix. Minor alterations are seen in the classification of hepatocellular carcinomas. No changes were made for tumours of the anal canal, the gallbladder (excluding the inclusion of tumours of the cystic duct) and tumours of the pancreas and the ampulla of Vater.
