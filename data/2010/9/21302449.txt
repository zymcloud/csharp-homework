Objective:To investigate the clinical significance of tumor microvascular density (MVD) detected by anti-CD105 and anti-CD34 as a predictor of recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT).Methods:One hundred and twelve (100 with adjacent nontumorous area) patients with HCC who underwent LT between Jan. 2001 and Dec. 2006 were included in this retrospective study. Paraffin blocks of tumor tissue and adjacent nontumorous tissue were used for immunohistochemical study. MVD of HCC was evaluated by anti-CD105 monoclonal antibody and anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody.Results:The immunohistochemich staining showed CD34 strongly positive expressed in the tumor area with tumor mature vasculature, and CD105 strongly positive expressed in adjacent nontumorous area with tumor newly formed vessels. Univariate analysis using chi-square test showed portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), pTNM stage, MVD-CD105 expression in adjacent nontumorous area, tumor size and serum AFP level were significantly associated with HCC recurrence after LT (P Conclusion:The anti-CD105 mAb is an ideal tool to quantify new microvessels in HCC. MVD-CD105 expression in adjacent nontumorous area may be used as an additional factor for the identification of patients at risk for post-transplant recurrence.
