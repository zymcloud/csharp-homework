Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary tumor of the liver. Patients frequently have multiple histologically similar, but anatomically separate tumors. The clonal origin of multiple hepatocellular carcinomas is uncertain.Methods:The authors analyzed 31 tumors from 12 different patients (11 women, 1 man), who had multiple hepatocellular carcinomas involving 1 or both lobes. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using laser capture microdissection. DNA was analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH), X chromosome inactivation status, and TP53 gene mutations.Results:Ten (83%) of the 12 patients showed LOH in at least 1 of the analyzed microsatellite markers. Concordant LOH patterns between separate hepatocellular carcinomas in individual patients were seen in 8 (80%) of 10 cases, whereas discordant patterns were seen in 2 (20%) of 10 cases. Five (50%) of 10 informative female patients showed identical nonrandom X chromosome inactivation patterns in multiple tumors; 1 case showed discordant nonrandom X chromosome inactivation pattern. TP53 mutations were identified in 8 (67%) of 12 patients. Tumors in 7 (88%) of these 8 patients showed different point mutations. Three patients (Cases 4, 5, and 10) had tumors with additional TP53 point mutations, indicating additional genetic abnormalities in these tumors.Conclusions:The data suggested that the significant proportion of patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinomas have tumors of common clonal origin.
