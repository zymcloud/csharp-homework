Hepatitis B virus causes chronic necroinflammatory liver disease, which is known as hepatitis B. This inflammatory condition may further aggravate liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently available conventional hepatitis B vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen, which develops a humoral immune response and hence protects against the infection. However, it fails in developing the desired cellular immune response, which is one of the most important bioresponses contributing to virus elimination from infected hepatocytes. At the same time, moderate humoral response developed following conventional vaccination do not protect the mucosal surfaces through serosal response. The mucosa is a predominant entry site for most of the infectious pathogens. Several strategies, including the use of adjuvants, development of surface functionalized novel antigen carriers and mucosal immunization for example, have been explored to investigate their role in addressing the limitations associated with the current hepatitis B vaccine. This review focuses on recent advances that have been made in order to develop an effective vaccine against hepatitis B.
