Background:Liver transplantation (LTX) is indicated in selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis.Methods:We compared the outcome of LTX for patients with and without HCC in 5-year time periods between 1987 and 2007 to reflect the implementation of the Milan tumor selection criteria in 1997 and of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score-based liver allocation in 2002.Results:Of 2350 patients who underwent primary LTX, 330 had HCC. Five-year patient survival for HCC patients was 28.6% in 1987-1992 and 42.3% in 1992-1997, which was 41.4-31.4% lower than that in non-HCC patients (P 6 cm [hazard ratio (HR) 3.67], >or=5 nodules (HR 3.441), vascular invasion (HR 3.18), transplant in 1987-1992 (HR 6.772), and transplant in 1992-1997 (HR 3.059). MELD-based liver allocation reduced median waiting time for LTX for HCC versus non-HCC (35 vs. 111 days; P = 0.005) without compromise in patient outcome.Conclusions:The results of LTX for HCC continue to improve and are equal to results in patients without HCC.
