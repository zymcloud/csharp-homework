BACKGROUND.: The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of contrast-enhanced sonography (CEUS) with Sonazoid to demonstrate local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and not seen on conventional sonography, prior to repeat RFA. METHODS.: This study included 16 cirrhotic patients with 17 cases of hypervascular locally recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma found by contrast-enhanced multidetector row CT (MDCT) but not seen on noncontrast sonography. We used Kupffer-phase imaging and vascular-phase imaging after re-injection. The morphologic patterns of local recurrence detected on CEUS were compared with those on MDCT. We performed repeat RFA guided by CEUS using Kupffer-phase imaging after re-injection. RESULTS.: We were able to detect on CEUS the location of all local recurrences with positive enhancement after re-injection. The morphologic patterns of local recurrence on CEUS were in concordance with those found on MDCT in all lesions. Repeat percutaneous RFA was successfully performed in all lesions. CONCLUSIONS.: The CEUS appearance of local recurrences correlated well with those on MDCT. A wider use of CEUS to guide repeat of percutaneous RFA may be possible with Sonazoid.
