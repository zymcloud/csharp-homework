Introduction:Breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM) are considered as a systemic disease which is mainly treated with chemotherapy, while the role of surgical resection still remains to be well defined. The aim of the study is to analyse the survival and prognostic factors predictive of mortality in patients with BCLM treated by liver resection.Material and methods:A total of 21 patients were operated on between 1998-2008, with liver resection being performed on 12. We retrospectively collected several variables.Results:The mean age was 48 years. The most frequent stage was I, with curative surgery in all cases, and the majority (66.7%) received adjuvant treatment. The BCLM were mainly meta metachronic (83.3%). The majority (66.7%) received neoadjuvant treatment. The liver resection was R0 in all cases with no morbidity and a mortality in the long term of 8.3%. Two-thirds received chemotherapy. The estimated survival at one year was 67% and 23% at 5 years. A disease free period of less than 24 months between the primary tumour and the appearance of metastasis was associated with a worse survival.Conclusions:Resection of BCLM within a multimodal treatment is safe in selected patients.
