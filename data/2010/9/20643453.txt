Purpose:We identified factors predicting liver histology in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor undergoing concurrent post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and liver resection.Materials and methods:We reviewed the Indiana University testis cancer database to identify all patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumor and liver metastasis who underwent post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and liver resection between 1976 and 2006.Results:A total of 59 patients met study inclusion criteria. Necrosis, teratoma and cancer were identified in 31%, 46% and 24% of retroperitoneal specimens, and in 73%, 17% and 10% of liver specimens, respectively. Concordance between retroperitoneal and liver histology was 49% overall, including 94% for necrosis, 26% for teratoma and 36% for cancer. Liver necrosis alone was found in 94%, 70% and 50% of patients with retroperitoneal necrosis, teratoma and cancer, respectively.Conclusions:The overall rate of histological discordance between retroperitoneal and liver histology was 51% with 73% of all liver specimens containing necrosis only. Retroperitoneal necrosis is highly predictive of hepatic necrosis (94%). Management for liver lesions at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection must be individualized. Observation may be warranted for liver lesions requiring complicated hepatic surgery regardless of retroperitoneal pathology.
