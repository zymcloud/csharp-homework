Aim of the study:The purpose of this study is to isolate the pure compounds from the extracts of Cordyceps militaris obtained through solid-state cultivation process, and evaluate their anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties.Materials and methods:Silica gel column chromatographic purification of Cordyceps militaris extracts resulted in the isolation of 10 pure compounds (1-10). The compounds 1-10 were examined for their growth inhibitory properties against nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-12 enhanced production from LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated macrophages. Additionally, the anti-proliferation effects of 1-10 on human cancer cell lines, colon (colon 205), prostate (PC-3), and hepatoma (HepG2) cells were also analyzed.Results:Compound 8 displayed potent growth inhibition on NO, TNF-alpha and IL-12 production with an IC(50) value of 7.5, 6.3, and 7.6 microg/ml, respectively. A similar inhibitory trend on these inflammatory mediators was observed for 3, 7, 9 and 10 with an IC(50) values ranging from 10.8 to 17.2 microg/ml. On the other hand, compounds 3 and 8 were potent anti-proliferative agents with an IC(50) value of 35.6 and 32.6 microg/ml toward PC-3 and colon 205 cell lines, respectively. The compounds 1 and 2 showed potent anti-proliferation in PC-3 and colon 205 cells, while only 3 displayed such effect in HepG2 cells.Conclusion:The present study provides scientific supporting information for the ethnopharmacological use of Cordyceps militaris as an anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent.
