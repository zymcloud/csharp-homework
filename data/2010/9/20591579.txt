The tumor necrosis factor receptor super-family member 6b (TNFRSF6B) is over-expressed in various human cancers, but its function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncertain. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between TNFRSF6B expression and apoptosis in HCC and the effect of anti-TNFRSF6B neutralization monoclonal antibody (McAb) on HCC cells. TNFRSF6B mRNA and protein expression were compared with apoptosis in 78 cases of HCC. Proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration ability of liver cancer cells co-cultured with anti-TNFRSF6B McAb were also detected. TNFRSF6B mRNA and protein expression in the tumor tissues negatively correlated with apoptosis. Cell proliferation was decreased, cell cycle was arrested in G1/S-phase, apoptosis was increased, and migration ability was inhibited by anti-TNFRSF6B McAb in vitro. Anti-TNFRSF6B McAb could be useful to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in HCC. Thus, TNFRSF6B might be a critical, targeted therapy strategy for HCC.
