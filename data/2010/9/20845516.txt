Aim:To determine the role of diabetes mellitus (DM) and other associated factors in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with cirrhosis, compared with those HCC patients without cirrhosis, in the single setting of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, after other known concomitant diseases were excluded.Methods:A total of 482 patients, treated at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health (Beijing, China), in the period January 2003 to June 2009, and with a hospital discharge diagnosis of HCC, were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, metabolic and instrumental features were analyzed.Results:Of the total, 310 patients were diagnosed with HBV infection and, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 224 were analyzed, including 122 patients (54.5%) with cirrhosis (the case group) and 102 patients without cirrhosis (the control group). Twenty-seven patients (12.1%) were diabetic, including 19 in the case group and 8 in the control group (19/122 = 15.6% vs 8/102 = 7.8%, P = 0.077). Thirty-one possible relevant parameters were compared by univariate analysis, and 9 variables were selected for multivariable analysis, including DM (P = 0.077), past history of HBV infection (P = 0.005), total bilirubin (P Conclusion:Besides the three cirrhosis-related parameters, DM was found to be the sole independent factor associated with HCC in patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, compared with those without cirrhosis.
