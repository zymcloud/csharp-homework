Background and objective:Heparanase-1 (HPA-1) can promote angiogenesis and metastasis of malignant tumors and plays an important role in the genesis and development of tumors. This study was to explore the effects of specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HPA-1 combined with heparin on invasiveness of mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Methods:The expression of HPA-1 in Hca-F, Hca-P, and Hepa1-6 cells, which have high, low, and no metastatic potential, respectively, was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After transfection with two specific siRNAs targeting HPA-1, siRNA-1 and siRNA-2, and treatment with heparin, invasiveness of Hca-F cells was observed by Matrigel invasion assay.Results:HPA-1 was negative in Hepa1-6 cells while positive in both Hca-F and Hca-P cells. The expression levels of both HPA-1 mRNA and protein were obviously higher in Hca-F cells than in Hca-P cells. HPA-1 proteins could be secreted into culture supernatant of Hca-F and Hca-P cells, and the amount of secreted HPA-1 detected by Western blot analysis was larger in Hca-F cells than in Hca-P cells (1.34 ± 0.02 vs. 0.60 ± 0.01, P Conclusion:The combined application of specific siRNA targeting HPA-1 and heparin is more effective in inhibiting the invasiveness of mouse hepatoma cells.
