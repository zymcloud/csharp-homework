To suppress the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells into surrounding connective tissues during metastasis, we investigated the usefulness of sorafenib. In order to search for model cell lines, cell numbers were counted to reveal cell lines with the potential to proliferate in serum-free media. Cell proliferation and cell motility were analyzed with the MTS and wound assay, respectively. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and mitotic and apoptotic indices were analyzed to assess the cell cycle and apoptosis. The expression levels of cyclin D1 and the cleavage of caspase-3 were analyzed by Western blotting. HLF cells exhibited growth in the serum-free medium, while the other cell lines examined did not. Sorafenib suppressed the cell proliferation and motility of the HLF cells in the serum-free media. Both indices of BrdU and mitotic potential decreased and the apoptotic index was increased in the serum-free media with sorafenib, suggesting that the cell cycle was suppressed and apoptosis was induced. The expression levels of cyclin D1 decreased and the cleavage of caspase-3 was noted in the serum-free media with sorafenib. Sorafenib may be suitable for molecular therapy to suppress the metastasis of HCC.
