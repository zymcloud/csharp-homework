Background:Resection of liver metastases is accepted as treatment for diverse tumours, implying a survival improvement. Metastases often recur after first hepatectomy and, very few would be potentially resectable.Materials and methods:A retrospective study of 18 patients undergoing repeated hepatectomies (two or more liver resections in the same patient) due to metastases of colorectal cancer between 1988 and 2006 was performed.Results:Thirteen men and five women, mean age 57.55 years, participated. In all patients, repeated liver resection was performed due to recurrence of the metastases. Complications rate after first hepatectomy was 11.1% and after the second 16.6%. Mortality rate was 11.1% after second hepatectomy, and there was no mortality after third hepatectomy. Three- and 5-year survival after colectomy was 88.9% and 77.8%, respectively; after first hepatectomy 3- and 5-year survival was 88.9% and 61.1%, respectively; after second hepatectomy, 3- and 5-year survival was 83.3% and 61.1% respectively; and 3-year survival after third hepatectomy was 67%.Conclusion:Repeated resections by expert surgeons for recurrent liver metastases can be safely performed, with low morbidity and mortality rates similar to first hepatectomies. Repeated resections of liver metastases of colorectal cancer improve global survival.
