Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequent primary malignant tumor of the liver. Bony metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma are usually rare, in which most common sites involved are vertebra and pelvis. Still rarer are metastases to the chest wall and skull. We report a case of a 45-year old man with unusual metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma to skull, sternum and ribs. These combinations of metastases have rarely been reported in literature.
