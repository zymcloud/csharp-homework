Objective:To investigate the expression of tumor rejective antigen 1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis(LC) tissues, and the relationship between clinicopathological feature and HCC.Methods:The expressions of TRA1 mRNA and its protein were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot respectively. Immunohistochemical staining was used to further examine the expression of TRA1 protein in LC, HCC and control tissues. The relationship between clinicopathological feature and HCC was analyzed. Data of RT-PCR and Western blot were analyzed by One-way ANOVA; results of immunohistochemical staining were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and correlation analysis using Spearman rank correlation.Results:RT-PCR data showed that the expression of TRA1 mRNA was higher in HCC and LC tissues than that in the normal liver tissues (F values were 20.821 and 12.311 respectively, P is less than 0.05). The expression of TRA1 protein in HCC and LC tissues was signifIcantly higher than that in control by Western blot (F values were 21.231 and 20.125 respectively, P Conclusion:The over-expression of TRA1 in hepatocirrhosis and HCC is correlated with the formation and development of HCC. It may be a prognostic marker for the diagnosis of HCC and be associated with the degree of differentiation and HBV infection. It can be used as a marker for prognostic prediction of HCC.
