The patient was a 53-year-old male. He presented with swelling of the left submandibular region. Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen showed small cell carcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy revealed multiple liver, bone and lymph node metastases. He was diagnosed with small cell carcinoma of the submandibular gland with multiple metastases, Stage IV. Systemic chemotherapy consisting of CPT -11 plus CDDP as first-line and amrubicin as second-line therapy was given. Once CT showed a partial response of the tumors, but he passed away after about 10 months. Small cell carcinoma arising in the submandibular gland is extremely rare, and there are few clinical reports.
