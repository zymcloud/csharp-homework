Background and objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignant neoplasms worldwide and is the second leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. Genetic polymorphism has been reported as a factor for increased susceptibility of HCC. Glutathione-S-transferases theta (GSTT1) and micro (GSTM1) play essential roles in detoxification of ingested xenobiotics and modulation of the susceptibility of gene-related cancer. The aim of this study was to estimate the relationships between these two gene polymorphisms and HCC risk and clinicopathological status in Taiwanese.Methods:Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine gene polymorphisms of 102 patients with HCC and 386 healthy controls.Results:Both gene polymorphisms were not associated with the clinical pathological status of HCC and serum levels of liver-related clinical pathological markers. While no relationship between GSTM1 gene polymorphism and HCC susceptibility was found, individuals of age Conclusions:GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotypes do not associate with increased risk of HCC.
