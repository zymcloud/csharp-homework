Peliosis hepatis is a rare vascular condition of the liver characterized by the presence of cystic blood-fi lled cavities distributed randomly throughout the liver parenchyma. We report a 46 year old female, with dyspepsia. An abdominal Doppler ultrasound showed a hyper vascularized solid liver nodule of 5 cm diameter. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT scan showed the same hyper vascularized nodule. With the possible diagnoses of primary hepatocellular carcinoma or focal nodular hyperplasia, the patient was subjected to an excision of hepatic segment VI, where the nodule was located. The pathological diagnosis of the surgical piece was a peliosis hepatis.
