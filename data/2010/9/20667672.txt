The glycyrrhetinic acid-modified stealth cationic liposomes (GA-PEG-CLs) loaded with pDNA (GA-PEG-CLPs) were developed and found to transfect human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 with high efficiency. GA-PEG-CLs were comprised of DOTAP, cholesterol (Chol) and glycyrrhetinic acid-polyethyleneglycol-cholesterol conjugate (GA-PEG-Chol). Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that 5% GA-PEG-CLs constituted by DOTAP/Chol/GA-PEG-Chol at molar ratio of 50:45:5 could completely entrap pDNA at a lower liposomes/pDNA weight ratios of 4:1 (N/P ratio: 1.14). Compared to ordinary cationic liposomes (CLs), steric cationic liposomes (PEG-CLs) and 1% GA-PEG-CLs made from DOTAP/Chol/MPEG2000-Chol/GA-PEG-Chol at molar ratio of 50:45:4:1, 5% GA-PEG-CLs were found to possess the highest transfection efficiency as gene vectors in serum-free or serum-containing medium in PKCalpha over-expressed HepG2 cells but no significance difference in human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293. Additionally, 5% GA-PEG-CLs have the lowest cytotoxicity on human normal hepatocyte cell line L02. The competitive inhibition experiments mediated by GA were carried out in HepG2 cells, which demonstrated that GA-PEG-CLs could deliver selectively pDNA to hepatoma cells by the targeting moiety GA. In conclusion, GA-PEG-CLs containing 5% GA-PEG-Chol might be one of the most potential gene vectors as hepatoma targeting therapy.
