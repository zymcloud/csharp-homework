Background:Renal dysfunction is often present in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Acute renal failure (ARF) may occur after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) owing to radiocontrast agent. This study investigated the incidence and risk factors of ARF and prognostic predictors in HCC patients with preexisting renal insufficiency undergoing TACE.Methods:A total of 566 HCC patients undergoing TACE were enrolled. Renal insufficiency was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m.Results:In a mean follow-up duration of 18+/-16 months, 231 (40.8%) patients undergoing TACE died. Renal insufficiency that was present in 134 (23.7%) patients at baseline, independently predicted a poor prognosis in the Cox proportional hazards model [risk ratio (RR): 1.47, P=0.012]. Of them, 13 (10%) and 6 (5%) patients had transient and prolonged ARF after TACE, respectively. Post-TACE gastrointestinal bleeding [odds ratio (OR): 16.54, P=0.001] and higher Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) scores (> or =2; OR: 4.22, P=0.02) were independent risk factors for ARF in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the Cox model, prolonged ARF (RR: 3.28, P or =2; RR: 2.13, PConclusions:Gastrointestinal bleeding and higher CLIP scores are associated with the development of ARF in patients with HCC and renal insufficiency undergoing TACE. Higher CLIP scores and renal insufficiency, either preexisting before TACE or as a complication of TACE, are poor prognostic predictors in HCC patients receiving TACE.
