The present study aimed to retrospectively compare the survival rates between patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and hepatic resection for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). According to our database, derived from three affiliated hospitals, the inclusion criteria for this study were: solitary HCC [Child-Pugh class A and International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage T1-3N0M0] treated between July 1990 and October 2001. Subsequently, hepatic resection (149 patients) as well as chemoembolization (102 patients) groups were selected. Following stratification according to tumor stage [UICC, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) and Milan criteria], survival rates were compared between the treatment groups. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Age, gender and size of the HCC did not differ significantly between the groups. Moreover, no significant difference in the survival rates (average hepatic resection, 58.9 months; average chemoembolization, 45 months; P=0.1697) was observed between the groups. In the subgroup analysis, according to tumor stage, the survival rate was significantly higher for the hepatic resection group than for the chemoembolization group in the UICC T3N0M0 (P=0.017) subgroup. However, no significant differences in survival rates were observed between the hepatic resection and chemoembolization groups for UICC T1 (P=0.7329), T2N0M0 (P=0.5741), CLIP0 (P=0.3593), CLIP1-2 (P=0.3287) and within (>5 cm; P=0.4429) and beyond Milan criteria (â‰¤5 cm; P=0.4003) subgroups. Chemoembolization is as effective as hepatic resection in treating solitary HCC in subpopulations with UICC T1-2N0M0 or CLIP 0-2 HCC or Milan criteria and adequate liver function. In the subgroup with UICC T3N0M0 HCC, hepatic resection is superior to chemoembolization.
