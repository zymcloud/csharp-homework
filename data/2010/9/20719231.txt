Background:Worldwide, prophylactic vaccines against two major human cancers are now commercially available: hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines (first licensed in 1982) against primary hepatocellular carcinoma and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines (first licensed 2006) against cervical cancer. Initial implementation strategies for HBV vaccination were not successful in preventing disease in the community: it took 15 years for significant global reduction in the burden of this disease.Methods:We compare and contrast HBV vaccine experiences to challenges for successful global HPV vaccination strategies, and make recommendations accordingly.Results:Lessons from HBV immunisation for successful outcomes with HPV immunisation showed that several factors need to be met: (i) the engagement of key stakeholders in all aspects of planning and delivery of HPV vaccine strategies; (ii) understanding the specific characteristics of targeted population groups; (iii) global cooperation and support with WHO recommendations; (iv) Government supported mass immunization programs and cooperation between public and private entities; (v) affordable HPV vaccines for some regions; (vi) culturally appropriate and diverse public education programs in targeted health promotion strategies; (vii) pro-active health providers and parents in encouraging adolescents to undertake HPV vaccination; and (vii) eventual immunisation of infants.Conclusions:The key to success will be affordable, readily deliverable HPV vaccines to young girls as universal campaigns.
