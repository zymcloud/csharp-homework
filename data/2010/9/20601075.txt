Background:Aflatoxin M₁ (AFM₁) is the main monohydroxylated derivative of aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) formed in liver and excreted into milk. Although AFM₁ is less toxic than AFB₁, it has been classified as a possible human carcinogen, Group 2B agent by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).Objectives:The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the occurrence of AFM₁ in the main dairy products consumed in Catalonia region (Spain), and (ii) to assess the exposure of Catalonian population to aflatoxin M₁ through deterministic and probabilistic method.Methods:Occurrence of Aflatoxin M₁ (AFM₁) was determined in 72 composites of milk, 72 composites of cheese and 72 composites of yoghurt from Catalonia. AFM₁ content was analysed using an Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay commercial kit. Three approaches to exposure assessment were conducted: one deterministic method and two probabilistic models with Monte Carlo simulations.Results:AFM₁ was detected in 94.4% (68/72) of whole UHT milk samples, in 2.8% (2/72) of yoghurt samples and not detected in cheese. The maximum level was detected in one yoghurt sample with 51.58 ng/kg, only this sample being over the legal EU limit of 50 ng/kg. Milk, cheese and yoghurt mean concentrations were 9.29±2.61, <12.5 and 13.22±4.82 ng/kg, respectively.Conclusions:According to these values, it should be expected Catalonian population is not exposed to a significant risk from aflatoxin M₁ including average and high consumers.
