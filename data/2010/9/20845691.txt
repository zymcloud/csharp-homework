Recently, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is very popular for completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer patients, but cisplatin-based regimens are not safety and tolerable for outpatients. In this study, gemcitabine plus carboplatin regimen is selected as more safety and feasible for outpatient chemotherapy, and scheduled bi-weekly administration to reduce hematological toxity, especially thrombocytopenia. Twenty patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer (pStage IA - IIIB) administered gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 and carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 3 bi-weekly for 8 times at outpatient chemotherapy center except that 1st treatment was done with short stay in hospital. Of 20 patients, 13 (65%) completed the 8 times bi-weekly treatment and 7 patients incompleted because of neutropenia in 2, anemia in 1, liver dysfunction in 3, interstitial pneumonia suspected in 1. Relative dose intensity was 79%. Seven patients had grade 3/4 neutropenia, 2 had grade 3 thrombocytopenia, 2 had grade 3 anemia, and 2 had grade 3 liver dysfunction. Hematological toxity, especially thorombocytopenia are less than standard administration of gemcitabine and carboplatin regimen, so we conclude that this regimen is feasible in outpatient adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer.
