Objective:To investigate the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its clinicopathological significance.Methods:Four high polymorphic microsatellite markers flanking Mfn2 were selected for LOH analysis in 29 cases of HCC.Result:The frequencies of LOH on D1S2667, D1S2740, D1S434 and D1S228 were 21%, 23%, 21% and 22%, respectively. LOH at Mfn2 was closely correlated with tumor size, age, capsule, differentiation and t HBV infection (P0.05).Conclusion:LOH at Mfn2 gene in HCC is associated with the clinicopathological features of patients.
