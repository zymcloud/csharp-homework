Introduction:Patients with peritoneal metastases (PM) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often experience a rapid demise even after a complete removal of intrahepatic tumour. Localised PM may now be adequately controlled and managed with cytoreductive surgery (CRS).Treatment:Three patients underwent CRS for HCC PM.Outcome:The first patient survived 21 months from the time of CRS and is alive with the disease. The second patient died 4 months after CRS. The third patient survived 10 months since CRS and is also alive with the disease. Collectively, the survival of 24 patients with HCC PM extracted through a collective literature review who were treated with cytoreductive surgery had 1- and 2-year survival percentages of 83% and 71%, respectively.Conclusion:Careful selection of patients with localised disease to the peritoneal cavity for CRS, taking into consideration the performance status, liver function and tumour biology may lead to a successful outcome in patients with HCC PM.
