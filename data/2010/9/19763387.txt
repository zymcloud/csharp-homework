Despite the wide spectrum of selection criteria used by living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) centers in Japan, LDLT for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can achieve an acceptable outcome comparable to the outcome for deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) for HCC. One of the most crucial considerations in liver transplantation for HCC is the advent of expanded criteria that allow more patients with HCC to receive the organs and offer similar or even better results compared to the Milan of UCSF criteria. Expanded criteria for HCC are proposed from three single-center and one multicenter study in Japan. These criteria are based on the independent predictors for outcome derived from the analyses of the pretransplant factors and explant pathology. The beneficial effect of those proposed criteria can be predicted by the inclusion rates of the patients compared to the Milan or UCSF criteria in the same cohort and the outcome for those included patients. While application of the UCSF criteria increases the inclusion rate compared to the Milan criteria by 5-10%, these proposed criteria increase the inclusion rates by 5-54% compared to the Milan criteria. The higher inclusion rates compared to the application of the Milan criteria are achieved by criteria including tumor markers, either AFP or PIVKA II or both. Inclusion of tumor markers in addition to parameters of tumor morphology might be the key to establish the best criteria for liver transplantation for HCC.
