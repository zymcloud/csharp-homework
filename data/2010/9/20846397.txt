Background:Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is involved in the hepatocarcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the HDGF expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its correlation with clinicopathologic features, including the survival of patients with HCC. Furthermore, we examined the biological processes regulated by HDGF during the development of using HepG2 cell line as a model system.Methods:We used immunohistochemistry to compare HDGF protein expression in HCC and normal liver tissues and further analyze the HDGF protein expression in clinicopathologically characterized 137 HCC cases. We stably knocked down the endogenous expression level of HDGF in HepG2 cells with specific shRNA-expressing lentiviral vector. Following the successful establishment of stable cells, we examined in vitro cell growth by MTT assay, anchorage-independent growth by soft-agar colony formation assay and cell migration/invasion by transwell and boyden chamber assay. And in addition, we also investigated the in vivo tumor growth by xenograft transplantation of HepG2 cells into nude mice.Results:Protein expression level of HDGF was markedly higher in HCC tissues than that in the normal liver tissues(P = 0.011). In addition, high expression of HDGF protein was positively correlated with T classification(p Conclusion:High HDGF expression is associated with poor overall survival in patients with HCC. Down-regulation of HDGF inhibits the growth, anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells.
