The aim of this study was to elucidate the importance of three tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Lens culinaris agglutinin A-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP-L3), and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), for detecting and predicting the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). A total of 108 patients with initial non-advanced HCC who underwent curative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in our hospital were enrolled in this study. The effectiveness of the three tumor markers for detecting recurrence and recurrence-free survival was analyzed. Positivity of these three makers was not markedly increased at the first or second recurrence. In addition, there was no significant correlation between the initial and recurrent levels of each tumor marker. The tumor marker that was positive at the time of initial HCC was not necessarily positive at recurrence. The tumor marker levels at recurrence were not correlated with pre-ablation levels. No significant correlation was found in the tumor marker values between pre-ablation and the time of recurrence. On multivariate analysis, high AFP-L3 levels (>/=10%) were significantly predictive of recurrence-free survival. All three tumor markers should be routinely measured to detect recurrence during follow-up after RFA. Especially high AFP-L3 levels should be followed closely.
