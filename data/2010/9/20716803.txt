Mallory bodies (MBs) and hyaline globules (HGs) are recognized as hepatocellular cytoplasmic inclusions in liver diseases. We reviewed 123 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICCs) and encountered 16 cases (13.0%) in which cancer cells had MB-type inclusions and/or HG-type inclusions, both of which are positive for p62 and ubiquitin. The HG type was present in all 16 cases, and 5 cases contained the MB type. Of 16 patients, 12 had chronic liver disease that was related to alcoholic abuse in 4, hepatitis B surface antigen-positive in 3, and hepatitis C virus antibody-positive in 8. Viral infection and liver cirrhosis were more common in ICCs with p62+ inclusions (P = .0004 and P = .0199, respectively). Of 16 ICCs, 15 with hyaline inclusions had a peripheral tumor location (P = .0052). On ultrastructural examination, the MB type had an electron-dense fibrillar appearance, while the HG type appeared as rounded masses of granular materials. Our results suggest that intracytoplasmic hyaline bodies occasionally can be found in cholangiocarcinoma with chronic liver disease related to viral hepatitis or alcoholic intake.
