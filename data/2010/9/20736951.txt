Background:Enzastaurin (Enz) is a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor blocking protein kinase C (PKC)beta/AKT pathway. However, an ability of this compound to inhibit cancer invasion and metastasis is not yet clearly elucidated.Methods:The ability of Enz to inhibit invasion and metastasis, and to target molecules was investigated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by RT-PCR validated microarray, Matrigel, and in vivo chorionallantoic membrane (CAM) assays.Results:Enzastaurin significantly reduced migration, invasion, and in vivo metastasis to lungs and liver (CAM assay) of diverse NSCLC cell lines. Genes promoting cancer progression (u-PAR, VEGFC, and HIF1alpha) and tumour suppression (VHL, RASSF1, and FHIT) of NSCLC were significantly (P<0.05) down- or upregulated after Enz treatment in H460, A549, and H1299 cells, respectively. Luciferase/chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Enz transcriptionally controls urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR) expression by promoter inhibition through Sp1, Sp3, and c-Jun(AP-1). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of u-PAR re-sensitised Enz-resistant cells and induced apoptosis, suggesting u-PAR as a marker of Enz resistance.Conclusion:This study shows that Enz inhibits migration, invasion, and in vivo metastasis by targeting u-PAR, besides further targeting progression-related and tumour-suppressor genes in NSCLC. Together with u-PAR being a novel putative marker of Enz response, these data encourage molecularly tailored clinical studies on Enz in NSCLC therapy.
