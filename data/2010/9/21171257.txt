Objective:To explore the anti-tumor immunity in vitro induced by prostate cancer cell vaccine transfected with recombinant adenovirus encoding 4-1BBL in mice.Methods:The replication-deficient adenovirus AdEasy-1 system was used to construct recombinant adenovirus Ad-m4-1BBL and Ad-eGFP. The prostate cancer cell RM-1 of mice was transfected with Ad-m4-1BBL and Ad-eGFP, and treated with mitomycin (MMC) to produce TCV, TCV-Ad-eGFP and TCV-Ad-m4-1BBL, followed by co-culture with syngeneic murine spleen cells. Then the cytotoxic activity of the lymphocytes against RM-1 cells was analyzed with CCK-8 solution, and IL-2 and INF-gamma were detected by ELISA.Results:The 4-1BBL protein was highly expressed in the TCV-Ad-m4-1BBL of the 4-1BBL-transfected mice. TCV-Ad-m4-1BBL significantly increased the expressions of IL-2 ([180.24 +/- 2.22] pg/ml) and INF-gamma ([1512.46 +/- 23.64] pg/ml) as compared with TCV and TCV-Ad-eGFP (P Conclusion:The m4-1BBL-expressing prostate cancer cell vaccine can effectively induce anti-tumor immune responses.
