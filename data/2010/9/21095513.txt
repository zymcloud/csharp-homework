The treatment of chronic hepatitis B is essentially based on the use of nucleoside or nucleotide analogues, which lead to viral suppression in the majority of cases. Viral suppression is associated with normal ALT values and progressive histological improvement of not only necroinflammatory lesions but also fibrosis. Regression of cirrhosis can be observed in severe cases. With the use of second-generation nucleoside or nucleotide analogues, the risk of mutation resistance is rare or inexistent. Finally, negativation and seroconversion of the HBs antigen can be observed in the medium-term. This seroconversion is usually associated with a decreased risk of complications and morbidity-mortality improvement.
