Background:How to prioritize patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for liver transplantation (LT) remains controversial. This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a policy for prioritizing HCC patients according to their response to pre-LT therapy.Methods:The study period was from 2000 to 2008. Dropout criteria included macroscopic vascular invasion, metastases, and poorly differentiated grade at pre-LT biopsy. A specific treatment algorithm was adopted to treat HCC before LT, and the effect of treatment was evaluated 3 months after listing or after the diagnosis of HCC for patients diagnosed while already on the waiting list. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1, patients with disease that completely or partially responded to therapy; and group 2, patients with stable, progressive, or untreatable disease. Group 2 patients were prioritized for LT unless full restaging and repeat biopsy identified dropout criteria.Results:At the 3-month visit, 62 HCC patients (42%) were assigned to group 2 and 85 (58%) to group 1. Eleven of 12 dropouts due to tumor progression came from group 2 (P 0.05), but a slightly higher risk of post-LT HCC recurrence (13% and 2%, respectively; P = 0.04).Conclusions:Response to therapy is a potentially effective tool for prioritizing HCC patients for LT.
