The liver is a common site of both primary and secondary malignancy resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Careful patient evaluation and triage allows for optimal utilization of all oncologic therapies, including radiation, systemic chemotherapy, surgery, transarterial therapies, and ablation. Although the role of interventional oncologists in the management of hepatic malignancies continues to evolve, the use of percutaneous ablation therapies has proven to be an effective and minimally invasive modality for treatment. Percutaneous ablation therapies have diversified from direct ethanol injection to multiple modalities including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, acetic acid injection, laser ablation, microwave ablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound, and irreversible electroporation. RFA is the most commonly utilized modality for hepatic interventions and has proven efficacy in both hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma metastases. Although tumor size remains a challenge, combination therapies and new device innovations continue to allow for improved ablation zones and more durable results.
