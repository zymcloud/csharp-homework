Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second most common cause of male cancer death in Korea, where the major etiology, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, is endemic. With a high incidence of unresectable HCCs and a low cadaveric organ donation rate, the number of adult living-donor liver transplantations (LDLTs) has increased rapidly, by tenfold, over the past 10 years, as an alternative to deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT) in Asia, including Korea. Currently, HCC accounts for more than 40% of the indications for adult LDLT as the associated decompensation cirrhosis or unresectable HCC with 2.8% perioperative mortality at our institute. In determining eligibility for LDLT, the Milan criteria, which have a major aim of reducing the wastage of cadaveric liver grafts, still remain the gold standard. Our published results with 168 adult LDLTs show no difference from the results with DDLT for HCC that meets the Milan criteria. However, since a substantial proportion of adult LDLT patients not fulfilling the Milan criteria have been found to survive for longer than expected, and because a live donor organ is a private gift, most LDLT programs in Korea accept HCC patients beyond the Milan criteria, and the reported 3-year survival rates for such patients are approximately 63%.
