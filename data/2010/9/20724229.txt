A novel, sensitive and reliable liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of belinostat (PXD101) in human plasma. Oxamflatin was used as the internal standard. Liquid-liquid extraction of the plasma sample was performed using tert-butyl methyl ether as the organic solvent. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a BDS Hypersil C18 column (2.1 mm x1 00 mm, 5 microm) using gradient elution mode using 0.05% formic acid in water and 0.05% formic acid in acetonitrile as solvents A and B, respectively, 60/40. The run time was 6 min. The mass spectrometer was operated under a positive electrospray ionization condition and a multiple reaction monitoring mode. An excellent linear calibration was achieved in the range of 0.5-1000 ng/mL. An average recovery of belinostat for four quality controls was 72.6% and the recovery of the internal standard at 1000 ng/mL was 67.8%. The intra-day and inter-day precisions for belinostat were
