Purpose:To compare the direct costs of two diagnostic algorithms for pretherapeutic TNM staging of rectal cancer.Materials and methods:In a study including 33 patients (mean age: 62.5 years), the direct fixed and variable costs of a sequential multimodal algorithm (rectoscopy, endoscopic and abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray, thoracic/abdominal CT in the case of positive findings in abdominal ultrasound or chest X-ray) were compared to those of a novel algorithm of rectoscopy followed by MRI using a whole-body scanner. MRI included T 2w sequences of the rectum, 3D T 1w sequences of the liver and chest after bolus injection of gadoxetic acid, and delayed phases of the liver. The personnel work times, material items, and work processes were tracked to the nearest minute by interviewing those responsible for the process (surgeon, gastroenterologist, two radiologists). The costs of labor and materials were determined from personnel reimbursement data and hospital accounting records. Fixed costs were determined from vendor pricing.Results:The mean MRI time was 55 min. CT was performed in 19/33 patients (57%) causing an additional day of hospitalization (costs 374 euro). The costs for equipment and material were higher for MRI compared to sequential algorithm (equipment 116 vs. 30 euro; material 159 vs. 60 euro per patient). The personnel costs were markedly lower for MRI (436 vs. 732 euro per patient). Altogether, the absolute cost advantage of MRI was 31.3% (711 vs. 1035 euro for sequential algorithm).Conclusion:Substantial savings are achievable with the use of whole-body MRI for the preoperative TNM staging of patients with rectal cancer.
