Alterations in the DNA methylation status particularly in CpG islands are involved in the initiation and progression of many types of human cancer. A number of DNA methylation alterations have been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, a systematic analysis is required to elucidate the relationship between differential DNA methylation status and the characteristics and progression of HCC. In the present study, a global analysis of DNA methylation using a human CpG-island 12K array was performed on a number of HCC cell lines of different origin and metastatic potential. Based on a standard methylation alteration ratio of ≥2 or ≤0.5, 58 CpG island sites and 66 tumor-related genes upstream, downstream or within were identified. This study showed a series of CpG island methylation alterations in the HCC cell lines. The expression of various oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and other key genes were up- or downregulated, respectively, resulting in CpG island hypomethylation or hypermethylation accordingly. To conclude, a foundation has been provided for screening CpG island methylation profiles as HCC biological markers.
