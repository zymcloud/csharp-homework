Background and objectives:Interferon (IFN) can eradicate hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA from serum and hepatic tissue, and suppress the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite such effectiveness, HCC develops even in HCV patients successfully treated with IFN therapy.Methods:HCV-related HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC were divided into three groups according to preceding IFN for HCV infection therapy and the therapeutic effect: responders group (n = 23), non-responders group (n = 46), and no-IFN group (n = 215). Postoperative outcome was retrospectively examined in the three groups.Results:AST and ALT were significantly lower in responders group than non-responders group (P Conclusions:Preceding IFN therapy for HCV infection improves postoperative outcome in HCV-related HCC patients treated successfully with IFN.
