The photocytotoxic effect of hypericin (Hyp) targeted by two different delivery techniques, namely, liposomes and anti-hepatocyte specific antigen (anti-HSA) was investigated. Optical absorption and steady-state fluorescence were used to analyze the conjugation of Hyp with anti-HSA model and to evaluate the encapsulation capacity and drug release in a liposome model. Particle size and thermal analysis of the prepared liposomes were performed using laser-light scattering and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. Viability study of HepG2 cells exposed to Hyp in the two delivery systems, in the dark and following visible light irradiation, was performed in comparison to free Hyp. The intracellular uptake and localization of Hyp in HepG2 cells were analyzed by means of spectrofluorometry and fluorescence microscopy. Spectroscopic measurements demonstrated that Hyp binds to anti-HSA in its monomeric form. The photocytotoxic effect of Hyp depended clearly on the form of Hyp administered, either in free form, loaded into liposomes or conjugated with anti-HSA. While liposomes loaded with Hyp (Lip-Hyp) did not induce significant phototoxicity, both free Hyp or anti-HSA-Hyp inflicted substantial cell mortality, after photoirradiation. The intracellular uptake of Lip-Hyp by HepG2 cells was estimated to be 20% less compared to free Hyp or anti-HSA-Hyp. In spite of the equal uptake of both free Hyp and anti-HSA-Hyp, HepG2 cells demonstrated a relatively higher mortality with anti-HSA-Hyp compared to free Hyp.
