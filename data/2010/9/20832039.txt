We report the case of an early local recurrence after a laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) for a Furhman grade 1-2 clear cell renal carcinoma (CCRC). CT scan at 6 months revealed a local recurrence. An open total nephrectomy was performed. There were six nodules in the perirenal fat from a grade 3 CCRC. Twenty-six months after the LPN, the patient had a wound recurrence, which was surgically removed. Four months after the wound recurrence, the patient had pulmonary, liver and adrenal glands metastasis. He received an oral treatment with sunitinib. At 4 months after the initiation of the sunitinib, he had a total response.
