Objectives:To demonstrate the effectiveness and the safety of laser thermal ablation (LTA) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) deemed not accessible for other percutaneous procedures (radiofrequency ablation, sclerotherapy).Methods:From September 2003 to August 2008, 140 patients with HCC nodules were treated. In 49 patients, the lesions were localized in "critical sites". A total of 29 men and 20 women (age range 51-79 years; Child-Pugh score A = 75.51%, B = 24.49%) with 52 nodules (mean diameter 2.0 +/- 1.2 cm) were treated in 95 percutaneous LTA sessions. We compared major and minor complications observed in the two groups of patients. Effectiveness was defined as the percentage of HCCs completely ablated after percutaneous LTA. Follow-up was carried out with computed tomography (CT) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.Results:No major complications or deaths were registered. In a few patients (8.16%), minor complications were observed. No substantial differences were observed on comparing the percentage of minor and major complications in these patients with the remaining patients. A difference in terms of effectiveness was found.Conclusion:LTA can be considered a safe treatment in "critical nodules".
