We present the first transcriptional regulatory element found in a PAH gene intron. The element is located in the PAH gene intron 8, acts as an enhancer specifically in the hepatoma cell line, and binds GATA-1 transcription factor. Herein the presented data could unlock a new area for the analysis of PAH gene expression and could contribute to refining genotype-phenotype correlation.
