Background and objectives:To evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the absence of another standard treatment option.Methods:The authors reviewed the details of 38 patients with inoperable HCC (diameter Results:Two-year overall survival and local progression-free survival rates were 61.4% and 66.4%, respectively. The local response rate was 63% at 3 months after SBRT. A high radiation dose was found to be independently related to survival. A decline in liver function was observed in six patients (16%) and Grade 3 musculoskeletal toxicity in one patient (2.7%).Conclusions:This study showed that SBRT can be safely administered to select HCC patients, and these results suggest that this technique should be considered a salvage treatment. A further well-controlled large-scale study and longer follow-up are needed to determine optimal dose-fraction schedules and characterize late complications.
