Background/purpose:The results of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at Kyoto University were analyzed.Methods:Between February 1999 and December 2006, 136 patients with HCC underwent LDLT. Of these, 74 patients met the Milan criteria, while 62 patients did not. Treatment for HCC had been previously performed prior to LDLT for 101 patients (74%).Results:According to the results of multivariate analysis of risk factors for recurrence among preoperative tumor variables, we have defined new Kyoto criteria as Conclusions:The proposed Kyoto criteria are expected to serve efficiently as expanded selection criteria for LDLT in patients with HCC. History of previous treatments did not affect outcomes after LDLT.
