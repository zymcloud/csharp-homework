Background:Anatomic resection of the liver in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is generally recommended. Several previous reports have described the potential superiority of anatomic resection. However, no clear evidence of long-term survival or other advantages compared with those achieved with limited resection exist. We evaluated the oncologic outcomes of nonanatomic resection performed as a primary treatment for small (Materials and methods:From March 1998 to January 2005, 353 consecutive patients underwent resection of HCC. Among them, 167 patients with single and small (Results:There were no significantly different preoperative clinical characteristics between the two groups (Group NA versus Group A). Only the resection margin width (0.8 +/- 0.6 cm versus 2.0 +/- 1.4 cm, P Conclusion:Our study showed that nonanatomic resection has no adverse effects on the oncologic outcomes of single and small (
