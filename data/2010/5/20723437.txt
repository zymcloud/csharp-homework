Objective:To explore the therapeutic efficacy and safety of batroxobin in patients with primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) and the advantages of transcatheter arterial perfusion of batroxobin combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:40 patients with PHC were randomized into experimental group (transcatheter arterial perfusion of batroxobin combined with TACE treatment, 20 patients) and control group (TACE alone group, 20 patients). The patients were followed up and the data were recorded, compared and analyzed.Results:(1) Compared with the control group, the FIB level in the experimental group was significantly decreased at the first month after treatment (P 0.05).Conclusion:Batroxobin can rapidly and effectively decrease the FIB level. Therefore it may be used as an effective and safe adjuvant drug for the the treatment of primary hepatic carcinoma. Transcatheter arterial perfusion of batroxobin combined with TACE therapy has advantages in comparison with TACE alone. It could be taken as a new therapeutic regimen in the PHC treatment.
