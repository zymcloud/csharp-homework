Background:Portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT) is highly associated with the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there are no appropriate cell models of PVTT with which to study the biological and physiological characteristics of PVTT.Methods:Primary cell culture was performed by the use of a successive xenograft line called PVTT-#1, which was obtained from a 60-year-old male HCC patient accompanied by PVTT.Results:A successive cell line named CSQT-2 was established. The cell line showed aggressive phenotypes in terms of cell growth, survival, migration, xenograft and metastasis. Moreover, an orthotopic transplantation assay showed that PVTT can be generated in nude mice when CSQT-2 cells were inoculated in the liver and that it shows a typical migratory tendency in the vascular branches of portal vein. Moreover, the established CSQT-2 cells also showed varied expression of tumour-initiating cell (TIC) markers such as CD133, CD90 and EpCAM.Conclusion:Establishment of CSQT-2 may provide a suitable model with which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PVTT-related HCC.
