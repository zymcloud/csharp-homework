Liver transplantation is regarded as an effective treatment for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, some patients experience recurrence and subsequently rapid progression of the disease. We investigated prognostic factors affecting survival after recurrence in patients who underwent adult living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for HCC. From October 1992 to December 2005, 138 adult patients underwent LDLT for HCC. Among these, 28 patients (20.3%) who suffered recurrence were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze factors affecting survival after recurrence. The median time to recurrence was 7.9 months. The median survival time after recurrence was 11.7 months, and the 1- and 3-year survival rates after recurrence were 52.8% and 15.8%, respectively. Initially, 7 patients (25%) showed multiorgan involvement; however, in the follow-up, 21 patients (75%) had multiorgan involvement. On univariate analysis, a pretransplant alpha-fetoprotein level >1000 ng/mL, major vascular invasion, a poorly differentiated tumor, a time to recurrence
