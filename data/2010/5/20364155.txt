Aim:To explore a novel function of a mutant of the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx Delta 127) in the promotion of hepatoma cell migration.Methods:The effect of HBx Delta 127 and wild type HBx on the migration ability of hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells were examined using wound healing assays in stable transfection systems. The full-length osteopontin(OPN) promoter sequence was cloned into the pGL3-Basic plasmid. The promoter activities of OPN in stably HBx Delta 127-transfected hepatoblastoma HepG2 (HepG2-X Delta 127) and hepatocellular carcinoma H7402 (H7402-X Delta 127) cells were determined using luciferase reporter gene assays. The mRNA expression levels of OPN were detected by RT-PCR. And the effect of MK886, a specific inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), on OPN promoter activity and mRNA expression in HepG2-X Delta 127 and H7402-X Delta 127 cells were examined using luciferase reporter gene assays and RT-PCR, respectively. Finally, the migration ability of HepG2-X Delta 127 was observed after treatment with siRNA targeting OPN mRNA and HBx mRNA using wound healing assays.Results:HepG2-X Delta 127 cells exhibited a greater capacity for wound repair compared to HepG2-X cells. The promoter activity and mRNA expression levels of OPN were also increased in HepG2-X Delta 127 and H7402-X Delta 127 cells. Moreover, MK886 abolished the HBx Delta 127-mediated upregulation of OPN. Wound healing assays demonstrated that the migration ability of HepG2-X Delta 127 cells can be suppressed by treatment with siRNA targeting OPN mRNA and siRNA targeting HBx mRNA.Conclusion:HBx Delta 127 strongly promotes hepatoma cell migration via activation of OPN involving 5-LOX.
