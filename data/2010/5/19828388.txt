Although not frequently, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can ensue in a non-cirrhotic liver. As compared to cirrhotic HCC, this kind of tumour has some peculiarities, such as: (a) a lower male preponderance and a bimodal age distribution; (b) a lower prevalence of the three main risk factors (hepatitis B and C virus infections and alcohol abuse), with an increased prevalence of other etiologic factors, such as exposure to genotoxic substances and sex hormones, inherited diseases, genetic mutations; (c) a more advanced tumour stage at the time of diagnosis, as it is usually detected due to the occurrence of cancer-related symptoms, outside any scheduled surveillance program; (d) a much higher amenability to hepatic resection, due to the low risk of liver failure even after extended parenchymal mutilation; (e) overall and disease-free survivals after resection of non-advanced tumours (meeting the Milano criteria) comparable to that obtained with liver transplantation in cirrhotic patients carrying an early tumour; (f) overall survival strictly dependent on tumour burden (and its recurrence) and barely influenced by liver function.
