Endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) has emerged as a new diagnostic tool that allows the bronchoscopist to see beyond the airway, including pulmonary and mediastinal lesion. The real time EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) has advanced the diagnostic yield in primary lung pathology and mediastinal lymph node staging of lung carcinoma. Sixty-four patients (36 males, 28 females, ages ranging from 16 to 86 years) with peribronchial lung lesions and mediastinal and/or hilar lymph node lesions underwent EBUS-TBNA. All patients had intraoperative cytological assessment by smears on aspiration samples or touch preparation on needle core biopsies.The cytological final diagnoses were categorized as negative, suspicious/positive, and non-diagnostic. Forty-nine samples were obtained from lymph node lesions and 15 samples were obtained from lung lesions. In cytology specimens, 32 patients had suspicious/positive diagnoses and 32 patients had negative diagnosis. In follow-up histology specimens, 35 patients had malignant diagnoses, including 18 adenocarcinomas, 8 small cell carcinomas, 6 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 metastatic melanoma, and 1 lymphoma. Twenty-nine patients had negative diagnoses. Sensitivity and specificity were 88.9% and 96.4%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 97.0% and 87.1%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was 92.2%. EBUS-TBNA is an efficient and effective technique for diagnosis of intrapulmonary and mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes. It becomes significantly invaluable on clinical management for staging in those patients with lung cancer of other metastatic malignancies. This technique enables us to obtain tissue samples for quick diagnoses beyond central airway with minimal complications.
