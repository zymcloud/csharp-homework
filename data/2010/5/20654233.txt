Objective:To explore the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the interaction of PAH exposure and other HCC risk factors to HCC.Methods:Baseline blood samples, collected from 345 HCC cases and 961 controls, were used to determine the level of PAH-albumin adducts by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effect of PAH-albumin adducts on risk of HCC.Results:The mean level of PAH-albumin adducts was significantly higher in cases than in controls ((5.68 +/- 0.72) fmol/mg albumin vs (5.46 +/- 0.63) fmol/mg albumin) (u = 5.98, P 34.21 fmol/mg albumin), respectively (chi(2)(trend) = 15.06, P Conclusion:PAH-albumin adducts was related with HCC, and there is a trend of HCC prevalence increasing with the content of PAH-albumin adducts. There are interactions between PAH-albumin adducts and HBV infection, family history of cancer and diabetes mellitus on HCC.
