We report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in association with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In May 2003, a 66- year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of acute liver dysfunction. He was diagnosed with AIH, and his liver function was normalized by oral administration of the corticosteroid. In July 2007, when he was admitted for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia, two liver tumors (S4: ø4 cm and S2: ø1 cm) were revealed by abdominal CT scan, and the serum level of AFP was high. According to the findings of imaging diagnosis and laboratory data, the patient was diagnosed as having HCC. Since the standard invasive therapies of HCC were not accepted by the patient and his family, he was treated by oral administration of UFT-E (tegafur/uracil: 200 mg/day). Three months after the initiation of administration, CT scan showed a remarkable reduction of the tumors, and his serum AFP level was decreased to the normal range. This case shows that HCC develops in an AIH patient even if liver function is maintained in the normal range. It also suggests the clinical usefulness of UFT-E in the management of HCC given the difficulty of treatment by the standard therapies.
