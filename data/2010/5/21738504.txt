Miriplatin, a cisplatin derivative with a high affinity for iodized ethyl esters of fatty acids from poppy seed oil, is a novel chemotherapeutic agent designed for use in the transarterial treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we describe transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) using miriplatin to treat a case of advanced HCC with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) refractory to TAI with epirubicin. A 66-year-old man with advanced hepatitis C virus-related HCC with PVTT in the right lobe of the liver was treated with TAI with epirubicin suspended in iodized oil; however, tumor marker levels (alpha-fetoprotein and des-gamma-carboxy protein) did not decrease. Next, he was treated twice with TAI with miriplatin suspended in iodized oil. The tumor marker levels markedly decreased to a nearly normal range and the size of the main tumor was markedly reduced according to dynamic computed tomography. No serious adverse events occurred during the course of treatment with TAI and miriplatin. Therefore, we suggest that TAI with miriplatin is a safe and effective treatment option for advanced HCCs refractory to TAI with epirubicin.
