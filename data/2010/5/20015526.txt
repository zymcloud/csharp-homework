Background:We sought to evaluate the influence of age on the outcome of repeat hepatectomies in patients > or = 75 years with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We studied 121 curative repeat hepatectomies retrospectively. Among the 121 patients, 100, 20, and 1 received second, third, and fourth hepatectomies, respectively. The short-term surgical results of a younger group ( or = 75 years; n = 33) were compared. The long-term prognosis of the patients who underwent second hepatectomies was also compared between a younger group ( or = 75 years; n = 23).Results:The patients in the elderly group displayed more comorbid conditions pre-operatively, including hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, than the younger group (P Conclusion:Our findings suggest that advanced age by itself does not have an adverse effect on operative outcomes, including postoperative complications and long-term prognosis. Repeat hepatectomy may, therefore, be justified for recurrent HCC in selected elderly patients.
