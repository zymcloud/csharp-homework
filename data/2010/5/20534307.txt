Tumor progression before orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the main cause of dropouts from waiting lists among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Performing a porto-caval shunt (PCS) before parenchymal liver transection has the potential to allow an extended hepatectomy in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, reducing portal hyperflow and therefore the sinusoidal shear-stress on the remnant liver. We report the case of a 59-year-old man affected by hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child Pugh score presentation, C-10; Model for End Stage Liver Disease score, 18) and HCC (2 lesions of 2 and 2.8 cm). The patient began the evaluation to join the OLT waiting list, but, in the 3 months required to complete the evaluation, he developed tumor progression: 3 HCC lesions, the largest 1 with a diameter of about 4.4 cm. These findings excluded transplantation criteria and the patient was referred to our center. After appropriate preoperative studies, the patient underwent a major liver resection (trisegmentectomy) after side-to-side PCS by interposition of an iliac vein graft from a cadaveric donor. The patient overcame the worsened severity of cirrhosis. After 6 months of follow-up, he developed 2 other HCC nodules. He was then included on the waiting list at our center, undergoing OLT from a cadaveric donor at 8 months after salvage treatment. At 36 months after OLT, he is alive and free from HCC recurrence. Associating a partial side-to-side PCS with hepatic resection may represent a potential salvage therapy for patients with decompensated cirrhosis and HCC progression beyond listing criteria for OLT.
