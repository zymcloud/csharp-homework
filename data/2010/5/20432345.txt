Purpose:To develop a fully quantitative 4D transcatheter intraarterial perfusion (TRIP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique and prospectively test the hypothesis that quantitative 4D TRIP-MRI can be used clinically to monitor intraprocedural liver tumor perfusion reductions during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).Materials and methods:TACE was performed within an x-ray digital subtraction angiography (DSA)-MRI procedure suite in 16 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Quantitative 4D TRIP-MRI with targeted radiofrequency field mapping and dynamic longitudinal relaxation rate mapping was used to monitor changes in tumor perfusion during TACE. First-pass perfusion analysis was performed to produce intraprocedural blood flow (Frho) maps. Mean liver tumor perfusions before and after TACE were compared with a paired t-test (alpha = 0.05).Results:Perfusion reductions were successfully measured with quantitative 4D TRIP-MRI in 22 separate tumors during 18 treatment sessions. Mean tumor perfusion Frho decreased from 16.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.7-21.9) before TACE to 5.0 (95% CI: 3.5-6.5) (mL/min/100 mL) after TACE. Tumor perfusion reductions were statistically significant (P Conclusion:Quantitative 4D TRIP-MRI can be successfully performed within clinical interventional settings to monitor intraprocedural changes in liver tumor perfusion during TACE.
