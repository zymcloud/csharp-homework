Background & aims:The risk and the predictors of liver disease progression in carriers of inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) are unclear.Methods:Participants in the Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-Hepatitis B Virus (REVEAL-HBV) study who were seronegative for hepatitis B e antigen; had serum levels of HBV DNA Results:There were 20,069 participants, contributing a total of 262,122 person-years, with a mean follow-up of 13.1 years. Annual incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death were 0.06% and 0.04%, respectively, for inactive HBV carriers; rates were 0.02%, and 0.02% for controls, respectively. The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for carriers of inactive HBV, compared to controls, were 4.6 (95% confidence interval: 2.5-8.3) for hepatocellular carcinoma and 2.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-4.1) for liver-related death. Older age and alcohol drinking habits were independent predictors of risk for carriers of inactive HBV to develop hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusions:Carriers of inactive HBV have a substantial risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death compared with individuals not infected with HBV.
