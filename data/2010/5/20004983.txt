Carbonyl reductase/20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (CR/20beta-HSD) serves both as a key enzyme in the gonadal synthesis of maturing-inducing hormone in salmonids, and as an enzyme protecting against certain reactive oxygen species. We have previously shown that mRNA of the hepatic CR/20beta-HSD B isoform is increased in rainbow trout caged downstream from a Swedish sewage treatment plant. Here, we report an increase of both the A as well as B form in fish kept downstream from a second sewage treatment plant. The two mRNAs were also induced in fish hepatoma cells in vitro after exposure to effluent extract. This indicates that the effects observed in vivo could be a direct effect on the liver, i.e. the mRNA induction does not require a signal from any other organ. When fish were exposed in vivo to several effluents treated with more advanced methods (ozone, moving bed biofilm reactor or membrane bioreactor) the expression of hepatic mRNA CR/20beta-HSD A and B was significantly reduced. Their abundance did not parallel the reduction of estrogen-responsive transcripts, in agreement with our previous observations that ethinylestradiol is not a potent inducer. Treatment with norethisterone, methyltestosterone or hydrocortisone in vivo did not induce the hepatic CR/20beta-HSD A and B mRNA expression. In contrast, both isoforms were markedly induced by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist beta-naphthoflavone as well as by the pro-oxidant herbicide paraquat. We hypothesize that the induction of CR/20beta-HSD A and B by sewage effluents could be due to anthropogenic contaminants stimulating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and/or causing oxidative stress.
