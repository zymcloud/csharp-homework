Double carcinomas of hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are extremely rare, and among the reported cases, none of the hepatocellular carcinomas show clear cell change. We report a case of synchronous double primary clear cell tumor in the liver and the kidney of a 70-year-old male. The renal mass was a renal cell carcinoma of mixed clear and granular cell types, and the hepatic mass was a hepatocellular carcinoma with extensive clear cell change that mimicked a metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A simple battery of immunohistochemical stains composed of hepatocyte antigen, and CD10 was performed to make a definite diagnosis.
