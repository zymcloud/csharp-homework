Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been a significant problem in hemodialysis (HD) patients. In general, it carries significant morbidity including liver cirrhosis, liver cell failure and hepatoma. The study was conducted on 36 seronegative HD patients. All patients were managed with strict application of infection control guidelines as well as isolation of HCV-positive patients. None of the patients received any blood transfusions and were managed with iron and erythropoietin. After five years of follow-up, we found that the incidence of HCV seroconversion was zero. Our study further suggests that following infection control guidelines, isolation of seropositive patients and minimizing blood transfusions can help in prevention of HCV transmission among HD patients.
