Aims:It is important to understand the role of microRNA in the transformation from chronic HBV hepatitis to hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatocarcinogenesis. Relationship of microRNA-602 with chronic HBV hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and HCC was investigated in this article.Results:(1) 14 MicroRNAs were aberrantly expressed in HCC and CL compared with NL. Among these, microRNA-602 expression in CH, LC, NT and HCC was 2.939, 3.234, 2.439 and 4.134 times of that in NL respectively, which was significantly different (p Methods:(1) MicroRNA expression was investigated in normal (NL), chronic HBV hepatitis (CH), HBV-positive cirrhotic (CL), HBV-positive HCC and corresponding normal para-tumorous livers (NT) and hepatoma cells was evaluated with microRNA microarray and verified by real-time PCR, and microRNA-602 was selected for further study. Expression of miR602-target genes RASSF1A and P73 were detected with RT-PCR and western blot. (2) MicroRNA-602 expression in HepG2 and HepG2-HBX was inhibited by miR-602 inhibitor transfection; RASSF1A and P73 expression was detected and cell apoptosis and proliferation were detected.Conclusions:MicroRNA-602 plays a pro-carcinogenic role in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting RASSF1A. MicroRNA-602 might be an early diagnostic marker for HBV-mediated HCC.
