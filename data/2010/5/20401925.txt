We previously reported that yamamarin, a pentapeptide with an amidated C-terminus (DILRG-NH(2)) isolated from larvae of the silkmoth, and its palmitoylated analog (C16-DILRG-NH(2)) suppressed proliferation of rat hepatoma (liver cancer) cells. In this study, we investigated the structure-activity relationship of yamamarin by in vitro assay and spectroscopic methods (CD and NMR) for various analogs. The in vitro assay results demonstrated that the chemical structure of the C-terminal part (-RG-NH(2)) of yamamarin is essential for its activity. The CD and NMR results indicated that yamamarin and its analog adopt predominantly a random coil conformation. Moreover, a comparison of NMR spectra of DILRG-NH(2) and C16-DILRG-NH(2) revealed that the N-terminal palmitoyl group of C16-DILRG-NH(2) did not affect the conformation of the C-terminal part, which is essential for activity. Together, these results should assist in the design of more sophisticated anticancer drugs.
