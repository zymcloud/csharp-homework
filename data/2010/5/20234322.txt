Introduction:Although erlotinib, an orally active and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor, is mainly metabolized in the liver, its effectiveness and safety for patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) has not been reported. Thus, we investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of erlotinib and its active metabolite OSI-420 in such patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Method:We administered 150 mg erlotinib daily to three patients with NSCLC and CRF undergoing HD (HD group) and five patients with NSCLC and normal organ function (control group) and analyzed the PK of erlotinib and OSI-420. In the HD group, PK analyses were performed on day 1 (off HD), day 8 (off HD), and day 9 (on HD) after starting administration of erlotinib, and in the control group, they were performed on day 1 and day 8.Results:In the HD group, there were little differences in the PK data between day 8 and day 9. The PK data on day 1 and day 8 of the HD group were also similar to those of the control group. There were no serious adverse events in any cases, and one of the HD patients achieved partial response.Conclusion:Erlotinib was hardly affected by renal function and HD, which confirms the effectiveness and safety of erlotinib treatment in patients with NSCLC and CRF undergoing HD. Erlotinib can become one treatment option for such patients.
