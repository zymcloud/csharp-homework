Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma(LCNEC)is a relatively new category with biological behavior similar to small cell carcinoma. Thus, it is reportedly well treated by the same chemotherapy as for small cell carcinoma. We experienced a case of gastric large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, treated very effectively by CDDP+CPT-11.60 mg/m(2) of CDDP was administered on day 1, and 60 mg/m(2) of CPT-11 on day 1, 8 and 15. An intermission after administration for 14 days made for one course. Four courses were carried out. A complete response was obtained for a primary gastric lesion and liver metastasis, and a partial response was obtained for lymph node metastases. So far it has showed no change for 6 months after chemotherapy. Both CDDP and CPT-11 are key drugs in the chemotherapy for common gastric cancer, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma from poorly-differentiated gastric cancer. We found this combination chemotherapy is a suitable regimen for the assumed existence of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma at the gastric lesion.
