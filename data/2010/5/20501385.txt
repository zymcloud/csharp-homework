Objective:To survey the status of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in the liver of patients with liver cancer and explore the correlation between Hp infection and liver cancer.Methods:Liver specimens were obtained 30 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), 30 with liver cancer, and 30 healthy control subjects. The specimens were cultured in Colombian agar medium in microaerophilic condition for isolation of Hp. The presence of Hp was also identified by biochemical test, urease test, immunohistochemistry, and PCR and sequence analysis.Results:Hp was found in none of the liver specimens by culture tests. One out of the 30 patients with liver cancer (3%) was positive for Hp by urease tests. Immunohistochemical staining identified Hp positivity in 9 liver cancer tissue (30.0%), but in none of control or CLD cases (PConclusion:A greater incidence of Hp infection in the liver is identified in patients with liver cancer than in healthy subjects and CLD patients, suggesting a potential correlation between Hp infection to liver cancer.
