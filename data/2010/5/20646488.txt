Objective:To explore the efficacy and determine the risk factors of survival for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) treated by percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA).Methods:From January 1999 to December 2008, 82 patients with recurrent HCC, with the diameter less than 7 cm for solitary tumor, or the largest tumor less than 5 cm for multiple tumors(the number of tumors less than 3), were treated by PRFA. The significance of 12 clinical or pathological variables in the risk factors of overall survival were assessed.Results:The overall survival 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 75.8%, 43.9% and 34.5% (from the date of PRFA), and 95.1%, 63.2% and 46.6% (from initial hepatectomy), respectively. Univariate analysis indicated that tumor size before initial hepatectomy, recurrence interval from initial hepatectomy, number of recurrent tumors, diameter of largest recurrent tumor, serum glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and serum albumin (ALB) level were significant prognostic factors (P Conclusion:PRFA is effective for recurrent HCC. Recurrence interval from initial hepatectomy, diameter of largest recurrent tumor, serum GGT and ALB level are significant prognostic factors.
