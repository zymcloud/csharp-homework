Background and objective:In Guangxi province, from 1970s to 1990s, the mortality of primary liver cancer (PLC) ranked the first among a variety of malignant tumors. Investigating the epidemiological characteristics of PLC is very important for developing reasonable and effective treatment strategy, allocating health resources rationally, and evaluating the quality of PLC prevention and control. This study was to analyze the mortality and epidemiological characteristics of PLC in Guangxi province between 2004 and 2005.Methods:Multi stage stratified cluster random sampling method was used to select 9 counties (cities or urban areas) as sample points. The residents' death causes between 2004 and 2005 were analyzed, and the epidemiological characteristics of PLC were investigated.Results:In the period of 2004-2005, the crude mortality of PLC was 34.39/100,000 in Guangxi province population (55.30/100,000 in men and 13.21/100,000 in women). The national population standardized mortality in 1964 was 22.17/100,000. The man to woman ratio of mortality was 4.19:1. PLC ranked as the first death cause among a variety of malignant tumors, and PLC related death accounted for 30.70% of all tumor related death cases. Age specific mortality of PLC was increased with age, rising significantly from 30 year old (from 25 year old in men and from 40 year old in women), and reached a peak at 75 year old.Conclusions:The mortality of PLC shows a decreasing trend in Guangxi province in the early 21st century, and the starting age of PLC death peak postpones about 10 years than that in 1990s. It shows that the comprehensive prevention and control measures of PLC implemented in Guangxi province are fruitful. However, the PLC mortality in Guangxi province is still significantly higher than the national average level, and it still ranks as the first death cause in a variety of malignant tumors in Guangxi province. PLC mainly occurs in middle aged and elderly people. The prevention and treatment research of PLC still has a long way to go.
