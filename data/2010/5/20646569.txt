Objective:To explore the surgical treatment method and outcome for subaxial cervical spine metastatic tumor.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 7 cases of subaxial cervical spine metastatic tumor treated at our hospital between 2002 and 2007. There were 3 male and 4 female patients. The primary lesions included 1 lung cancer, 1 renal cancer, 1 liver cancer, 2 gastric cancers and 2 breast cancers. All cases were treated with anterior vertebrectomy, reconstruction of cervical spine stability with mesh cage and plate fixation. Preoperative and 3-month postoperative VAS scores of neck pain and neurological status of Frankel classification were analyzed statistically. Cervical spine stability was observed by radiography during follow-up.Results:The preoperative and postoperative VAS scores of neck pain were 7.4 +/- 0.8 and 1.8 +/- 1.2 respectively. There was obvious statistical difference between two scores (t = 15.11, P = 0.000). The post-operative neurological status of Frankel classification improved by one to two grades. The mean follow-up period was 18 months except for one patient dying from multiple organ failure at 9 months post-operation. Radiology showed satisfactory cervical spine stability during follow-up.Conclusion:For treating subaxial cervical spine metastatic tumor, anterior vertebrectomy, reconstruction with mesh cage and plate fixation is an effective method to relieve clinical pains and improve neurological functions by complete spinal cord decompression and cervical stability reconstruction.
