Background:Previous studies have reported the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aims:To explore the relationships among DM2, antidiabetic therapy and HCC risk.Methods:We recruited 610 HCC patients compared with 618 matched cirrhotic patients and 1696 Controls. The odds ratio (OR) for HCC in diabetic subjects treated with insulin, sulphonylureas and metformin was calculated.Results:DM2 prevalence was 31.2% in HCC, 23.3% in cirrhotic patients and 12.7% in Controls (PConclusions:Our study shows that DM2 is an independent risk factor for HCC and pre-exists to HCC occurrence. In DM2 patients with HCC, metformin therapy is associated with a reduced HCC risk and seems to have a protective effect on HCC development.
