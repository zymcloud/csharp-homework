Background:The choice between minor versus major resection or anatomic versus nonantatomic resection for small (Methods:Between January 1983 and December 2002, patients with solitary HCC of or = 3 segments) hepatectomy.Results:In 373 patients, 259 underwent minor and 114 underwent major hepatectomy. Patients in the minor resection group had more severe underlying liver disease (P = .005). Therefore, only 29.3% received anatomic resection in the minor resection group in comparison with 72.8% in the major hepatectomy group (P = .0001). No difference was found in postoperative morbidity (P = .105), mortality (P =.222), intrahepatic recurrence (P = .742), and 5-year DFS and OS (31.6% vs 31.8%, P = .932 and 50.7% vs 44.0%, P = .114) in both groups. The type of operative resection was not found to be a significant factor affecting survival in univariate analysis, but the preoperative liver function (alanine aminotransferase [AST] or alanine aminotransferase [ALT], serum albumin, or Child-Pugh status), tumor characteristics (alpha-feto protein, size, and presence of daughter nodules), and blood transfusion were found to be independent factors that affect the DFS and OS in a multivariate analysis.Conclusion:The severity of cirrhosis and tumor characteristics depicts long-term survival rather than the type of resection in HCC.
