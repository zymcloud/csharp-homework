Purpose:The survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has improved with advancements in various diagnostic tools and treatment modalities. Consequently, bone metastases from HCC are diagnosed more frequently. The aims of the present study was to describe the clinical features and treatment of HCC patients presenting with bone metastases. In particular, we evaluated the role of zoledronic acid in these patients especially with regard to pain reduction, analgesic drug consumption and safety.Methods:Between December 2006 and July 2008, we recruited 17 (male:female, 12:5, median age, 68 years; age range, 62-85 years) consecutive patients. Spinal metastases were present in 11 patients (64.7%). Zoledronic acid was administered in all patients (total number of administrations, 107; mean number of administrations, 6.29).Results:A total of 15 patients received at least three administrations of zoledronic acid and reported clinical benefit with pain reduction and tapering of analgesic drugs. Before starting treatment, the mean VAS for patients who received at least three administrations (15/17 patients) of zoledronic acid was 7.1 (+/-0.24), and after 3 months 5.3 (+/-0.20). This improvement was independent of the sex, the extent of metastasis and the concomitant anticancer treatment. No significant side effects were registered in this series of patients. Median survival was 10 months (CI 6,353-13,647).Conclusions:Zoledronic acid may be helpful in treating bone metastases in HCC patients. Patients regularly receiving zoledronic acid showed significant pain relief.
