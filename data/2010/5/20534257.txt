Most transplant centers consider severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT) to be an absolute contraindication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). We retrospectively examined the outcome of 24 patients with PHT (group 1) who underwent OLT compared with 24 matched patients (group 2) without PHT, who also underwent OLT. Based on right cardiac catheterization measurements made after the induction of anesthesia for OLT, PHT was defined as mild or moderate-to-severe if the mean pulmonary arterial pressure exceeded 25 or 35 mm Hg, respectively. The incidence of PHT was 9.8% (24/244); 21/24 PHT patients showed mild and 3/24 moderate PHT. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis did not show a significant difference between the two groups. The incidence of pulmonary infections was significantly greater in group 1 (P
