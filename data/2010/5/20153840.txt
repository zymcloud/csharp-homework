Apolipoprotein A-V (apoA-V), secreted solely by the liver, is a low abundance protein that strongly influences plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. In vitro, in transfected hepatoma cell lines apoA-V is largely retained within the cell in association with cytosolic lipid droplets (LD). To evaluate if this is true in vivo, in the present study the amount of apoA-V in the plasma compartment versus liver tissue was determined in APOA5 transgenic (Tg) mice. The majority of total apoA-V ( approximately 80%) was in the plasma compartment. Injection of APOA5 Tg mice with heparin increased plasma apoA-V protein levels by approximately 25% indicating the existence of a heparin-releasable pool. Intrahepatic apoA-V was associated with LD isolated from livers of wild type (WT) and APOA5 Tg mice. Furthermore, livers from APOA5 Tg mice contained significantly higher amounts of TG than livers from WT or apoa5 knockout mice suggesting that apoA-V influences intrahepatic TG levels.
