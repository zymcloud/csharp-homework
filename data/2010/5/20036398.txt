Background and objective:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis and its current situation in Spain is not well known. Therefore, a national registry was created to assess the characteristics of patients with de novo HCC.Patients and method:Between 1/10/2008 and 31/1/2009, 62 centers reported the baseline demographic, clinical and tumor characteristics, the first choice of treatment and eligibility for transplantation (OLT) of HCC diagnosed during this time.Results:There were 705 new cases of HCC, 78% men, mean age 65 years, 89% cirrhosis (58% Child-Pugh class A, 42% HCV, 30% alcohol). Only 334 cases (47%) were diagnosed by screening. The size of the main nodule and BCLC stage were significantly lower in the screening group than in the rest (p75 years) (p=0.171). Chemoembolization was the most common treatment: initial tumors (46.4%), tumors >5 cm (15.7%), multifocal HCC (37.9%) and as a bridge to OLT (33%).Conclusion:The majority of HCC patients are diagnosed in Spain out of early detection programs, and this limits the chance for early diagnosis and effective therapy.
