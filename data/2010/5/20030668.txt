Calreticulin, upon translocation to the cell surface, plays a critical role in the recognition of tumour cells and in experimentally induced cellular anti-tumour immunity. However, less is known about anti-calreticulin antibodies and their role in malignancies. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we found immunoglobulin (Ig)A and/or IgG anti-calreticulin antibodies in sera of approximately 63% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 57% of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRA) and 47% of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PACA), while healthy controls, patients with viral hepatitis C and with chronic pancreatitis reached only 2%, 20% and 31% seropositivity, respectively. We found significantly elevated mean levels of IgA anti-calreticulin antibodies (P
