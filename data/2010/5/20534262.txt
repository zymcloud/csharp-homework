Apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1)/redox effector factor 1 (Ref-1), which is a multifunction protein involved in both transcriptional regulation of gene expression during adaptive cellular responses to oxidative stress and in the base excision repair pathway of DNA lesions generated as a consequence of oxidant-induced base damage, contributes to the maintenance of genome stability. APE1/Ref-1 is normally localized in the nucleus; cytoplasmic localization observed in several tumors has been correlated with a poor prognosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) grading is an essential tool to predict the risk of relapse and patient prognosis, particularly in patients undergoing liver transplantation (OLT). The aim of this study was to identify the role of APE1/Ref-1 in predicting a posttransplant HCC relapse. We studied 48 patients transplanted for HCC to define grading as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic APE1/Ref-1 expression within neoplastic versus nonneoplastic parenchyma. We defined a cutoff of 60% of cytoplasmic APE1/Ref-1 expression to identify positive cases. At a minimum of 1.5-year follow-up after transplantation, 32 patients are alive and 16 patients are deceased after HCC relapse. Among low-grade HCC (grades 1 and 2), 76% of cases are alive; only 34% showed cytoplasmic APE1/Ref-1 immunoreactivity. Among the high-grade cases (grades 3 and 4), 50% were alive with 64% showing cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. Nuclear reactivity was generally similar either in neoplastic or in cirrhotic livers, irrespective of the grade. These data seemed to support the hypothesis of a predictive role of APE1/Ref-1 for HCC risk of relapse, which together with tumor grade by analysis of a pretransplant needle biopsy should aid decision making for OLT.
