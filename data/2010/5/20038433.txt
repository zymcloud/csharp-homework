Background & aims:Acquisition of resistance to the antiproliferative effect of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 is crucial for the malignant progression of cancers. In this study, we sought to determine whether deregulated expression of tristetrapolin (TTP), a negative posttranscriptional regulator of c-Myc, confers resistance to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-beta1 on liver cancer cells.Methods:The epigenetics of TTP promoter regulation and its effects on TGF-beta1 signaling were examined in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and patient tissues.Results:TTP was down-regulated in HCC cell lines (10/11), compared with normal liver, as well as in tumor tissues (19/24) from paired HCC specimens. Methylation of a specific single CpG site located within the TGF-beta1-responsive region (TRR) of the TTP promoter was significantly associated with TTP down-regulation in both HCC cell lines and tumor tissues (r = -0.606383, P Conclusions:Abrogation of the post-transcriptional regulation of c-Myc via methylation of a specific single CpG site in the TTP promoter presents a novel mechanism for the gain of selective resistance to the antiproliferative signaling of TGF-beta1 in HCC.
