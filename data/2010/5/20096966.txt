There is a wide range of benign liver tumors that behave in very different ways and require a management strategy specifically tailored to each. The most common benign solid liver tumor is hemangioma followed by focal nodular hyperplasia; the most common cystic tumor is the simple cyst. Most of these tumors are asymptomatic and are discovered as incidental findings on imaging tests performed for other reasons. Usually, no treatment or follow-up is required. The differential diagnosis with malignant liver tumors is sometimes difficult. This difficulty, together with the presence of symptoms or complications, is the main reason for surgical resection.
