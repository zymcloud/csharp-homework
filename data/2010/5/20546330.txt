Aim:To evaluate changes in liver function parameters and risk factors 1 year after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Subjects in this retrospective study comprised 45 patients with HCC who underwent RFA therapy (RFA alone, n = 25; transcatheter arterial embolization therapy before RFA, n = 20) and showed no recurrence of HCC 1 year after RFA. Serial changes in serum total bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time and Child-Pugh score (CPs) were evaluated before and after RFA. In addition, Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to clarify risk factors for aggravation of liver function after RFA therapy.Results:Serum albumin levels showed a significant decrease from before (3.6 +/- 0.4 g/dL) to 12 months after RFA therapy (3.2 +/- 0.4 g/dL; P Conclusion:Liver function parameters, particularly serum albumin level, gradually and dominantly decreased in HCC patients with grade B and C according to the CPs classification over the course of 1 year after RFA therapy. A CPs of 9 or more represents a major risk factor for the aggravation of liver function after RFA therapy.
