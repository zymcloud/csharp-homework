Aims:Hepatic recurrence following resection of liver metastases occurs in about half of the patients. This is attributed to insufficient margins by some authors, while others accuse the presence of occult tumor cell dissemination.Methods:Representative samples of the hepatic margin of 32 patients were examined. Clinicopathologic parameters of the primary tumors of metastatic lesions as well as the width of hepatic resection margin and postoperative adjuvant therapies were recorded.Results:Occult tumor cells were identified in 18 patients (56%). Postoperative adjuvant therapy was associated with longer relapse-free survival.Conclusions:Immunohistochemical detection of occult tumor cells is feasible and a frequent finding in the remaining tissue after hepatic metastasectomy.
