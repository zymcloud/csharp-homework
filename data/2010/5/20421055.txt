Background:Combined resection of both the liver and pancreas for malignancy remains a controversial procedure. To many, the need for such an extended procedure implies an extent of disease that is usually not amenable to surgical control, and the extent of the procedure exposes the patients to substantial operative risks. The purpose of this study was to assess our results with combined resection of the liver and pancreas.Study design:Forty patients underwent combined liver and pancreas resection from 1996 to 2009. Patient ages ranged from 39 to 69 years (mean 53 years). Underlying diagnoses were neuroendocrine tumor (13), cholangiocarcinoma (13), gallbladder carcinoma (9), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (3), colorectal cancer (1), and metastatic ocular melanoma (1). Pancreatic resections included 26 pancreaticoduodenectomies (PD) and 14 distal pancreatic resections. Liver resections included 18 trisectionectomies (13 right, 5 left), 10 lobectomies (8 right, 2 left), and 12 segmental resections.Results:There was no perioperative mortality. One patient who underwent PD with right trisegmentectomy for gallbladder cancer developed postoperative liver failure that improved with supportive management. Two patients developed bile leaks that resolved with conservative management. One patient developed a pancreatic leak/hemorrhage and required a completion pancreatectomy. Mean hospital stay was 14 days (range 7 to 42 days). Median follow-up was 30 months (range 3 to 76 months). Patients undergoing resection for neuroendocrine tumors had a better 5-year survival than those with hepatobiliary malignancies (100% vs 37% p = 0.01).Conclusions:Combined resection of the liver and pancreas can be performed safely. The need for combined partial hepatectomy and pancreatectomy to remove malignancy should not be considered a contraindication to resection in selected patients.
