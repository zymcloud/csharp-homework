Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are present in bone marrow and other tissues such as adipose tissue, muscle, pancreas, liver, and so on. Recent evidence suggests that MSC migrate to sites of infection, inflammation, and cancer, and interact with different immune cell subsets. Here, we report for the first time on the isolation and characterization of multipotent nasal mucosa-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (nm-MSC). nm-MSC showed a plastic adherent and fibroblast-like morphology and were able to form colonies. They expressed the typical bone marrow MSC marker antigens CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105 and were able to differentiate along the adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic pathways. nm-MSC produced a set of inflammatory cytokines, expressed chemokine receptors, and were responsive to stimulation with cytokines, chemokines, and TLR4 ligand LPS. Thus, these cells may serve as an alternative adult stromal cell resource for regenerative tissue repair and may represent important regulators of local mucosal immunity.
