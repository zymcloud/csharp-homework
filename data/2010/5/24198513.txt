Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy that has a poor prognosis because it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. HCC normally develops as a consequence of underlying liver disease and is most often associated with cirrhosis. Surgical resection and liver transplantation are the current best options to treat liver cancer. However, problems associated with liver transplantation, such as shortage of donors, risk of immune rejection, and tissue damage following surgery provided the impetus for development of alternative therapies. The emerging field of stem cell therapy has raised hopes for finding curative options for liver cancer. Stem cells have the ability not only to proliferate after transplantation but also to differentiate into most mammalian cell types in vivo. In this review, progress on stem cell-derived technologies for the treatment of liver cancer is discussed.
