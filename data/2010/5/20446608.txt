We reported a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with needle tract implantation of the right thoracic wall, which were strongly suspected to have been caused by percutaneous needle biopsy performed at the former hospital to diagnose HCC in September 2001. He visited our hospital at his age of 68 and underwent transcatheter arterial embolization in February 2002. In November 2007, a right 9th intercostal tumor measuring 20 x 15 mm was found on his computed tomography (CT) scan. He underwent resection of the right thoracic wall tumor in January 2008. Pathological diagnosis of the tumor was well differentiated HCC. Twenty one months after surgery, he remains alive without recurrence.
