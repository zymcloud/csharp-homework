Purpose:To develop a quantitative multiparametric PROPELLER (periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach and its application in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) chemically induced rodent model of hepatocarcinogenesis for lesion characterization.Materials and methods:In nine rats with 33 cirrhosis-associated hepatic nodules including regenerative nodule (RN), dysplastic nodule (DN), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and cyst, multiparametric PROPELLER MRI (diffusion-weighted, T2/M0 (proton density) mapping and T1-weighted) were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, T2 and M0 maps of each tumor were generated. We compared ADC, T2, and M0 measurements for each type of hepatic nodule, confirmed at histopathology.Results:PROPELLER images and resultant parametric maps were inherently coregistered without image distortion or motion artifacts. All types of hepatic nodules demonstrated complex imaging characteristics within conventional T1- and T2-weighted images. Quantitatively, cysts were distinguished from RN, DN, and HCC with significantly higher ADC and T2; however, there was no significant difference of ADC and T2 between HCC, DN, and RN. Mean tumor M0 values of HCC were significantly higher than those of DN, RN, and cysts.Conclusion:This study exploited quantitative PROPELLER MRI and multidimensional analysis approaches in an attempt to differentiate hepatic nodules in the DEN rodent model of hepatocarcinogenesis. This method offers great potential for parallel parameterization during noninvasive interrogation of hepatic tissue properties.
