Purpose:Chemoprevention is an effective approach to control hepatocarcinogenesis. Bacoside A, the active constituent of Bacopa monniera Linn., is anticipated to play a role in chemoprevention of liver cancer.Methods:In the present study, we investigated the chemopreventive effect of bacoside A against N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in an animal model.Results:Administration of carcinogen showed a significant elevation in the levels of lipid peroxidation, serum tumor marker enzymes and liver injury marker enzymes with subsequent decrease in the levels of both hemolysate and liver antioxidant status. Bacoside A co-treatment maintained the N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced alterations at near normal level. Histopathological and electron microscopic study of the liver tissue also supports the above biochemical observations.Conclusions:From our findings we conclude that bacoside A is effective to prevent DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma by quenching lipid peroxidation and enhancing antioxidant status through free radical scavenging mechanism and having potential of protecting endogenous enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activity.
