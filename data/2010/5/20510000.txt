Objective:To investigate the expression of integrin beta 1 in hepatic cirrhosis (HC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The expression of integrin beta 1 in HCC, HC and normal liver tissues was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The association between the integrin beta 1 expression and clinical pathological features were analyzed.Results:(1) The levels of integrin beta 1 mRNA and protein in the HCC (1.30+/-0.24, 90.50+/-33.50) and HC (1.58+/-0.31, 123.10+/-38.90) were much higher than that in the normal hepatic tissue (0.37+/-0.08, 11.90+/-6.00) (P less than 0.05). (2) The expression of integrin beta 1 was associated with HC (r = 0.692), Edmondson pathologic grade (F = 13.618), encapsulation (F = 17.857) and metastasis (F = 38.857) (P less than 0.01).Conclusions:Integrin beta 1 may play an important role in the development of hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
