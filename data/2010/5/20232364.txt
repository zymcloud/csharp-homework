Frequent intrahepatic metastasis causes early tumor recurrence and dismaying prognosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We recently identified overexpression of stathmin1 (STMN1) in human HCC. This study was designed to elucidate the clinical and biological significance of overexpression of STMN1 in HCC. Expression of STMN1 was conducted by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting assays on 58 pairs of HCC and para-tumor liver tissues from patients with HCC along with normal liver tissues as the controls. Association of STMN1 overexpression with tumor recurrence and prognosis was investigated by Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival and Cox Regression analyses. Roles of STMN1 in cell cycle, cell motility, and invasion were determined by in vitro assays. STMN1 overexpression in hepatoma was strongly associated with local invasion (P = 0.031), early recurrence (P = 0.002), and poor prognosis (P = 0.005), and was an independent indicator for tumor recurrence (P = 0.0045). STMN1 overexpression further identified subgroups of HCC patients with higher tumor recurrence and worse prognosis among HCC patients with early tumor stage (T1) or intermediate histological grades (G2 and G3), both of whom represent the majority of HCC patients receiving primary curative hepatectomy. Silencing STMN1 expression via RNA interference suppressed invasion activity, while ectopic expression of STMN1 enhanced cell invasion and caused polyploidy of cells. In conclusion, STMN1 overexpression could predict early tumor recurrence and poor prognosis, particularly at early stage of hepatoma. Overexpression of STMN1 promoted polyploidy formation, tumor-cell invasion, and intrahepatic metastasis, suggesting that STMN1 can be a target for anti-cancer therapy of human hepatoma.
