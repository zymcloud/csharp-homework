Objective:Malignancy is the leading cause of death among heart-transplant recipients. There is a higher incidence of post-transplant malignancy in heart-transplant recipients than in kidney-transplant recipients. This study sought to assess the incidence of malignancy in heart-transplant recipients in Taiwan.Methods:This is a retrospective chart review.Results:From 1987 to 2008, 291 patients who underwent heart transplantation and survived for more than 1 month were enrolled. Seventeen patients (5.8%) developed de novo malignancies including skin cancers (three), post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (seven) and solid-organ malignancies (seven). Solid-organ malignancies affected prostate, liver, urinary bladder, kidney, lung, larynx, pancreas and brain in seven patients. Malignancy was responsible for 7% and 13% of all death for heart-transplant recipients who lived for more than 1 year and more than 5 years. The cumulative incidence of 1.03% at 1 year, 4.2% at 5 years and 8.1% at 10 years in our patients was much lower than the incidences reported in the multicentre registry of the International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation and in the Western series. The incidence was especially low for skin cancers. Compared with previous reports of kidney-transplant recipients in Taiwan, the incidence of post-transplant malignancy was not significantly increased.Conclusions:The incidence of post-transplant malignancy was low in Chinese heart-transplant recipients compared with heart-transplant recipients in Western countries. It resulted from a relative rarity of skin cancers in the Chinese population.
