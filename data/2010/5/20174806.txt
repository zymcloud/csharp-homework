Background:There are few detailed clinical reports about perihepatic lymph node (LN) assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the incidence, site, and impact on survival of LN metastasis in patients with HCC amenable to curative liver resection and routine regional lymphadenectomy.Methods:From January 2001 to June 2004, a total of 523 HCC patients undergoing curative hepatic resection and routine regional lymphadenectomy were included in this study. The incidence, site of LN metastasis in HCC patients, and its influence on survival were analyzed.Results:A total of 3433 lymph nodes were dissected from the 523 patients enrolled in this study and examined by pathologists. Among these patients, LN metastasis was found in 39 (7.45%) patients. Hepatic pedicle, retropancreatic space, and common hepatic artery stations were conventionally removed. The incidence of LN metastasis in the hepatic pedicle station was higher than that in the other stations (p Conclusions:Lymph node metastasis in patients with HCC is closely related to a lower survival rate. Regional lymph node dissection should always be performed to determine the precise stage of the disease. Hepatic resection with regional lymphadenectomy is a safe procedure in patients with HCC.
