Background:First-line treatment for Methods:We examined post-treatment survival of 144 consecutive HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy and of 56 consecutive HCC patients who underwent thermal ablation therapy limited to the HCC (Results:Pretreatment liver function was significantly worse and prevalence of Child-Pugh classification B/C was significantly higher in the ablation group compared to the hepatectomy group. Prevalence of tumor recurrence after treatment did not differ significantly between groups, irrespective of solitary or multiple HCC. In solitary HCC, overall survival rates in both groups did not differ significantly. Even in Child-Pugh B patients, survival was not significantly different between hepatectomy and ablation. In HCC with 2-3 lesions Conclusion:In cases of multiple small HCCs, hepatic resection is recommended over local ablation therapy as the first-line treatment in cases where liver function has been preserved.
