epi-Androsterone 1 was converted into its hydrazone derivative through the reaction with hydrazine hydrate 80%. Hydrazonoandrostane derivative 2b reacted with hydrazonoyl halides in the presence of K(2)CO(3) forming the corresponding hydrazopyridazinoandrostane derivatives 6a-d. The 3Î²-acetyl-17-hydrazonoandrostane derivative 2b reacted with a halogen reagent, benzoyl chloride, to form the non-cyclic 16-benzoylated hydrazone 9. On the other hand, compound 2b produced the corresponding pyridazinoandrostane derivatives 11 and 12 via its reaction with phenacyl bromide and chloroacetone respectively. Reaction of the hydrazono derivative 2b with benzaldehyde in the presence of acetic acid drops led to the formation of the benzylidenehydrazonoandrostane derivative 13. The product 14, phosphinom-ethylenehydrazonoandrostane was obtained by the reaction of the derivative 13 with trisdimethylaminophosphine in the presence of dry benzene. The reaction of compound 2b with phenyl isothiocyanate followed by boiling in chloroacetic acid or thioglycolic acid produced the pyrazoloandrostane derivatives 17 and 18 respectively. The biological activity of compounds 6a, 6d, 11, 12, and 15 was evaluated as inhibitor of growth in a human liver carcinoma cell line and doxorubicine was used for comparison. Compounds 15 and 12 showed a higher potency than the other tested compounds.
