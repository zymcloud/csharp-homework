Objective:The purpose of the study was to explore the antitumor effect of docetaxel-loaded lipid microbubbles combined with ultrasound-targeted microbubble activation (UTMA) on VX2 rabbit liver tumors.Methods:Docetaxel-loaded lipid microbubbles were made by a mechanical vibration technique. VX2 liver tumor models were established in 90 rabbits, which were randomly divided into 6 groups, including control, docetaxal-loaded lipid microbubbles alone, docetaxal alone, docetaxal combined with ultrasound, pure lipid microbubbles combined with ultrasound, and docetaxel-loaded lipid microbubbles combined with ultrasound (DOC+MB/US). The tumor volume and inhibition rate (IR) of tumor growth were calculated and compared. Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxyuridine nick end labeling. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Caspase 3 and MMP2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was detected by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The tumor metastasis rate and survival time of the animals were compared.Results:The IR and apoptotic index of the DOC+MB/US group were the highest among all groups, and the proliferating labeling index was the lowest. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 protein and mRNA expression in the DOC+MB/US group was the lowest among all groups, and caspase 3 mRNA expression in the DOC+MB/US group was the highest. The extensive metastasis rate in the DOC+MB/US group was the lowest, and the survival time of the animals in the DOC+MB/US group was the longest.Conclusions:Docetaxel-loaded lipid microbubbles combined with UTMA could inhibit the growth of VX2 rabbit liver tumors by deferring proliferation and promoting apoptosis, which may provide a novel targeted strategy for chemotherapy of liver carcinoma.
