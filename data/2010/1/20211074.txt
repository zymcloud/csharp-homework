Objective:To investigate the potential prognostic factors for patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with different modes of therapy.Methods:The clinicopathological data of 300 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancers were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed.Results:The median survival of patients with recurrence (MSR) treated with complete and palliative resection of liver metastases and unresectable patients was 48, 19 and 18 months, respectively (P = 0.000). In patients with unresectable liver metastases, systemic chemotherapy plus regional therapy demonstrated a median survival time of 23 months, significantly longer than the 6 months in untreated patients (P = 0.000). Patients who showed response to the first-line therapy demonstrated an improved survival versus the patients who had no response, with a median survival time of 24 vs. 16 months (P = 0.000). Univariate analysis revealed that resection modes of primary diseases and liver metastases, treatment modality for liver metastases, and response to first-line therapy were prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis showed that resection modes of liver metastases, multimodality treatment after liver metastases, and the response to first-line therapy were all independent prognostic factors for patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.Conclusion:Resection of liver metastases, multimodality treatment after liver metastases, and response to first-line chemotherapy are all independent prognostic factors for patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
