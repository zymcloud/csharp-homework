Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is becoming an important public health concern. Current therapeutic options are limited and new treatments are therefore being developed. The intra-arterial treatment chemoembolization has limited efficacy and few prospects for further progress. One particularly promising, though little used, alternative to chemoembolization is radioembolization with iodine-131 ((131)I) or rhenium-188 labeled lipiodol or yttrium-90 labeled microspheres (glass or resin beads). Three randomized studies have proven the effectiveness of (131)I-lipiodol in patients with HCC-as adjuvant therapy after surgery, compared with chemoembolization, and also in patients who have portal vein thrombosis. Microspheres enable the delivery of high-dose radiation (>200 Gy) to the tumor while sparing the neighboring hepatic tissue from overexposure. Overall, the efficacy of radioembolization has been good and toxic effects have been low. These results are comparable to those obtained with chemoembolization but further improvement can be expected by combining radioembolization with standard chemotherapy or with targeted therapies, such as anti-angiogenic drugs.
