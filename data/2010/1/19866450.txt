Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) has been well characterized in native livers, but to our knowledge, no cases of FNH have been described in liver allografts. We review the clinicopathological features of 6 FNHs identified in 4 patients after orthotopic liver transplantation. There were 3 male patients and 1 female patient ranging in age from 2 to 63 years. The time from transplant to a diagnosis of FNH ranged from 15 to 118 months. Two patients presented with an incidental solitary liver nodule. One patient presented with 2 liver nodules, and the other patient initially presented with 1 liver nodule and was found to have another nodule at autopsy 6 years later. Two FNHs were seen as an incidental finding at autopsy, and the other 4 were initially identified on ultrasound. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans revealed features atypical for FNH and suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma. The initial diagnosis of FNH was made by needle core biopsy in 3 cases and at autopsy in 2 cases. The lesions ranged in size from 1.7 to 6.9 cm. Three patients had conditions associated with altered hepatic vascular perfusion; 2 patients had portal vein thrombosis, and 1 had a partial allograft from a living donor. In conclusion, FNH can present as a hepatic nodule after orthotopic liver transplantation and should not be confused with hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of altered hepatic circulation in the posttransplant liver, a diagnosis of FNH would not be unexpected. FNH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hepatic nodules within the posttransplant liver, especially in patients with known hepatic vascular perfusion abnormalities.
