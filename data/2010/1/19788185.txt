Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) appears to progress more rapidly in males than in females, and CHB-related hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are predominately diseases that tend to occur in men and postmenopausal women. To obtain more insight into the underlying mechanisms of gender disparity of CHB progress, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis was employed to compare liver proteome of C57BL/6 and HBV transgenic (HBV-Tg) mice both in male and female groups. We identified 8 differently expressed proteins in male HBV-Tg mice and 12 in female HBV-Tg mice. Apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) was found to be down-regulated in male and female HBV-Tg mouse liver. It is more interesting that the pattern of liver Apo A-I isoforms was altered in male HBV-Tg mice but not in female HBV-Tg mice. Our further results indicated that the basic Apo A-I isoform, based on pI positions from serum 2-dimensional Western blotting, increased in male CHB patient sera but not in female CHB patient sera. Finally, we identified that the oxidative modification Apo A-I mainly reside in basic isoform. This pattern of selectively modified Apo A-I isoforms may be considered as a pathological hallmark that may extend our knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of CHB progression.
