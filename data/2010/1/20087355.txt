Background:Stage IV colorectal cancer encompasses a broad patient population in which both curative and palliative management strategies may be used. In a phase II study primarily designed to assess the efficacy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin, we were able to prospectively examine the outcomes of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer according to the baseline resectability status.Methods:At enrolment, patients were stratified into three subgroups according to the resectability of liver disease and treatment intent: palliative chemotherapy (subgroup A), conversion therapy (subgroup B) or neoadjuvant therapy (subgroup C). All patients received chemotherapy with capecitabine 2000 mg m(-2) on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin 130 mg m(-2) on day 1 repeated every 3 weeks. Imaging was repeated every four cycles where feasible liver resection was undertaken after four or eight cycles of chemotherapy.Results:Of 128 enrolled patients, 74, 22 and 32 were stratified into subgroups A, B and C, respectively. Attempt at curative liver resection was undertaken in 10 (45%) patients in subgroup B and 19 (59%) in subgroup C. The median overall survival was 14.6, 24.5 and 52.9 months in subgroups A, B and C, respectively. For patients in subgroups B and C who underwent an attempt at curative resection, 3-year progression-free survival was 10% in subgroup B and 37% for subgroup C.Conclusions:This prospective study shows the wide variation in outcome according to baseline resectability status and highlights the potential clinical value of a modified staging system to distinguish between these patient subgroups.
