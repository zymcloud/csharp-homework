The principal aim of the present study consisted in the identification of the disregulated proteins associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The differences in protein expression between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the corresponding non-HCC liver tissues were investigated in a cohort of 20 patients using two-dimensional fluorescence difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). The up- and down-regulated protein spots that exhibited 1.5-fold difference signal intensity with statistical significance (p
