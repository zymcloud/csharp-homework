Purpose:The aim of the study was to investigate the ability of contrast-enhanced sonography (CEUS) with the contrast agent SonoVue to differentiate between benign and malignant focal liver lesions.Methods:In a prospective study, we examined 317 patients (204 males, 113 females, aged 59 +/- 12 years) with focal liver lesions detected by B-mode gray-scale sonography. After intravenous injection of 1.2 mL SonoVue, the liver was examined continuously for 3 minutes using low-MI sonography with contrast-specific software. Final diagnosis was established by histopathology, CT, MRI, or HIDA-scintigraphy.Results:Two hundred nine patients had malignant focal lesions, including 107 hepatocellular carcinomas, 70 metastases, 26 cholangiocellular carcinomas, and 6 other types of malignancy. One hundred eight patients had benign focal lesions, including 30 regenerative nodules, 30 hemangiomas, 13 cases of focal nodular hyperplasia, 12 abscesses, 8 cases of necrosis, 7 cases of focal steatosis areas, and 8 other benign lesions. Hypoenhancement or no enhancement in the late phase was found in 91% of the malignant lesions but in only 37% of the benign lesions (p Conclusion:CEUS is helpful in the differentiation between benign and malignant focal liver lesions.
