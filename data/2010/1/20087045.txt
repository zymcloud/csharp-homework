The patient was a 63-year-old male admitted for further evaluation of the bleeding esophageal tumor. Endoscopic biopsy revealed small cell carcinoma. CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated nodular enlargement at the celiac axis. Under diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the esophagus at Stage IVa, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FP (5-FU+CDDP) was given. Immediately after fluid load, levels of serum sodium decreased to 117 mEq/L and persisted during chemotherapy treatment despite aggressive corrections. Response and shrinkage of the distant nodal metastases were confirmed, and an esophagectomy was conducted. Pathological examination with IHC demonstrated positive staining for CD56, NSE and synaptophysin but negative for ADH. Lymph node and liver metastases recurred. Progression of the disease again triggered hyponatremia.
