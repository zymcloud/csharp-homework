Background:The authors successfully adopted an interesting and effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) referred to as angiographic subsegmentectomy (AS). This treatment involved simultaneous embolization of the peripheral feeding artery and the portal vein. The result was that almost all of the HCC and peripheral liver parenchyma developed complete anatomic necrosis.Methods:To determine the effectiveness of this method, the authors retrospectively studied the local recurrence rates of 49 solitary HCCs and the long-term survival rates of 120 patients with HCC between 2000 and 2008.Results:The results indicated that, in 31 small, solitary HCCs (Conclusions:AS should be investigated further as potential first-line therapy for the treatment of patients with stage I and II HCC.
