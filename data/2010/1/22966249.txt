Peliosis hepatis-like blood-filled cavities are frequently observed in the tumors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This finding is generally referred to as 'peliotic change' in HCC. However, the clinicopathological features of HCC with peliotic change (PHCC) are not fully understood. These issues are addressed in the present study. Among 294 consecutively surgically resected HCCs, the clinicopathological features of PHCC were compared with those of a common type of HCC (control). PHCC was observed in 116 (39.5%) of 294 HCCs. The mean tumor diameter of 3.4±0.9 cm of the PHCC group was significantly larger than that of the 2.5±0.9 cm of the control, and the incidence of PHCC was related to increased tumor diameter. In the 116 PHCCs, the tumors were completely or incompletely encapsulated. On ultrasonography, PHCCs showed hyperechoic and/or mosaic patterns. The mean diameter of 3.5±0.8 cm of PHCCs with a hyperechoic and/or mosaic pattern was significantly larger than that of 2.3±0.9 cm in the control. In conclusion, it is necessary for clinicians and pathologists to discern the characteristics of peliotic change as a morphological feature that modifies ultrasound findings.
