Focal nodular hyperplasia is a polyclonal hyperplasia of liver cells as a result of locally enhanced blood flow because of vessel malformations. Only symptomatic FNH is an indication for resection or enucleation. In contrast to FNH growth of adenoma is dependent on sexual hormones. Solitary HNFalpha-inactivated and inflammatory adenomas larger than 5 cm should be removed because of risk of tumor rupture or bleeding, while beta-catenin mutated adenomas should be surgically removed at any stage because of risk of malignant transformation. The prognosis of patients with HCC is dependent on the tumor stage, but also on the liver function. Resection is the treatment of choice for HCC in patients without liver cirrhosis. Patients with liver cirrhosis and early HCC without extrahepatic metastasis can be successfully treated by liver transplantation. If transplantation is not possible these tumors should be removed by local percutaneous ablation. Transarterial chemoembolization is an effective treatment for more advanced HCC in patients with good liver function. Studies showed that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib significantly improves survival of patients with advanced or metastatic HCC in child A cirrhosis. The only curative option for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas is surgical resection. Patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinomas should be treated with a chemotherapy consisting of Gemcitabine-Cisplatin-combination.
