Purpose:To assess the value of CT-perfusion in determining the quantitative vascularization features of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients.Materials and methods:A total of 35 cirrhotic patients with single histologically proven HCC not exceeding 3cm in diameter underwent conventional triple-phase multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) examination. All patients were also examined with CT-perfusion (CTp) technique after i.v. injection of 50mL of iodinated contrast. Data were analyzed using a dedicated software which generated a quantitative map of liver parenchyma perfusion. The following parameters were assessed: hepatic perfusion (HP); blood volume (BV); arterial perfusion (AP); time to peak (TTP) and hepatic perfusion index (HPI). Univariate Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis.Results:In the 35 HCCs evaluated, the following quantitative data were obtained: HP (mL/s/100g): median=47.0 (1(st)qt=35.5; 3(st)qt=61.2); BV (mL/100mg): median=22.5 (1(st)qt=18.4; 3(st)qt=27.7); AP (mL/min): median=42.9 (1(st)qt=35.8; 3(st)qt=55.6); HPI(%): median=75.3 (1(st)qt=63.1; 3(st)qt=100); TTP(s): median=18.7 (1(st)qt=16.8; 3(st)qt=24.5). Perfusion values calculated in cirrhotic liver parenchyma were HP: median=10.3 (1(st)qt=9.1; 3(st)qt=13.2); BV: median=11.7 (1(st)qt=9.6; 3(st)qt=15.5); AP: median=10.4 (1(st)qt=8.6; 3(st)qt=11.3); HPI: median=17.5 (1(st)qt=14.3; 3(st)qt=19.7); TTP: median=44.6 (1(st)qt=40.3; 3(st)qt=50.1). HP, BV, HPI and AP were found to be significantly higher in HCC lesion than in liver parenchyma (pConclusion:CT-perfusion technique allows obtaining quantitative information about tumor-related vascularization of early HCC, in patients with liver cirrhosis.
