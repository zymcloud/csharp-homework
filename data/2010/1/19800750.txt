There are no reports of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating postradiotherapy cholangitis. We report the case of a 45-year-old patient who had undergone upper abdominal radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, 21 years before, which was complicated years later by cholangitis with stricture of the common bile duct. Biliodigestive anastomosic surgery was scheduled due to recurrent angiocholitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma was discovered. The patient died from carcinoma some months later.
