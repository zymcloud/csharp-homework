Iron accumulation in the liver is considered to be a co-factor for progression of liver disease. Iron overload can enhance the effects of oxidative stress and influence the natural history of patients with cirrhosis, exposing them to a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. The results of clinical studies designed to assess the impact of liver iron content on the risk of tumor development have remained controversial for some time. It is known that common factors can affect both liver iron overload and the risk of cancer, necessitating multivariate analyses of these features in large cohorts of cirrhotic patients. Furthermore, the causes and consequences of hepatic iron overload appear to depend on the cause of the underlying liver disease. Thus, the only solid evidence of a relationship between liver iron overload and event occurrence has come from longitudinal studies conducted in homogeneous cohorts of patients with cirrhosis. So far, the available data suggest that iron accumulation in the liver is an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and/or nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis, but not in those with viral hepatitis C cirrhosis.
