Aims:Evasion of apoptosis is a feature of cancer cells. As a mechanism of apoptosis inactivation in cancer cells, somatic mutations of pro-apoptotic genes have been reported in many cancers. Caspase-10 is an initiation-phase caspase, and somatic mutation of CASP10 that encodes caspase-10 has been found in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and gastric carcinoma.Methods:The aim of this study was to explore whether CASP10 gene is somatically mutated in colon, breast, lung, and hepatocellular carcinomas. We analysed the entire coding region and all splice sites of CASP10 in 47 colon, 47 breast, 47 lung, and 47 hepatocellular carcinomas by a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay.Results:We found two CASP10 mutations in the colon cancers (2/47; 4.3%), but none in breast, lung or hepatocellular carcinomas. One mutation [c.41A > C (p.Lys14Thr)] was a missense mutation, while the other was a substitution mutation in a splice site (c.684 + 4G > A). The colon cancer with the CASP10 missense mutation harboured additional CASP gene mutations (CASP3, 7 and 8).Conclusion:Our data indicate that somatic mutation of CASP10 is rare in colon, breast, lung, and hepatocellular carcinomas. However, the data also suggest that CASP10 mutation might contribute to the pathogenesis of some colon carcinomas together with other CASP gene mutations.
