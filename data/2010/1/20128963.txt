Objective:To compare the metastatic characteristics of HCCLM3 cells and SMCC-7721 cells in nude mice model.Methods:Nude mice were divided into two groups (n = 8, each), mice were transplanted with HCCLM3 cells (group A) and SMMC-7721 cells (group B). Tumor size, metastasis rate and other clinical parameters were compared between the two groups. Statistical analysis was performed with the help of SPSS 16.0 for Windows computer software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results:Intrahepatic metastases rate was 100% (8 / 8), mean intrahepatic primary tumor volume was (6954+/-1945) mm(3) in group A, Intrahepatic metastases rate was 62.5% (5/8), and mean intrahepatic primary tumor volume was (6034+/-2035) mm(3) in the group B. There was no statistical difference in the primary liver tumor size and intrahepatic metastases rate (P = 0.20; t = 6.38, P = 0.37, respectively). The numbers of intrahepatic metastases and the involved lobes, and the volume of tumor were 4.5 (median), 3, and 975 mm(3) (median) respectively, in group A, and these were 1 (median), 1 and 274 mm(3) (median) respectively in group B. The difference between two groups was statistically significant (Z values, -2.818, -2.289, and -1.975, respectively).The rate of lung metastasis and other organ metastasis in the A group was significantly higher than that in group B (P less than 0.001, P less than 0.041, respectively).Conclusion:HCCLM3 cells have higher metastatic potential than SMMC-7721 cells in nude mice.
