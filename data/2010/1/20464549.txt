Many types of pulp and paper mill effluents have the ability to induce mixed-function oxygenase (MFO) activity and vitellogenin (VTG) protein in exposed male fish. The search for the compounds responsible for MFO induction has led to several classes of compounds, among them retene and stilbenes. The objective of this study was to investigate the biological activities of candidate stilbene compounds. Three stilbenes, 3,5-dihydroxystilbene (pinosylvin; P1), 3-hydroxy-5-methoxystilbene (P2), and 3,5-dimethoxystilbene (P3), were extracted from Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris) and purified to evaluate their ability to induce MFO activity in vitro using ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in a rat hepatoma cell line (H4IIE). As these compounds may be chlorinated during pulp bleaching, chlorination of P2 was undertaken, producing di- and trichlorinated isomers (Cl-P2), which were also tested. Compounds were tested for EROD-inducing ability in vivo by exposing juvenile rainbow tout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to waterborne concentrations (0.010 to 1.0 mg/L) for 4 days. Compounds were also tested for their ability to induce VTG in trout primary liver cells in vitro. The stilbenes were weak inducers of EROD and VTG. H4IIE EROD was induced by all four compounds, with the most potent induction by P3, followed by P1, the Cl-P2 mixture, and then P2. Induction for all four stilbenes was from 3.13 × 10⁻³ to 3.57 × 10⁻⁴ as potent as retene and about 1.11 × 10⁻⁵ to 1.20 × 10⁻⁶ as potent as TCDD. Juvenile rainbow trout did not show EROD induction after exposures to P1, P2, or the Cl-P2 mixture, whereas P3 caused activity fourfold above that of controls. P1, P3, and Cl-P2 all weakly induced VTG in rainbow trout hepatocytes. The most potent inducer of VTG was Cl-P2, followed by P3 and P1. The results show the ability of wood-derived stilbenes to cause weak MFO induction in fish and in rat liver cells and to weakly induce vitellogenin in fish liver cells.
