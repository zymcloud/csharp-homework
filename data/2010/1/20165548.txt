Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EH) is a rare vascular neoplasm. An accurate radiologic diagnosis is usually difficult due to the presence of multiple nodules, simulating metastatic carcinoma. Though histologic features of this tumor are well described, cytologic reports of hepatic EH are very few in the available literature. We describe a case of a young healthy adult male who was found to have multiple hepatic masses on radiologic investigations. A guided fine needle aspiration demonstrated a poorly differentiated neoplasm. The diagnosis was made on core biopsy assisted by immunohistochemistry, which showed characteristic features of EH. He is doing well 14 months after diagnosis, without surgical excision or chemotherapy. An accurate diagnosis of hepatic EH on aspiration cytology requires an adequate specimen and awareness of its cytologic features, including discohesive atypical cells with intracytoplasmic lumina and intranuclear inclusions. Since this tumor is usually unresectable but has a favorable prognosis as compared to hepatocellular carcinoma, a correct diagnosis is essential for appropriate management and prognostication.
