Objective:The purpose of this article is to illustrate the characteristic changes induced in different tumor types by the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib.Conclusion:Sorafenib reduces tumor perfusion and thereby induces necrosis and often hemorrhage. Malignant tumors treated with sorafenib undergo both morphologic and functional changes; however, the morphologic changes are less frequent and inadequate for early evaluation of response. Therefore, imaging tools accurately assessing hemorrhage and decrease in tumor perfusion with subsequent necrosis should be the mainstay in monitoring targeted therapy agents.
