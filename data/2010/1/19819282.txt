To compare immunologic phenotypes between (1) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and a healthy population and (2) more advanced and early stage HCC patients, we studied 45 HCC patients and 46 healthy controls from January 2006 to January 2008. Using fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, HCC patients were demonstrated to exhibit stronger phagocytosis of granulocytes and monocytes and more peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the G2/M phase compared with healthy volunteers. By contrast, lower percentages of B and T(h) lymphocytes were also found in the peripheral blood of HCC patients than in the healthy population. Most importantly, a higher percentage of B cells was found in patients with advanced HCC than in those with early HCC in terms of TNM stage (II and III vs I, p = 0.004), the Japanese Integrated Scoring system (2-3 vs 0-1, p = 0.0235), and tumor numbers (> or =2 vs 1, p = 0.005). In conclusion, our findings suggested that HCC patients might exhibit enhanced innate immunity and reduced adaptive immunity compared with healthy volunteers. A higher percentage of B cells was found in patients with more advanced HCC compared with patients with early stage HCC, which might serve as an indicator of the severity of HCC.
