The substitution of amino acid (aa) 70 of arginine for glutamine and/or that of aa91 of leucine for methionine in the core protein in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b is associated with a poor response to pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Factors influencing these substitutions were sought in 1,097 patients infected with HCV-1b who had not received antiviral treatment. HCV variants with Arg70 and Leu91 (wild-type) decreased, while those with Gln70 and/or Met91 (mutant types) increased with age (P or = 58 IU/L) and gamma-GTP (> or =61 IU/L), and decreased albumin levels ( or =61 IU/L (1.647 [1.268-2.139]) increased the risk for the Gln70 variant. In conclusion, the substitution of amino aa70 of Arg for Gln in patients infected with HCV-1b increases with age, and it is associated with severe liver disease accompanied by elevated AST and gamma-GTP levels, as well as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
