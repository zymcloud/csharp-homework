T-helper (Th)17 cells, a new population of effector CD4(+) T cells, are characterized by the secretion of interleukin (IL)-17. It has been demonstrated that Th17 cells are distinct from Th1 and Th2 cells; they play important roles in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases; and are closely related to host defense, tumorigenesis and transplant rejection. Moreover, it has been found that these cells have a close and intricate connection with the regulatory T cells, which play an important role in maintaining self-tolerance and down-tuning immune responses. In the present review, we find that they are significantly elevated in various kinds of liver diseases including liver autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases, alcoholic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.
