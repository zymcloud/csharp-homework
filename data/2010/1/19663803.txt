Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has gained great popularity in the treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) on cirrhosis and is replacing Percutaneous Ethanol Injection (PEI) in treating 3 cm or less HCC nodules. Its necrotic effect is more predictable than that of PEI and therefore RF can achieve a longer local tumor progression control and survival. In the last four years many data on its efficacy have been added in the Literature and long-term results on 3-5-year survival are available. In this Review article data of the last 4 years on percutaneous RF ablation of HCC on cirrhosis are discussed in order to give an answer to questions put forward on this matter at 2000 EASL Barcelona Consensus Conference. Moreover, new perspectives in the percutaneous treatment of some form of advanced HCC (the so-called percutaneous thrombectomy) are presented together with some patents in the treatment of HCC.
