Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major worldwide public health concern. Despite recent advances, there has been little success in improving the survival of HCC patients. Due to advances in diagnostic modalities and the increasing incidence of chronic viral hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both of which are well known risk factors of HCC, the prevalence of HCC is increasing in developed countries and it is expected that this trend will continue in the future. In Middle Eastern countries the prevalence of this cancer is lower compared to sub-Saharan Africa and some Far East countries; however it is documented that the prevalence of this cancer in some parts of the Middle East is also increasing. In the current review, the prevalence and burden of this disease worldwide, particularly in Middle Eastern countries, and risk factors for HCC are discussed.
