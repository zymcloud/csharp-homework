We compared the diagnostic performance of ferucarbotran-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with that of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for the preoperative detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of 27 consecutive patients (male-female, 21:6; 33-76 years) with 38 surgically proven HCCs (mean diameter, 2.8 cm; range, 0.8-10.2 cm) on a 3.0-T unit. Three observers independently reviewed each MR image in a random order on a tumor-by-tumor basis. The diagnostic accuracy of these techniques for the detection of HCC, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values was evaluated. For each observer, the values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) were 1.000, 1.000, and 0.974 for ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI and 1.000, 0.987, and 1.000 for gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, and the differences were not statistically significant between 2 techniques for each observer (P > 0.05). For each observer, sensitivities were 100%, 100%, and 92.1% for ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI and 100%, 94.7%, and 100% for gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI with no statistical significance (P > 0.005). The differences of the positive and negative predictive values of 2 techniques for each observer were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Ferucarbotran-enhanced MRI and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI show a similar diagnostic performance for the preoperative detection of HCCs.
