Uip to 20% of patients with liver cirrhosis develop hepatogenous diabetesdue to the hepatocellular functional loss and insulin resistance. Optimizing diabetic metabolic conditions is not only important to avoid typical late complications of diabetes, but also cirrhosis-associated complications e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or the occurence of hepatocellular carcinoma. So far there have beenno recommendations orguidelines for the diagnosis and treatmentof hepatogenous diabetes. The medical teatment of a diabetic condition is mainly influenced by its side effects. The risk of hypoglycemia must be considered carefully during drug treatment, especially in patients with chronic alcohol abuse. Suitable oral antidiabetics are glinides and short-acting sulfonylureas or possibly meal-related insulin administration with short-acting insulins or rapid-acting insulin analogues. Biguanide and PPAR-gamma agonists are contraindicated because of side effects in liver cirrhosis. Regarding basic treatment, an adequate daily energy and protein supply should be ensuredbecause the majority of patients with liver cirrhosis are malnourished.
