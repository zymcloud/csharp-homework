The purpose of this study was to measure the dynamics of serum α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentration in dogs with various tumors, and to investigate the localization of AGP in some tissues using immunohistochemical staining. Sera were obtained from 171 dogs bearing tumors of various types. Serum AGP concentration was measured by single radial immunodiffusion. Tumors occurring in the liver and spleen were also investigated immunohistochemically using anti-canine AGP antibody. Mean serum AGP levels were 749 ± 602 mg/L in dogs with carcinoma (n = 39), 1,014 ± 971 mg/L with sarcoma (n = 18), and 887 ± 935 mg/L with round cell tumors (n = 46), all significantly higher than serum AGP level in healthy dogs (n = 137, 364 ± 106 mg/L). Mean serum AGP levels were significantly higher than in healthy dogs in complex mammary gland carcinoma (n = 5, 876 ± 721 mg/L), malignant melanoma (n = 7, 1,010 ± 821 mg/L), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 5, 936 ± 741 mg/L) among carcinomas, hemangiosarcoma (n = 5, 1,740 ± 1,323 mg/L) among sarcomas, and lymphoma (n = 19, 1,072 ± 965 mg/L) and histiocytic tumor (n = 6, 1,800 ± 1,387 mg/L) among round cell tumors. In an immunohistochemical investigation of AGP localization, both weak and strong staining for anti-AGP antibody were seen in hepatic tissue in dogs with primary non-tumorous lesions originating in the spleen (hematoma) and elevated serum AGP, but all tumor tissue in the spleen was negative. Among dogs with primary tumor lesions of the spleen (hemangiosarcoma) and elevated serum AGP levels, both weak, moderate and strong staining for anti-AGP antibody were seen in hepatic tissue, while strong positive staining was apparent in all tumorous tissue from the spleen. In primary tumor lesions in the liver (hepatocellular carcinoma), both moderate and strong staining for anti-AGP antibody were seen in normal hepatic tissue, and both weak, moderate and strong staining were seen in tumor tissues of the liver. AGP levels thus appear to be elevated in dogs with carcinomas, sarcomas, and round cell tumors. With some of these malignant tumors, localization of AGP in tumor tissue was seen.
