Purpose:Many physicians express a relatively nihilistic approach to the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). Consensus among surgeons regarding the indications for an aggressive approach has not been reached. Current study was aimed to determine whether an aggressive approach, with an extended resection with thrombectomy and adjuvant therapy, would lead to an improved survival for HCC patients with PVTT.Methods:A retrospective review of 116 HCC patients with PVTT admitted from 1996 to 2006 was conducted. Patients were divided into 2 time-period (TP) cohorts, of them, 51 cases in the first 5 years (TP1) and 65 in the last 5 years (TP2).Results:Surgical operations were performed on 68 patients. Twenty-one surgical resections were performed in TP1 and forty-seven in TP2. The extent of liver resections, as well as the frequency of thrombectomy, was greater in TP2 (P = 0.039). During both time-periods, an aggressive therapy was associated with improved survival (P Conclusions:An aggressive approach, combining extended liver resection with thrombectomy and adjuvant therapy, leads to an improved survival in the HCC patients with PVTT.
