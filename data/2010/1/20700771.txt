Although basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common dermatological malignancy arising from sun exposed skin, BCC of the nipple is extremely rare. To our knowledge only 34 cases have been reported. We report a 78-year-old man who was undergoing chemotherapy for liver metastasis of gastric cancer 1 year after surgery. The chief complaint was exudation and oozing from the nipple. A mass lesion was palpable and detected on mammography and enhanced computed tomography, and atypical cells were detected on cytological examination. Simple resection was performed because histopathological diagnosis of an intraoperative frozen section revealed BCC. Final pathological diagnosis was also BCC. The authors report this case and review the previous reports, and discuss the clinicopathologic characteristics and adequate treatment for this disease.
