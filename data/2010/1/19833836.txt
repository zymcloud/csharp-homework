Background:We hypothesized that liver-derived mRNA, such as ALB (albumin) mRNA, would be released into human plasma with liver cell death.Methods:We genotyped ALB mRNA molecules in samples of plasma and whole blood from liver and bone marrow transplant recipients by RNA single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis. Plasma and whole blood ALB mRNA genotypes were compared with the DNA genotypes of the recipients and donors. A reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to measure plasma ALB mRNA concentrations in 107 patients [hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, or chronic hepatitis B (CHB)] and 207 healthy controls.Results:The RNA genotype data revealed ALB mRNA in plasma to be liver derived, whereas tissue compartments other than the liver also contributed to the ALB mRNA detected in whole blood. Statistically significant increases in plasma ALB mRNA concentrations were observed for HCC, cirrhosis, and active CHB, compared with controls. A cutoff of 835 copies/mL of plasma ALB mRNA identified by ROC curve analysis showed 85.5% diagnostic sensitivity and 92.8% diagnostic specificity for the detection of liver pathologies. Only 21.5% of patients with liver pathologies had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, whereas 73.8% had increased plasma ALB mRNA concentrations. Only 48.6% of the HCC patients had increased serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations, whereas 91.4% had increased plasma ALB mRNA concentrations.Conclusions:ALB mRNA is liver specific in plasma, but not in whole blood. Plasma ALB mRNA is increased in some liver pathologies and may be more diagnostically sensitive than alpha-fetoprotein and ALT.
