Background and objective:Oxaliplatin is one of the effective drugs for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Oxaliplatin-induced allergic reactions in European and American patients have been reported, but in China there are only a few case reports. This study investigated the incidence rate and characteristics of oxaliplatin-induced allergic reactions in Chinese patients with CRC.Methods:Clinical data of 109 patients with advanced CRC receiving oxaliplatin plus capecitabine (the XELOX regimen) as first-line therapy were collected and analyzed retrospectively.Results:Of 109 patients, 13 (11.9%) patients had hypersensitivity. In 546 cycles, 23 (4.2%) cycles involved hypersensitivity. Grade-I,-II, and -III reactions were seen in 13 cycles, 8 cycles, and 2 cycles, respectively, and no grade-IV reaction was observed. Allergic reactions usually occurred at the median time during the fifth cycle (range, the 1st-8th cycle) of oxaliplatin-containing therapy, and the cumulative oxaliplatin dose was 1200 mg (range, 400-1600 mg). Symptoms associated with anaphylaxis appeared 5-360 min (median, 180 min) after oxaliplatin infusion, and were relieved after withdrawing the oxaliplatin infusion and treating with antiallergic drugs. A total of 8 patients continued to receive oxaliplatin therapy after prophylactic administration of antiallergic drugs, such as steroids, and 4 patients did not report persistent allergic reactions. Compared with men, oxaliplatin-induced allergic reactions were more commonly seen in women patients (P<0.05), while age, body surface area, performance status, tumor location, and pathologic type showed no significant difference.Conclusion:Oxaliplatin-induced allergic reactions occurred in Chinese patients with CRC, and the incidence rate, occurrence time, degree of severity, and clinical outcome were consistent with literature published abroad.
