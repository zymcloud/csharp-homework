Aim:To investigate cell cycle proteins in chronic hepatitis C virus infection in order to analyze their role in the process of hepatocyte transformation and to characterize their prognostic properties.Methods:Subjects of the current study included 50 cases of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) without cirrhosis, 30 cases of CHC with liver cirrhosis (LC), and 30 cases of hepatitis C-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) admitted to the Department of Hepato-Gastroenterology, Theodor Bilharz Research Institute (TBRI), Giza, Egypt. Fifteen wedge liver biopsies, taken during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, were also included as normal controls. Laboratory investigations including urine and stool analysis, liver function tests and prothrombin concentration; serologic markers for viral hepatitis and ultrasonography were done for all cases of the study together with immunohistochemical analysis using primary antibodies against Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, p21, p27 and Rb/p105 proteins.Results:Normal wedge liver biopsies didn't express Cyclin E or Rb/p105 immunostaining but show positive staining for Cyclin D1, p21 and p27. Cyclin D1 expressed nuclear staining that was sequentially increased from CHC to LC (P Conclusion:Upregulation of Cyclin D1 in CHC plays a vital role in the development and differentiation of HCC; while, Cyclin E may be a useful marker formonitoring tumor behavior. p21 and p27 can be used as predictive markers for HCC. Furthermore, higher expression of Rb/p105 as well as inverse relation with p21 and histologic grades suggests its important role in hepatic carcinogenesis.
