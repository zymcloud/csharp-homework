The level of serum glycoproteins and their glycosylation pattern change in liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Some of them, especially alpha fetoprotein (AFP), serve as useful biomarkers for HCC. The present investigation showed high level of AFP in hepatitis B cirrhosis (HBV-LC) and hepatitis C cirrhosis (HCV-LC) patients. However, increase of AFP level was not significantly high in chronic hepatitis B (HBV-CH) as determined by ELISA using monoclonal anti-human AFP (mAb-AFP). The differential expression of sialic acid linkage was observed in HBV-CH and HCV-LC by ELISA; the former bound strongly with Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), which has exclusive binding specificity for NeuAcα2-6-, whereas HCV-LC reacted preferably with Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) which recognizes NeuAcα2-3-. There was significantly high glycan branching in HBV-LC and HCV-LC in comparison to controls as illustrated by concanavalin A. This was further confirmed by Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin (E-PHA) and Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA). Enhanced fucosylation of AFP was observed in HBV-LC, HCV-LC and HCC patients by ELISA using fucose binding Aleuria aurantia lectin; however, maximum binding was found in HCC. Fucosylation with α1-6 linkage was further confirmed by Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA). From the above results it is concluded that the changes in concentration of AFP, differential expression of sialic acid, increase of glycan branching and fucosylation have a prognostic value of hepatitis and it could be possible that lectin-based assay with AFP can aid in diagnosis of hepatitis diseases besides clinical examination and routine laboratory investigation.
