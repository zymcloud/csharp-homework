Background:Blood transfusions are an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes after hepatectomy. In-hospital transfusions are still reported in one third of patients in major series. Data on factors affecting blood transfusions in large series of liver resection are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors predictive of blood transfusion in hepatectomies performed at a tertiary referral center.Methods:Records of 1,477 patients who underwent 1,557 liver resections between 1998 and 2007 were reviewed. Multivariate analysis of risk factors for red cell transfusion was performed.Results:Median intra-operative blood loss was 250 cc, and 30-day peri-operative red cell transfusion rate was 27%. On multivariate analysis, factors that significantly predicted increased red cell transfusion rates were female sex, pre-operative hematocrit<30%, platelet count<100,000/mm3, simultaneous resection of other organs, major hepatic resection, use of the Pringle maneuver, and tumors>10 cm. Parenchymal transection technique was an independent risk factor for perioperative red cell transfusion; the usage of the 2-surgeon technique (combined saline-linked cautery and ultrasonic dissection) was associated with a lower transfusion rate than other techniques, including ultrasonic dissection alone, finger fracture, and stapling (P<.001).Conclusion:Although most factors that affect the red cell transfusion rate for liver resection are patient- or tumor-related, the parenchymal transection technique is under the surgeon's control. The decrease in transfusion rate associated with the use of the 2-surgeon technique emphasizes the important role of the hepatobiliary surgeon in determining outcomes after liver resection.
