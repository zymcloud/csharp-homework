Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary tumor of the liver accounting for 4.6% of all new human cancers. Cardiac metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma is an uncommon secondary cardiac malignancy. We described two cases of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with large masses in the right atrium mimicking atrial myxoma. The RA masses were incidentally detected during two-dimensional echocardiographic examination.
