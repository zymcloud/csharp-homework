The link between inflammation and colorectal cancer development is becoming increasingly clear. It had long been recognized that patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at an increased risk of colon cancer. Evidence from experimental animals now also implicates the innate immune system in the development of sporadically occurring intestinal adenomas, the precursors to colorectal cancer. Here we discuss the interaction between the immune system and the adenoma to carcinoma sequence with a special emphasis on the role of mast cells which may play a key role in adenoma development. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mast cells in inflammation.
