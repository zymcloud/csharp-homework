This study aimed to clarify the mode of hepatic spread from gallbladder carcinoma and to elucidate its prognostic value. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 42 consecutive patients who underwent resection for gallbladder carcinoma with hepatic involvement verified histologically. The mode of hepatic spread was classified into 3 patterns: direct invasion through the gallbladder bed, portal tract invasion, and hepatic metastatic nodules. Intrahepatic lymphatic invasion was declared when either single tumor cells or cell clusters were clearly visible within vessels that showed immunoreactivity to the D2-40 monoclonal antibody. Seven, 24, and 11 patients had direct invasion alone, portal tract invasion with (22 patients) or without (2 patients) direct invasion, and hepatic metastatic nodules, respectively. Of the 24 patients with portal tract invasion, 14 had intrahepatic lymphatic invasion, 8 had neither intrahepatic lymphatic nor venous invasion, and 2 had both intrahepatic lymphatic and venous invasion. To date, 4 patients with direct invasion alone and 4 patients with portal tract invasion survived more than 5 years after resection, whereas all the patients with hepatic metastatic nodules died within 11 months after resection, irrespective of the type of hepatectomy. The mode of hepatic spread (P<0.001) was a strong independent prognostic factor. Direct liver invasion and portal tract invasion, which features intrahepatic lymphatic invasion, are the main modes of hepatic spread from resectable gallbladder carcinoma. The mode of hepatic spread independently predicts long-term survival after resection for patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Hepatic metastatic nodules indicate a dismal outcome after resection.
