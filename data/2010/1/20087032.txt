The median overall survival time was 267, 522, and 275 days in group A, B, and C respectively.Discussion:Vinorelbine-based chemotherapy was considered as a new treatment option for patients with metastatic or relapsed breast cancer. It is necessary to examine the use at the early stage or more to obtain a high response rate and duration of response.
