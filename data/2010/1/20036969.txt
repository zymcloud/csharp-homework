The Authors make a review of the most important molecules used today for detecting and screening hepatocellular carcinoma, analyzing their known biological features, advantages and limits especially concerning differential diagnosis from cirrhosis and others diseases. AFP, AFP-L3, DCP, Alpha-1-fucosidase are analyzed and all the current knowledge reviewed, as well as focusing on possible future applications and results of combined determination (what about another word here: evaluation etc) in HCC. Additionally other more recent molecules showing promising future clinical application are cited.
