PURPOSE Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from colorectal cancer traditionally is considered a terminal condition. Approaches that combine cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC) have been developed recently. The purpose of this study was to assess early and long-term survival in patients treated with that strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective-cohort, multicentric study from French-speaking countries was performed. All consecutive patients with PC from colorectal cancer who were treated with CRS and PIC (with or without hyperthermia) were included. Patients with PC of appendiceal origin were excluded. Results The study included 523 patients from 23 centers in four French-speaking countries who underwent operation between 1990 and 2007. The median follow-up was 45 months. Mortality and grades 3 to 4 morbidity at 30 days were 3% and 31%, respectively. Overall median survival was 30.1 months. Five-year overall survival was 27%, and five-year disease-free survival was 10%. Complete CRS was performed in 84% of the patients, and median survival was 33 months. Positive independent prognostic factors identified in the multivariate analysis were complete CRS, PC that was limited in extent, no invaded lymph nodes, and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Neither the grade of disease nor the presence of liver metastases had a significant prognostic impact. CONCLUSION This combined treatment approach against PC achieved low postoperative morbidity and mortality, and it provided good long-term survival in patients with peritoneal scores lower than 20. These results should improve in the future, because the different teams involved will gain experience. This approach, when feasible, is now considered the gold standard in the French guidelines.
