NK cells are innate immune cells that are important in tumor immunity, but also have the ability to modulate the adaptive immune system through cytokine production or direct cell-cell interactions. This study investigates the interaction of NK cells with dendritic cells (DCs) and tumor cells, and the role of specific NK cell-activating receptors in this process. Primary rat NK cells and an NK cell line produced IFN-γ when cocultured with either DCs or the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777 (McA). This NK cell activation by DCs and McA required cell-cell contact and was dependent on distinct NK-activating receptors. Silencing NK cell expression of NKp46 and NKp30 significantly diminished DC- and McA-mediated NK cell IFN-γ production, respectively. NK cells killed immature and mature DCs independently of NKp46, NKp30, and NKG2D; however, cytotoxicity against McA cells was dependent on NKp30 and NKG2D. Thus, we have shown in this study that NKp30 plays dual activating roles in NK-McA tumor interactions by mediating cytokine production and cytotoxicity. More importantly, NK cells are activated by both DCs and hepatoma cells to produce IFN-γ, but require distinct NK cell-activating receptors, NKp46 and NKp30, respectively. Our data suggest that therapeutics could be developed specifically to target NK-DC interactions without compromising NK tumor immunity.
