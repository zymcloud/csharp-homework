Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the fifth most common cancer in the world, and the third most frequent oncological cause of death. The incidence of HCC is on the increase. HCC typically develops in patients with chronic liver diseases, and cirrhosis, usually with viral etiology, is the strongest predisposing factor. Nowadays HCC diagnosis is a multistage process including clinical, laboratory, imaging and pathological examinations. The prognosis of HCC is mostly poor, because of detection at an advanced, non-resectable stage. Potentially curative treatment (surgery) is limited and really possible only for cases with small HCC malignancies. For this reason, more effective surveillance strategies should be used to screen for early occurrence of HCC targeted to the population at risk. So far, the generally accepted serological marker is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Its diagnostic accuracy is unsatisfactory and questionable because of low sensitivity, therefore there is a strong demand by clinicians for new HCC-specific biomarkers. In this review, we will focus on other biomarkers that seem to improve HCC diagnosis, such as AFP-L3, des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin, alpha-l-fucosidase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, glypican-3, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, a new generation of immunoglobulin M-immunocomplexes, and very promising gene-expression profiling.
