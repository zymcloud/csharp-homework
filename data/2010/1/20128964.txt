Objective:To compare the Golgi proteome of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with that of the adjacent non-tumor tissues.Methods:Hepatocellular carcinoma and adjacent non-tumor tissues were obtained from HCC patients. The protein expression maps in Golgi were obtained by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and the differentially expressed protein spots were analyzed by PD-Quest software. Peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) of differential protein spots was obtained with MALD-TOT-MS.Results:According to 2-DE maps, the average numbers of protein spots were (1153+/-49) and (1086+/-37) in hepatocellular carcinoma and the adjacent non-tumor tissues. Compared to the adjacent non-tumor tissues, 27 proteins were upregulated, and 20 proteins were downregulated in HCC Golgi.Conclusions:The Golgi proteome in HCC tissues is different from that in the adjacent non-tumor tissues, and the differential expression proteins are involved in energy metabolism, tumor metastasis, and cell cycle regulation.
