Introduction:The optimal size of clear liver resection margin width in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of margin width on long-term survival after liver resection for CRLM with a policy of standard neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.Methods:Consecutive patients (n=238) who underwent liver resection for CRLM were included over a ten-year period. All patients with synchronous or early (<2 years) metachronous tumours were treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Data were recorded prospectively.Results:Overall survival of the cohort at 1, 3 and 5 years were 90.3%, 68.1% and 56.1% respectively. The incidence of cancer involved resection margins (CIRM) was 5.8%. Patients with macroscopically involved resection margins had a poorer overall survival than those with microscopically involved margins (p=0.04). Involved resection margins had a poorer overall survival (p=0.002) than patients with clear margins. Width of clear resection margin did not affect long-term survival.Conclusion:CIRM independently predicts poor outcome in patients with CRLM. Clear margin width does not affect survival. A standard policy of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy may be associated with a low incidence of CIRM and improved long-term outcome of sub-centimetre margin widths, resembling those with >1cm resection margins.
