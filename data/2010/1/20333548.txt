Many lines of evidence have shown that Chinese medicine contains many chemical compounds with anticancer effects. Therefore, we tested whether the active ingredients of blister beetles have a therapeutic effect on hepatoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitive effects of norcantharidin which is extracted from blister beetles on human hepatoma cells HepG2 in vitro and its anticancer mechanism.MTT assay, agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry were used to evaluate HepG2 cells proliferation and apoptosis. The role of caspase activities were assayed using caspase apoptosis detection kit. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the level of Bcl-2/Bax expression. Our results indicate that norcantharidin inhibited HepG2 cell growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner by MTT assay. HepG2 cells treated with norcantharidin showed typical characteristics of apoptosis including the DNA fragmentation. The activities of caspase-3, -9 were up-regulated after norcantharidin treatment. By western blot analysis, we found the level of Bcl-2 were down-regulated, whereas, the level of Bcl-2 Up-regulated.so we suggest that up-regulation of mitochondrial Bax expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression participated in the apoptosis induced by NCTD. These results suggest that norcantharidin triggers apoptosis in hepato cancer cell lines via the activation of the caspses, mitochondrial pathways, and that this agent may be useful for developing new therapeutic regimens for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.
