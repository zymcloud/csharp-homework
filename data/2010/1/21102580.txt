Primary liver cancer, predominantly consisting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is one of the most common and aggressive human malignancies worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Emerging evidence indicates that miRNAs are often deregulated in HCC, and that some specific miRNAs are associated with the clinicopathological features of HCC. Recent work demonstrates that miRNAs have essential roles in HCC progression and directly contribute to cell proliferation, avoidance of apoptotic cell death, and metastasis of HCC by targeting a large number of critical protein-coding genes. The discovery of the aberrantly expressed miRNAs and their corresponding targets has opened a novel avenue to investigate the molecular mechanism of HCC progression and to develop potential therapeutics against HCC. In this review, we summarise current knowledge about the roles and validated targets of miRNAs in liver cancer progression.
