Purpose:To study the targeting and photodynamic therapy efficiency of porphyrin and galactosyl conjugated micelles based on amphiphilic copolymer galactosyl and mono-aminoporphyrin (APP) incoporated poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate)-polycaprolactone (Gal-APP-PAEMA-PCL).Methods:Poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate)-polycaprolactone (PAEMA-PCL) was synthesized by the combination of ring opening polymerization and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, and then Gal-APP-PAEMA-PCL was obtained after conjugation of lactobionic acid and 5-(4-aminophenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin (APP) to PAEMA-PCL. The chemical structures of the copolymers were characterized, and their biological properties were evaluated in human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp2) and human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells.Results:Both APP-PAEMA-PCL and Gal-APP-PAEMA-PCL did not exhibit dark cytotoxicity to HEp2 cells and HepG2 cells. However, Gal-APP-PAEMA-PCL was taken up selectively by HepG2 cells and had the higher phototoxicity effect. Both polymers preferentially localized within cellular vesicles that correlated to the lysosomes.Conclusions:The results indicated that porphyrin and galactosyl conjugated polymer micelles exhibited higher targeting and photodynamic therapy efficacy in HepG2 cells than in HEp2 cells.
