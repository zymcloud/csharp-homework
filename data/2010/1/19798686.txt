Purpose:Liver resection (LR) and liver transplantation (LT) are considered the only two potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, there has been an intense debate as to whether LR or LT is the optimal initial treatment for patients with Child A or B cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to compare the results of LR and LT in patients with HCC and with Child A or B cirrhosis in a single center over a 10-year period.Method:Seventy-eight patients were treated with LT and 130 were treated with LR. We evaluated patient characteristics, short-term results such as hospital stay, postoperative complication, mortality, and long-term results such as overall and recurrence-free survival and recurrence.Results:The hospital stay of the LT group was significantly longer than that of the LR group (P Conclusion:LT should be considered as the primary treatment in patients with HCC within the Milan criteria. LR is recommended for patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria. The LT group showed a significantly lower recurrence rate than the LR group. However, in the case of recurrence, the LT group showed a poorer long-term outcome than the LR group.
