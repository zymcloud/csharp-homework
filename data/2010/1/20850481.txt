ZBP-89 can enhance tumor cells to death stimuli. However, the molecular mechanism leading to the inhibitory effect of ZBP-89 is unknown. In this study, 4 liver cell lines were used to screen for the target of ZBP-89 on cell death pathway. The identified Bak was further analyzed for its role in ZBP-89-mediated apoptosis. The result showed that ZBP-89 significantly and time-dependently induced apoptosis. It significantly upregulated the level of pro-apoptotic Bak. ZBP-89 targeted a region between -457 and -407 of human Bak promoter to stimulate Bak expression based on the findings of Bak promoter luciferase report gene assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ZBP-89-induced Bak increase and ZBP-89-mediated apoptosis were markedly suppressed by Bak siRNA, confirming that Bak was specifically targeted by ZBP-89 to facilitate apoptosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that ZBP-89 significantly induced apoptosis of HCC cells via promoting Bak level.
