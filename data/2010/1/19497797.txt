Aim:The purpose of this study is to describe de novo post-liver transplant malignancies and compare their frequency with incidence rates from Italian cancer registries.Patients and methods:Four hundred and seventeen patients subjected to liver transplantation, from 1991 to 2005, surviving for at least 30 days and without a previous diagnosis of cancer (including hepatocellular carcinoma), were evaluated for the development of de novo malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancers.Results:During a total follow-up time of 2856 person-years, 43 de novo malignancies were diagnosed in 43 liver transplantation recipients (10.3%). The most common cancers were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (9 cases), cancer of the head and neck (8 cases), Kaposi's sarcoma (6 cases) and esophageal carcinoma (5 cases). The 1, 3, 5 and 10 years estimated survival rates were 69%, 57%, 53% and 42%. Patients with de novo cancers had a lower 10-year survival rate than patients without cancers (58% versus 76%, p=0.005). The risk of cancer after liver transplantation was nearly 3-fold higher than that of the general population of the same age and sex (95% CI: 1.9-3.6). De novo tumour sites or types with significantly elevated SIR included Kaposi's sarcoma (SIR=144), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR=13.8), esophagus (SIR=23.4), head and neck cancers (SIR=7) and cervix uteri (SIR=30.7).Conclusions:Tumours after liver transplantation are associated with lower long-term survival, confirming that cancer is a major cause of late mortality in liver transplantation.
