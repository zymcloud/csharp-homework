Background:Gallbladder cancer (GBCA) is a rare malignancy with a variable incidence worldwide. This study analyzed GBCA patients treated at centers in 3 countries. The aim was to assess for location-specific differences in presentation and outcomes, which might suggest differences in pathogenesis or disease biology.Study design:Data for consecutive patients submitted to operation at Instituto Oncológico Fundación Arturo López Pérez (FALP, Chile), Yokohama City University (YCU, Japan), and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, USA) between 1999 and 2007 were studied retrospectively. Patient demographics, disease- and treatment-related variables and outcomes were analyzed by chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and log-rank test.Results:Two hundred sixty-one patients (MSKCC, 130; FALP, 85; YCU, 46) underwent exploration, and 160 (MSKCC, 91; FALP, 33; YCU, 36) underwent R0 resection. Patients treated at FALP were younger (median 57 years, p < 0.001) and more often female (80%, p < 0.005); at YCU there were fewer patients with incidental tumors (19.5% compared with more than 60% at FALP and MSKCC, p < 0.001). En bloc liver and bile duct resections were performed more commonly at MSKCC and YCU (p < 0.001). Patients treated at FALP had more advanced tumor stage compared with those treated at MSKCC and YCU (p < 0.001). Disease-specific survival (DSS) was not different among the groups when patients submitted to an R0 resection were analyzed (p = 0.12). On multivariate analysis, T-stage, nodal involvement, and bile duct involvement were predictors of DSS; center was not significant.Conclusions:Despite some differences in presentation, disease extent, and surgical treatment, DSS after curative intent resection was similar among all 3 groups. The most important predictors of outcomes were related to tumor extent rather than country of origin.
