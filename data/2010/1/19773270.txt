Objective:To assess the resectability rate of patients with initially unresectable liver-only metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) after treatment with irinotecan/capecitabine.Methods:Patients received irinotecan (240 mg/m(2)) as a 30 min intravenous infusion on day 1 and capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) orally bid for 14 days beginning on day 2. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. The protocol encouraged two to four cycles of irinotecan/capecitabine after recovery from surgery.Results:Between May 2004 and February 2007, 48 patients entered in the study. Forty-seven (97.9%) of the 48 patients were assessable for response. The overall response rate before surgery was 56.3% (95% CI, 42.3-70.3%) in the treated population, including 2 non-confirmed complete response (CR), 18 partial responses (PR) and 7 non-confirmed PR. Twenty-three (47.9%) of 29 patients with tumor shrinkage proceeded to surgical intervention. Twenty of the 23 patients had a complete resection (S-CR). With a median follow-up time of 32 months (range, 24-38 months), the overall median time to progression and overall survival for all patients were 16.7 months (95% CI, 10.0-23.4 months) and 27.5 months (95% CI, 23.6-31.4 months) for all patients. The 1- 2- and 3-year overall survival estimates were 79.2% (95% CI, 67.7-90.7%), 60.4% (95% CI, 46.6-74.3%) and 29.2% (95% CI, 16.3-42.0%), respectively. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in eight (17.0%) patients. The most common Grade 3/4 hematological adverse event was neutropenia in 8.5% of the patients. There were no treatment-related deaths during this study.Conclusions:Irinotecan/capecitabine appears to be a safe and very effective regimen in selected patients with unresectable liver metastases from CRC, but who are treated with a curative intent.
