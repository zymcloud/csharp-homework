Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) involves the delivery of a small number of ultra-high doses of radiation to a target volume using very advanced technology and has emerged as a novel treatment modality for cancer. The role of SBRT is most important at two cancer stages-in early primary cancer and in oligometastatic disease. This modality has been used in the treatment of early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, renal-cell carcinoma, and liver cancer, and in the treatment of oligometastases in the lung, liver, and spine. A large body of evidence on the use of SBRT for the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors in various sites has accumulated over the past 10-15 years, and efficacy and safety have been demonstrated. Several prospective clinical trials of SBRT for various sites have been conducted, and several other trials are currently being planned. The results of these clinical trials will better define the role of SBRT in cancer management. This article will review the radiobiologic, technical, and clinical aspects of SBRT.
