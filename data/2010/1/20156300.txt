Persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major risk toward development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The elucidation of pathogenesis of HCV-associated liver disease is hampered by the absence of appropriate animal models: there has been no animal model for HCV infection/pathogenesis except for the chimpanzee. In contrast, a number of transgenic mouse lines carrying the cDNA of the HCV genome have been established and evaluated in the study of HCV pathogenesis. The studies using transgenic mouse models, in which the HCV proteins such as the core protein are expressed, indicate the direct pathogenicity of HCV, including oncogenic activities. HCV transgenic mouse models also show a close relationship between HCV and some hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations such as hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance or Sj√∂gren's syndrome. A crucial role of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of liver disease in HCV infection has been demonstrated, implying hepatitis C to be a metabolic disease. Besides the data connecting liver fibrosis progression and the disturbance in lipid and glucose metabolisms in hepatitis C patients, a series of evidence was found showing the association between these two conditions and HCV infection, chiefly using transgenic mouse carrying the HCV genome. Furthermore, the persistent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha has recently been found, yielding dramatic changes in the lipid metabolism and oxidative stress overproduction in cooperation with the mitochondrial dysfunction. These results would provide a clue for further understanding of the role of lipid metabolism in pathogenesis of hepatitis C including liver injury and hepatocarcinogenesis.
