Background and objective:Multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) might originate from multicentric occurrence (MO) or intrahepatic metastasis(IM). This study was to find out proteins which play important roles in clonal origin of multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma bt screening the differentially expressed proteins between the MO and IM tissues using comparative proteomic analysis.Methods:Total protein extracted was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparative analyses of the 2-DE protein patterns between the two groups were carried out using computerized imaging techniques. Proteins exhibiting significant alternations were subsequently isolated and identified by mass spectrometry.Results:A total 1025+/-52 and 900+/-98 spots were detected in the protein profile in IM and MO, respectively. Twenty-five protein spots were statistically different at expression levels between the two groups. Twenty of them were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS and bioinformatics.Conclusions:The protein profile of MO HCC tissues is different from that in IM HCC tissues. The twenty differentially expressed proteins might play a key role in the carcinogenesis and progression of multinodular HCC. These newly identified proteins might be potential and valuable biomarkers for identifying the multinodular HCC of clonal origin.
