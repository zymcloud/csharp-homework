Here we investigated the in vivo effect of morin (500ppm in diet) in fostering apoptosis in diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (200mg/kg bodyweight) mediated experimental hepatocellular carcinogenesis model. We analyzed the expression of cytosolic protein Akt and their important apoptotic downstream targets like caspase-9, Bcl-2, Bax, GSK-3betain vivo, by immunoblot analysis. In silico docking studies indicated that morin could serve as a better inhibitor than the classical PI3K inhibitor LY294002. The results obtained from in vivo studies confirm this. We also demonstrate here that morin's interaction with a defined set of amino acids of PI3K p110gamma catalytic subunit resulted in the down-regulation of p-Akt(Ser473), p-Akt(Thr308) and total Akt causing the attenuation of its downstream targets in DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, morin caused the up-regulation of tumor suppressor PTEN, an important negative regulator of Akt, thus initiating apoptosis. Supplementation of morin to experimental animals modulated Bcl-2/Bax ratio causing the release of cyt C and up-regulation of caspase-3 and -9. Morin was also found to prevent the Akt-mediated suppression of GSK-3beta possibly causing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. These observations were supported by the DNA fragmentation and transmission electron microscopy results, which showed the occurrence of apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that morin begets apoptosis in DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.
