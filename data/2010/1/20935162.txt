In the present study, protein lysates from microdissected glutathione S-transferase placental-form-positive (GST-P(+)) foci and hepatocellular carcinomas from livers of rats treated with N-diethylnitrosamine followed by phenobarbital at doses of 0 and 500 ppm in the diet for 10 and 33 weeks were analyzed using QSTAR Elite liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and iTRAQ technology. Among 75 proteins, a total of 27 and 50 proteins displaying significant quantitative changes comparing with adjacent normal-appearing liver tissue were identified in GST-P(+) foci of initiation control and promotion groups, respectively, which are related to transcription, protein folding, cytoskeleton filaments reorganization, cell cycle control, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress responses, lipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and signal transduction. Furthermore, Ingenuity Pathway and bioinformatic analyses revealed that expression changes of genes encoding proteins with altered expression detected in GST-P(+) foci are likely to be controlled by c-myc, NRF2, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, nuclear factor kappa B, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 transcriptional factors. Coordinated overexpression of mitochondrial chaperons prohibitin (PHB) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), septin 9 (SEPT9), neurabin 1, and other cytoskeletal and functional proteins in areas of GST-P(+) foci during initiation and/or promotion stages of rat hepatocarcinogenesis was associated with induction of cell proliferation and might be responsible for the neoplastic transformation of rat liver preneoplastic lesions. Newly discovered elevation of PHB, PHB2, and SEPT9 in GST-P(+) foci and tumors, imply that they might play important role in the onset of liver cancer and be of potential values in the studies of hepatocarcinogenesis.
