Objective:To investigate the effect of Pteris semipinnata L. (PsL) extract Ent-11alpha-hydroxy-15-oxo-kaur-16-en-19-oic-acid (5F)-on HepG2 cells and explore its potential mechanism.Methods:Cytotoxicity of 5F was studied in HepG2 cells treated with different doses of 5F (0 - 80 mg/L) for 24 h and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. To analyze apoptosis qualitatively, the Hoechst/PI assay was used. The level of Bax in mitochondria fraction of 5F-treated HepG2 cells was determined by western blotting. The levels of cyto-c and AIF in the cytosol were analyzed by western blotting.Results:The cytotoxicity of 5F on HepG2 cells was elevated with the increasing of 5F concentrations, as evidenced by the cell viability assay. The apoptotic cells characterized by condensed neclei were observed after the exposure of HepG2 cells to 5F. The level of Bax in mitochondria fraction of 5F-treated HepG2 cells increased. The levels of cyto-c and AIF in the cytosol of 5F-treated HepG2 cells increased.Conclusion:5F mediated apoptosis involves mitochondria-dependent pathway and 5F might have a therapeutic value against human cancer cell lines and especially on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.
