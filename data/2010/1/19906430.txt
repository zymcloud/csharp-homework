In this paper, antineoplastic activities of protein-conjugated silver sulfide nano-crystals with different shapes were described in detail. Transmission electron microscope analysis demonstrated that stable and well-disperse protein-conjugated silver sulfide nano-particles, nano-rods, and nano-wires could be prepared by aqueous chemistry method. The Fourier transform infrared spectrograph analysis indicated the strong coordination between silver sulfide surfaces and -OH and -NH groups in bovine serum albumin. The antineoplastic activities of protein-conjugated silver sulfide nano-crystals were examined by cell viability analysis, optical and electron microscopy methods. The results showed that nano-particles, nano-rods and nano-wires could inhibit the proliferations of human hepatocellular carcinoma Bel-7402 cells and C6 glioma cells, and the activities were size-dependent.
