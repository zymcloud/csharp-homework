Background:Factors associated with advanced liver disease have been incompletely explored in HIV/HBV coinfected patients.Objectives:To describe liver-related morbidity, mortality, and related risk factors, in HIV/HBV coinfected patients.Study design:We followed-up 107 consecutive HIV/HBV coinfected patients. Clinical, biological and virological data were collected every 3 months. Liver-related mortality and a composite score were used to define advanced liver disease.Results:The patients were mainly sub-Saharan Africans (61%) or Europeans (33%). Forty-four percent of patients had liver biopsy, 78% of patients received lamivudine. Advanced liver disease (ALD) was diagnosed in 19/107 patients during follow-up (mean 4.8 years): 10 extensive fibrosis, 5 cirrhosis, 3 hepatocellular carcinoma resulting from cirrhosis, and 1 fulminant hepatitis following lamivudine withdrawal. Eleven patients died, 4 from HBV-related liver disease. In univariate analysis, male gender, mean HIV and HBV viral loads, and raised AST/ALT transaminases were associated with increased risk of ALD. The strongest associations, in a multivariate model, were mean AST transaminase and cumulated time receiving lamivudine, with a favourable effect. 39% of patients with increased mean AST presented with ALD, versus 7% when normal mean AST (Relative Risk 5.5).Conclusions:During HIV/HBV coinfection, transaminase levels are strongly associated with ALD. Normal mean AST has a high negative predictive value, contrary to previously reported data in HIV/HCV patients.
