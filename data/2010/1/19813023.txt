Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2) plays a role in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system. CRHR2 together with its ligands, urocortins (Ucns) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), functions as a mediator of inflammatory response and inhibitor of angiogenesis. Recently, it has been reported to be expressed in many human cancers. An association between rs2267716 polymorphism in the CRHR2 gene and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was found in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In the present study we analyzed, using a polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR), the rs2267716 polymorphism in 364 hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients, 196 non-HCC patients with HBV infection, and 404 healthy controls. The aim was to detect the possible association of this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with susceptibility to HBV-related HCC. Significant differences of rs2267716 allele were detected between HBV-related HCC patients and healthy controls (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.13-2.15, P = 0.007) or non-HCC patients with HBV infection (OR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.13-2.31, P = 0.009). These results suggest that the rs2267716 polymorphism in the CRHR2 gene might influence the risk of developing HCC in patients with HBV infection in Chinese population.
