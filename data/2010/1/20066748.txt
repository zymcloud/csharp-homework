Aim:To identify prognostic factors from pretreatment variables of the initial transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) procedure in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One thousand and five hundred and sixty-nine patients with unresectable HCC underwent TACE as initial treatment were retrospectively studied. Pretreatment variables of the initial TACE procedure with a P value less than 0.05 by univariate analysis were subjected to Cox proportional hazards model.Results:The median overall survival time and 1-, 5-, 10-year survival rates were 10.37 mo, 47%, 10%, and 7%, respectively. A Cox proportional hazard model showed that 8 pretreatment factors of regional lymph nodes metastasis, Child-Pugh class, macrovascular invasion, greatest dimension, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Hepatitis virus B, tumor capsule, and nodules were independent prognostic factors. Patients with multimodality therapy have better survival than those with TACE treatment only.Conclusion:Tumor status, hepatic function reserve, AFP, and hepatitis virus B status were independent prognostic factors for unresectable HCC. Distant metastasis might not be a contraindication to TACE. Multimodality therapy might improve survival.
