Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is one of the most common treatment modalities for hepatocellular carcinoma. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is considered to be a relatively safe procedure, but transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is associated with a number of disastrous complications. Among the ischaemic complications caused by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, spinal cord injury is very rare, but can occur via the intercostal or lumbar arteries. We report two cases of extremely rare spinal cord injuries after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The patients had sensory loss below the T9 or T10 dermatomes and paraparesis or paraplegia within 6-8h after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. One patient sustained paraplegia until death 2 months after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and the other patient recovered almost completely 2 months after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.
