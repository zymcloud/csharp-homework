Background:Recent studies have shown that intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusions promote postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a specific method of oxygen administration, which is independent of fluid therapy or blood transfusion. The aim of the present study was to assess the usefulness of acute HBOT after liver resection for patients with HCC in order to minimize the requirement for perioperative blood transfusions.Patients and methods:Forty-one consecutive patients who showed Hb level Results:In six patients from the HBOT group, who experienced intraoperative major bleeding or showed fatal hepatic hypoxia (ShvO(2) Conclusion:These results suggest that acute HBOT after hepatectomy, aimed at reducing perioperative erythrocyte transfusions, may be employed for overcoming deficiencies in systemic and hepatic oxygen supply and thus diminishing postoperative complications. As an added benefit, such therapy may affect postoperative immunological responses and long-term survival after liver resection in HCC patients. Further analyses of the use of HBOT is warranted to confirm surgical outcome data and to assess the economic impact on healthcare costs.
