Importance of the field:Despite therapeutic advances, cancer remains the cause of an estimated 23% of deaths in the USA. New treatments for malignancy are greatly needed.Areas covered in this review:Talaporfin sodium is a light-activated drug that causes tissue death through induction of apoptosis. Systemic antitumor effects mediated by CD8(+) T cells have been demonstrated in preclinical studies, providing a mechanism for distant response of tumors noted in clinical trials. Talaporfin sodium is approved in Japan for early-stage endobronchial cancer. Phase I and II studies in solid tumors have shown tumor regression in patients refractory to other therapies. Phase III pivotal studies against hepatocellular carcinoma as monotherapy and liver-metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with chemotherapy are ongoing. Talaporfin sodium is also in studies in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. Substantial safety data from clinical trials so far indicate that the drug is well tolerated.What the reader will gain:Talaporfin sodium has a broad safety profile and a mode of action that could affect growth in treated and untreated tumors.Take home message:Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that talaporfin sodium treatment may offer a powerful option to synergize current therapies, as well as an alternative monotherapy in treating cancer.
