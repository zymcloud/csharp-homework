Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the major obstacle to successful chemotherapy of human malignancies and strategies for overcoming MDR phenomena are still unavailable to clinical use. Previous results showed that ultrasound (US) exposure could make MDR cancer cells become more sensitive to anticancer drugs, and the physical parameters of US exposure could adjust the uptake and retention of rhodamine 123 in MDR cells. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of therapeutic ultrasound as a physical approach to overcoming MDR in a multidrug resistant human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2/ADM). Our results demonstrated that the percentage of P-glycoprotein(+) (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein(+) (MRP) and lung resistance-related protein(+) (LRP) cells was 96.97% ± 2.41%, 20.84% ± 3.12% and 1.16% ± 0.59% in HepG2/ADM cells, and 62.84% ± 3.42%, 10.26% ± 1.18% and 3.05% ± 0.37% in US-exposed HepG2/ADM cells, respectively. A significant decrease in the number of P-gp(+) and MRP(+) cells was observed between US-exposed HepG2/ADM and HepG2/ADM cells (p
