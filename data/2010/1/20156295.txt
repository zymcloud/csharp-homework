In the 2008 guidelines for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis, who are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), the main goal is to normalize levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases by eliminating HBV or reducing viral loads. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, the clearance of HBV from serum is aimed for by entecavir, as the main resort, for histological improvement toward the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, by contrast, meticulous therapeutic strategies are adopted for the reversal to compensation, toward the eventual goal of decreasing the risk of HCC. For maintaining liver function and preventing HCC, branched chain amino acids and nutrient supplements are applied, in addition to conventional liver supportive therapies. For patients with chronic hepatitis B, separate guidelines are applied to those younger than 35 years and those aged 35 years or older. Even for patients with chronic hepatitis who are negative for hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg), but who harbor HBV DNA in titers of 7 log copies/mL or more, a "drug-free state" is aimed for by sequential treatment with interferon (IFN) plus entecavir as the first line. For patients with chronic hepatitis B aged 35 years or older, who are HBeAg-negative and carry HBV DNA in titers of less than 7 log copies/mL, long-term IFN for 24-48 weeks is adopted anew. To HBeAg-negative patients who have either or both platelet counts of less than 150 x 10(3)/mm(3) and less than 7 log copies of HBV DNA, also, long-term IFN for 24-48 weeks is indicated.
