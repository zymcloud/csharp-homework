Objectives:Chronic hepatitis B patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Our objective was to test whether dysregulation of adipokines contributes to liver injury. We also studied whether viral factors affected adipokines, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis.Methods:A prospective cohort of 266 chronic hepatitis B patients undergoing liver biopsy was studied. Fasting blood was taken for the analysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin, leptin, and resistin. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Factors associated with significant necroinflammation and cirrhosis were identified.Results:Histological activity index was correlated with serum TNF-alpha (R=0.40, PConclusions:TNF-alpha and/or IL-6 contribute to hepatic necroinflammation in chronic hepatitis B patients. Adiponectin protects against insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis but does not affect liver injury. Adipokines and viral factors contribute to liver injury independently.
