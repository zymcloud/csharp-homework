The treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma with distant metastasis remains unclear. We experienced a successful case of S-1 chemotherapy for bilateral pulmonary recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma following hepatectomy after gaining chemoresistance through pretreatment. A 62-year-old man underwent extended right hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma occupying the whole right lobe. CT scan 15 months after hepatectomy revealed bilateral multiple pulmonary recurrence. Pharmacokinetic modulation chemotherapy (PMC) was performed after treatment of UFT, and stable disease status for 24 months was achieved. Pulmonary metastatic lesions gradually became larger, so oral administration of 100 mg per day of S-1 was followed by stable disease status for 9 months. The present case suggests that S-1 chemotherapy may be useful for hepatocellular carcinoma with distant metastasis.
