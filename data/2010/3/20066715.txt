Background:Intrahepatic arterial yttrium 90 ((90)Y) microspheres have been proposed as a less toxic, less invasive therapeutic option to transhepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for patients with surgically unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TACE has demonstrated the ability to prolong survival. However, long-term survival remains uncertain.Methods:In a 2-cohort experience in the treatment of North American patients who had advanced, unresectable, biopsy-proven HCC, 691 patients received repetitive, cisplatin-based chemoembolization; and a separate cohort of 99 patients who had similar treatment criteria received a planned, single dose of (90)Y. Over the study period, an additional 142 patients were followed without treatment (total, 932 patients).Results:Overall survival was slightly better in the (90)Y group compared with the TACE group (median survival, 11.5 months vs 8.5 months). However, the selection criteria indicated a small but significant bias toward milder disease in the (90)Y group. By using stratification into a 3-tier model with patients dichotomized according to bilirubin levels Conclusions:Given the current evidence of therapeutic equivalence in survival, (90)Y and TACE appeared to be equivalent regional therapies for patients with unresectable, nonmetastatic HCC.
