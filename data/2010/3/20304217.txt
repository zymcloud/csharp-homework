Management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation (OLT) is not well established. We conducted a retrospective analysis of our results in the treatment of HCC recurrence after OLT Patients. The 23 HCC recurrences developed after 182 OLT performed for HCC within Milan criteria, had an average follow-up of 60 months.Results:The median time to recurrence was 23.4 months. Surgical resection of the recurrence was possible in 11 patients, but an R-0 resection was obtained in 8 patients. Four of these 8 patients developed another recurrence, with 3 succumbing due to tumor recurrence and 1 alive at 12 months with recurrence. The other 4 patients without recurrences, include 3 who are alive at 19, 31, and 86 months and 1 who died at 32.6 months due to hepatitis C recurrence. The 3 patients with palliative resections developed recurrences. Twelve patients were rejected for surgery: 8 were treated symptomatically, 2 with systemic chemotherapy, and 2 with everolimus and sorafenib. This last treatment was also prescribed for 2 patients after R-0 surgery who are alive at 19 and 31 months and for 1 patient after R-1 surgery who is alive at 19 months. Of 15 patients who died, 13 succumbed to HCC recurrence. The average survival from transplantation was 61.7 +/- 37.5 and 48 +/- 34.3 months for patients without and with recurrence, respectively (P Conclusions:HCC recurrence after OLT of patients within Milan criteria was low but had a great impact on survival. Few cases are amenable to R-0 resection, but when possible it was associated with a significantly increased survival, although with an high incidence of a new recurrence. There is a rationale for the use of sorafenib and mammalian target of rapamycin based immunosuppression, which warrants randomized studies.
