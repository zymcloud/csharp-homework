A 35-year-old woman with recurrent breast cancer with liver metastasis was treated with classical CMF because they had been resistant to anthracycline, taxane and vinorelbine. A remarkable response was achieved, FDG-PET demonstrated that FDG accumulation disappeared in the liver metastasis. Toxicities were tolerable and classical CMF could be continued on an outpatient basis without compromising quality of life. Our experience suggested that classical CMF was a useful regimen for recurrent metastatic breast cancer refractory to treatment with new agents.
