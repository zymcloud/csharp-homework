Background:End-stage liver disease is often complicated by hyponatremia. Cirrhotic patients with hyponatremia admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) have high mortality rates. This study analyzed the outcomes of critically ill cirrhotic patients and identified the prognostic value of serum sodium concentration.Methods:One hundred twenty-six consecutive cirrhotic patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary center during a 1.5-year period were enrolled in this study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables on the first day of ICU admission were prospectively recorded for post hoc analysis.Results:Overall hospital mortality was 65.1%. Comparing with serum sodium >135 mmol/L, patients with serum sodium 135 mmol/L versus those with serum sodium Conclusions:Low serum sodium levels in critically ill cirrhotic patients are associated with high complications of liver cirrhosis, in-hospital mortality, and poor short-term prognosis. The serum sodium concentration is important predictor of survival among candidates for liver transplantation. Future research with sequential application of serum sodium may reflect the dynamic aspects of clinical conditions, thus providing complete data for mortality risk.
