Objective:To explore whether or not HBx protein can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in liver cancer cell SMMC-7721.Methods:A recombinant adenovirus vector containing HBx gene was constructed and introduced into SMMC-7721 cell. The morphological changes were observed. The expression changes of epithelial and mesenchymal markers were investigated by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Invasive and metastatic capacity of transfected SMMC-7721 cell was evaluated through transwell migration assay.Results:The recombinant adenovirus vector containing HBx gene was constructed and transfected successfully into SMMC-7721 cell. At Day 7 post-transfection, the transfected SMMC-7721 cell underwent the morphological change from a classic epithelial morphology to a spindle-like shape. In addition, the HBx protein significantly increased the expressions of N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin, but decreased the expressions of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin in SMMC-7721 cell. The cellular invasion assay indicated that transfection of HBx drastically enhanced the invasive potential of SMMC-7721 cell.Conclusion:HBx protein may induce EMT and enhance the invasive potential of SMMC-7721 cell.
