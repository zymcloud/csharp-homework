A large number of trypsin inhibitors belonging to various types have been purified from different kinds of legumes. In this study, by using liquid chromatography, a Kunitz type trypsin inhibitor (KBTI) with a molecular weight of 20107.645 Da was purified from Korean large black soybeans. KBTI reduced the proteolytic activities of trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin with the activity of approximately 8520 BAEE units/mg and approximately 24 BTEE units/mg, respectively. It showed high thermal stability (0-100 degrees C) as well as stability over a large range of pH values (pH 3-11). Furthermore, KBTI inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity with an IC(50) value of 0.71 microM and induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2 and interferon-gamma at the mRNA level. KBTI exerted weak antiproliferative activity toward CNE-2 and HNE-2 nasopharyngeal cancer cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and Hep G2 hepatoma cells. KBTI was destitute of mitogenic, ribonuclease and antifungal activities.
