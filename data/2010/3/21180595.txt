Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is prevalent worldwide. It may cause cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment for this condition may need to be lifelong, thus the drugs used must be both efficacious and safe. Clinical trials of tenofovir have demonstrated a good safety profile for this drug and it has potent antiviral properties. However, to better characterize the safety of this drug, the postmarketing surveillance must be taken into account. Clinicians need to be vigilant, as infrequent adverse events may be revealed during this phase. The current review presents a detailed expos√© of preclinical and clinical data on tenofovir to increase awareness of possible adverse events and drug-drug interactions, based on the large experience of this drug in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment (and to date in patients with CHB). Several recommendations that may help the clinician to prevent the development of adverse events associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) treatment are outlined, along with a suggested surveillance protocol for the timely and proper identification of possible renal and bone toxicity.
