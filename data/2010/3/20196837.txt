Background:Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder mainly associated with homozygosity for the C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. The reports about the C282Y and H63D mutations and hepatocellular carninoma (HCC) were controversial. To clarify the relationship between C282Y and H63D mutations and HCC, a meta-analysis including nine studies (1102 HCC cases and 3766 controls, mainly came from European populations) was performed.Methods:The association was measured using random-effect (RE) or fixed-effect (FE) odds ratios (ORs) combined with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to the studies' heterogeneity.Results:Meta-analysis of nine studies showed that Y allele of C282Y was associated with HCC risk: RE OR reached 1.50 (95%CI: 1.05-2.14, p for heterogeneity = 0.02, I2 = 0.57). Subgroup analysis of seven studies also showed Y allele was associated with HCC risk in healthy populations: RE OR reached 1.61 (95%CI: 1.08-2.39, p for heterogeneity = 0.04, I2 = 0.55). We further did subgroup analysis in alcoholic liver cirrhosis (LC) patients of four studies (224 cases and 380 controls) and found that both the dominant model and Y allele of C282Y were associated with HCC risk (FE OR reached 4.06, 95%CI: 2.08-7.92 and 3.41, 95%CI: 1.81-6.41, respectively). There was no distinct heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 0). Sensitivity analyses showed the results were robust in the subgroup analysis of alcoholic LC patients.Conclusions:C282Y mutation was associated with HCC in European alcoholic LC patients.
