Background:To evaluate the triple-phase CT findings for the differentiation of fat-deficient angiomyolipoma from hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed contrast-enhanced triple-phase CT images of 10 patients with fat-deficient hepatic angiomyolipoma and 28 patients with 29 hepatocellular carcinomas in non-cirrhotic liver proved on histologic examination. The CT findings for the two types of tumors were compared using Fisher's exact test.Results:Early draining vein depicted on arterial or portal phases was seen in eight (80%) angiomyolipomas and two hepatocellular carcinomas (7%) (pConclusions:The presence of early draining vein connecting with prominent tumoral vessels and absent tumor capsule were useful CT findings for the differentiation of fat-deficient angiomyolipoma from hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver.
