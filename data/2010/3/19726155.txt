Introduction:Liver tumors should be surgically treated whenever possible. In the case of bilobar disease or coexisting liver cirrhosis, surgical options are limited. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been successfully used for irresectable liver tumors. The combination of hepatic resection and RFA extends the feasibility of open surgical procedures in patients with liver metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:RFA was performed with two different monopolar devices using ultrasound guidance. Intraoperative use of RFA for the treatment of liver metastases or HCC was limited to otherwise irresectable tumors during open surgical procedures including hepatic resections. Irresectability was considered if bilobar disease was treated, the functional hepatic reserve was impaired or appraised marginal for allowing further resection.Results:Ten patients with both liver metastases and HCC, and two patients with cholangiocellular carcinoma were treated. Complete initial tumor clearance was achieved in all patients. Two patients of the metastases group and five patients of the HCC group suffered from local recurrence after a median of 12 months (1-26) (local recurrence rate 32%). Five patients of the metastases group and six patients of the HCC group developed recurrent tumors in different areas of the ablation site after a median time of 4 months (2-18) (distant intrahepatic recurrence in 55%). Survival at 31 months was 36%.Conclusion:RFA extends the scope of surgery in some candidates with intraoperatively found irresectability.
