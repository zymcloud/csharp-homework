Purpose:To assess the diagnostic value of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in follow-up of patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) who were treated with radiofrequency (RF) ablation and to compare it with that of four-phase multi-detector row computed tomography (CT).Materials and methods:From July 2007 to May 2008, 36 patients (43 HCCs) were enrolled who were treated with RF ablation (tumor size, 20-47 mm; mean, 24.5 mm) and underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging and four-phase (precontrast, arterial, portal venous, and equilibrium) multidetector CT for follow-up. Two radiologists independently reviewed these images, and conspicuity of tumor margins and detection of residual or recurrent tumor were assessed on a five-point scale with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were evaluated.Results:The mean conspicuity value of tumor margins was significantly higher on MR imaging than on multidetector CT (P Conclusions:Diagnostic accuracy, conspicuity of tumor margins, and detection rate of residual or recurrent tumor were found to be better with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging than with four-phase multidetector CT.
