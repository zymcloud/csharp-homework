Background:The objective of this trial was to analyze the clinical patterns and outcome variables of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in liver transplant patients.Patients and methods:Sixty patients after liver transplantation (LT) for HCC were analyzed. All of them received initially a calcineurin-inhibitor based immunosuppressive regimen. Recurrent HCC was treated by surgical intervention, if eligible, or adjuvant therapies. Furthermore, patients were converted to a Sirolimus (SRL)-based immunosuppressive regimen after tumor relapse. The impact of clinical and histopathological variables on post-recurrence survival was analyzed in uni- and multivariate analysis.Results:Sixteen liver recipients developed HCC recurrence between 4 and 58 months (median: 23 months) post-LT. Sites of first tumor recurrence were lung (n = 5), liver (n = 4), bone (n = 4), cerebrum (n = 1), adrenal gland (n = 1) and peritoneum (n = 1). Seven patients were amenable for surgical resection, while 9 patients were only suitable for adjuvant treatment (n = 4) or general medical support (n = 5). Median survival rate post-recurrence was 65 months (range: 12-136 months) in patients amenable for surgical therapy, and 5 months (range: 1-52 months) in patients unsuitable for surgical intervention (P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis identified late (>24 months) posttransplant tumor relapse (P = 0.039) and surgical therapy (P = 0.014) as independent predictors of long-term survival after tumor relapse. Five patients are tumour-free alive for a median of 65 months after surgical resection of recurrent HCC and conversion to SRL.Conclusion:Liver transplant patients with HCC recurrence should be treated surgically, if eligible, since this is an independent predictor of long-term survival.
