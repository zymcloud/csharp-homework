There is no established protocol proven to be beneficial for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation. Only a few reports have shown direct treatment by surgery or ablation to be independent predictors of survival for localized recurrence. Moreover, the necessity of immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection makes many physicians hesitate to administer systemic chemotherapy. This case report documents a case in which the administration of an herbal product, an extract of the lacquer tree, Rhus verniciflua Stokes, was associated with a decrease in the size of lung metastases in a patient with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation refractory to doxorubicin. This patient experienced prolonged survival compared with average survival times and little toxicity.
