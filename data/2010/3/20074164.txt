Background and aim:To assess the significance of adequate alpha-fetoprotein decrease in monitoring the treatment effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Methods:A total of 72 RFA treatments in 54 HCC patients were analyzed. The favorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease was defined as the alpha-fetoprotein half-life of less than 7 days. The efficacy of the ablation response is assessed by standard imaging modality, a computed tomography scan 1 month after RFA. We assessed the correlation between different alpha-fetoprotein decreases and treatment outcomes by standard imaging modality.Results:Of the 72 therapies, 15 (21%) were favorable alpha-fetoprotein decreases. Fifty-one (71%) therapies showed concordant results through standard image modality and alpha-fetoprotein decrease, including 14 (27%) therapies with a complete radiological response and favorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease, and the remaining 37 (73%) therapies with an incomplete radiological response and unfavorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease. The accuracy was 70.8% by using alpha-fetoprotein decrease in the detection treatment response based on a complete radiological response. Among the 34 therapies with a complete radiological response, 14 therapies with a favorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease had a better disease-free survival curve than 20 therapies with an unfavorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease (P = 0.003). Only one case had a favorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease, but incomplete radiological response, with massive necrosis, with the exception of a small residual tumor.Conclusions:A favorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease has better predictive power for disease-free survival than for an unfavorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease. HCC patients after RFA with an unfavorable alpha-fetoprotein decrease should be considered to have undergone incomplete treatment, despite the complete response by standard image modality post-RFA.
