Purpose:Egyptian hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients present at advanced stages. We aimed to study the influence of surveillance versus non-surveillance on HCC staging and the potential therapeutic options.Methods:A retrospective study to evaluate the effect of surveillance on early detection of HCC among cirrhotic patients from 2003 to 2008. Patients examined every 6 months using ultrasound and α-fetoprotein (α-FP) (group A) and those diagnosed with those that present for the first time symptomatically or incidentally (group B). Groups were compared for α-FP level, tumour characteristics, severity of liver disease; tumour staging was evaluated by Okuda, CLIP and BCLC staging systems, in addition to the potential therapeutic options.Results:Group A comprised 122 HCC cases and group B 473. Surveillance improved HCC detection: at the stage of single nodule in 62.3% in group A versus 52.2% in group B, (P = 0.046) and reduced the percentage of HCC with portal vein thrombosis in 16.4 versus 33.8%, (P = 0.000) and the percentage of α-FP >400 ng/ml in 19.5 versus 32.6%, (P = 0.006) in groups A and B, respectively. Surveillance doubled the detection of HCC at early stage of BCLC (25.4 vs. 11.9% P = 0.000) and doubled the patients' chance for loco-regional ablation (12.3 vs. 5.9%, P = 0.015) and liver transplantation (10.7 vs. 3.2%, P = 0.001) in groups A and B, respectively.Conclusion:HCC surveillance increases early detection of HCC and doubled the chances for curative options. Implementation of both HCC surveillance and cadaveric liver transplantation programs should be recommended in Egypt.
