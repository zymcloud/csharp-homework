Introduction:Significant proportions of liver cirrhotic patients develop hepatocellular carcinoma and have to undergo hepatic resection. The compromised cirrhotic liver cannot withstand further removal of hepatic tissue, thus, leading to postoperative complication and death.Methods:In this study, we enrolled 20 patients having liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma and randomly assigned them into two groups to receive autologous stem cells or placebo.Results:After 3 weeks, all participants underwent liver resection and were followed for 12 weeks postoperative. We observed that the group receiving preoperative stem cell therapy had shown a significant improvement in all parameters of liver function and had no postoperative complications compared to the group treated with placebo, which showed no improvement in liver parameters and had postoperative complications.Discussion:In conclusion, autologous stem cell therapy can improve the surgical outcome in cirrhotic livers and should be considered as an adjuvant treatment in such patients undergoing hepatic resection.
