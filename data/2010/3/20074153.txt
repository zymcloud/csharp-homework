Background and aims:We evaluated the prognosis and associated factors in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; up to 3 nodules, each up to 3 cm in diameter) treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as first-line treatment.Methods:Eighty-eight consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous RFA as first-line treatment were enrolled, among whom 70 who had hypervascular HCC nodules which were treated by a combination of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and RFA. RFA was repeated until an ablative margin was obtained.Results:The rate of local tumor progression at 1 and 3 years was 4.8% and 4.8%, respectively. The rate of overall survival at 3 and 5 years was 83.0% and 70.0%, and the rate of disease-free survival at 3 and 5 years was 34.0% and 24.0%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, age ( 2 cm; risk ratio [RR] = 4.629, 95% CI = 1.241-17.241, P = 0.023).Conclusion:Percutaneous RFA under the protocol reported here has the potential to provide local tumor control for small HCC. In addition to host factors, time interval from RFA to recurrence was an important determinant of prognosis.
