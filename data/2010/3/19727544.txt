Background:The value of prophylactic abdominal drainage in patients undergoing hepatectomy is controversial. We carried out a retrospective study to clarify the value of this procedure.Methods:The study subjects were 1269 consecutive patients who underwent elective hepatectomy with drain insertion for malignant tumors without associated gastrointestinal procedures or bilio-enteric anastomosis. Symptomatic abdominal fluid collections were treated by the drain salvage method, percutaneous puncture, and/or re-operation, in that order of preference.Results:One patient died (mortality rate, 0.07%) and 7 patients had postoperative bleeding (0.6%). Bile leakage, found in 111 (8.7%) patients, subsided with retention of the drain in 78 (70%) and use of the drain salvage technique in 8 (7.2%), whereas percutaneous puncture and re-operation were required in 11 (9.9%) and 14 (12.6%). Symptomatic fluid collection, observed in 65 (5.1%) patients, was treated by the drain salvage technique in 20 (31%) patients, while puncture and re-operation were required in 25 (38%) and 20 (31%).Conclusions:Placement of drains was effective in a considerable proportion of patients undergoing hepatectomy, with regard to reducing the frequency of development of subphrenic fluid collections and biliary fistula/biloma formation.
