Serum soluble interferon-alpha/beta receptor (sIFN-alpha/betaR) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were evaluated in the patients with gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary-pancreatic cancer. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of serum sIFN-alpha/betaR with that of serum hs-CRP and evaluated the two diagnostic parameters in combination. Serum sIFN-alpha/betaR levels were measured in 92 patients and 25 healthy individuals by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The diagnoses were 37 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 17 cases of pancreatic cancer, 15 cases of colon cancer, 13 cases of biliary tract cancer, and 10 cases of gastric cancer. Serum levels of sIFN-alpha/betaR and hs-CRP were significantly higher in the patients than in healthy individuals (p
