Background and aims:Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are associated with a higher risk of colon cancer. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded as a manifestation of metabolic syndrome in the liver. This investigation was initiated to determine whether NAFLD has a relationship to colorectal adenomatous polyps.Methods:We examined the 2917 participants who underwent a routine colonoscopy at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in 2007. We divided the 2917 subjects into the adenomatous polyp group (n = 556) and the normal group (n = 2361). Anthropometric measurements, biochemical tests for liver and metabolic function, and abdominal ultrasonographs were assessed.Results:The prevalence of NAFLD was 41.5% in the adenomatous polyp group and 30.2% in the control group. By multiple logistic regression analysis, NAFLD was found to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenomatous polyps (odds ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.60). An increased risk for NAFLD was more evident in patients with a greater number of adenomatous polyps.Conclusion:NAFLD was associated with colorectal adenomatous polyps. Further studies are needed to confirm whether NAFLD is a predictor for the development of colorectal adenomatous polyps and cancer.
