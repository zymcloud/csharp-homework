Aim:To identify new markers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a proteomic analysis.Methods:Patients with liver cirrhosis of the three most frequent etiologies: hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus and alcoholic liver disease, were included in the study. The samples were analysed by 2D-electrophoresis in order to determine the differential protein expression. The proteins were separated according to the charge in immobilized pH 3-10 gradient strips and then by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins of interest were excised, digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were separated and identified.Results:Three differentially expressed apolipoproteins (Apo) were identified based on the protein profile using proteomic techniques: Apo-A1, Apo-A4 and Apo-E. Apo-A4 levels were significantly lower in HCC than in non-HCC patients regardless of etiology (P Conclusion:Apo-A4 and Apo-A1 may be used clinically as biomarkers of HCC with a high sensibility and specificity. These findings may provide additional insights into the mechanism of HCC development and progression.
