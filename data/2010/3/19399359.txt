Background:Benign obstructions of the liver hilum are occasionally encountered in surgically resected cases. Some of these cases are pathologically classified as benign sclerosing cholangitis and are not clearly categorized. This study aims to elucidate the clinicopathological features of benign sclerosing cholangitis of unknown origin.Methods:Patients who had undergone surgery of the proximal bile duct from 1993 to 2008 on suspicion of proximal bile carcinoma were evaluated, then their clinical presentation, histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were retrospectively analyzed.Results:One hundred seventy-six patients underwent surgery during this period. Of these, five patients were diagnosed with benign sclerosing cholangitis of unknown origin. All five patients were middle-aged with no history of autoimmune disease. One patient died of recurrent cholangitis after surgery. Histopathologically, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrations were observed in all five cases. Among them, the clinicopathological findings of one patient were compatible with IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis, and the other two patients had unusual histopathological findings with prominent lymph follicular formation.Conclusions:Although patients with benign sclerosing cholangitis of unknown origin comprise a heterogeneous population, they can be further classified into subgroups. The response to immunosuppressive therapy, long-term prognosis and histological morphology of the disease should be considered in order to classify these cases of sclerosing cholangitis.
