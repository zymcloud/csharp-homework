Background:A prolonged survival in liver transplant recipients due to a better management exposes them to multiple factors that can impair neurologic function in the long term.Methods:Twenty-two patients were studied by brain magnetic resonance and completed a neuropsychologic assessment shortly before liver transplant, 6 to 12 months after (short term), and 6 to 9 years (long term) after liver transplant. Thirteen healthy controls matched by age were studied in parallel.Results:An enlargement in the ventricular size (an indirect measure of brain volume) was observed in the short term (+8%) and in the long term after liver transplant (+22%); the size of ventricles was larger than in healthy controls. In addition, a progression in the volume of focal T2 white matter lesions (an index of small vessel cerebrovascular disease) was detected in the long term (+49%) and was related to vascular risk factors in those with larger increases (>12.5% per year). Neuropsychologic function showed a significant improvement after liver transplant and remained stable in the long term, except for memory loss in those patients with larger increases in white matter lesions.Conclusions:Improvement in neuropsychologic function after successful liver transplant can be demonstrated up to 9 years. However, these patients experience a progressive accumulation of focal T2 brain lesions and show a smaller brain volume than controls, which can be related to their previous cirrhosis. A good management to minimize brain injury before transplantation and an accurate treatment of vascular risk factors may be important to prevent consequences on cognitive function.
