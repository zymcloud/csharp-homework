Objective:To report clinical and pathological findings of a patient with late onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), progressive cerebellar ataxia (PCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patient:A 64-year-old woman, with a long lasting IDDM, progressively developed a severe cerebellar syndrome and died 2 years after the onset of the symptoms for a systemic infection. Autoantibodies to antigastric parietal cell and anti-pancreatic islet cell resulted positive. Autopsy showed a selective loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, with an increase of Bergmann glia and variable microglial proliferation; furthermore, it disclosed an HCC. GAD-Abs were detected both in serum and CSF.Conclusions:Clinical and experimental reports suggest a possible role of neoplastic cells in producing GAD-Abs. We postulate, in our case, that HCC could have been responsible for an overproduction of GAD-Abs, leading to the onset of PCA. Thus, GAD-Abs could be considered as a paraneoplastic marker in a subgroup of patients with PCA.
