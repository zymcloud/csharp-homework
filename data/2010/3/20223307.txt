Purpose:Ciliated Hepatic Foregut Cyst (CHFC) is a rare congenital lesion arising from the embryonic foregut. Since squamous cell carcinomas arising from CHFC have been reported in adults, complete resection should be considered. We report our experience with CHFC.Methods:We reviewed the charts of 2 patients who had surgery after prenatal detection of a CHFC and 2 patients with postnatal diagnosis.Results:Two patients had antenatally detected liver cyst. Postnatal ultrasonography showed a cyst in segment IV, with wall calcifications and sediments. Bile ducts were encased in the wall of the cyst. They underwent central hepatectomy with double biliary diversion and uneventful post operative course. The two other patients underwent non anatomical resection of a cyst on the left lobe and in segment IV, found prior or during liver surgery. Pathology examination showed cysts filled with mucinous fluid, surrounded by an epithelium composed of ciliated cells. One case had a squamous metaplasia.Conclusion:In infants, CHFC are found antenatally or incidentally. A solitary uni or mutilocular cyst with wall calcifications, sediments, located in the central liver segments should raise the diagnosis. Resection of large cysts in the central segments of the liver is challenging and biliary diversion should be considered.
