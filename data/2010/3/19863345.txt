Aim of this paper is to review and describe Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measures applied in kidney cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and leukemia patients under drug therapy. A comprehensive search in PubMed was conducted to identify studies assessing quality of life (QoL) in these indications. In total 32 studies, including four studies through reference list checking and 21 different HRQoL instruments, were identified. Six generic, five disease-specific, and 10 domain-specific instruments were identified. In conclusion no overall standards in HRQoL measurement could be observed in the respective indications.
