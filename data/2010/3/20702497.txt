Background:This study was carried out to observe the radioprotective effect of Panax ginseng root extract (PGE) against radiation-induced hematological and biochemical alterations in blood and liver of mice. Materials and methods. Adult Swiss albino mice were exposed to 6 Gy gamma radiation in the presence (experimental) or absence (control) of PGE to study the quantitative and qualitative alterations in the blood and liver.Results:Radiation exposure resulted in a significant decline (P<.001) in erythrocyte count, hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit (Hct) in peripheral blood. Maximum changes in all the parameters were observed on day 3 after irradiation. In contrast, PGE-pretreated irradiated animals showed a significant increase in erythrocyte, Hct, and Hb values compared with irradiated controls. Furthermore, a significant elevation in lipid peroxidation level over normal was recorded in irradiated control mice, whereas this increase was considerably lesser in PGE pretreated animals. Likewise, pretreatment with PGE caused a significant increase in glutathione levels in serum as well as in liver in comparison to irradiated controls.Conclusion:From this study, it is clearly evident that PGE provides protection against radiation-induced hematological and biochemical alterations in Swiss albino mice.
