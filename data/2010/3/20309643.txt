Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive cancer. For patients who are diagnosed with advanced stage disease that are not surgical candidates, the disease is universally lethal. Advance has been made to extend survival with molecular target therapy, but durable complete responses are extremely rare. We report an unusual case where a 74-year-old patient with unresectable HCC received eight months of reduced-dose of sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and achieved a durable complete remission. At the most recent follow up, he remains in remission 16 months after cessation of treatment, without clinical or imaging evidence of disease recurrence.
