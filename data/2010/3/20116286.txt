Purpose:To determine whether chemoembolization can benefit patients with unresectable recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Materials and methods:Twenty-eight of 71 patients (39%) with unresectable recurrent HCC following OLT and without contradictions to chemoembolization were included: 14 patients received chemoembolization after OLT (chemoembolization group) and 14 matched control subjects who did not receive chemoembolization (non-chemoembolization group). Tumor response was determined with follow-up computed tomography after each chemoembolization procedure and classified into four grades according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Overall survival was evaluated from OLT and from the diagnosis of recurrent HCC.Results:Within a median follow-up of 14.5-months, 12 of the 14 patients in the chemoembolization group (86%) and 13 of the 14 in the non-chemoembolization group (93%) developed new recurrences. Eight of the 14 patients in the chemoembolization group (57%) showed partial tumor response (>30% reduction in the size of target lesions). Moreover, patients who underwent chemoembolization had a significantly longer overall survival after OLT (P = .0133) and after the diagnosis of HCC recurrence (P = .0338) compared to those who did not. No severe complications developed in patients receiving chemoembolization during follow-up.Conclusions:Lobaplatin-based chemoembolization may elicit effective tumor response for recurrent HCCs and improve the overall survival of patients with unresectable HCC recurrence following OLT.
