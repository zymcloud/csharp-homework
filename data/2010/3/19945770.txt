Objectives:To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before liver transplantation (LT) and its influence on survival and tumor recurrence in patients transplanted for HCC.Patients and methods:We included 67 liver transplant patients with a preoperative diagnosis of HCC and pathological confirmation in the native liver between January 2000 and October 2007. Treatment before LT was performed in 46 (68.7%) patients [radiofrequency ablation in 18, transarterial chemoembolization in 31 and percutaneous ethanol injection in two].Results:The median time between inclusion on the waiting list and LT was 4 months and was similar in treated and untreated patients. The median time between pre-transplantation locoregional therapy and LT was less than 6 months in 65.2% of the patients. Treated patients had better liver function (Child A 52.2 vs 19%; Child B 39.1 vs 33.3%; Child C 8.7 vs. 47.6%; p=0.001) and a higher proportion of total tumor size > 3 cm (59.1% vs 30%; p=0.031). Total tumor necrosis was observed in 26.1% of the patients, with no differences according to treatment modality or tumor size. Tumor recurrence occurred in six patients (9%). The median time between LT and tumor recurrence was 26.5 months with a subsequent median survival of 6.6 months. Overall survival was 83.5%, 69.9% and 59.5%, and tumor recurrence-free survival was 83.5%, 68.3% and 58% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively. Previous HCC treatment showed no influence on survival or tumor recurrence. Likewise, the grade of tumor necrosis was unrelated to overall survival or the probability of recurrence.Conclusion:Treatment of HCC before LT in patients with a waiting list time of less than 6 months does not appear to influence survival or tumor recurrence.
