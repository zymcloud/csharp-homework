Adrenal cortical carcinoma is a rare diagnosis and may present with hormone secretion. A histological differentiation between an adrenal cortical adenoma and carcinoma can be very difficult. However, a fast diagnosis including staging and complete surgical resection is pivotal for the prognosis of an adrenal cortical carcinoma. Metastasing adrenal cortical carcinoma should be treated with a mitotane based chemotherapy, and inclusion in the "firm-act study" is highly recommended. The present case report demonstrates the diagnostic pitfalls in a female patients with Cushing's syndrome who suffered from metastasing adrenal cortical carcinoma.
