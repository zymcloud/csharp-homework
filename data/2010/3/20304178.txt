Introduction:Liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an accepted therapeutic modality, depending on the size and number of nodules. Since a high incidence of incidental HCC at transplantation has been reported, our aim was to evaluate the histopathologic characteristics of these patients.Patients and methods:This retrospective analysis from March 1998 to June 2009 included liver transplantation patients without increased alpha-fetoprotein or nodules on imaging methods. We included patients with HCC on anatomopathologic exam, excluding those presenting with HCC on the presurgery evaluation through clinical, laboratory and imaging methods.Results:Among the 277 transplanted subjects, 27 showed incidental HCC. The alpha-fetoprotein average level was 8.52 mg/dL (1.6-28.2). One patient presented with adenomatosis and focus of HCC. Histopathologic analyses showed: mean tumor size was 0.9 cm (range = 0.4-3.5); average number of tumors in each explanted liver 1.85 (range = 1-7) nodules; and three (11.1%), microvascular invasion (11.1%). The TNM staging showed 17 (63%) stage I and 6 (22%) stage II. The Edmondson and Steiner classification showed 19 (70%) subjects in degree II.Conclusion:The histopathologic presentation of incidental HCC after liver transplantation showed tumors in early stage with microvascular invasion in some cases.
