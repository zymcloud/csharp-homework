Volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) Cl(-) channels are critical for the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response triggered upon cell swelling. Recent evidence indicates that H(2)O(2) plays an essential role in the activation of these channels and that H(2)O(2) per se activates the channels under isotonic isovolumic conditions. However, a significant difference in the time course for current onset between H(2)O(2)-induced and hypotonicity-mediated VSOR Cl(-) activation is observed. In several cell types, cell swelling induced by hypotonic challenges triggers the release of ATP to the extracellular medium, which in turn, activates purinergic receptors and modulates cell volume regulation. In this study, we have addressed the effect of purinergic receptor activation on H(2)O(2)-induced and hypotonicity-mediated VSOR Cl(-) current activation. Here we show that rat hepatoma cells (HTC) exposed to a 33% hypotonic solution responded by rapidly activating VSOR Cl(-) current and releasing ATP to the extracellular medium. In contrast, cells exposed to 200 microm H(2)O(2) VSOR Cl(-) current onset was significantly slower, and ATP release was not detected. In cells exposed to either 11% hypotonicity or 200 microm H(2)O(2), exogenous addition of ATP in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+) resulted in a decrease in the half-time for VSOR Cl(-) current onset. Conversely, in cells that overexpress a dominant-negative mutant of the ionotropic receptor P2X4 challenged with a 33% hypotonic solution, the half-time for VSOR Cl(-) current onset was significantly slowed down. Our results indicate that, at high hypotonic imbalances, swelling-induced ATP release activates the purinergic receptor P2X4, which in turn modulates the time course of VSOR Cl(-) current onset in a extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent manner.
