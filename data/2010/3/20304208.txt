Objective:To analyze the characteristiscs, evolution and survival of patients included on the waiting list (WL) for liver transplantation (OLT).Patients and methods:Between February 2002 and April 2009, 254 patients were included on WL to receive a first graft. Two hundred twenty-two patients (87.4%) were transplanted (group T); 7 (2.8%) died on the WL and 25 (9.8%) were excluded, namely, 13 (52%) due to improvement (group IE) and 12, for other reasons (group OE). Data collected prospectively were analyzed retrospectively.Results:Indications for transplant were cirrhosis (58%), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 29%) and other etiologies (13%.) Average time on the WL was 60.3 +/- 62.9 days. Significant differences were not observed among the groups with respect to age, gender, or indication for OLT. The probability for exclusion due to progression and/or death was not significantly greater among patients included for HCC than for other reasons (P = .6). Survivals at 1, 3, and 5 years after WL inclusion were 81.2%, 73.3%, and 68.6%, respectively, in the whole series; and 85,4%, 76,9%, and 71.7% in group T. All group OE patients died before the first year, while group IE showed a survival of 100%, 91.7% and 91.7% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Survival was not different between groups T and IE (P = .03), but was lower in group OE than in groups T or IE (P Conclusion:The list mortality rate in our series was low, probably in relation to the short waiting time. The rate of exclusion from WL was 10%. Patient with hepatocellular carcinoma were not at an increased risk of WL exclusion. Patients excluded due to improvement displayed excellent survivals during the 5 years following exclusion.
