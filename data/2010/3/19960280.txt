Introduction:We report a rare case of a 23-year-old male who presented with abdominal discomfort for 15 days. An ultrasound was performed which showed a hypoechoic, heterogenous mass in the left lobe of the liver and distended portal vein, followed by further investigation with computed tomography (CT), MRI, and MRA. Serum alpha-fetoprotein was not elevated and hepatitis B antigen was negative.Methods:CT scan depicted a nodular mass in left liver lobe with occlusion of both the central part and the two main branches of intrahepatic portal vein.Result:Biopsy of the liver mass led to a diagnosis of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.Conclusion:Fibrolamellar carcinoma is an uncommon variant of hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis is suggested by radiographic studies and is confirmed by histological examination.
