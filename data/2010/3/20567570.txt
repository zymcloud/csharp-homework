Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer worldwide. The impact of this disease is great, as it is the third-leading cause of global cancer-related mortality. Traditionally, patients with HCC did not present until they were in late stages of the disease, limiting their therapeutic options. In recent years, improvements in disease awareness, as well as in surveillance and screening techniques, have led to earlier diagnosis and the potential for improved prognosis and patient survival. Some current treatments rely on surgical or locoregional techniques, many of which were not suitable for patients with advanced stage disease. In addition to surgical resection, advances in radiofrequency ablation and tran-sarterial chemoembolization procedures have increased survival. However, these improvements are short-lived, requiring alternative therapies for patients with recurrent or advanced-stage HCC. Although conventional chemotherapeutic agents have traditionally been administered in this setting, their role in HCC is decreasing as advances in targeted therapies have proven successful in this disease. Notably, treatment with the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib led to significant improvements in survival in phase III clinical studies, resulting in its approval for unresectable HCC. This clinical roundtable provides an overview of HCC, first focusing on the recognition of the disease. This overview is followed by an in-depth discussion of successful management of HCC using a multimodality approach. Techniques in surgical resection and locoregional therapy are described, as are the safety and efficacy of new systemic and targeted agents. Upon completion of this activity, physicians will have an improved understanding of the occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment of HCC.
