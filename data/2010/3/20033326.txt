Background:We explored the predictors of response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with recurrent intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy and investigated the survival of these patients according to the response to TACE.Methods:We analyzed data from 199 consecutive HCC patients who underwent curative liver resection and who later received repeat TACE for intrahepatic HCC recurrence.Results:Of 199 patients, 139 (69.8%) achieved complete necrosis (CN) of HCC after repeated TACE (mean TACE session number, 1.3) and the other 60 (30.2%) (non-CN group) did not achieve CN. At hepatectomy, the CN group showed significantly smaller proportions of tumor capsular invasion, microvascular invasion, and pathologic tumor-node-metastasis stage III or IV HCCs. At first TACE, the CN group showed a significantly greater proportion of patients with time to recurrence > or = 1 year, Child-Pugh class A, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels Conclusions:CN after repeat TACE for postresection intrahepatic recurrence was attained more commonly in patients with smaller tumor size and lower tumor number at first TACE and favored longer survival in recurrent patients.
