Liver fibrosis (LF), where the chronic HCV infection is a major cause, is a characteristic of chronic liver diseases. LF results from chronic damage to the liver in conjunction with the accumulation of ECM proteins. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their specific inhibitors (TIMPs) are thought to play an essential role in the hepatic lesions. The available data concerning the circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in chronic hepatitis C are not conclusive. Therefore, the present study was designed to seek the relationship between serum MMP-9, and TIMP-1 to liver status in chronic liver disease in fifty patients divided into three groups (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were analyzed by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that the lowest serum level of MMP-9 was found in chronic hepatitis patients compared to the control ( P
