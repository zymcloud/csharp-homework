The inhibitor of growth (ING) family proteins have been defined as candidate tumor suppressors. ING4 as a novel member of the ING family has potential tumor-suppressive effects. In this study, we explored the combined effect of adenovirus-mediated ING4 (Ad-ING4) gene transfer plus chemotherapy drug cisplatin (CDDP) on SMMC-7721 human hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo, and its underlying mechanism. We demonstrated that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP induced synergistic growth inhibition, enhanced apoptosis, and had an additive effect on upregulation of Fas, Bax, Bak, cleaved Bid, cleaved caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, and on downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) in SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma cells. Moreover, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP synergistically suppressed in vivo SMMC-7721 hepatocarcinoma subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografted tumor growth and reduced tumor vessel CD34 expression and microvessel density (MVD) in athymic nude mice. Most importantly, Ad-ING4 plus CDDP did not have overlapping toxicities in HL-7702 normal human liver cells and normal liver tissues of mice. The in vitro and in vivo enhanced antitumor effect elicited by Ad-ING4 plus CDDP was closely associated with the cooperative regulation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways and synergistic inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Thus, our results indicate that Ad-ING4 plus CDDP is a potential combined treatment strategy for hepatocarcinoma.
