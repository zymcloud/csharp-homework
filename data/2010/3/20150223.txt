Background:After cardiovascular disease, cancer is the most common cause of death. HESA-A is a natural product of herbal and marine origin. The aim of this study was to investigate the beneficial effects of HESA-A in patients with end-stage metastatic cancers.Methods:In this clinical trial, 30 consecutive patients (18 men, 12 women) with end-stage cancers and liver metastasis at the Cancer Research Center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences were studied. Patients received HESA-A 50 mg/kg/d orally in 2 to 3 divided doses for 3 months. At the start and end of the 1st, 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks of the study, the patients were assessed and hematological and hepatic biochemical indices were measured. Also, the Karnofsky Performance Scale questionnaire was completed for each patient.Results:The mean age of patients was 56.23 +/- 12.10 years. Mean Karnofsky Performance Scale scores of the patients increased from 48 +/- 14.36 to 78.42 +/- 15.37 after 12 weeks of treatment. A total of 90.4% of the patients who remained in the study were alive for 12 weeks. No significant hepatic or hematologic adverse effect was seen during the study.Conclusion:HESA-A appears to be an effective and safe anticancer compound that may increase survival of end-stage patients and can be used in selected cases. Further prospective controlled clinical trials with large sample size and longer follow-up period are warranted to understand the mechanisms of action of HESA-A and evaluate its long-term effects on the survival and quality of life of patients with cancer and as well as its unfavorable side effects.
