Background & aims:We evaluated the long-term outcomes after antiviral therapy of patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Methods:Seventy-five patients with HCV infection and decompensated cirrhosis received therapy with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. We compared adverse-event profiles and mortality rates between patients with or without sustained virologic responses (SVRs). The mean follow-up time off therapy was 51 Â± 18 months (range, 3-78 months).Results:Seven patients with HCV genotypes 1 or 4 (16%) and 17 patients with genotypes 2 or 3 (55%) achieved SVRs. The mean survival times were 53 months among patients who did not achieve SVRs (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-59 months) and 73 months among those who did achieve SVRs (95% CI, 67-80 months) (P = .004). During the study, 25 patients died (2 with and 23 without SVRs). During the follow-up period, 8 of 24 patients with SVRs (33.3%) and 49 of 51 without SVRs (96.1%) experienced further events of decompensation (P Conclusions:Among patients with cirrhosis that is a result of HCV infection and who have progressed to a stage of liver decompensation, an SVR after antiviral therapy is a positive prognostic factor.
