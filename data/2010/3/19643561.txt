Aims:To assess whether combining percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was better than PRFA alone for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:One hundered twenty patients (with a solitary HCCResults:The 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-year overall survival rates for the TACE-PRFA and PRFA groups were 93%, 83%, 75%, 50%, and 89%, 76%, 64%, 42%, respectively (p=.045). Subgroup analyses showed the survival for the TACE-PRFA group was better than the PRFA group for tumors >5.0 cm (p=.031) and for multiple tumors (p=.032), but not for tumors Conclusion:Patients treated with TACE-PRFA had better overall survivals than PRFA alone, but only in a subgroup of patients with tumor >5 cm or multiple tumors.
