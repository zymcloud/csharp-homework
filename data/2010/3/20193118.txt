Background and objective:Accumulating data indicate that docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil has certain effect on advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. This study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel plus nedaplatin and 5-fluorouracil (DNF regimen) in treating advanced esophageal carcinoma.Methods:Forty-three patients with pathologically confirmed advanced esophageal carcinoma treated by DNF regimen: intravenous infusion of docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) over 1 h, intravenous infusion of nedaplatin (100 mg/m(2)) over 3 h, intravenous infusion of leucovorin (CF, 200 mg/m(2)) over 2 h, intravenous injection of 5-fluorouracil (375 mg/m(2)) over 10 min, followed by a 46-hour infusion of 5-fluorouracil (2.6 g/m(2)). The cycle was repeated every three weeks. Treatment efficacy was evaluated every two weeks according to the WHO standards. All patients received at least two cycles of chemotherapy.Results:Patients received a total of 144 cycles of treatment, and all were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Of the 43 patients, 2 (4.65%) achieved complete response (CR), 25 (58.14%) achieved partial response (PR), 9 (20.93%) had stable disease (SD), and 7 (16.28%) had progressive disease (PD). The overall response rate was 62.8%. The median time-to-progression (TTP) was 201 days and the median survival time (MST) was 310 days. Grade III/IV adverse events mainly included neutropenia (20.93%), febrile neutropenia (4.65%), thrombocytopenia (6.98%) and vomiting (9.30%). One patient died of grade IV thrombocytopenia.Conclusion:DNF regimen is effective for and well tolerated by patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma.
