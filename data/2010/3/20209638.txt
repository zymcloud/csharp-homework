The selection of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for liver transplantation is currently based on the size and number of tumors to minimize the risk of recurrence. These criteria measure tumor bulk but may not reflect tumor behavior accurately. A biological marker of tumor behavior could aid with patient selection further. The aims of this study were to determine factors associated with a higher risk of tumor recurrence and to assess the role of tumor proliferation status with respect to recurrence following transplantation. Pathological data on 67 patients who underwent transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma were reviewed, and tumor proliferation was assessed by minichromosome maintenance protein-2 (MCM-2) and cyclin A expression. A Cox regression analysis of factors related to tumor recurrence and overall survival was carried out. Recurrence-free survival was assessed according to compatibility with selection criteria, vascular invasion, and proliferation status. Tumor size, vascular invasion, and highest MCM-2 expression were associated with tumor recurrence by multivariate analysis (P
