A 73-year-old woman visited our hospital complaining of general fatigue and jaundice. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and Î³-glutamyltransferase. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a mass lesion at the ampulla of Vater with dilatation of the common bile duct and main pancreatic duct. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography revealed dilatation of the bile duct and a negative filling defect due to the tumor. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. The specimen included an ulcerated firm tumor of the papilla Vater. The surface of the ampulla consisted of well-differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma, whereas the deep layer, such as submucosal or muscular layer, contained large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma component was positive for chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56. The patient died from multiple liver and bone metastases 13 months after surgery. This is a very rare case of a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma accompanied by adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components.
