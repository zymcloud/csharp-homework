Aim:To investigate the expression of URG4 in HCC (Hepatocellular carcinoma) and its correlation with HBx.Methods:Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression of URG4 and HBx in HCC tissues, adjacent nontumor tissues and normal lives tissues.Results:The expression rate of URG4 in HCC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues were 48% and 54% respectively, while there was only 22.2% weak URG4 expression in normal tissues. Correlation coefficient between expression of HBx and URG4 was 0.38 in HCC tissues (PConclusion:Expression of URG4 in HCC tissues, adjacent nontumor tissues, and HCC cell lines was much higher than that of normal tissues and cells. Expression of URG4 in HCC is closely related with HBx.
