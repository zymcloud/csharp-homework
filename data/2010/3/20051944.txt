Objectives:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are well-known risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetes mellitus (DM) and overweight have also been reported as risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We tried to elucidate the roles of DM and overweight in HCC development in a dual HBV and HCV endemic area of southern Taiwan.Methods:In 2004, a community-based comprehensive screening program was conducted in Tainan County. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV, alpha-fetoprotein, complete blood counts, triglyceride, cholesterol, and glucose levels were examined. DM was defined as fasting blood sugar >126 mg per 100 ml, and overweight was defined as a body mass index >24 kg m(-2). Subjects with thrombocytopenia (platelet count 20 ng ml(-1)) underwent ultrasonographic screening for HCC. A total of 56,307 adults (>40 years old) participated, and 72 new HCC cases were detected and confirmed.Results:In comparisons of all 72 HCC cases with the other 144 individual age-, sex-, residency-, HBsAg-, and anti-HCV-matched controls, only thrombocytopenia and high alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were shown to be independent risk factors. Neither DM nor overweight was shown to be significant in any of the analyses.Conclusions:On the basis of the community-based cross-sectional and case-controlled studies, neither DM nor overweight was a risk factor for HCC in a dual HBV and HCV endemic area. However, male gender, age (> or =65 years), HBsAg, anti-HCV, thrombocytopenia, and high ALT levels were independent risk factors for HCC.
