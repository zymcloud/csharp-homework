Background:Clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma depend on presence or absence of cirrhosis. In the literature there are few reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic patients.Objective:To describe a consecutive series of resected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic liver and to identify prognostic factors of recurrence and survival.Material and methods:Between 1990 and 2006, 51 patients were operated on. Data were retrospectively analysed from a prospectively collected database. Single and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associated with survival and disease-free survival.Results:Thirty-three patients were male, median age 49.8 years. A major hepatectomy was performed in 72%. Morbidity was 43% and mortality was 0%. One-, two- and three-year survival rates were 90%, 75% and 67%, respectively. One-, two- and three-year disease-free survival rates were 65%, 41% and 37%, respectively. Presence of vascular invasion and of positive nodes was statistically significant for survival in univariate analysis but had no statistical significance in multivariate analysis.Conclusions:Major hepatic resection is a safe treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic patients. Both vascular invasion and presence of positive nodes were associated with poor survival. However, neither of them represented an independent variable.
