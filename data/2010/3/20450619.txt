Objective:To investigate the in vitro anti-cancer effects of ouabain combined Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 siRNA upon HepG2 cells and its molecular mechanism.Methods:The Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit expressions of human hepatoma tissue, normal liver tissue and human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, SMC7721 and Bel7402) were determined. The cells received different treatments (0.03 micromol/L siRNA, 0.1 micromol/L ouabain and combination). The proliferation of HepG2 was observed by CCK-8 assay. The activity of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase was measured. The HepG2 cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein levels of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit, MAPK1, Cyclin A, CDK2, PCNA and P21WAF1 were detected by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot.Results:The gray value Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit in hepatoma tissue was 174.74 +/- 16.77 and 65.31 +/- 7.88 respectively in normal liver tissue. The Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 subunit expression of hepatoma tissue was significantly higher than normal liver tissue(P Conclusion:The Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase alpha1 siRNA combined ouabain inhibits the proliferation of HepG2 cells by decreasing the expression of MAPK1 and induces the cell cycle S arrest by decreasing the production of Cyclin A/CDK2/PCNA complex and increasing the expression of P21(WAF1).
