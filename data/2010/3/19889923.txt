Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections represent a global health problem, since these account for 350 million chronic infections worldwide that result in 500,000-700,000 deaths each year. Control of viral replication and HBV-related disease and mortality are of utmost importance. Because the currently available antiviral therapies all have major limitations, new strategies to treat chronic HBV infection are eagerly awaited. Six single-domain antibodies (VHHs) targeting the core antigen of HBV (HBcAg) have been generated and three of these bound strongly to HBcAg of both subtype ayw and adw. These three VHHs were studied as intrabodies directed towards the nucleus or the cytoplasm of a hepatoma cell line that was co-transfected with HBV. A speckled staining of HBcAg was observed in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with nucleotropic VHH intrabodies. Moreover, an increased intracellular accumulation of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and a complete disappearance of intracellular HBcAg signal were observed with nuclear targeted HBcAg-specific VHHs. These results suggest that HBcAg-specific VHHs targeted to the nucleus affect HBcAg and HBeAg expression and trafficking in HBV-transfected hepatocytes.
