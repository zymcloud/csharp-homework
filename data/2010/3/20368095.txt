Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide. In order to investigate the molecular biologic mechanism of HCC's development, we studied the expressions of SE-1, CD105 and CD31 in tumor endothelial cells (TECs) of HCC and in the serum of rats.Methods:We analyzed the expressions of SE-1, CD31 and CD105 in rat HCC tumor tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Twenty HCC bearing rats and eighteen normal rats were examined for the expressions of SE-1, CD31 and CD105 antigens in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results:SE-1, CD31 and CD105 antigens were detected both in HCC tissue and in normal liver tissue with higher expressions of CD31 and CD105 in HCC while the SE-1 antigen expression was higher in normal liver. Similarly, serum CD31 and CD105 in rats with HCC were significantly increased compared with normal rats (t = 2.8628, P = 0.0086; t = 4.4922, P Conclusion:SE-1, CD31 and CD105 are closely related with liver tumor angiogenesis, which is similar to their performances in terms of their expressions in the serum.
