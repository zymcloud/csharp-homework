Better prediction of safety risk and understanding of mechanism of action of drug candidates remain a major challenge in order to prevent late stage attrition. Continuous efforts are made to improve and develop new models, especially in some areas such as hepatotoxicity. Besides primary hepatocytes and transformed liver cell lines, stem cells either isolated from embryos or adult tissues or obtained by reprogramming somatic cells are emerging as a new potential source of unlimited numbers of hepatocytes. Presently, only hepatocyte-like cells expressing low levels of liver-specific markers, especially drug metabolizing and detoxifying enzymes, are usually obtained, making them still unsuitable as metabolically competent cells for toxicity studies. The only exceptions are some hepatoma cell lines, particularly the HepaRG cell line that can differentiate from a bipotent progenitor stage to attain the functional capacity of normal adult hepatocytes in primary culture without losing the indefinite growth property of transformed cells. Since the research field on stem cells is growing fast marked advances might be expected in the next future.
