Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, are the two major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Liver histology of both diseases can be associated with steatosis, oxidative stress and fibrogenesis. Although better defined for HCV, approximately 20% of patients with these diseases can also develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, it has become clear that the presence of metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease negatively impacts HCV-related outcomes, while simultaneously, the progression of HCV may have metabolic consequences in that it encourages or exacerbates insulin resistance. A growing body of evidence suggests that successful treatment of HCV may rely on understanding and addressing the complex and often mutually confounding relationship between HCV and the individual elements that comprise metabolic syndrome.
