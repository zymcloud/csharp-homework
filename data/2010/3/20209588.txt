In selected patients, locoregional therapy (LRT) has been successful in downstaging advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) so that the conventional criteria for liver transplantation (LT) can be met. However, the factors that predict successful treatment are largely unidentified. To determine these factors, we analyzed our experience with multimodal LRT in downstaging advanced HCC before LT in a retrospective cohort study. Thirty-two patients with advanced HCC exceeding conventional and expanded criteria for LT underwent therapy, but only those patients whose tumors were successfully downstaged were considered for LT. Eighteen patients (56%) had their tumors successfully downstaged; 14 patients (44%) did not. No intergroup differences existed with respect to patient characteristics or the types and number of treatments. However, mean alpha-fetoprotein levels were significantly higher in the non-downstaged group than in the downstaged group (P
