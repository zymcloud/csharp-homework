Background:Gross vascular invasion is a well-established prognostic indicator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the biological significance of microscopic invasion remains unclear.Methods:Curatively resected primary HCCs were classified retrospectively into 3 groups: HCCs without vascular invasion (V0), HCCs with microvascular invasion (V1), and HCCs with macrovascular invasion (V2). Microarray profiling of patients with V0, V1, and V2 using Jonckheere-Terpstra (JT) tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests was performed.Results:Distinct patterns of gene expression were demonstrated between V0 and V2 groups; less (L) and highly (H) invasive phenotypes, respectively. It is noteworthy that 2 dendrograms by the hierarchical clustering provided exactly the same assignment results for V1 cases that were thus separated into L and H gene-expression phenotypes. Marked differences were found in overall (P Conclusion:Gene profiling suggested that microvascular invasiveness consisted of a classable mixture of 2 distinct phenotypes. Thus, gene-array analyses may have clinical benefit, because they may in fact be more predictive than other clinical factors.
