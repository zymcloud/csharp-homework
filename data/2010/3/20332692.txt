A 56-year-old female visited our department due to bleeding from a mass in her left breast in November 2007. There was a tumor (diameter, 5 cm) accompanied by ulcer formation and fixation to the pectoral muscle, centering on the left breast Carea. CT examination showed multiple lung metastasis and liver metastasis. Core needle biopsy demonstrated scirrhous carcinoma. The tumor was positive for ER and strongly positive for HER2. After 4 courses of FEC100, 10 courses of trastuzumab / docetaxel combination therapy were performed for a total of 30 weeks. After the therapy, the breast tumor decreased in size, and the lung and liver metastatic lesions disappeared, showing a partial response (PR). FDG-PET examination revealed no abnormal accumulation. In February 2009, left mastectomy was performed. Pathological examination revealed Grade 2b and only a slight residue of cancer cells. This patient with advanced breast cancer accompanied by distant metastasis responded to trastuzumab/docetaxel combination therapy.
