A case of hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) was described in a 26-year-old woman, who was a potential kidney donor for her father and denied taking the oral contraceptive pill. A hypervascular mass of 4.1 cm in largest dimension was detected in the liver segment V by computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The normal levels of liver enzymes, negative serum markers for hepatitis viruses, and non-elevated alpha- fetoprotein level were detected. The wedge resection of segment V was done with an uneventful clinical course. In Western countries, HCAs are known to occur in women in their reproductive periods. It may not be associated with oral contraceptive. Molecular biological studies disclosed three variants of HCAs, i.e., I) with mutation of HNF 1-alpha gene, II) with mutation of beta-catenin gene, and III) no mutation of the two genes. Histological correlations with the three variants as recommended by the Bordeaux group in 2007 could not be accomplished in the present study due to overlapping histological features between the variants I and III. The etiological factors of HCA are known to relate to the contraceptive pill usage in female and the anabolic-androgenic-steroid administration in male. In Thailand, the occurrence of HCA is expected to be only 0.3% of cases with hepatocellular carcinoma.
