Importance of the field:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although patients with early-stage disease have a good prognosis, there has been no effective therapy available for those with advanced disease. Despite the death risk of patients with advanced HCC being reduced with sorafenib therapy, many patients eventually turn out to be refractory to this therapy. Thus, treatment of HCC remains an urgent health concern.Areas covered in this review:Recent improvement in understanding the pathophysiology of HCC at the molecular level has fostered the development of molecular targeted therapies that specifically block the disrupted pathways.What the reader will gain:This review summarizes the preclinical and clinical data from 2004 to 2009 on the efficacy and safety of the emerging drug for the treatment of HCC, including small molecule inhibitors (erlotinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, cediranib, brivanib and dovitinib) and the rationale for combination therapies for patients with advanced HCC.Take home message:Understanding the mechanisms of action, safety and efficacy of these new agents and new methods of combining these drugs may help prolong overall survival of patients with HCC and reduce disease recurrence after surgery or ablative therapies.
