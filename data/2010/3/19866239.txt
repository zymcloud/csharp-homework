Background:Through data mining the Stanford Microarray Database, the CKS1B transcript was found to be frequently upregulated in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with low alpha-fetal protein (AFP) expression. Together with SKP2, CKS1B is known to implicate p27(Kip1) protein turnover promoting cell-cycle progression.Methods:CKS1B, p27(Kip1), and SKP2 were immunostained in 75 HCCs and correlated with clinicopathological features, local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and overall survival (OS). Silencing of CKS1B and SKP2 with interference short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) was performed in SK-Hep1 and Hep-3B cell lines.Results:Immunohistochemically, increased CKS1B and SKP2, and attenuated p27(Kip1) were all associated with tumor multiplicity (P Conclusions:CKS1B protein overexpression in HCCs is implicated in clinical aggressiveness but not in p27(Kip1) turnover, implying presence of p27(Kip1)-independent oncogenic attributes. The combined assessment of CKS1B and p27(Kip1) immunoexpressions effectively risk-stratifies HCCs with different prognoses, which may aid in the management of this deadly malignancy.
