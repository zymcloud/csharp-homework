Myeloperoxidase (MPO) generates reactive halogenating species that can modify DNA. The aim of this study was to investigate the formation of 8-halogenated 2'-deoxyguanosines (8- halo-dGs) during inflammatory events. 8-Bromo-2'-dG (8-BrdG) and 8-chloro-2'-dG (8-CldG) were generated by treatment of MPO with hydrogen peroxide at physiological concentrations of Cl(-) and Br(-). The formation of 8-halo-dGs with other oxidative stress biomarkers in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats was assessed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry using a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb8B3) to 8-BrdG-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibody recognized both 8-BrdG and 8-CldG. In the liver of lipopolysaccharide-treated rats, immunostaining for 8-halo-dGs, halogenated tyrosines, and MPO were increased at 8 h, whereas those of 8-oxo-2'-dG (8-OxodG) and 3-nitrotyrosine were increased at 24 h. Urinary excretion of both 8-CldG and 8-BrdG was also observed earlier than those of 8-OxodG and modified tyrosines (3-nitrotyrosine, 3-chlorotyrosine, and 3- bromotyrosine). Moreover, the levels of the 8-halo-dGs in urine from human diabetic patients were 8-fold higher than in healthy subjects (n = 10, healthy and diabetic, p
