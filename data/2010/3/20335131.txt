Objective:To study the therapeutic effect adenovirus-mediated apoptin gene transfer combined with ADM and CDDP on hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.Methods:In c57BL/ 6 mice bearing hepatocellular carcinoma, the changes of tumor volume, histomorphology, tumor inhibition rate and the side effects were observed after intratumoral injection of adenovirus containing apoptin gene and ADM and CDDP.Results:Seven days after the treatment, the mean volume of the tumor in the mice receiving intratumoral apoptin-containing adenovirus injection combined with ADM and CDDP reduced significantly as compared with that in mice treated with adenovirus vehicle and control group. The tumor inhibition rate in the combined treatment group was 90.13%, significantly higher than that in the control group. No adverse effect of the treat was observed in the course of the experiment.Conclusion:The adenovirus vectors containing apoptin gene combined with ADM and CDDP may serve a safe treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
