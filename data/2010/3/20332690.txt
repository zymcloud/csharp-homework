The patient was a 58-year-old male with small cell lung cancer [T2N1M1 (HEP) ED case] who was treated systemic chemotherapy with 2 courses of CDDP+CPT-11 and 3 courses of CBDCA+PTX. After 5 courses of chemotherapy, the total response was stable disease (SD). Because the primary lesion had achieved a minor response, however, liver metastasis evidenced no change. Because of his good performance status, he was immediately treated by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy ( HAI) using CPT-11 to control the liver metastasis. After the HAI of weekly CPT-11 during eleven months until progression of primary lung lesion, no change in size of the liver metastasis was recognized with decreasing ProGRP (18,400 -->5,800). HAI is considered very useful for disease control without progression and for good quality of life.
