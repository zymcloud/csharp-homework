Therapeutic approaches of cancers have been recently improved by the development of targeted therapies. Amongst these new drugs, some anti-angiogenic molecules have been approved by either the EMEA or the Food and Drug Administration. Sorafenib, one of these inhibitors of angiogenesis, has been established as the standard of care for advanced hepatocellular and renal carcinoma. This paper reviews the safety profile of sorafenib and presents guidelines for the prevention and the treatment of the main side effects associated with this molecule.
