Replacing the two Mn(2+) ions normally present in human Arginase I with Co(2+) resulted in a significantly lowered K(M) value without a concomitant reduction in k(cat). In addition, the pH dependence of the reaction was shifted from a pK(a) of 8.5 to a pK(a) of 7.5. The combination of these effects led to a 10-fold increase in overall catalytic activity (k(cat)/K(M)) at pH 7.4, close to the pH of human serum. Just as important for therapeutic applications, Co(2+) substitution lead to significantly increased serum stability of the enzyme. Our data can be explained by direct coordination of l-Arg to one of the Co(2+) ions during reaction, consistent with previously reported model studies. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments verified that the Co(2+)-substituted human Arg I displays an approximately 12- to 15-fold lower IC(50) value for the killing of human hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma cell lines and thus constitutes a promising new candidate for the treatment of l-Arg auxotrophic tumors.
