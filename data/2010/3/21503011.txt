Background and objective:Bcl-2 family members can be functionally divided into anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic groups. The balance between these two groups may determine the fate of tumor cells. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), this balance is often tilted towards the anti-apoptotic members in tumor cells, leading to resistance to cell death and rapid proliferation.Material and methods:In the current study, we investigated Bcl-2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemically, using specific monoclonal antibodies in liver tissues obtained from two patient groups. The first group included fifty patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) without hepatocellular carcinoma, the other group included twenty five HCVinfected patients but with confirmed HCC. Serum Bcl-2 was assayed using enzyme immunoassay.Results:Results showed serum Bcl-2 was elevated in 82% versus 100% in HCC-free and HCC patients, respectively. Moreover, cytoplasmic staining of Bcl-2 was found in only 16% of chronic HCV patients without HCC, versus 8% in HCC patients. On the other hand, nuclear staining of PCNA was detected in 100% of HCC patients, but in none of the HCV patients without HCC.Conclusion:The results collectively suggest that in HCV-infected patients with and without HCC, apoptosis is dysregulated and proliferation activity perturbed. There may be prognostic and/or diagnostic potential in estimating Bcl-2 and PCNA proteins in these patient groups.Key words:Bcl-2 - PCNA - Apoptosis - HCC - HCV.
