Purpose:This phase II study was designed in order to evaluate efficacy and safety of the combination of vinorelbine (VNB), fluorouracil (FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma (MBC) previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.Methods:From 12/2003 to 12/2007, 51 women (median age 59) were treated. Performance status (PS) (ECOG) was 0-2 (median 0). The chemotherapy consisted of VNB 25 mg/sqm on day 1 added to FU and LV (following De Gramont schedule) on day 1 and 2. Treatment was repeated every 14 days. 518 cycles of CT were administered (median 12). Most common sites of metastatic spread were: bone, liver, lymph nodes, lung.Results:We recorded three cases of G4 neuthropenia and in one case it was febrile; no others G4 toxicities were seen. G3 toxicities were more common, especially neuthropenia (8 patients) asthenia (4) mucositis (2) and Hand-Foot Syndrome (2). Overall response rate was 27.5% (14 patients had a PR) and disease control rate was 76.5%; 12 patients experienced disease progression. Median time to progression (TTP) was 7.70 months and overall survival (OS) was 18.70 months.Conclusions:Results demonstrate that the ViFL regimen has substantial activity in patients with MBC already treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. The combination may be considered a valid choice for the treatment of MBC. Better survival results were seen in patients with visceral metastases than bone involvement. The low response rate shows that the ViFL regimen is not suitable for the neoadjuvant setting.
