Introduction:Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment of choice of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for patients with cirrhosis, mainly those with early HCC. Herein we have present the clinical characteristics and outcomes of cirrhotic patients with HCC who underwent OLT from cadaveric donors in our institution.Methods:From May 2001 to May 2009, we performed 121 OLT including 24 patients (19.8%) with cirrhosis and HCC within the Milan criteria. In 4 cases, HCC was an incidental finding in the explants.Results:The patients' average age was 55 +/- 10 years, including 82% men. Fifty percent of patients were Child class B or C. The average Model for End Stage Liver Disease for Child A, B, and C categories were 11, 15, and 18, respectively. The HCC diagnosis was made by 2 dynamic images in 16 cases; 1 dynamic image plus alphafetoprotein >400 ng/mL in 4; and 4 by histologic confirmation. Twenty patients received a locoregional treatment before OLT: 6 percutaneous ethanol injection, 9 transarterial chemoembolization, 1 transarterial embolization, and 4 a combination of these modalities. The median follow-up after OLT was 19.7 months (range, 1-51). A vascular invasion was observed in the explant of 1 patient, who developed an HCC recurrence and succumbed at 8 months after OLT. Two further patients, without vascular invasion or satellite tumor displayed tumor recurrences at 7 and 3 months after OLT, and death at 2 and 1 month after the diagnosis. The remaining 25 patients have not shown a tumor recurrence.Conclusion:In the present evaluation, OLT patients with early HCC and no vascular invasion showed satisfactory results and good disease-free survival. Strictly following the Milan criteria for liver transplantation in patients with HCC greatly reduces but does not completely avoid, the chances of tumor recurrence.
