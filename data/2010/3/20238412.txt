The authors report a giant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a diameter over 30 cm and weight over 10 kg that was resected completely. A 62-year-old man was admitted because of continuous abdominal uplift. A computed tomography scan demonstrated that the entire abdomen was filled with a giant tumor containing both cystic and solid components with a size of 29 cm x 22 cm. The huge tumor was successfully resected without any complication, such as massive hemorrhage or visceral injuries. The size and weight of the tumor were 35 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm and 10 050 g, respectively. Pathological examination showed that the tumor was a well-differentiated HCC, and alpha-fetoprotein was positive. Postoperative syndrome, characterized by hypovolemic shock, diarrhea and urine retention, was observed and induced by abdominal decompression. This syndrome was resolved with expectant treatment. The patient was still alive without recurrence after a 27-mo follow-up.
