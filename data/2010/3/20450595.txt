Objective:To study the efficacy and toxicity of cyberknife radiosurgery for primary hepatic carcinoma.Methods:From September 2006 to March 2008, 17 patients with clinical stage I-III primary hepatic carcinoma were treated with cyberknife at Tianjin Cancer Hospital. 12 patients received previous treatment of surgery, or interventional therapy or radiofrequency therapy before the cyberknife radiosurgery. Totally 23 lesions in the liver were treatment. The median planning target volume (PTV) was 75 ml (13 - 351 ml). Fiducials were placed in or adjacent to the tumor one week before the CT scan simulation. The median total prescription dose was 45 Gy (range: 39 - 52 Gy) at 3-8 fractions and the median prescription isodose lines was of 78.0% (range: 75.0% - 81.0%.Results:The follow-up time was 3-30 months (median: 14 months). All patients finished the treatment and slightly fatigue was the most common complain. There were 12 patients alive and 5 patients died. All the lesions in liver treated by the cyberknife radiosurgery achieved local control.Conclusion:The cyberknife radiosurgery for primary hepatic carcinoma showed a high rate of local control and minimal toxicity. Long time follow-up is necessary to evaluate the survival data and late toxicity.
