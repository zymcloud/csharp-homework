Objective:To research the effect of anthraquinone extracted from rubiqmnone on growth inhibition, introduction apoptosis and expression of relative gene of bcl-2 of hepatocarcinoma cell SMMC 7721, and provide the effective target of gene therapy.Method:The growth inhibition effect was detected by MTF. Morpholgy, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry were used to observe the cell apoptosis. The effect of anthraquinone on bcl-2mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR.Result:Anthraquinone could inhibit the growth of hepatocarcinoma cell SMMC 7721. The typical apoptosis cells were found by inverted microscope and common microscope. DNA agarose gel electrophoresis showed a typical apoptosis strip. G1 period of cell cycle had apoptosis peak of abnormal diploid by PI simple stain, and cell cycle stopped at G1 period. The apoptosis fuction of anthraquinone introdution hepatocarcinoma cell was further certified by Annexin V-FITC/PI. Anthraquinone could decrease the expression of bcl-2mRNA by RT-PCR.Conclusion:Anthraquinone can significantly inhibit growth of hepatocarcinoma cell and induce apoptosis. The mocular mechanism may be related to down-regulating the expression of bcl-2 gene.
