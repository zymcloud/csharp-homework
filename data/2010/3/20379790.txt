Dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (DCE-US) is a new functional technique enabling a quantitative assessment of solid tumor perfusion using raw linear data. DCE-US allows the calculation of parameters as slope of wash-in or area under the curve (AUC) representing, respectively, blood flow or blood volume. Reduction in tumor vascularization can easily be detected in responders after 1 or 2 weeks and is correlated with progression-free survival and overall survival in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DCE-US is supported by the French National Cancer Institute (INCa), which is currently studying the technique in metastatic breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and renal cell carcinoma, as well as in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, to establish the optimal perfusion parameters and timing for quantitative anticancer efficacy assessments. Currently 490 patients are included in 20 centers and the preliminary results on 400 patients with 1,096 DCE-US demonstrated that AUC could be a robust parameter to predict response.
