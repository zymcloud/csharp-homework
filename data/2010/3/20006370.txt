In order to investigate the global and dynamic host microRNAs (miRNAs)/messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression alteration during in vitro acute HCV infection, a comprehensive microarray analysis was performed using human hepatoma cells. Totally, 108 human miRNAs and 1247 mRNAs were identified whose expression levels changed for more than 2.0-fold in response to HCV infection. Upon HCV infection, signature from the unique miRNA expression pattern reflected the involvement of miRNA-regulated host cellular physiology and antiviral mechanism, whereas a preponderance of differentially regulated genes associated with metabolism, cell growth, apoptosis and cytokine/chemokine pathways. Furthermore, a reverse regulatory association of differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted targets was constructed. Finally, the differentially expressed miRNAs such as miR-24, miR-149, miR-638 and miR-1181 were identified to be involved in HCV entry, replication and propagation. These results suggest that combined miRNA and mRNA profiling may have superior potential as a diagnostic and mechanistic feature in HCV infection.
