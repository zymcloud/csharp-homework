Objective:Protein-energy malnutrition is frequently observed in patients with liver cirrhosis and is associated with their poor prognosis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is elevated in those patients and may contribute to the alterations of energy metabolism. Our aim was to characterize the aberrant energy metabolism in cirrhotic patients with regard to TNF-alpha.Methods:Twenty-four patients (mean age 65 +/- 6 y) with viral liver cirrhosis who did not have hepatocellular carcinoma or acute infections were studied. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited after matching for age, gender, and body mass index with the patients and served as controls (59 +/- 8 y). Serum levels of TNF-alpha, soluble 55-kDa TNF receptor (sTNF-R55), soluble 75-kDa TNF receptor (sTNF-R75), and leptin were determined by immunoassay. Substrate oxidation rates of carbohydrate and fat were estimated by indirect calorimetry after overnight bedrest and fasting.Results:In cirrhotic patients, serum levels of TNF-alpha, sTNF-R55, and sTNF-R75 were significantly higher than those in the controls and correlated with the increasing grade of disease severity as defined by Child-Pugh classification. Serum leptin concentration was not different between cirrhotics and controls but correlated with their body mass index. The decrease in substrate oxidation rate of carbohydrate and the increase in substrate oxidation rate of fat significantly correlated with serum TNF-alpha, sTNF-R55, and sTNF-R75 concentrations.Conclusion:Tumor necrosis factor-alpha might be associated with the aberrant energy metabolism in patients with liver cirrhosis.
