Purpose:The liver is the most common site of metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), and this is a determinant of the prognosis. However, no reliable molecular predictors of liver metastasis have yet been identified.Methods:Sixty-two surgical specimens of colorectal cancer were studied. The first group included 25 patients who achieved a disease-free survival period of at least 6 years (CRC-M0), and the second group included 37 patients with synchronous (n = 22) or metachronous (n = 15) liver metastasis (CRC-M1). SMAD4, p53, and Ki-67 expression levels were assessed immunohistochemically.Results:The loss of SMAD4 expression and elevated Ki-67 expression were found significantly more frequently in CRC-M1 patients than in CRC-M0 patients (P = 0.0047 and P = 0.013, respectively). Statistically significant differences were also observed between the CRC-M0 group and the metachronous metastasis group. No difference was seen in the overexpression of p53 between the groups. A combination analysis of SMAD4 and Ki-67 revealed no cases with maintained levels of SMAD4 and a low Ki-67 expression had or developed liver metastasis.Conclusion:The loss of SMAD4 expression and elevated Ki-67 expression was therefore found to significantly correlate with liver metastasis, regardless of the time of occurrence, thus indicating these factors to be predictive markers for liver metastasis in patients with CRC.
