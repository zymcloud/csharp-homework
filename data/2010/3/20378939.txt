Objective:To report an infrequent case of Stauffer's Syndrome with jaundice as a paraneoplastic syndrome of a metastatic renal cancer.Methods:We describe the set up of cholestatic jaundice without neoplastic liver infiltration in a patient with a metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which turned back with surgery and systemic treatment.Results:Proper treatment of baseline disease enables turn back paraneoplastic signs and symptoms of Stauffer's Syndrome.Conclusions:Reversible cholestatic jaundice without evidence of hepatic disease is an infrequent form of the Stauffer's syndrome. This paraneoplastic syndrome is associated particularly with renal carcinoma but was described in lymphoproliferative diseases, prostate cancer and broncogenic tumors. This paraneoplastic entity is characterized by elevated alkaline phosphatase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and gamma-glutamyl transferase without liver neoplastic infiltration.
