Background:The prognosis of the patients with early recurrence after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is usually dismal.Methods:One hundred twenty-four patients underwent curative resection for HCC at Kyungpook National University Hospital from January 2002 to December 2006. An early recurrence was defined as a recurrence within 2 years after a curative resection. The risk factors associated with an early recurrence were analyzed as well as other risk factors correlated with survival after early recurrence.Results:Early disease recurrence developed in 56 patients (45.2%). The risk factors associated with an early recurrence were a tumor size larger than 5 cm (P = 0.001) and the presence of tumor micrometastasis (P 1.0 mg/dl and macroscopic vascular invasion. (P = 0.004, P Conclusion:The preoperative CRP and macroscopic vascular invasion were associated with the aggressiveness of early recurrent HCC.
