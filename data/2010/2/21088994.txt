The in vitro hepatoprotective effect of the methanolic extract from Ficus gnaphalocarpa (Miq.) Steud. ex A. Rich (Moraceae) on the CCl₄-induced liver cell damage as well as the possible antioxidant mechanisms involved in this protective effect, were investigated. The phytochemical investigation of this methanolic extract led to the isolation of six compounds identified as: betulinic acid (1); 3-methoxyquercetin (2); catechin (3); epicatechin (4); quercetin (5); and quercitrin (6). The hepatoprotective activity of these compounds was tested in vitro against CCl₄-induced damage in rat hepatoma cells. In addition, radical-scavenging activity, β-carotene-linoleic acid model system, ferric-reducing antioxidant parameter and microsomal lipid peroxidation assays were used to measure antioxidant activity of crude extract and isolated compounds. Silymarin and trolox were used as standard references and, respectively, exhibited significant hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities. (5), (6) and (2) showed significant antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities as indicated by their ability to prevent liver cell death and lactate dehydrogenase leakage during CCl₄ intoxication. These results suggest that the protective effects of crude extract of F. gnaphalocarpa against the CCl₄-induced hepatotoxicity possibly involve the antioxidant effect of these compounds.
