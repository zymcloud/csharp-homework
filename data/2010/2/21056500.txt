Background & aims:Evidence on the efficacy of antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative treatment is scarce. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) combination therapy in these patients, compared to cirrhotic patients.Methods:This prospective, multicenter, case-control study recruited 82 consecutive CHC patients with HCC after curative management and 87 sex/age-matched cirrhotic patients. All patients received pegIFN-alpha-2a and weight-based RBV according to current treatment recommendations. The primary outcome measurement was sustained virological response (SVR, seronegative of hepatitis C virus RNA throughout the 6-month post-treatment follow-up period).Results:The SVR rate was significantly lower in the HCC group compared to the cirrhosis group (48.8% vs 64.4%, p=0.04). However, the significantly lower rate of SVR in the HCC group was observed among genotype-1 patients (33.3% vs 60.7%, p=0.005) but not among genotype-2/3 patients (70.6% vs 71.0%, p=0.88). In patients who achieved 80/80/80 adherence, there was no significant difference of SVR rate between groups (50.7% vs 64.2%, p=0.12) Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that rapid virological response (viral clearance during the first 4 weeks of treatment, odds ratio=22.1, pConclusions:The study proved the feasibility of pegIFN/RBV therapy with current treatment guidelines in CHC patients after successful eradication of HCC, with careful monitoring.
