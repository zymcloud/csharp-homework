Background:The surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become prevalent, and the modalities for its treatment have improved.Aim:To understand the changes that occur in the characteristics and prognostic factors of HCC with time.Methods:Newly diagnosed HCC patients were divided into two groups; patients treated before 31 December 2000 (n = 504), and after 1 January 2001 (n = 746), and their clinical backgrounds and prognostic factors were analysed.Results:The number of patients negative for both Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb) increased with time (NBNC-HCC). The size of HCC decreased in patients who were positive for HBsAg (B-HCC) or HCVAb (C-HCC), whereas no difference was observed in NBNC-HCC. The patient survival of C-HCC improved; however, no difference was detected for NBNC-HCC. In multivariate analysis, low albumin, high aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ascites, large tumour size, multiple tumour number and high alpha-fetoprotein were risk factors for survival before 2000, whereas the presence of HBsAg was additionally selected as a good prognostic factor and AST was excluded after 2001.Conclusions:The prognostic factors as well as clinical background of HCC changed with time, and the presence of HBsAg was found to be an additional good prognostic factor after 2001.
