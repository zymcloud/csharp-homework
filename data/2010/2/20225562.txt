Apart from ideal models such as breast cancer, colon cancer and cervical cancer, other cancers particularly broncho-pulmonary cancer, urological (outside the case of the prostate), liver and melanoma do not lend themselves to actions of screening and early diagnosis. This assertion must be qualified because even in these cancers, targeted actions on certain populations may lead to cost-effective actions. The best example is monitoring of cirrhotic patients by ultrasonography and determination of alpha-feto-protein every 6 months which has proved effective in reducing mortality due to primary liver cancer. The monitoring of certain populations of patients with many naevi or a history of melanoma also allows early diagnosis and effective melanoma price, however, the excision of many non-cancerous lesions. Some cancers did not follow this rule because, for instance, the screening and early diagnosis of lung cancer among smokers is still a failure even when using the scanner.
