Introduction:Although there is general correlation between the TNM stage of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its prognosis, there is often significant variability of tumor behaviour and individual patient outcome, which is unaccounted for by pathologic factors alone. Our aim was to estimate perioperative tumor cell dissemination in patients with primary or CRC liver metastases as a possible factor influencing the outcome.Methods:Forty patients were prospectively enrolled in the study from the year 2007 to 2008. Eighteen patients had histologically proven CRC (50% rectal, 44% colonic, 6% colonic and rectal). Sixteen patients (47%) had CRC liver metastases only. The remaining six patients who underwent colon or liver resection for benign conditions, acted as the control group. All patients with malignant pathologies had R0 resections. Blood samples were taken before the surgical incision (T0), immediately after tumor resection (T1) and at the end of the surgical intervention (T2). Data acquisition was performed using a dual-laser FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Circulating malignant cells were identified as being CD45-/cytokeratin+.Results:The analysis of patients overall (CRC resection subgroup and hepatectomy subgroup) revealed that there was no statistically significant difference of the tumoral cell count in the blood per million of hematopoietic cells at T0, T1 and T2.Conclusions:This study demonstrates no differences in the detected circulating numbers of tumor cells at different stages of surgical intervention.
