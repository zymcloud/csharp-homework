Methylation of core histones regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. Recent studies have demonstrated that these methylation patterns have prognostic value for some tumors. Therefore, we investigated dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4diMe) and H3K4 methylating (Ash2 complex) and demethylating enzymes (LSD1) in carcinomas of the hepatic and gastrointestinal tract. High levels of H3K4diMe were rarely observed in 15.7% of hepatocellular carcinoma (8/51) unlike other carcinomas including, in ascending order, cholangiocellular carcinoma/adenocarcinoma of the extrahepatic biliary tract, gastric carcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma (P
