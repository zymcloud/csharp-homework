In living relative liver transplantation, patients are exposed to enormous stress and multifaced monitors are required to evaluate physiologic status of the patient such as blood volume, electrolytes balance, clotting ability and metabolic status including oxygen consumption. To maintain transplanted liver graft function, an adequate oxygen supply to the graft is one of the most important factors. Central venous oxygen saturation is minimally invasive and one of the most useful monitor to evaluate the oxygen demand and supply balance in the graft. A continuous central venous oximetry (PreSep, Edwards Lifesciences, Tokyo, JAPAN) was used. The use of the oxymetry to evaluate oxygen demand and supply balance in a living relative liver transplantation especially in a case of massive bleeding was very effective.
