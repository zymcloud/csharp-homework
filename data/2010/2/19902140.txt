Background and aims:Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptor (IGF-IR) signaling plays important parts in both the tumorigenicity and progression of digestive/gastrointestinal malignancies. In this study, we sought to test the effectiveness of a practical approach to blocking IGF-IR signaling using RNA interference delivered by recombinant adenoviruses.Methods:We constructed a recombinant adenovirus expressing short hairpin RNA targeting IGF-IR (shIGF-IR) and assessed its effect on signal transduction, proliferation, and survival in digestive/gastrointestinal cancer cell lines representing colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and hepatoma. We analyzed the effects of shIGF-IR alone and with chemotherapy in vitro and in nude mouse xenografts, as well as on insulin signaling and hybrid receptor formation between IGF-IR and insulin receptor.Results:shIGF-IR blocked expression and autophosphorylation of IGF-IR and downstream signaling by the IGFs, but not by insulin. shIGF-IR suppressed proliferation and carcinogenicity in vitro and up-regulated apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. shIGF-IR augmented the effects of chemotherapy on in vitro growth and apoptosis induction. Moreover, the combination of shIGF-IR and chemotherapy was highly effective against tumors in mice. shIGF-IR reduced hybrid receptor formation without effect on expression of insulin receptor.Conclusions:shIGF-IR may have therapeutic utility in human digestive/gastrointestinal cancers, both alone and in combination with chemotherapy.
