Purpose:To use the excised cervical lymph node tissue from oral verrucous carcinoma patient with focal squamous cell carcinoma subcutaneously to establish a xenografted model in nude mice.Methods:The xenograft tumors were finally removed for histopathological study and the mice were laparotomized to examine metastatic tumors in livers, kidneys, lungs.Results:The tumor formation rate was 87.5%(7/8),and the appearance of transplanted tumors was like that in human and HE staining showed that the cancer cells of those tumors models and mesenchymal components remained morphologically like the original tumor. The liver, renal, lung and lymph nodes didn't show obvious metastasis.Conclusion:The xenografted model is successfully established with a higher formation rate, and the model morphologically resembles the human tumor.
