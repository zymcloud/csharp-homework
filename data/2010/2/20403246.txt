Objective:To investigate the clinical characteristics and treatment of desmoplastic small round cell tumor.Methods:Five patients with DSRCT were diagnosed and treated in our Hospital from January 1999 to May 2009. Forty-eight cases with complete clinical data were collected and reviewed from 23 published reports. Therefore totally 53 patients with DSRCT were analysed. The survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test.Results:The median age of all cases was 23 (1.5 - 66) years old at the time of diagnosis. 75.5% of patients were male. The most common presenting complaint was intra-abdominal mass or pain (77.4%). In 46 patients (86.8%), the primary tumor was located in the abdomen or pelvis. Fifteen (28.3%) had positive lymph nodes or distant parenchymal metastases. The median follow-up was 1.8 years (range, 0.1 - 10.0 years). The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survivals were 45.8%, 20.8% and 5.7%, respectively. Forty-seven patients underwent surgery. Complete tumor resection was significantly correlated with long survival. The 1- and 3-year survival rates were 70.5% and 53.7% in patients treated with complete tumor resection compared to 37.2% and 4.8% in the incomplete tumor resection cohort (P = 0.0020). Thirty-four patients received chemotherapy and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 60.1% and 35.2%, respectively, however, only 29.7% and 12.7% in patients without chemotherapy (P = 0.0396). Twelve patients had radiotherapy and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 75.0% and 38.9%, respectively, compared with 36.9% and 14.8% in those without radiotherapy (P = 0.0314).Conclusion:Complete tumor resection results in improved survival in patients with DSRCT. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy correlate with improved patient outcome. Multimodal therapy may improve the survival in patients with DSRCT.
