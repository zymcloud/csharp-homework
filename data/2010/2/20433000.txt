Hepatitis Delta virus is a defective RNA virus that requires HBV as helper virus. The two viruses share the same route of transmission, being prevalently transmitted by contaminated blood and body fluids. HDV can infect simultaneously with HBV (coinfection) or in a patient with already established HBV infection (superinfection). A progressive decline in HDV prevalence both as acute or chronic infection has been observed for several years. More recently, several European countries have observed stable HDV prevalence mainly due to migrants from non European countries. Persistent HDV replication has been demonstrated as correlated to cirrhosis development and hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence. Moreover, persistent HDV replication predicts liver related mortality. Early and prolonged treatment may lead to virus eradication, improving long-term prognosis.
