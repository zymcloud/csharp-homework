Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors are rapidly being integrated into the management of cancer. This is the first report of sorafenib and sunitinib, both small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, triggering radiation recall dermatitis. The pathophysiology of radiation recall is poorly understood, and several possible mechanisms have been proposed. The clinical presentations of these two cases were consistent with one hypothesized mechanism of radiation recall, an idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity reaction.
