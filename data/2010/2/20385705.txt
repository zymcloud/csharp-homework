Stilbenes possess a variety of biological activities including chemopreventive activity. This study was conducted to evaluate the structural activity relationships of six methoxylated stilbene analogues with respect to their cytotoxic effects and antioxidant activities on HepG2 hepatoma and Chang liver cells. The cytotoxic and total antioxidant activities of six stilbene analogues were determined by MTT and Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assays, respectively. We found that the cis-methoxylated stilbene: (Z)-3,4,4'-trimethoxystilbene was the most potent and selective antiproliferative agent (IC₅₀ 89 µM) in HepG2 cells. For the total antioxidant activity, compounds possessing hydroxyl groups at the 4' position namely (E)-3-methoxy-4'-hydroxystilbene, (E)-3,5-dimethoxy-4'-hydroxystilbene (pterostilbene), (E)-4-methoxy-4'-hydroxystilbene showed the highest antioxidant activity. Structure activity relationship studies of these compounds demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect and antioxidant activities of the tested compounds in this study were structurally dependent.
