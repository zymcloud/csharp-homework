Doxorubicin-eluting-bead embolization (DEB) is considered a safe and efficient treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a low complication rate and an increased tumor response compared with conventional transarterial chemoembolization. We describe a case of a 69-year-old patient who underwent DEB for HCC and who developed a liver abscess requiring urgent left liver lobectomy. Despite this severe complication, efficacy of DEB embolization was histologically proved as a large ischemic zone with complete tumor necrosis.
