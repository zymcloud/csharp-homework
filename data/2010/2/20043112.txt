In radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), microbubbles appearing during the procedure make it difficult to determine effectiveness with ultrasonography (US) imaging. We developed a modified US-volume system and evaluated its efficacy for demonstrating response to therapeutic RFA. Our US-volume system displays multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images providing a synchronized view with a US image along with past US-volume data in real-time side-by-side on a personal computer. Seventy-eight patients (94 nodules) were enrolled, of whom 35 (47 nodules) were evaluated using this system (US-volume group) and compared to the other 43 (47 nodules) examined before development of our system (control group). All nodules were clearly depicted by US. If the shortage of margin was predicted with US-volume system, we performed additional needle insertion. Tumor necrosis following RFA was graded by dynamic computed tomography as follows: Grade A, necrotic area surrounded in all directions with an adequate margin (>or=5 mm); Grade B, necrotic area surrounded in all directions, though some margin areas
