Background and aim:With the aging of society, the number of elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been increasing in Japan. The Government of Japan defines elderly as being over 65 and has divided the elderly into two stages: the first elderly stage ( or = 75). We investigated the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA) in patients in the second elderly stage in comparison with other HCC patients, retrospectively.Methods:Two hundred six patients with HCC, who were within the Milan criteria, with low-grade performance status (0 or 1) and a Child-Pugh classification of A or B were enrolled. All were treated with RFA from January 2000 to December 2008 as an initial therapy and were divided into elderly HCC group (e-HCC group; > or = 75, n = 63) and non e-HCC group (Results:Age and the level of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist (PIVKA-II) were higher in the e-HCC group as compared with the non e-HCC group (78.3 +/- 3.2 vs 64.2 +/- 7.5 years, 676.3 +/- 2643.7 vs 142.4 +/- 442.2 mAU/mL: P Conclusions:Elderly HCC patients, who have good performance status, should be treated in the same manner and with the same strategy as young HCC patients.
