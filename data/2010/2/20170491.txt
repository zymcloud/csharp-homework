Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major risk factors for chronic hepatitis, which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as for type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), which may further evolve into an overt B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It has been previously shown that B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire, expressed by clonal B-cells involved in type II MC as well as in HCV-associated NHL, is constrained to a limited number of variable heavy (VH)- and light (VL)-chain genes. Among these, the VK3-20 light chain idiotype has been selected as a possible target for passive as well as active immunization strategy. In the present study, we describe the results of a multiparametric analysis of the innate and early adaptive immune response after ex vivo stimulation of human immune cells with the VK3-20 protein. This objective has been pursued by implementing high-throughput technologies such as multiparameter flow cytometry and multiplex analysis of cytokines and chemokines.
