Objective:To isolate and identify the antineoplastic constituents of the marine algae Galaxaura filamentosa.Methods:The constituents were isolated and purified by low-pressure silica gel column chromatography, thin layer chromatography and recrystallization, and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis.Results:Isolated a new antineoplastic cyclic peptide, cyclo-N-methyl-Leucine-Leucine-N-methyl-Leucine-Leucine-Leucine.Conclusion:This new compound was remarkably active against the human renal cell carcinoma GRC-1 and human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell lines with corresponding IC50 values of 4.26 microg/mL and 4.63 microg/mL.
