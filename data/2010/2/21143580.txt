Background:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most frequent aetiological factors associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aim:This study evaluated the temporal trend in the aetiological role played by HBV infection alone in patients diagnosed with HCC during the last 20 years in Italy.Methods:Among the 2042 HCC patients included in the Italian Liver Cancer (ITA.LI.CA.) database, 346 had chronic HBV infection alone. We assessed the proportion of HCC patients with HBV infection in four quinquennia (1987-1991, 1992-1996, 1997-2001, 2002-2006) and evaluated their main clinical, virological and oncological characteristics across these periods.Results:Although the absolute number increased, the proportion of HBV-related HCC relatively decreased over time from 26.7% (47/176 patients) in 1987-1991 to 14.7% (127/862 patients) in 2002-2006 (P=0.0005). Patients' demographical, clinical and virological characteristics were similar across the four quinquennia. A greater proportion of patients was diagnosed with non-advanced HCC in more recent years (from 26% in 1987-1991 to 48% in 2002-2006, P=0.025), likely owing to a growing use of semiannual surveillance (from 63% in 1987-1991 to 80% in 2002-2006).Conclusions:We observed a significant, relative decrease in the role played by chronic HBV infection alone in the determinism of HCC during the last 20 years. In recent years, more patients are diagnosed with non-advanced HCC probably owing to improvements in HCC detection.
