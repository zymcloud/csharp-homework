The Mus81 gene encodes a critical endonuclease involved in DNA repair and tumor suppression. Our previous study has shown reduced expression of Mus81 in hepatocellular carcinoma and its association with the metastatic potential and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of Mus81 in colorectal carcinoma is currently unknown. We therefore carried out the present study to explore the correlation between Mus81 expression and the progression of colorectal carcinoma. Mus81 expression in 92 cases of colorectal carcinoma and matched normal tissues was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that Mus81 expression in colorectal carcinoma tissues was significantly reduced compared with the corresponding normal tissues (P
