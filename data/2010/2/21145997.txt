The purpose of this study was to assess the anti-tumor and immunomodulatory effects of PIE on tumor cells Sarcoma 180 and Hepatoma 22 in implanted mice. The monosaccharide composition of PIE was analyzed by GC. The results demonstrated that PIE monosaccharide composition was n(Xyl): n(Man): n(Fuc): n(Glc): n(Gal)=2.3: 1: 6.4: 22.1: 19.83. The oral administration of PIE characteristically inhibited the growth of S180 and H22 cells and increased the life span. The concentrations of serum IL-2 and IL-18 were significantly increased in the S180 implanted mice fed with PIE in the doses of 500 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg compared with those in control (p<0.01). The concentrations of serum IL-2 were significantly increased in H22 implanted mice in the doses of 500 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg compared with those in control (p<0.01).
