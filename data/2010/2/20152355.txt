Introduction:Choledochal cyst (CC) is closely associated with anomalous arrangement of the pancreaticobiliary duct, which is considered a high-risk factor for biliary tract malignancy. Early diagnosis and early treatment for CC could lead to a good prognosis. This study investigated late complications and long-term outcomes after surgery for CC.Patients and methods:Fifty-six patients with CC and over 10 years of postoperative follow-up were analyzed retrospectively. All patients had undergone total resection of the extrahepatic bile duct and hepaticojejunostomy.Results:Six patients showed liver dysfunction manifested in the first 10 years after surgery, but all returned to normal thereafter. Dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts persisted in 6 postoperatively, and in 3, this was still apparent more than 10 years after. Recurrent abdominal pain was encountered in 3, 1 had pancreas divisum with a pancreatic stone, and 1 had adhesive small bowel obstruction. Two patients developed biliary tract malignancy. A 14-year-old girl died of recurrent common bile duct cancer 2 years after the initial resection of CC with adenocarcinoma. A 26-year-old man with repeated cholangitis owing to multiple intrahepatic bile stones developed cholangiocarcinoma 26 years after the initial resection of CC. Event-free survival rate and overall survival rate were 89% (50/56) and 96% (54/56), respectively.Conclusions:Choledochal cyst generally has an excellent prognosis with early total resection and reconstruction. Long-term surveillance for the development of malignancy is still essential, especially if there is ongoing dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct or biliary stones.
