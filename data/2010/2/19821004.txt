Purpose:We aimed to examine the therapeutic efficacy of ethanolamine oleate iopamidol (EOI) as an embolic material for percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization (PTPE).Methods:Eighty-two patients with liver tumors were treated with PTPE. Fifty-eight patients had hepatocellular carcinomas, 11 had liver metastases, and 13 had other liver tumors. A total of 55 patients (group E) were treated with 5% ethanolamine oleate after gelatin sponge administration. As a control, we evaluated 27 patients (group F) who were treated with fibrin glue and iodized oil. PTPE was mainly indicated before hepatic resection, for patients with high nontumorous volumetric resection ratios (the nontumorous volumetric resection ratio was estimated to be greater than 65% in patients with an indocyanine green retention ratio of 15 min (ICG R15) of 10% or less, and the nontumorous volumetric resection ratio was estimated to be greater than 40% in the patients with an ICG R15 of 10-20%).Results:All patients were successfully treated percutaneously under local anesthesia. Balloon-occluded and ipsilateral approaches were used in 81 patients (99%) and 62 (75%) patients, respectively. The rate of insufficient embolization or recanalization was significantly lower in group E (7.3%) in comparison to group F (25.9%; p Conclusion:EOI is a safe embolic material that can be used to induce greater liver hypertrophy, in comparison to fibrin glue, in PTPE for liver tumors.
