Background:Poorer prognosis is seen in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative hepatic resection with early recurrence (1 year). This study aimed to identify risk factors for postoperative early recurrence of small HCC (Methods:The study population consisted of 158 patients who underwent curative resection for small HCC between January 2002 and July 2004. Risk factors for early recurrence were analyzed.Results:Thirty-three (20.8%) patients developed early recurrence after surgery. Univariate analysis showed the following significant risk factors for early recurrence in small HCC: serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level >100 ng/ml, lack of tumor capsule formation, microscopic vascular invasion, high Edmonson-Steiner grades, and cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) expression (P100 ng/ml (odds ratio 2.561, 95% confidence interval 1.057 to 6.206, P=0.037) and microscopic vascular invasion (odds ratio 4.549, 95% confidence interval 1.865 to 11.097, P=0.001) were independent factors.Conclusions:Postoperative early recurrence is related to serum AFP level >100 ng/ml and microscopic vascular invasion in patients with small HCC. Adjuvant therapy and careful follow-up are required for patients with these risk factors.
