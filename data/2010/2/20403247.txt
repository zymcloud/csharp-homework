Objective:Erlotinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, showing a significant improvement of survival in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after the failure of front-line chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and toxicity of Erlotinib in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients.Methods:A total of 104 patients with advanced NSCLC admitted in our department during December 2006 to November 2008 were enrolled in this study. Eligible patients received oral Erlotinib 150 mg/d until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Best clinical response was determined using RECIST criteria, the adverse events were evaluated according to the NCI criteria.Results:The total effective rate was 27.9% (29/104) and the clinical benefit was 76.0% (79/104). The median progression-free survival was 5.1 months (95%CI 4.0 - 8.0). The median survival time was 13.1 months (95%CI 10.0 - 15.7). The 1-year survival rate was 61.5%. Significant survival benefit from erlobinib therapy was observed for patients with good personal status (HR 0.56, P = 0.006), adenocarcinoma (HR 0.43, P = 0.004) and skin rash (HR 0.46, P = 0.005). But patients with smoking (HR 2.75, P < 0.001) and liver metastasis (HR 2.91, P = 0.002) add the risk of death. The adverse events were mild (grade < or = 2), most common toxicities were skin rash in 73.1% (76/104) and diarrhea in 41.3% (43/104). Only 6.7% (7/104) patients got adverse events of grade > or = 3.Conclusion:Erlotinib is an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for advanced NSCLC and could offer an alternative for patients after the failure of first-line chemotherapy, unsuitable for or not wishing to receive chemotherapy.
