CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), in which multiple genes are concurrently methylated, is an important mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma development. We determined a hypermethylation profile in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined the promoter methylation status of 10 genes in 60 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 60 cases of paired non-tumor tissues, and 6 cases of normal tissues by methylation-specific PCR. The average methylated gene numbers were significantly different between HCC and nontumor tissues (p
