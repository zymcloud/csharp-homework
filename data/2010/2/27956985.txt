Hepatocelluar carcinoma is one of the commonest cancers in Nigeria. Some patients may manifest a variety of paraneoplastic syndromes. Carcinoid syndrome is an extremely rare presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma. A 57-year old man presented with recurrent facial flushing and diarrhea, tricuspid regurgitation, and very high level of urinary hydroxyindoleacetic acid (HIAA) as the first manifestation of a multicentric hepatic lesion which proved histologically to be hepatocellular carcinoma. The lesions also exhibited arterial hypervascularization on contrast enhanced computerized tomography. The patient is still alive after 6 years of symptoms.
