Spontaneous regression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare. We report a case of 67-year-old man having HBV-associated HCC with multiple lung metastases which regressed spontaneously. The patient had single liver mass and received surgical resection. The mass was confirmed as HCC histopathologically. Nine years after surgical resection, a 3.3 cm sized recurred HCC was detected on the resection margin in CT scan. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed 3 times, and lung metastases developed thereafter. The patient received 2 more sessions of TACE, however, metastatic lung nodules were in progress very rapidly. We decided to stop TACE and followed the patient regularly without any anti-cancer treatment. Nine months after development of lung metastasis, the size and number of metastatic lung nodules decreased and were not detected anymore after 14 months. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels also decreased to normal range and no viable tumor was noted in the liver. The patient is still alive 12 years after the first diagnosis of HCC and 16 months after lung metastasis developed.
