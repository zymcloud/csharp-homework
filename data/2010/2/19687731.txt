Purpose:We performed a phase I study to evaluate the feasibility and determine the maximally tolerated dose of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of oxaliplatin in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Patients and methods:Patients with unresectable or recurrent HCC received HAI-oxaliplatin over 2 hours at dose escalation levels of 90, 110, 130, and 150 mg/m given every 3 weeks. The therapy was continued until disease progression or excessive toxicity not amenable to appropriate modifications. Restaging was performed after every 2 cycles.Results:A total of 23 patients were enrolled, with 17 patients evaluable for toxicity assessment. The median age was 63 years (range: 47-84 years), with 22 men and 1 woman. Stage distribution was as follows: stage II, 3 patients; stage III, 12 patients; and stage IV, 8 patients. A total of 53 cycles (range: 1-3) of HAI-oxaliplatin were delivered. The conventional grade 3/4 hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities were infrequent. Among 17 evaluable patients receiving >2 cycles, 3 patients had partial responses and 8 had stable disease. A greater than 50% reduction in alphafetoprotein was seen in the 3 patients with partial responses and 3 patients with stable disease.Conclusions:HAI-oxaliplatin is a feasible, well tolerated, and demonstrated activity in this advanced HCC cohort. HAI-oxaliplatin 150 mg/m every 3 weeks was determined as the dose for further evaluation in phase II trials.
