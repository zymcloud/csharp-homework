Background:The goal of the study was to assess a T2*-weighted MRI sequence for the ability to identify hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Hepatic iron deposition, which is common in chronic liver disease (CLD), may increase the conspicuity of HCC on GRE imaging due to increased T2* signal decay in liver parenchyma. In this study, a breath-hold T2*-weighted MRI sequence was evaluated by a blinded observer for HCC and the results compared to a reference standard of gadolinium-enhanced MRI in these same patients. Forty-one patients (mean age 56.2 years; 17 females) were included in this approved, retrospective study.Results:By the reference standard, 14 of 41 patients had a total of 25 HCCs. The sensitivity of the T2*-weighted MR sequence for identifying HCC, per lesion, was 60%, while the specificity was 100%. There was a significantly lower T2* value of liver parenchyma in patients with HCC identified by the T2*-weighted sequence than in those with HCCs which were not identified by the T2*-weighted sequence (27.8+/-2.2 vs. 21.9+/-2.1 ms; P=.02).Conclusions:A T2*-weighted MRI sequence can identify HCC in patients with CLD. This technique may be beneficial for imaging of patients contraindicated for gadolinium.
