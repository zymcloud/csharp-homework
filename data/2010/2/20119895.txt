Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. The majority of HCCs develops on the basis of a chronic liver disease. This often complicates diagnosis and therapy. Non-invasive diagnostic criteria are based on dynamic imaging techniques and the serum level of AFP (alpha-fetoprotein). When evaluating HCC patients for therapy, besides tumor burden and localisation, the therapeutic evaluation must also consider the general condition of the patient and his/her liver function. For this purpose, the BCLC algorithm of the Barcelona Clinic for Liver Disease has proven helpful. Only one-third of the patients can be cured by resection, transplantation or local tumour ablation. In locally advanced cases transarterial procedures including transarterial chemoembolisation and radioembolisation are applied. HCC is a chemo-resistant tumour and chemotherapy is not accepted as standard of care in HCC. Sorafenib is the first systemic treatment with proven efficacy approved for the treatment of advanced and metastatic HCC. Interdisciplinary management of HCC patients is essential in order to provide every patient with the optimal therapy at his specific stage of disease.
