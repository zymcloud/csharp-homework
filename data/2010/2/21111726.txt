Background:Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF₁₆₅) is stored, transported and released by platelets. Platelet functional abnormalities have been described in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, this study was designed to investigate the behavior of VEGF₁₆₅ with respect to platelet activation in HCC.Methods:Plasma and serum VEGF₁₆₅ and plasma sP-selectin levels were analyzed in patients with HCC (n=70) or cirrhosis (n=45) and control subjects (n=70). Given the thrombocytopenia that characterizes both HCC and cirrhotic patients, plasma VEGF₁₆₅ and sP-selectin as well as serum VEGF (plt-VEGF₁₆₅-load) levels were normalized by platelet counts.Results:Median concentrations of plasma VEGF₁₆₅/platelet (p=0.002) and sP-selectin/platelet (pConclusions:The results obtained are suggestive for VEGF₁₆₅ release by tumor in HCC. It is plt-VEGF₁₆₅-load, but not plasma VEGF₁₆₅ or serum VEGF₁₆₅ that is an independent predictor for overall survival of HCC patients.
