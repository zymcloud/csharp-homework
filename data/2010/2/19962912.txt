Rationale and objectives:To compare diffusion-weighted (DW) with standard T2-weighted imaging for quantitative evaluation of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis.Materials and methods:Fourteen patients (all men; mean age, 58.6 years; age range, 45-69 years) with 22 small HCCs (1 cm in diameter) in cirrhosis were included in the study. DW imaging with breath-hold single-shot echo planar imaging (b = 0, 800 seconds/mm(2)) and T2-weighted imaging with respiratory triggering fat-suppressed fast spin-echo sequence were performed on a 3-T magnetic resonance unit using an eight-channel torso phased-array coil. The signal intensity (SI) of HCC and liver were measured at workstation. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), contrast ratio (CR, SI(lesion)/SI(liver)), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated. CNRs and CRs obtained with DW and T2-weighted images, and ADCs of HCC and liver were compared using nonparametric tests.Results:Two lesions were excluded because of artifacts on DW images. Thus 20 lesions were analyzed. The CNRs obtained with T2-weighted images (27.12 + or - 21.12) were significantly higher (P = .02) than those with DW images (17.52 + or - 13.50). There were no significant difference between the CRs obtained with T2-weighted images (1.83 + or - 0.56) and DW images (2.01 + or - 0.67). There were no significant difference between the mean ADCs of HCC (1.22 x 10(-3) mm(2)/second + or - 0.24) and the cirrhotic liver (1.17 x 10(-3) mm(2)/second + or - 0.17), either.Conclusion:DW imaging with high b value was not superior to standard T2-weighted imaging in terms of lesion conspicuity of small HCC in cirrhosis.
