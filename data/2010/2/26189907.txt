A 65-year-old man presented at our hospital in 2006 because of a liver tumor. He had been treated for chronic hepatitis C with interferon-Î±2b for 6 months in 1998. A pathological examination showed that the hepatic tissue before interferon (IFN) therapy was classified as moderately active hepatitis with severe hepatic fibrosis. The IFN therapy induced the disappearance of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA from his serum and normalized alanine aminotransferase activity. In 2005, a tumor (2 cm in diameter) was detected in the right lobe of the liver by ultrasonography and computed tomography, and the tumor was stained with contrast medium during abdominal angiography. A right lobectomy was performed under the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathological examination revealed that the tumor was an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The noncancerous hepatic tissue was classified as having minimal activity with mild fibrosis. It is important to monitor closely for ICC as well as hepatocellular carcinoma even patients in whom the HCV RNA has disappeared after IFN therapy, because the outcome of treatment for small ICC is favorable.
