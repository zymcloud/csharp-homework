In order to investigate the anti-tumor angiogenesis activity with a recombinant Ag43/FGFR1 chimeric protein (AF) vaccine in a mouse H22 hepatoma model, tumor volume and survival rate of the mice were studied at a 3-day interval. Microvessel density (MVD) was detected by immunohistochemistry. The endothelial deposition of autoantibodies within tumor tissues was examined by immunofluorescent staining, and anti-FGFR1 antibody-producing B cells (APBCs) were tested by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. Compared with the three control groups, the tumor volume was significantly decreased and the survival time was significantly prolonged in AF-immunized group (P
