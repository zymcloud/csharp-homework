Background:Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) achieved significant results by the new treatment with sorafenib (a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor), but, because it has been tested mainly in Child A cirrhosis, patients with impaired liver function are not eligible for the treatment.Methods:This study was an open label phase III randomized trial comparing Synchro-Levels (Alphrema, Varese, Italy) and megestrol, with a 2:1 design, in patients with advanced HCC, planned before the sorafenib registration. End-points were objective response and impact on performance status (primary) and biochemical response (secondary).Results:The patients enrolled were 61 (43 men, 18 women; Child A in 28 [48%] and B in 33 [52%]). Forty-three were assigned to Synchro-Levels, 18 to megestrol. Most patients had multifocal disease (75% in megestrol and 59% in Synchro-Levels) and there was a significant difference in tumor burden, with more advanced disease in the megestrol arm (P = 0.0002). At 3 months, tumor burden was more frequently stable with megestrol, while performance status was significantly better in patients treated with Synchro-Levels. At 6 months, alpha-fetoprotein was more frequently stable or reduced with megestrol. An objective response was observed in a megestrol-treated patient. Mortality was significantly lower and long-term survival significantly more frequent with megestrol.Conclusion:Megestrol treatment shows good results in advanced HCC and could become part of best supportive care in patients not suitable for other treatments, that, despite sorafenib, remain an important share.
