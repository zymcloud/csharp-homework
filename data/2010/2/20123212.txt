The authors describe the case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein (PV) tumor thrombus. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation was applied successfully not only to the main tumor but also directly to the invaded PV. On the last imaging follow-up performed at 16 months after RF ablation the PV remained recanalized. Twenty months after the RF ablation, the patient was still alive with good clinical status.
