Introduction:The long-term outcomes of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) vs. surgical resection in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain controversial. One thousand sixty-one cirrhotic HCC patients were included into a retrospective study. Four hundred thirteen received RFA and 648 received surgical resection.Results:Overall (OS), recurrence-free (RFS), and tumor-free survival (TFS) were compared between the two groups and in subgroup analyses. The 5-year OS and corresponding RFS as well as DFS were significantly higher in the surgical resection group compared with the RFA group (p Conclusions:When treating Childs A cirrhotic patients with solitary HCC larger than 3 cm but less than 5 cm, or with two or three lesions each less than 5 cm, surgical resection provides a better survival than RFA. When treating Childs A cirrhotics with solitary HCC â‰¤ 3 cm, RFA has a comparable RFS to surgical resection, but RFA is less invasive.
