Given the accumulating evidence that gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) is not merely a sensitive marker for liver and bile disorders but also a risk marker for a multiplicity of other chronic diseases, gamma-GT may represent a promising risk indicator for occupational disability, which has emerged as an important public health problem. The association between gamma-GT and disability pension was examined in a cohort of 16,520 male construction workers in WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany, who participated in routine occupational health examinations from 1986 to 1992 and who were followed until 2005. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, hazard ratios were calculated with gamma-GT concentrations in the lowest quartile (1 to 24 U/L) as reference category after adjustment for age and further adjustment for potential confounding factors such as nationality, type of occupation, smoking, alcohol consumption, cholesterol, and body mass index (BMI). Overall, a monotonically increasing association of gamma-GT with all-cause disability pension (total number: n = 2,998 cases) was observed, with the steepest increase at lower levels of gamma-GT. Particularly strong associations were observed for participants in the highest quartile (>67 U/L) and disability pension due to musculoskeletal disorders, diseases of the digestive system, and cardiovascular as well as mental diseases (age-adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals: 1.53, 1.27-1.85; 9.68, 3.10-30.21; 1.76, 1.28-2.42; and 1.83, 1.23-2.72, respectively).Conclusion:gamma-GT is a strong risk indicator of all-cause occupational disability even at levels of gamma-GT in the "normal range" and is in particular associated with disability pension due to diseases of the digestive system, musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular, and mental diseases.
