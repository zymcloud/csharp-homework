We report a 76-year-old man who had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with arteriovenous shunting (AVS). Transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE) was selected as treatment because of poor pulmonary function. To prevent pulmonary embolism caused by the flow of embolic materials through the AVS, we performed embolization of the AVS with absolute ethanol under flow control by balloon catheters. Subsequently, we could perform TACE for HCC safely.
