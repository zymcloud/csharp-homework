A 73-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for hemorrhagic shock due to HCC rupture and treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in July 2007, followed by partial hepatic resection two months later. Multiple pulmonary and remnant liver metastases were detected by CT six months after the surgery. Since treatment with UFT for two months was not effective, the chemotherapy was changed to S-1 100 mg/body/day in June 2008. After S-1 treatment for three months, lung metastases remarkably diminished, as did the serum AFP level. Meanwhile, although the S-1 dose was gradually reduced to 50 mg/body/day due to adverse effects, pulmonary lesions and serum AFP level remained stationary for five months. While there is no established regimen for distant metastases of HCC, S-1 may be effective even at a reduced dose.
