Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in incidence in many countries, and is the most common cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. With regular surveillance, small early HCC lesions can be identified. An algorithm has been developed that allows for diagnosis of these lesions. Very early HCC lesions have high cure rates with appropriate treatment. If all these factors are in place most HCCs can be cured.
