Aim:The present study was specifically designed to assess the major clinical and pathological variables of patients with colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis in order to investigate whether currently used criteria appropriately select candidates for peritonectomy procedures (cytoreductive surgery) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).Patients and methods:Preoperative, operative and follow-up data on 146 consecutive patients presenting with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin and treated by surgical cytoreduction combined with HIPEC in 5 Italian Hospital and University Centers were prospectively entered in a common database. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the prognostic value of clinical and pathologic factors.Results:Over a minimum 24-month follow-up, the overall morbidity rate was 27.4% (mortality rate: 2.7%) and was directly related to the extent of surgery. Peritoneal cancer index (PCI), unfavorable peritoneal sites, synchronous or previously resected liver metastasis and the completeness of cytoreduction, all emerged as independent prognostic factors correlated with survival.Conclusions:Until research provides more effective criteria for selecting patients based upon the biomolecular features of carcinomatosis, patients should be selected according to the existing independent prognostic variables.
