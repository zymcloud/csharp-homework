Objective:To determine the total Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), the pure Diffusion coefficient (D) and the perfusion fraction (f) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under sorafenib treatment.Materials and methods:Two target tumors were prospectively analyzed in 12 patients at baseline, 2-weeks and 2-months treatment using b values of 0, 200, 400, 800 s/mm. Repeatability error was estimated on a healthy volunteer.Results:Lesion sizes, ADC and D values did not significantly change during treatment (overall mean values, respectively, 47.8 ± 31.0 mm, 1.34 ± 0.14 × 10⁻³ mm² s and 1.18 ± 0.22 × 10⁻³ mm²/s). However, f values significantly increased in seven responder patients (+38.39% at 2-weeks, +50.94% at 2-months, P = 0.005) while they decreased in five non responder patients (-41.93% at 2-weeks, P = 0.006). Furthermore, f was inversely correlated with αFP levels (P = 0.032) and responder patients had a higher mean overall survival (OS) than non responder patients (12.29 ± 4.46 vs. 7.80 ± 4.9 months). The % variation of f relative to baseline at 2-months was correlated with OS (P = 0.038) and symptomatic time to progression (P = 0.022).Conclusion:Contrary to ADC and D, the perfusion fraction f is a valuable marker of sorafenib treatment in advanced HCC.
