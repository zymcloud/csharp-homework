A series of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing glycosyl derivatives () of oleanolic acid were synthesized to improve the aqueous solubility and cytotoxicity of the parent compound . Derivative exhibited better solubility and strong cytotoxicity against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro. Furthermore, displayed low acute toxicity to mice and significantly inhibited the growth of HCC tumors in vivo, indicating that may be a promising candidate for the treatment of human HCC.
