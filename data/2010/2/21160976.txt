Aim:To evaluate the direct binding of two main chlamydial biovars (C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae) to plasma lipoproteins and its effect on chlamydial infection rate in human hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cells).Methods:Murine plasma lipoproteins were fractionated and isolated using fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC), spotted on nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with chlamydial suspensions. Direct binding of chlamydial particles to lipoprotein fractions has been studied using lipopolysaccharide-specific antibodies in immuno-dot blot binding assay and immunoprecipitation analysis. Immunostaining protocol as well as flow cytometry analysis have been employed to study the infectivity rate of chlamydial species in HepG2 cells.Results:Elementary bodies of both C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae bind ApoB-containing fractions of plasma lipoproteins. That binding becomes stronger when heat-denatured FPLC fractions are used, suggesting a primary role of apolipoproteins in interaction between chlamydial particle and lipoprotein. Both chlamydial biovars efficiently propagate in human hepatoma cell line - HepG2 cells even in serum free conditions forming late-stage inclusion bodies and releasing extracellular elementary bodies. Preincubation of C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae with native ApoB-containing lipoproteins enhances the rate of chlamydial infection in HepG2 cells.Conclusion:A productive infection caused by C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae may take place in human-derived hepatocytes revealing hepatic cells as possible target in chlamydial infection. Obtained results may suggest the participation of lipoprotein receptors in the mechanism of attachment and/or entry of chlamydial particles into target cells.
