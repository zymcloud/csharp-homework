Background & aims:The aim of our study was to search for highly up-regulated genes in primary malignant liver tumours and to analyse their expression at the mRNA- and protein level.Methods:Using a random-based gene fishing approach (representational difference analysis coupled to array hybridisation) we identified 7 genes high abundantly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as compared to non-neoplastic liver tissue, among them a gene fragment of the aldo-ketoreductase (AKR) superfamily. Full length cloning and sequencing of the gene fragment identified it as B10 gene of the AKR-family 1 (AKR1B10). For expression analysis on transcriptional level quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed in 22 HCC and 22 non-neoplastic liver cirrhotic tissues.Results:Our data demonstrate significantly higher expression levels of AKR1B10-mRNA in HCC compared to non-tumourous cirrhotic liver tissue (pConclusion:The over-expression of AKR1B10 in early stages of well and moderately differentiated tumours and its down-regulation in advanced tumour-stages with low grade of differentiation demonstrated that AKR1B10 may be a helpful marker for differentiation and proliferation of HCC and CC.
