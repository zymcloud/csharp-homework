Objective:To investigate the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and its clinical significance.Methods:The expressions of HER-2/neu were detected by SP immunohistochemistry method in 30 patients with HCC, 10 with portal cirrhosis of the liver and 10 with normal liver.Results:The positivity rate of HER-2/neu was markedly higher in HCC patients than in those with portal cirrhosis and normal liver (Chi(2)=6.482, P=0.032). The expression of HER-2/neu was closely correlated to portal cirrhosis of the liver (P=0.041), tumor invasion (P=0.028) and Edmondson grades (P=0.012). The average survival time was significant shorter in patients with HER-2/neu-positive tumor than in those with HER-2/neu-negative tumor (P=0.036).Conclusion:The expression of HER-2/neu may play a role in the invasion, metastasis and progression of HCC. The patients positive for HER-2/neu in the HCC tissues have generally poor prognosis.
