TGF-beta utilizes receptor-activated SMAD signaling to mediate growth suppression; however, non-SMAD signaling that modulates the TGF-beta response in epithelial cells become apparent when the SMAD signaling is abrogated, a common occurrence in pancreatic cancers. Here, we examined whether TGF-beta utilized NF-kappaB to downregulate PTEN, a gene that is rarely mutated in pancreatic cancers. SMAD4-null BxPc3 and CAPAN-1 pancreatic cancer cells were treated with TGF-beta (10 ng/ml) and lysed, and cellular proteins were analyzed by Western blots using p-IkappaB, p65, and PTEN antibodies. PTEN promoter and NF-kappaB activities were assessed by PTEN-luc and p-NF-luc constructs, respectively. Dominant negative p-IkappaB-alpha-M (NF-kappaB superrepressor) was used to block activation of NF-kappaB. Cell motility was assessed by Boyden chamber migration assay. TGF-beta induced IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation followed by NF-kappaB p65 subunit nuclear translocation and increased NF-kappaB activity. IkappaB-alpha-M blocked TGF-beta-induced NF-kappaB activity, reversed downregulated PTEN promoter activity and PTEN expression, and prevented augmentation of cell motility induced by TGF-beta. SMAD4 restoration, but not knockdown of SMAD2 and/or 3, reversed TGF-beta-induced NF-kappaB activity. Thus TGF-beta suppresses PTEN in pancreatic cancer cells through NF-kappaB activation and enhances cell motility and invasiveness in a SMAD4-independent manner that can be counteracted when TGF-beta-SMAD signaling is restored. The TGF-beta/NF-kappaB/PTEN cascade may be a critical pathway for pancreatic cancer cells to proliferate and metastasize.
