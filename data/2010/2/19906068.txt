The phase I metabolizing enzyme and phase II metabolizing enzyme play vital roles in carcinogenesis, but little is known about the changes of their activities in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this study phenacetin, a probe drug (1 g for men and 0.85 g for women orally), was applied for the detection of sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) and cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2) activities in 82 healthy participants and 148 HCC, 106 cirrhosis, and 41 chronic hepatitis B patients. In addition, a prospective cohort study for susceptibility to HCC was performed in 205 patients with cirrhosis secondary to chronic HBV infection. Compared with the healthy participants, SLUT1A1 activity increased by 9.7-fold in the HCC patients (P
