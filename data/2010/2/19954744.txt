Loss of function of the p53 protein, which may occur through a range of molecular events, is critical in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) evolution. MDM2, an oncogene, acts as a major regulator of the p53 protein. A polymorphism in the MDM2 promoter, SNP309 (T/G), has been shown to alter protein expression and may thus play a role in carcinogenesis. MDM2 SNP309 is also associated with HCC. However, the role of SNP309 in hepatocarcinogenesis with respect to TP53 mutations is unknown. In this study, we investigated the distribution of the MDM2 SNP309 genotype and somatic TP53 (the p53 tumor suppressor gene) mutations in 99 human HCC samples from Africa, Europe, China and Japan. Samples exhibited striking geographical differences in their distribution of SNP309 genotypes. The frequency and spectrum of p53 mutations also varied geographically; TP53 mutations were frequent in Africa, where the SNP309 T/T genotype predominated but were rare in Europe and Japan, where the SNP309 G allele was present more frequently. TP53 mutations were detected in 18% (4/22) of SNP309 T/G and G/G and 82% (18/22) of SNP309 T/T genotype holders; this difference was statistically highly significant (P-value=0.0006). Our results indicated that the presence of the SNP309 G allele is inversely associated with the presence of somatic TP53 mutations because they only coincided in 4% of HCC cases. This finding suggests that the SNP309 G allele may functionally replace p53 mutations, and in addition to known etiological factors, may be partly responsible for differential HCC prevalence.
