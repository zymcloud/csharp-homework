SM-11355 is a cisplatin derivative with high affinity for iodized ethyl esters of fatty acids of poppyseed oil. Clinical trials have shown that SM-11355 is effective for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is commonly used in combination with embolizing agents, but concomitant use of SM-11355 and embolizing agents has not been evaluated in previous trials. In this study, the safety and efficacy of SM-11355 in combination with embolizing agents were investigated in 10 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. An anti-tumor effect of TE4 was achieved in 4 of 9 patients and no serious adverse events were observed, indicating that this therapy can be used safely for hepatocellular carcinoma.
