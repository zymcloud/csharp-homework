The increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has led several countries to standardize and update its management. This review aims at summarizing these evolutions through six questions focusing on diagnosis and treatment. The radiological diagnosis of this tumor has been refined. Besides being hypervascular at the arterial phase, the "washout" in particular at the late phase of injection has become a prominent feature. Although routine ultrasound remains the corner stone of screening, contrast ultrasound has become a very reliable characterization tool as it allows continuous monitoring of the vascular kinetics. Biopsy of the tumor allows identification of conventional or molecular prognosis features, some of which could be used in current practice. The metabolic syndrome is an increasing etiology of HCC and carcinogenesis in this context may not always require the development of formal underlying cirrhosis. Associated (in particular cardiovascular) conditions account for an increased morbidity-mortality following surgery. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment of early-stage tumors. The limited availability of grafts has led some countries including France to implement new allocation rules that are still evaluated and might need to be refined. Sorafenib is the first medical treatment shown to be effective in the treatment of HCC. This efficacy is however still limited and its indication is therefore restricted to Child-Pugh A, OMS 0-2 patients in whom a potentially curative treatment is contraindicated.
