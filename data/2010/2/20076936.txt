Surgical R0 resection of primary and secondary hepatobiliary tumors, such as colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma and gall bladder carcinoma, remains the only potentially curative treatment option. The extent of involvement of lymph node metastases seems to be an independent prognostic factor in these tumors. The prognostic value of a systematic lymph node dissection in hepatobiliary tumors still remains unclear as there is a lack of prospective randomized trials. However, local lymphadenectomy (hepatoduodenal ligament and retropancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes) can be easily performed with low mortality and morbidity rates and may be helpful in better staging of the patients. Further randomized trials are necessary in order to define the relevance of lymph node dissection in hepatobiliary surgery.
