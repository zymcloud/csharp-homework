Chemokines have been proposed to contribute to tumour growth and metastatic spread of several cancer entities. Here, we examined the relative levels of CXCL12/CXCR4 in resection specimens from patients with different malignant and non-malignant colorectal diseases as well as colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). CXCL12/CXCR4 mRNA and protein expression profiles were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry in resection specimens from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 15), colorectal adenoma (CRA; n = 15), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; n = 47) and CRLM (n = 16). Corresponding non-affected tissues served as control. In contrast to UC tissues, CXCL12 showed a distinct down-regulation in CRA, CRC and CRLM specimens, whereas the corresponding receptor CXCR4 demonstrated a significant up-regulation in CRC and CRLM related to corresponding non-affected tissues (p < 0.05, respectively). Our results strongly suggest an association between CXCL12/CXCR4 expression and the induction of CRA, CRC and the development of CRLM. Therefore, CXCR4 may be a potential target for specific therapeutic interventions.
