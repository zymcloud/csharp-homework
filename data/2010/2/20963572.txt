We present a patient with metastatic pheochromocytoma, who developed progressive and fatal hypoglycemia most likely secondary to direct tumor glucose consumption that did not respond to high-dose glucose infusion, corticosteroids, or glucagon therapy. The pattern of glucose uptake on (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography, with preferential tumor glucose uptake in association with a marked reduction in normal uptake in the heart, muscles, and brain, is highly suggestive of direct consumption of glucose by the tumor rather than insulin-like growth factor-2 mediated hypoglycemia. In patients with large-volume metastatic malignancies, direct tumor glucose consumption should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia. Nuclear medicine imaging techniques can illustrate the pathophysiology of hypoglycemia in such cases.
