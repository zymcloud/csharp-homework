Ethnopharmacological relevance:Balanites aegyptiaca (Balantiaceae), mainly the fruit, is used by traditional healers and herbalists for treating many diseases in Africa and Asia.Aim of the study:Investigation of fixed oil composition of fruits and evaluation of its biological activity.Materials and methods:Oil content was identified using GC and GC/MS. In vitro examination of the oil biological activity (including cytotoxicity, antimutagenicity, antiparasitic, antiviral and antimicrobial activities) was performed.Results:The oil contained 54.53% unsaturated fatty acids and 1.14% sterols. The oil exhibited anticancer activity against lung, liver and brain human carcinoma cell lines. It also had antimutagenic activity against Fasciola gigantica induced mutagenicity besides anthelmintic activity against hepatic worms (Schistosoma mansoni and Fasciola gigantica). Preliminary screening showed that the oil had antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus. It also had antimicrobial activity against selected strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and Candida.Conclusion:The results showed remarkable biological activity of Balanites aegyptiaca fixed oil and proved its importance as natural bioactive source.
