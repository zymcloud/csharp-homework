Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that blocks tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis and is used for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and other solid tumors. Various dermatologic side effects have been reported, most notably a hand-foot-skin reaction (HFSR). This is a case of a sorafenib-induced psoriasiform eruption in a patient with metastatic thyroid carcinoma. This patient also developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and HFSR in association with sorafenib. To the authors' knowledge, a psoriasiform eruption due to sorafenib has not been reported in the literature and has important therapeutic implications.
