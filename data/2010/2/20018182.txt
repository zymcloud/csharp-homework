3-(4-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl) phenyl acetate (DPB-5) is a synthetic benzothiazole derivative. In the present study, we revealed that DPB-5 had strong cytotoxicity to induce cell apoptosis, which was mediated by ROS. And DPB-5 was more cytotoxic toward hepatoma cells than toward normal hepatic cells, which was resulted from the greater susceptibility of the malignant cells to ROS. DBP-5 caused massive ROS accumulation and GSH decrease, which lead to MMP disruption, caspase activation and finally induced cell apoptosis. Additionally, rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondria electron transport system, effectively blocked the ROS elevated effect of DPB-5, which suggested that DPB-5-induced ROS generated from the mitochondria. Further studies showed that DPB-5-induced cell apoptosis through caspases-cascade, but failed to activate caspase-9. Hence, we concluded that DPB-5-induced Hep G2 cells apoptosis via a ROS-mediated pathway which was caspase-dependent but did not rely on caspase-9.
