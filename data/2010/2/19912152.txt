Background:A randomized controlled trial performed by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) published in 2002 demonstrated that transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is an effective treatment for well-selected patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aim:To access whether this information has modified the use of TACE in clinical practice.Methods:From 2042 HCC patients included in the Italian Liver Cancer database, we selected 336 cases diagnosed over two 4-year periods (1999-2002, n = 161 and 2003-2006, n = 175), fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the BCLC study. These groups were compared for TACE application rate, patient characteristics and survival.Results:Patients undergoing TACE increased in the 2003-2006 period (from 62% to 73%, P = 0.035), with an increase in of Child-Pugh class A (from 64% to 77%, P = 0.048) and advanced HCC patients (from 54% to 69%, P = 0.041). In the 1999-2002 period, there was no significant difference in survival between TACE-treated and untreated patients, while in the 2003-2006 period, TACE-treated patients survived longer (P Conclusions:Following the publication of studies providing evidence of a survival benefit of TACE in selected patients with unresectable HCC, significantly more patients with well-compensated cirrhosis underwent TACE within this very homogenous population, leading to an increased survival despite a more advanced tumour stage.
