Purpose:This study aims to profile the expressions of 156 microRNAs (miRNA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to characterize the functions of miR-222, the most significantly upregulated candidate identified.Experimental design:miRNA expression profile in HCC tumors, matching adjacent cirrhotic livers, and cell lines was conducted using quantitative PCR. Common miR-222 upregulations were further validated in a larger cohort of tumors. The functional effects of miR-222 inhibition on HCC cell lines were examined. The downstream modulated pathways and target of miR-222 were investigated by coupling gene expression profiling and pathway analysis, and by in silico prediction, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was done to confirm target interaction.Results:We identified a 40-miRNA signature that could discriminate tumors from adjacent cirrhotic liver tissue, and further corroborated common miR-222 overexpression in tumors relative to its premalignant counterpart (55.3%; P Conclusions:Our study showed that miR-222 overexpression is common in HCC and could confer metastatic potentials in HCC cells, possibly through activating AKT signaling.
