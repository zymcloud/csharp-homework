Cancer cells usually obtain energy from a high rate of glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation under normoxia as well as hypoxia. Under these circumstances, pyruvate, the end-product of glycolysis, accumulates in cancer cells. We have previously reported that pyruvate activates endothelial cells and induces angiogenesis. Here, we examined the angiogenic activity of pyruvate in tumor cells. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the gene most upregulated by pyruvate, showed a pro-angiogenic activity, which was abolished by a PAI-1 neutralizing antibody. Moreover, stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) by pyruvate was required for induction of PAI-1 transcription through direct binding to hypoxia response element-2 (HRE-2) on the promoter. These results suggest that pyruvate can activate the angiogenic activity of cancer cells under normoxia and that PAI-1 may act as a pro-angiogenic factor in pyruvate-induced angiogenesis.
