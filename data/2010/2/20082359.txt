Background and objective:Breast metastasis from extramammary neoplasm is rare. We present the cases of metastasis to the breast after review of results in one institute and we want to show the difference of previous report.Methods:The surgical and pathology databases of Samsung Medical Center from November 1994 to March 2009 were investigated to identify all patients with a diagnosis of metastasis to the breast.Results:Thirty-three patients with breast metastases from extramammary neoplasm were studied. Gastric carcinoma was most common metastatic origin in this study. There were four cases with microcalcifications in their metastatic lesions. This is the first report of microcalcification of metastatic lesions to the breast from hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer.Conclusions:Pathologic examination and considering known clinical history may be helpful to differentiate the primary breast cancer and metastatic cancer. Metastasis to the breast from an extramammary neoplasm usually indicates disseminated metastatic disease and a poor prognosis. An accurate diagnosis of breast metastases, differentiating primary from metastatic breast carcinoma, is important for proper management.
