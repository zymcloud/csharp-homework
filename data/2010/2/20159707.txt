Objective:To investigate the inhibitory effect of survivin antisense oligodeoxynuleotides (ASODN) mediated by polyethylenimine (PEI) on hepatocelluar carcinoma SMMC-7721 cell proliferation and its effect on chemosensitivity to 5-FU in tumor-bearing mice.Methods:The inhibitory effect of PEI-ASODN on SMMC-7721 cell proliferation was assayed by WST-8 test, Trypan blue exclusion test, and cell clone formation assay. In mouse models of transplanted H22 cell hepatocarcinoma and ascites tumor, the effect of 5-FU combined with PEI-ASODN on the weight and volume of the subcutaneous tumors was examined. The tumor inhibition rate in the tumor-bearing mice was calculated and the average survival time recorded.Results:SMMC-7721 cells incubated with different concentrations of PEI-ASODN for 48 h showed significantly reduced cell proliferation in comparison with the control cells, while PEI or ASODN alone produced no such inhibitory effect. Incubation of SMMC-7721 cells with 0.75 micromol/L PEI-ASODN for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h resulted in significantly suppressed cell proliferation, and a 7-day incubation of the cells with PEI-ASODN at different concentrations (0.25-0.75 micromol/L) significantly inhibited the cell clone formation. In the tumor-bearing mice, the tumor weight and volume were obviously reduced with a tumor inhibition rate of 56.91% and volume inhibition rate of 57.83%, significantly different from those in saline-treated mice (PConclusion:PEI-ASODN complex can significantly inhibit the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma SMMC-7721 cells and enhance 5-FU chemosensitivity of the tumor cells in vitro and transplanted H22 tumors in mice.
