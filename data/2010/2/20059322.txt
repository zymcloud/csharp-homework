Introduction:Laparoscopic liver resections are becoming a common procedure, and bleeding remains the major concern during parenchymal transection. Total vascular inflow occlusion can be performed, but ischemic reperfusion injuries can lead to postoperative morbidity. On the other hand, hemihepatic inflow occlusion, leading to hemiliver ischemia, decreases the amount of liver parenchyma submitted to reperfusion damage and offers the advantage of reduced blood loss.Objective:The aim of this work was to describe our experience with laparoscopic the half-Pringle maneuver for segmentar or nonanatomic liver resctions.Patients and methods:Eight patients submitted to laparoscopic liver resection in a single tertiary center.Results:There were 5 women and 3 men with a mean age of 40.2 years (range, 26-54). Mean tumor size was 4.1 cm (range, 2.6-6.0), and mean hospital stay was 3.1 days (1-5). There were 3 liver adenomas, 2 hepatocellular carcinomas, 1 metastatic melanoma, 1 metastatic colorectal carcinoma, and 1 peripheral colangiocarcinoma. No postoperative complications or mortalities were observed.Conclusions:Results demonstrate that laparoscopic liver resection with the half-Pringle maneuver is feasible and safe and may be included in the technical armamentarium of laparoscopic liver resections for a selected group of patients.
