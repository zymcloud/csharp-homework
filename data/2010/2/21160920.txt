Sonazoid (Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan), a second-generation of a lipid-stabilized suspension of a perfluorobutane gas microbubble contrast agent, has been used clinically in patients with liver tumors and for harmonic gray-scale ultrasonography (US) in Japan since January 2007. Sonazoid-enhanced US has two phases of contrast enhancement: vascular and late. In the late phase of Sonazoid-enhanced US, we scanned the whole liver using this modality at a low mechanical index (MI) without destroying the microbubbles, and this method allows detection of small viable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions which cannot be detected by conventional US as perfusion defects in the late phase. Re-injection of Sonazoid into an HCC lesion which previously showed a perfusion defect in the late phase is useful for confirming blood flow into the defects. High MI intermittent imaging at 2 frames per second in the late phase is also helpful in differentiation between necrosis and viable hypervascular HCC lesions. Sonazoid-enhanced US by the coded harmonic angio mode at a high MI not only allows clear observation of tumor vessels and tumor enhancement, but also permits automatic scanning with Sonazoid-enhanced three dimensional (3D) US. Fusion images combining US with contrast-enhanced CT or contrast-enhanced MRI have made it easy to detect typical or atypical HCC lesions. By these methods, Sonazoid-enhanced US can characterize liver tumors, grade HCC lesions histologically, recognize HCC dedifferentiation, evaluate the efficacy of ablation therapy or transcatheter arterial embolization, and guide ablation therapy for unresectable HCC. This article reviews the current developments and applications of Sonazoid-enhanced US and Sonazoid-enhanced 3D US for diagnosing and treating hepatic lesions, especially HCC.
