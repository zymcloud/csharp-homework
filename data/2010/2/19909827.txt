FVE is a documented immunomodulatory protein purified from Enoki mushroom (Flammulina velutipes) and known as an activator for human T lymphocytes. This present study was aimed to investigate the anti-tumor effect and the related mechanisms of oral administration of FVE using a murine hepatoma model. Oral administration of FVE (10mg/kg) significantly increased the life span and inhibited the tumor size of BNL 1MEA.7R.1 (BNL) hepatoma-bearing mice. Tumor-bearing mice receiving oral FVE treatment had the highest tumoricidal capacity of peritoneal macrophages and tumor-specific splenocytes against BNL hepatoma cells. In addition, in vivo neutralization of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) demonstrated a significant decrease of FVE-induced anti-tumor effect (P
