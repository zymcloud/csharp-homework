A series of methoxystilbenes (E and Z isomers) related to resveratrol were investigated for their effects on NQO1 induction in murine hepatoma cells and growth inhibitory effects on human cancer cell lines. Both activities were enhanced in compounds with methoxy groups on rings A and B of resveratrol but methoxylation of the di-meta (3,5) hydroxyl groups on ring A of resveratrol was found to be more critical for improving activity. Strikingly different structure-activity trends were observed, namely the association of E isomers with potent NQO1 induction activity and Z isomers with growth inhibitory properties. The introduction of ortho-methoxy groups on ring A greatly benefited NQO1 induction activity while meta/para methoxy groups on ring A were preferred for potent growth inhibitory effects. These results serve to highlight the contrasting effects on different activities brought about by methoxylation, which is widely employed as a structural modification approach to improve potency and bioavailability of resveratrol. It serves as a timely reminder that in the course of structural modification, a balance between optimizing desired outcomes against unwanted effects is necessary and the most potent analog need not always be the most desirable.
