We report the case of a patient who presented with a supra-diaphragmatic lymph node recurrence 8 years after resection of a right liver fibrolamellar carcinoma. Treatment of this recurrence consisted of local excision by a right thoracotomy approach. Postoperative course was uneventful and the patient did not experience recurrence within 2 years. Based on this observation, we describe the major lymphatic vessels of the liver, in order to explain this unusual metastatic site occurrence.
