Aim:To evaluate the anticancer effect of alpha-tomatine (i.p.) either alone or in combination with doxorubicin (i.v.) in a mouse tumour model.Methods:We studied the effect of repeated alpha-tomatine (0.1 - 9 mg/kg) and/or doxorubicin (2 mg/kg) on the growth and mitotic activity of the solid Ehrlich tumour in vivo, as well as on the survival of the tumour-bearing mice.Results:Monotherapy with alpha-tomatine had a significant dose-dependent anticancer effect which peaked at 1 mg/kg. This was shown by both slowed tumour growth and reduced tumour cell proliferation. We also provide the first evidence that the combination alpha-tomatine (1 mg/kg) and doxorubicin (2 mg/kg) had a synergistic effect and significantly prolonged the survival of the mice. Neither alpha-tomatine nor doxorubicin influenced the infiltration of tumours with CD3+ lymphocytes; nor were we able to find an in vivo modulation of the key molecules of two regulatory pathways reported in vitro as the principal anti-cancer mechanisms of alpha-tomatine, i.e. iNOS and phosphorylated ERK2. However, alpha-tomatine still led to intracellular DNA inhibition and protein synthesis in Ehrlich tumour cells in a short-term culture ex vivo with IC50 values of 8.7 and 6.6 µM.Conclusions:The results suggest that ΤΟΜ, especially in combination with doxorubicin, may be a promising agent for the treatment of malignant solid tumours. Despite growing knowledge of the mechanisms of ΤΟΜ action in cancer cells, most aspects remain unclear. Parallel organ toxicity, especially potential liver effects, requires careful attention when performing in vivo studies in the future.
