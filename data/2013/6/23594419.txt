Gaucher disease is an autosomal, recessively inherited, lysosomal storage disease, which has been associated with gammopathies and malignancies. This report represents the results of a systematic review of the literature on the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathies and malignancies in Gaucher disease. A PubMed search identified 365 studies, of which 80 reported on concomitant Gaucher disease and malignancies and/or gammopathies (15 cohort/cross sectional studies, and 65 case reports/series). Based on these studies, we conclude that compared to the general population, Gaucher patients have an increased risk of cancer in general [pooled relative risk of 1·70 (95% confidence interval 1·27-2·31)], and multiple myeloma and haematological malignancies in particular (estimated risk between 25·0 and 51·1 and 3·5 and 12·7, respectively). In addition, an increased risk has been reported for hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Several factors have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology. These include: splenectomy, immune dysregulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, genetic modifiers, altered iron metabolism and insulin resistance.
