Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is a nonclassical HLA class I molecule involved in tumor escape mechanisms. Considering that the HLA-G 14bp insertion/deletion polymorphism is located at the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) in exon 8, and since it has been associated with the magnitude of HLA-G production, we studied the association of 14bp insertion/deletion polymorphism with the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 109 HCC patients followed at the University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil, and 202 healthy controls from the same geographic area were genotyped for the 14bp insertion/deletion polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Compared to controls, the frequency of the 14bp deletion allele was overrepresented in HCC patients (65% versus 56%, respectively, P = 0.0326). The 14bp deletion conferred an odds ratio (OR) of 1.46 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-2.05]. Similarly, the deletion/deletion genotype was marginally overrepresented in HCC patients (45% versus 35% in controls, P = 0.0871), conferring an OR of 1.54 (95% CI: 0.96-2.48). The frequencies of the deletion/insertion or insertion/insertion genotypes observed in patients were not statistically different from those observed in controls (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that the 14bp-deletion allele in HLA-G gene is associated with HCC susceptibility in a Brazilian population.
