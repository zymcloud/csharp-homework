A solitary skull metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma is rare. A 38-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma presented to our institution with a palpable temporal scalp mass. We took a magnetic resonance image, and discovered an enhanced and osteolytic skull tumor. The tumor was removed by an occipital craniectomy, and the histologic diagnosis was a cranial metastasis owing to hepatocellular carcinoma. A skull metastasis owing to hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with a subcutaneous scalp mass. Although a distant metastasis can affect the prognosis of the patient, early treatment may improve survival.
