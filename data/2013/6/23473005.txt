Purpose:The purpose of this study was to explore the outcomes and risk factors for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after kidney transplantation in occult HBV carriers, who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegative and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) seropositive before kidney transplantation.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 322 occult HBV carriers who received kidney transplantation in our hospital from January 1998 to June 2008. HBsAg and HBV DNA were routinely checked for diagnosis of HBV reactivation.Results:Our results showed that 15 cases (4.7%) of occult HBV carriers had HBV reactivation after kidney transplantation. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival was 86.7%, 79.4%, 72.2%, and 65.0%, respectively, in the HBV reactivation group, and was 96.1%, 93.8%, 91.5%, and 84.5%, respectively, in the non-HBV reactivation group (log-rank 4.12, P = 0.042). Graft survival showed no difference between these 2 groups (P > 0.05). The incidences of impairment of liver function, liver function failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute rejection were significantly higher in the HBV reactivation group compared with the non-HBV reactivation group (P 60 years) and using anti-T-cell antibodies were independent risk factors for HBV reactivation after kidney transplantation, while being hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) seropositive and using lamivudine prophylaxis could protect occult HBV carriers from HBV reactivation after kidney transplantation (P Conclusion:In conclusion, our data showed that HBV reactivation may diminish the patient survival but not graft survival. Older age and anti-T-cell antibodies may increase the risk of HBV reactivation, whereas lamivudine prophylaxis may prevent HBV reactivation after kidney transplantation.
