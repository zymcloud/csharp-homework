Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 180 patients with small HCC who underwent hepatectomy between 2006 and 2010. Independent predictors of tumor recurrence were identified with Cox regression analysis.Results:The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates were 83.7, 68.0, 65.3, and 98.9, 96.5, 92.7 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis reported that protein induced by the vitamin K antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) ≥ 200 mAU/mL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 80 IU/mL, and microvascular invasion were important predisposing factors for tumor recurrence. Elevated serum PIVKA-II level was associated with microvascular invasion in small HCC, which was a powerful predisposing factor.Conclusions:Although small HCC is generally associated with a good prognosis, serum PIVKA-II level ≥ 200 mAU/mL, ALP ≥ 80 IU/L, and microvascular invasion were predisposing factors for tumor recurrence. These factors can be used to stratify patients with respect to recurrence after resection. Elevated PIVKA-II was closely associated with microvascular invasion in small HCC. These data emphasize the importance of PIVKA-II in small HCC.
