Background and aim:The aim of our study was to determine the predictors of recurrences in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who had achieved complete remission (CR) by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:A total of 220 consecutive HCC patients who had achieved CR by TACE were followed for a median 72 months. CR was defined as complete lipiodol uptake based on the results of lipiodol-computed tomography 4 weeks after TACE and no additional tumor staining on the follow-up angiography. Recurrence patterns were classified as local recurrence and secondary tumor, respectively, in relation to the location of recurrence; early and late recurrence were classified in relation to recurrence time.Results:Recurrence of HCC was observed in 169 patients (77 %), of whom 91 (54 %) had local recurrences, 61 (36 %) had secondary tumor, and 17 (10 %) had both. There were 45 (27 %) early and 124 (73 %) late recurrences. Local recurrence developed more frequently in patients with early recurrence than in those with late recurrence (62 vs. 51 %, respectively), while secondary tumor was detected more commonly in patients with late recurrence than in those with early recurrence (39 vs. 29 %, respectively; P Conclusions:Early recurrences following CR by TACE may be due mainly to undetectable remaining tumors, whereas late recurrences may be caused by newly appearing tumors in patients with a background of advanced cirrhotic liver.
