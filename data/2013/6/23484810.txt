Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant gastroenterological cancers over the world. α-fetoprotein (AFP) is an oncofetal protein produced during HCC development that could generate weaker and less reproducible antitumor protection, and it may serve as a target for immunotherapy. Therefore, it is imperative to enhance its immunogenicity and develop therapeutic vaccines to eliminate AFP-expressing tumors. In this study, by way of glutaraldehyde cross-linking, we constructed a potential therapeutic protein vaccine, glycoprotein 96 (gp96)/AFP. Our results demonstrated that AFP and gp96 synergistically exhibited significant increase in AFP-specific CD8⁺ T-cell responses and impressive cytotoxic antitumor effect against AFP-expressing tumors. Priming mice with the reconstructed vaccine, we elicited robust strong protective immunity. Our study suggests that tumor vaccine by cross-linking tumor antigen and gp96 is a promising approach to cancer therapy.
