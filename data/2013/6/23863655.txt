We report our experience with two cases of postoperative multiple liver metastases that were reduced remarkably by S-1, VNR, and MPA combination therapy for breast cancer. A case diagnosed as Stage II B(T2, N1, M0)breast cancer was treated postoperatively with LH-RH agonist and TAM. Another case, diagnosed as Stage III B(T4b, N2, M0), was treated with postoperative CE therapy. Tumor markers were normalized and liver metastases were shrunk significantly in both cases which received combination chemotherapy of S-1, VNR, and MPA as first-line therapy after recurrence. We conclude that this combination chemotherapy is a useful regimen for metastatic breast cancer patients, because it can be continuously implemented over a long period of time while maintaining high QOL without serious adverse events.
