Background:The Milan criteria are used to define small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to select patients for curative treatments. Total tumor volume (TTV) is an alternative parameter for tumor burden. We aimed to evaluate whether TTV is a feasible prognostic marker in HCC patients with upper boundary TTV of 65.5 cm(3), which is equivalent to a single 5 cm tumor nodule defined by the Milan criteria.Methods:A total of 774 HCC patients with TTV Results:Of these patients, 50 (6.5 %) did not fulfill the Milan criteria. Patients beyond the Milan criteria more often had larger tumor size and TTV, as well as more tumor nodules (p values all 15 cm(3) had a significantly poorer survival than patients with TTV 15 cm(3) [risk ratio (RR): 1.474, p = 0.005], serum bilirubin â‰¥ 1.5 mg/dL (RR: 1.663, p = 0.003), serum sodium Conclusions:Total tumor volume, is an independent and better prognostic marker than the Milan criteria to indicate tumor burden in HCC patients who had tumor volume defined by the Milan criteria and underwent curative therapies.
