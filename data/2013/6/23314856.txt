Background:Acquired resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a serious therapeutic obstacle in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.Aim:To investigate whether nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was associated with drug resistance in 5-FU resistant Bel-7402 (Bel-7402/5-FU) cells, and if sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting the tumor and vasculature, could reverse drug resistance in Bel-7402/5-FU cells at the noncytotoxic dosage.Methods:We used MTT to detect the resistance reversal activity of sorafenib, compared Nrf2 expression in various conditions by western blot and qRT-PCR, and analyzed subcellular localization of Nrf2 by immunofluorescence.Results:The endogenous expression of Nrf2 in Bel-7402/5-FU cells was similar to that observed in Bel-7402 cells. However, Nrf2 expression levels were increased by 5-FU treatment in Bel-7402/5-FU cells higher than that in Bel-7402 cells, which is to highlight the Nrf2 contribution to the enhanced resistance of Bel-7402/5-FU cells to 5-FU. Moreover, intracellular Nrf2 protein level was significantly down-regulated by Nrf2-shRNA in Bel-7402/5-FU cells, resulting in partial reversal of 5-FU resistance. Sorafenib down-regulated the increased expression of Nrf2 induced by 5-FU treatment and partly reversed 5-FU resistance in Bel-7402/5-FU cells.Conclusions:These results suggested that more sensitive cell defense mediated by Nrf2 was associated with drug resistance of Bel-7402/5-FU cells. Sorafenib reversed drug resistance, and its reversal mechanism might be due to the suppression of Nrf2 expression induced by 5-FU, indicating the feasibility of using Nrf2 inhibitors to increase efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in HCC patients.
