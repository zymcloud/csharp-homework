The right kidney cancer very rarely locally invades the liver as compared with blood metastasis which occur more frequent. In these cases, the only extensive surgical resection of part of the liver gives the opportunity to improve survival dependent on kidney cancer. In the intra-and postoperative bleeding and leakage of bile from the liver cut surface is a complication that it depends on the success of the treatment. A valuable complement to traditional ways of obtaining hemostasis is sealed section of liver collagen patches of horse, which are covered with tissue adhesive supplemented human fibrinogen and thrombin (Tachosil). The aim of this study is to present the case of 38-year-old woman with a tumor of the upper pole of the right kidney invasive by the continuity of the right lobe of liver, in which the classic methods of obtaining hemostasis supplemented using Tachosil postoperative course and a comparison with data from the literature.Results:We demonstrated the usefulness of the application Tachosil sealing vascular suture in the vein cava inferior and obtain hemostasis and tissue sealing the right liver lobe cross-section area of about 250 cm2. After treatment, a patient had drainage from the site of the kidney comparable with data from the literature. Patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7 in good condition.Conclusions:Tachosil in major surgery because of locally advanced kidney cancer that invades the liver is a valuable complement to conventional surgical methods allowing for atraumatic stop bleeding and seal parenchymal liver tissue. Doing so helps to avoid early and late complications and reduce the cost of treating these complications.
