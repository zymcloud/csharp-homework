A 42-year-old man suffering from haemophilia A and coinfection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus was referred to our institution because of multiple liver tumours. He had been receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection. Ultrasonography showed multiple hypoechoic space-occupying lesions in the liver. Contrast-enhanced dynamic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple ring-enhanced hypervascular lesions in the liver. An ultrasonography-guided biopsy was performed and histological evaluation indicated one of the lesions to be combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma and others to be non-neoplastic. The patient underwent partial hepatic resection and is currently alive without recurrence for 15 months. Multiple ring-enhanced lesions have been undetectable in postoperative follow-up CT examinations.
