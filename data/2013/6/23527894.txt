Context:Curcuma caesia Roxb. (Zingiberaceae), commonly known as "Kala Haldi" in Bengali, has been traditionally used for the treatment of cancer, bruises, inflammation and as an aphrodisiac.Objective:To evaluate the antitumor activity and antioxidant status of the methanol extract of Curcuma caesia (MECC) rhizomes on Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC)-treated mice.Materials and methods:In vitro cytotoxicity assay of MECC was evaluated by using Trypan blue method. Determination of in vivo antitumor activity was performed after 24 h of EAC cells (2 × 10(6) cells/mouse) inoculation; MECC (50 and 100 mg/kg i.p.) was administered daily for nine consecutive days. On day 10, half of the mice were sacrificed and the rest were kept alive for assessment of increase in lifespan. Antitumor effect of MECC was assessed by the study of tumor volume, tumor weight, viable and non-viable cell count, hematological parameters and biochemical estimations. Furthermore, antioxidant parameters were assayed by estimating liver and kidney tissue enzymes.Results:MECC showed direct cytotoxicity (IC50 90.70 ± 8.37 μg/mL) on EAC cell line. MECC exhibited significant (p < 0.01) decrease in tumor volume, tumor weight, viable cell count and percentage increased the lifespan (57.14 and 88.09%) of EAC-treated mice. Hematological profile, biochemical estimation, tissue antioxidant assay significantly (p < 0.01) reverted to normal level in MECC-treated mice.Conclusion:MECC possesses potent antitumor activity that may be due to its direct cytotoxic effect or antioxidant properties. Further research is in progress to find out the active principle(s) of MECC for its antitumor activity.
