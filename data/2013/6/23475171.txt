To investigate the clinical significance of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-2 and SOCS6 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression levels of SOCS2 and SOCS6 mRNA and protein in tumor, para-tumor and normal liver tissues were detected in 106 HCC patients by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. According to qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, we first found that both the expression levels of SOCS2 and SOCS6 mRNA and protein in HCC were significantly lower than those in para-tumor (both P
