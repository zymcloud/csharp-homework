XRCC1-399 allele polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the conclusions of the various studies have been inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis of available studies to determine whether XRCC1-399 alleles influence susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma. We searched English-language databases, including PubMed, Medline and Embase, using terms such as "hepatocellular carcinoma" (or "HCC"), "X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1" (or "XRCC1") and "genetic polymorphism" (or "SNP"), among others; we also searched Chinese-language databases, including CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, and CBM, using terms such as "ganai", "ganxibaoai", "ganzhongliu", "duotaixing", and "X-xian xiufu jiaocha hubu jiyin 1". Eight independent studies, including 1604 HCC cases and 2185 controls, were included. The pooled odds ratio for XRCC1-399 was 0.99 (95% confidence interval = 0.75-1.31). We conclude that XRCC1- 399 gene polymorphisms are unrelated to risk for HCC.
