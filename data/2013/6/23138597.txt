Purpose:The liver and peritoneum are common sites of colorectal metastases. Hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is considered gold standard treatment. We attempt to compare the survival outcomes for CLM patients after hepatectomy to that of patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases (CPM) who underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).Methods:A retrospective review of patients with CPM and CLM who underwent surgery between January 2003 and May 2011 was performed. The overall (OS) and disease-free survivals (DFS) were compared.Results:There were 22 patients with CPM who underwent CRS and HIPEC and 186 patients who underwent hepatectomy for CLM. Patients with CPM had a 3-year OS of 39 % and DFS of 27.7 %. CLM patients showed a 3-year OS of 58.5 % and a DFS of 28.8 %. Most recurrences for CPM occurred within 2 years, while CLM patients continue to develop systemic recurrences over 3 years, showing a gradual decline in DFS and OS during this period of time.Conclusion:Our results show that CRS and HIPEC for CPM confer good OS and DFS rates and that the DFS after CRS and HIPEC is comparable to that after hepatectomy for CLM.
