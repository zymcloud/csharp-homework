Purpose:Krüppel-like factor 8 (KLF8), a downstream transcription factor of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), has a role in tumorigenesis, tumor progress and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction. Recent studies mainly focused on its role in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, little is studied in gastric cancer. Here, we aim to explore whether KLF8 is involved in TGF-β1-induced EMT in gastric cancer cells.Methods:Western blot and real-time PCR assays were used to detect the expression of KLF8, E-cadherin and vimentin in gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 treated with or without TGF-β1. The lentivirus-mediated RNA interference technique was used to knock down the expression of KLF8 in gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. In vitro, the ability of cell migration and invasion were measured by transwell and wound healing assays; the cell motility was detected by high content screening assay.Results:TGF-β1 could induce EMT via down-regulating E-cadherin and up-regulating vimentin expression in gastric cancer cells. Further study found that TGF-β1 could induce KLF8 expression at the protein and mRNA levels in gastric cancer cells (P Conclusions:KLF8, a transcription factor, is involved in TGF-β1-induced EMT in gastric cancer cells and may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer.
