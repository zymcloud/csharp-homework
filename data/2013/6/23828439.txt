Thyroid metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare, and has poor prognosis. We report the case of a 62-year-old woman seen at our clinic because of the occurrence of a slightly painful abdominal mass. At that time, alpha-fetoprotein concentration was very high, reaching 49,831.7 ng/mL. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous mass in segment IV of the liver, which was diagnosed as HCC upon MRI. The patient underwent surgical resection and histological analysis of the specimen confirmed HCC. Metastases to the thyroid were detected 17 months after liver resection. Although the presence of metastases indicates advanced disease, thyroidectomy was performed, since no other distant metastases were detected. In fact, the patient is doing well 3 years after thyroidectomy and regular imaging exams showed no tumor recurrence. Current alpha-fetoprotein concentration is 8 ng/mL. In conclusion, thyroid metastasis from HCC is uncommon and short-term survival is expected. However, surgical resection should be encouraged, especially in the case of solitary metastases.
