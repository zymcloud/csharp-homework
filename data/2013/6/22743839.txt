Purpose:To assess the role of CT perfusion technique in detection of blood flow changes related to the therapeutic effects in HCC lesion treated with RFA.Methods:14 cirrhotic patients with known HCC underwent a perfusion study about 4 months (range 1-13 months) after RFA on a 16-slice MDCT scanner (Brilliance, Philips). Dynamic CT was performed acquiring 8 dynamic slice/scan, after injection of 50 mL of contrast media. In treated lesion, surrounding parenchyma and hypervascular tissue suspicious for residual disease/recurrence, the following perfusion parameters were analyzed: perfusion (P, mL/100 g min); arterial perfusion (AP, mL/min); blood volume (BV, mL/100 mg); hepatic perfusion index (HPI, %), and time to peak (TTP, s). Univariate Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis.Results:In patients with residual disease (8/14) values of perfusion parameters measured within tumor were: P, median = 45.2; AP, median = 48.2; BV, median = 18.9; HPI, median = 35.8; and TTP, median = 19.4. The values calculated in ablated area were: P, median = 10.9; AP, median = 9.6; BV, median = 5.5; HPI, median = 14.6; TTP, median = 39.6. The parameters calculated in the surrounding parenchyma were: P, median = 15.8; AP, median = 14.2; BV, median = 12.0; HPI, median = 17.9; TTP, median = 43.2. A significant difference (P Conclusion:Perfusion CT enables assessment of HCC vascularity after RFA treatment, by adding quantitative information about the presence of residual arterial vessels within the viable residual neoplastic tissue.
