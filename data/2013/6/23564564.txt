Background:Metastatic tumor antigen 1 (MTA1) overexpression is closely associated with postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been suggested that pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) can prevent the occurrence of HCC in patients who have chronic viral hepatitis. In this study, the authors examined whether postoperative adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy can reduce the recurrence of MTA1-positive HCC after curative surgical resection.Methods:In this case-control study, 93 patients with MTA1-positive HCC who underwent curative surgical resection were prospectively enrolled. The median patient age was 53 years (range, 27-78); there were 65 men and 28 women; the etiology was hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 77 patients, hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 6 patients, and non-HBV/non-HCV in 10 patients; 31 patients received Peg-IFN (Peg-INTRON) subcutaneously at a dose of 50 Î¼g per week for 12 months (the Peg-IFN group); and the remaining 62 patients were followed only and did not receive any adjuvant therapies (control group). Patients were followed every 1 to 3 months for a median of 24 months.Results:HCC recurred postoperatively in 26 of 93 patients (28%), and 9 patients (10%) died during follow-up. The overall cumulative recurrence rates were significantly lower in the Peg-IFN group than in the control group (7% and 14% vs. 24% and 34% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively; P Conclusions:The current data indicate that adjuvant Peg-IFN therapy may reduce the recurrence of HCC in patients who have MTA1-positive HCC after curative surgical resection.
