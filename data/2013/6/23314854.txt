Background:Thrombocytopenia has been reported to be both a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development as well as a prognostic factor. Many HCCs also occur in presence of normal platelets.Aim:To examine a cohort of HCC patients with associated thrombocytosis.Methods:Records were examined of a cohort of 634 biopsy-proven and randomly presenting HCC patients without thrombocytopenia.Results:In the total cohort, 52 patients were identified with thrombocytosis (platelet levels >400 Ã— 10(9)/L) and compared with 582 patients with normal platelet values. The average tumor sizes were 13.1 versus 8.8 cm (p 5 cm. Thrombocytosis patients were younger and had less cirrhosis, but similar percent with hepatitis B or C or alcohol consumption.Conclusion:Thrombocytosis in association with HCC occurs in patients with larger tumor sizes and better liver function.
