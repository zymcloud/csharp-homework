Introduction:Appropriate selection of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) patients for liver transplantation is crucial to minimize the risk of recurrence and provide long-term outcomes comparable with those for other indications. Selection criteria based on total tumor volume (TTV) and Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations were proposed in a recent large study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of liver transplantation for HCC within and beyond these criteria.Material and methods:This retrospective study included 104 patients with HCC who underwent liver transplantation. Risk factors for overall survival and tumor recurrence were evaluated. Overall survival and cumulative tumor recurrence rate for patients with TTV Results:Pretransplantation AFP concentration >400 ng/mL (P = .016; hazard ratio [HR], 3.36; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.25-9.03) was the only risk factor for overall survival. TTV >115 cm(3) (P = .021; HR 4.29; 95% CI, 1.24-14.81) and AFP concentration >400 ng/mL (P = .002; HR 6.97; 95% CI, 2.02-24.03) were independent risk factors for recurrence. The estimated 3-year tumor recurrence rate was 4.2% for patients with TTV Conclusions:In contrast to other criteria, selection of HCC patients for liver transplantation on the basis of TTV and AFP concentration relates to both morphological features and tumor biology. Although fulfillment of these criteria was more than 1.5-fold higher than that of the Milan criteria, the rate of tumor recurrence was exceptionally low.
