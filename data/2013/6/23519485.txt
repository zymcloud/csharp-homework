We have investigated the expression and role of the 58-kDa micro-spherule protein (MSP58) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunohistochemistry was performed in 252 samples from patients with HCC to detect the expression level of MSP58. Results indicated that the expression level of MSP58 in the cancer samples was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test showed significant difference in the expression of MSP58 in patients with serum AFP, tumor size, histological differentiation, and universal integrated circuit card (UICC) stage (P
