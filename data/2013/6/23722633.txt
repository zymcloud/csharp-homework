Background:Numerous donor and recipient risk factors influence survival after liver transplantation (LT).Methods:The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the effect of donor and recipient variables on 12-month patient and graft survival after LT. Five hundred forty-six patients underwent LT in a single center (2000-2010).Results:Bilirubin (P=0.006) and cold ischemia time (P=0.002) were predictive of graft loss at 12 months after LT. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score â‰¥25 was associated with a lower 12-month graft survival than Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score Conclusions:Bilirubin and cold ischemia time are crucial for graft outcome post-LT. Survival in HCV-positive patients is lower than in HCV-negative recipients. Donor age and partial graft use are predictive of patient and graft survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
