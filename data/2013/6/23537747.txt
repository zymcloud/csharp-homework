Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and its receptor, c-Met activation has recently been shown to play important roles in cancer invasion and metastasis in a wide variety of tumor cells. We use HGF as an invasive inducer of human HepG2 cells to investigate the effect of four flavones including apigenin, tricetin, tangeretin, and nobiletin on HGF/c-Met-mediated tumor invasion and metastasis. Among them, nobiletin markedly inhibited HGF-induced the abilities of the adhesion, invasion, and migration by cell-matrix adhesion assay and transwell-chamber invasion/migration assay under non-cytotoxic concentrations. Data also showed nobiletin inhibited HGF-induced cell scattering and cytoskeleton changed such as filopodia and lamellipodia. Furthermore, nobiletin could inhibit HGF-induced the membrane localization of phosphorylated c-Met, ERK2, and Akt, but not phosphorylated JNK1/2 and p38. Next, nobiletin significantly decreased the levels of phospho-ERK2 and phospho-Akt in ERK2 or Akt siRNA-transfected cells concomitantly with a marked reduction on cell invasion and migration. In conclusion, nobiletin attenuates HGF-induced HepG2 cells metastasis involving both ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways and are potentially useful as anti-metastatic agents for the treatment of hepatoma.
