Many studies have shown that Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles are associated with the development of various cancers. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown. To investigate whether HLA class I allelic polymorphism is related to the development of hepatitis B virus(HBV)-associated HCC, a total of 326 HBV-infected patients (138 individuals with HCC and 188 well-matched controls without HCC) were enrolled in this study. HLA-A, -B, and -C were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) method. We identified HLA-B(∗)35:01:01G as a risk factor for HBV-related HCC development independent of our previous findings in HLA region (OR, 12.04; p, 0.0028; pc, 0.04). HLA-A(∗)11:01:01G, B(∗)58:01:01G, C(∗)03:02:01G and some of their extended haplotypes were found as potential susceptible factors for HCC development. HLA-B(∗)46:01:01G and some of its extended haplotypes were found as potential protective factors for HCC development. Our results support that specific HLA class I alleles and haplotypes may affect the risk of HBV-related HCC development. The findings may help to determine better approaches for prevention and treatment of HCC in these patients.
