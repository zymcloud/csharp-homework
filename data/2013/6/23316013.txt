We aimed to establish an objective point score to guide the decision for retreatment with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In all, 222 patients diagnosed with HCC and treated with multiple TACE cycles between January 1999 and December 2009 at the Departments of Gastroenterology/Hepatology of the Medical Universities of Vienna (training cohort) and Innsbruck (validation cohort) were included. We investigated the effect of the first TACE on parameters of liver function and tumor response and their impact on overall survival (OS, log rank test) and developed a point score (ART score: Assessment for Retreatment with TACE) in the training cohort (n = 107, Vienna) by using a stepwise Cox regression model. The ART score was externally validated in an independent validation cohort (n = 115, Innsbruck). The increase of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by >25% (hazard ratio [HR] 8.4; P Conclusion:An ART score of â‰¥2.5 prior the second TACE identifies patients with a dismal prognosis who may not profit from further TACE sessions.
