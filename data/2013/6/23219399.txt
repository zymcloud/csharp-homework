Chronic kidney disease is associated with premature death from cardiovascular disease, which is, in part, driven by high density lipoprotein deficiency and dysfunction. One of the main causes of high density lipoprotein deficiency in chronic kidney disease is diminished plasma apolipoprotein (Apo)A-I level. Plasma ApoA-I is reduced in dialysis patients and hepatic ApoA-I messenger RNA (mRNA) is decreased in the uremic rats. This study explored the mechanism of uremia-induced downregulation of ApoA-I. Human hepatoma derived cells were incubated in media containing whole plasma or plasma subfractionation from normal subjects and patients with end stage renal disease pre- and posthemodialysis. Cells and culture media were isolated to measure ApoA-I protein and mRNA. ApoA-I promoter activity was measured using transfection with a luciferase promoter construct containing the -2096 to +293 segment of ApoA-I gene. Finally, effect of uremic and control plasma was assessed on ApoA-I RNA stability. Exposure to uremic plasma significantly reduced ApoA-I mRNA expression and ApoA-I protein production. These effects were reversed by replacing uremic plasma with normal plasma. Although no difference in ApoA-I promoter activity was found between cells exposed to uremic and normal plasma, uremic plasma significantly reduced ApoA-I RNA stability. Experiments using plasma subfractions revealed that the inhibitory effect of uremic plasma on ApoA-I mRNA expression resides in fractions containing molecules larger but not smaller than 30 kd. The pre- and postdialysis plasma exerted an equally potent inhibitory effect on ApoA-I mRNA abundance. Uremia lowers ApoA-I production by reducing its RNA stability. The inhibitory effect of uremic milieu on ApoA-I mRNA expression is mediated by non-dialyzable molecule(s) larger than 30 kd.
