Emerging evidence indicates that the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster may possess a causal role in mammary tumorigenesis and function as a novel class of oncogenes. However, the regulatory mechanism of the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster in mammary carcinoma cell invasion and migration is still largely unknown. We observed that the expression levels of miR-23a, miR-24-2 and miR-27a were significantly higher in breast cancer with lymph node metastasis, compared with that from patients without lymph node metastasis or normal tissue. Forced expression of the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster promoted mammary carcinoma cell migration, invasion, and hepatic metastasis, through targeting Sprouty2 (SPRY2) and consequent activation of p44/42 MAPK. Epidermal growth factor induced the expression of the transcription factor c-MYC, which promoted the expression of mature miR-23a, miR-24-2, and miR-27a and subsequently decreased expression of SPRY2 and activated p44/42 MAPK to promote mammary carcinoma cell migration and invasion. We therefore suggest a novel link between epidermal growth factor and the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster via the regulation of c-MYC, providing the potential for the miR-23a/24-2/27a cluster to be used as biomarker in the diagnosis and/or treatment of breast cancer.
