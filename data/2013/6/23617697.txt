A series of hybrids from O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)diazeniumdiolate and oleanolic acid (OA) were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated as novel nitric oxide (NO)-releasing prodrugs that could be activated by glutathione S-transferase π (GSTπ) overexpressed in a number of cancer cells. It was discovered that the most active compound, 21, released high levels of NO selectively in HCC cells but not in the normal cells and exhibited potent antiproliferative activity in vitro as well as remarkable tumor-retarding effects in vivo. Compared with the reported GSTπ-activated prodrugs JS-K and PABA/NO, 21 exhibited remarkably improved stability in the absence of GSTπ. Importantly, the decomposition of 21 occurred in the presence of GSTπ and was much more effective than in glutathione S-transferase α. Additionally, 21 induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, activating both the mitochondrion-mediated pathway and the MAPK pathway and enhancing the intracellular production of ROS.
