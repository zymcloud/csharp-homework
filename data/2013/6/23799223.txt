Gall bladder malignancy predominantly comprises adenocarcinoma and is found mostly in a late stage whereas primary lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) within the gall bladder is exceedingly rare and has an incidental presentation. We report a case of well differentiated adenocarcinoma with MALT lymphoma of the gall bladder in an 83 year old woman. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a carcinoma and lymphoma occurring simultaneously in the gall bladder.
