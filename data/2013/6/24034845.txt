Objective:To conduct a meta-analysis to study the effect of antiviral therapy on the prognosis of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)-related cirrhosis.Methods:PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese Biomedical Database, Chinese Journals Full-text Database, and Wan Fang Digital Journal Full-text Database were searched for studies on nucleoside analogues antiviral treatment outcome of patients with CHB-related cirrhosis (vs. controls without antiviral therapy) published between January 1998 and March 2012. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed by two independent investigators. Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 index. In the case of homogeneity the random-effects model was applied, and in the case of heterogeneity the fixed-effects model was applied. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Results:Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis: one high-quality randomized-controlled trial (RCT) study, four prospective cohort studies, and two case-control studies. Compared to the control group, the group treated with antiviral therapy showed a significantly lower incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (11.2%, 76/680 vs. 6.7%, 75/1116; OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.79, P = 0.001) and lower mortality (23.6%, 78/331 vs. 10.8%, 43/398; OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.55, P = 0.000).Conclusion:Antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogues significantly reduces the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and mortality in patients with CHB-related cirrhosis.
