Objective:The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical, pathologic, and computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of hepatic angiomyolipoma (HAML) and to improve the diagnostic efficacy of the tumor.Materials and methods:Clinical, pathologic, and imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated in 18 patients with HAML. Two patients underwent both CT and MRI, ten underwent CT alone, and six underwent MRI alone. Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced examinations were performed in all patients. Imaging characteristics, such as the lesion location, lesion diameter, presence of early draining veins, attenuation/signal intensity of the lesions on imaging, and enhancement pattern were reviewed.Results:There were 3 male and 15 female patients. HAML was seen as a well-defined, solitary mass on imaging with medium size (mean diameter, 5.9 cm). Fat was detected in ten patients. Calcification was noted in two patients and cystic degeneration was seen in one patient. Hepatic cirrhosis and capsule were not detected in all patients. The mean attenuation values exceeded 120 hounsfield units (HU) in 11 patients (91.7%). Peripherally decreasing enhancement rim as well as early draining vein was seen in 15 patients (83.3%). The early draining veins were all hepatic veins. Tumor vessels were noted in all patients.Conclusion:The presence of early draining vein, peripheral decreasing enhancement rim, and the absence of tumor capsule in the hypervascular hepatic tumor on CT and/or MRI together with normal alpha fetal protein may be helpful for the diagnosis of HAML in non-cirrhotic liver.
