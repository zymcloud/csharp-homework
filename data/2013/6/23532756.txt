MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate post-transcriptional gene expression in various physiological and pathological processes, including viral infections. The miR-17-92 cluster encodes six miRNAs (miR-17-5p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, and miR-92a-1) which are transactivated by c-Myc. Because hepatitis B virus transactivates c-Myc, the interaction between the miR-17-92 cluster and HBV replication was examined in this study. Inducing HBV replication in a human hepatoma cell line increased miR-17-5p, miR-20a and miR-92a-1 expression. HBV-induced overexpression of miR-17-92 was reversed by c-Myc knockdown. Antisense peptide nucleic acids against miR-20a and miR-92a-1 augmented HBV replication. A computational analysis yielded potential binding sites for miR-20a and miR-92a-1 in the HBV genome. The direct interaction between these two miRNAs and target regions in HBV transcripts was confirmed by luciferase reporter analysis. These results demonstrated negative feedback suppression of HBV replication by the miR-17-92 polycistron.
