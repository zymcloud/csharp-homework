In this article, we prepared a dual thermoresponsive and pH-responsive self-assembled micellar nanogel for anticancer drug delivery by using a degradable pH-responsive ketal derivative, mPEG2000-Isopropylideneglycerol (mPEG-IS, PI) polymer. The purpose of this study is to develop an injectable dual-responsive micellar nanogel system which has a sol-gel phase transition by the stimulation of body temperature with improved stability and biocompatibility as a controlled drug delivery carrier for cancer therapy. The pH-responsive PI was designed with pH-responsive ketal group as hydrophobic moieties and PEG group as hydrophilic moieties. The PI micelles encapsulated paclitaxel (PTX) was fabricated. Then, the PI micelles were formed in a thermo-nanogel. The micellar nanogel could improve the solubility and stability of PTX. The physiochemical properties of PI micelles and micellar nanogel were characterized. The results showed that dual-responsive micellar nanogel could carry out sol-gel transition at 37 Â°C. The PI polymer can spontaneously self-assemble into micellar structure with size of 100-200 nm. The dual-responsive micellar nanogel could be degraded under lower pH condition. The test in vitro PTX release showed that dual-responsive micellar nanogel could release about 70% for 70 h under pH 5.0 while about 10% release at pH 7.4 and pH 9.0. The dual-responsive micellar nanogel was of lower cytotoxicity and suppressed tumor growth most efficiently. The micellar nanogel will be a new potential dual-responsive drug delivery system for cancer therapy.
