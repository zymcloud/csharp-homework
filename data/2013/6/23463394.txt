Background:The purpose of the present study was to determine whether intrahepatic injection of (131)I-lipiodol (Lipiodol) is effective against recurrence of surgically resected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From June 2001 through March 2007, this nationwide multi-center prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled 103 patients 4-6 weeks after curative resection of HCC with complete recovery (52: Lipiodol, 51: Control). Follow-up was every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months. Primary and secondary endpoints were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively, both of which were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier technique and summarized by the hazard ratio (HR). The design was based on information obtained from a similar trial that had been conducted in Hong Kong.Results:The Lipiodol group showed a small, and nonsignificant, improvement over control in RFS (HR = 0.75; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 0.46-1.23; p = 0.25) and OS (HR = 0.88; 95 % CI 0.51-1.51; p = 0.64). Only two serious adverse events were reported, both with hypothyroidism caused by (131)I-lipiodol and hepatic artery dissection during angiography.Conclusions:The randomized trial provides insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of (131)I-lipiodol in these patients.
