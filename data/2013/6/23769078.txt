Background:For the first time at Asan Medical Center (AMC) we performed more than 400 liver transplantations (LTs) per year in 2011, despite same number of living donor liver transplantations (LDLTs).Methods:Our OLT program was started in 1992, but not activated well due to the scarcity of deceased donor organs. Since adult LDLTs using a left lobe and then a right lobe were successfully performed in 1997, we have developed several innovative techniques and approaches for adult LDLT, for example, modified right-lobe graft reconstructing middle hepatic branches in 1998, dual graft LDLT using 2 left lobes in 2000; new criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); as well as ABO-incompatible LDLT, the first in the world. As a result, the number of LDLTs has increased rapidly but reached a plateau recently. Nationwide efforts to promote deceased donation increased the number of deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT).Results:We have performed 317 LDLTs per year in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The number of LTs reached 403 in 2011. This large number was possible due to a remarkable increase of DDLTs from 50 in 2010 to 86 in 2011. Seventy-nine patients (68.1%) among 116 patients (28.8%) required an urgent LT receiving a DDLT. LT for HCC or ABO-mismatch comprised 50.3% (n = 150) or 8.7% (n = 35), respectively. In-hospital mortality rate in 2011 was 4.7%.Conclusions:The increased LTs number at AMC was aided by the nationwide campaign.
