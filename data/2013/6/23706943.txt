Previous studies suggest different pathways in the molecular development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the pattern of chromosomal imbalances in HCC depending on the type of underlying liver disease as detected by comparative genomic hybridization in 67 cases of primary HCC occurring in non-cirrhotic livers (n=30), in liver cirrhosis (LC) related to alcohol intake (n=9), cryptogenic or metabolic changes (n=11), and chronic viral hepatitis B or C (n=17). HCC were treated by liver resection in 48 patients and transplantation in 19 patients. The 10-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 51% and 68%, respectively. The copy number changes occurring in more than 10% of cases were gains at 8q (55%), 1q (49%), 7q (15%), 7p (13%), 6p (12%), and 20q (12%), as well as losses at 8p (55%), 4q (33%), 6q (33%), 13q (25%), 14q (24%), 17p (22%), 16q (19%), 1p (18%), 18q (16%), 9p (13%), 10q (13%), 4p (12%), and 9q (12%). HCC arising in alcoholic LC showed a different pattern with significantly fewer net changes (p=0.008), particularly fewer chromosomal gains (p=0.008) and fewer breakpoints (p=0.003) compared to the other investigated HCC subgroups. Future clinical studies should evaluate the prognostic relevance of these findings.
