Background:In perioperative management of hepatic resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), excessive blood loss and blood transfusion greatly influence postoperative complications and prognosis of the patients. We evaluated the influence of the use of blood products on prognosis of patients with CRLM.Patients and methods:The subjects of this study were 65 patients who underwent elective hepatic resection between January 2001 and April 2011 for CRLM without distant metastasis or other malignancy. We retrospectively investigated the influence of the use of blood products, including red cell concentrate (RC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and clinical variables on overall survival.Results:In univariate analysis, bilobar distribution (p=0.0332), more than four lymph node metastases of the primary cancer (p=0.0155), perioperative RC use (p=0.0205), and perioperative FFP use (p=0.0065) were positively associated with poor overall survival rate. In multivariate analysis, bilobar distribution (p=0.0012), more than four lymph node metastases of the primary cancer (p=0.0171), and perioperative FFP use (p=0.0091), were independent risk factors for poor overall survival rate.Conclusion:The use of FFP is associated with worse overall survival after elective hepatic resection for patients with CRLM.
