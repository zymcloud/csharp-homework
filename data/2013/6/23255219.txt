In the US, approximately 2,000 children are diagnosed with rare cancers each year, with 5-year survival ranging from <20% for children with advanced carcinomas to >95% for children with intraocular retinoblastoma or localized germ cell tumors. During the last years, 12 clinical studies have been successfully completed in children with retinoblastoma, liver tumors, germ cell tumors, and infrequent malignancies, including therapeutic, epidemiologic, and biologic studies. Current efforts are centered in the development of large international collaborations to consolidate evidence-based definitions and risk stratifications that will support international Phase 3 clinical trials in germ cell tumors, hepatoblastoma, and other rare cancers.
