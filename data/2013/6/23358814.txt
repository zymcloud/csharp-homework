Purpose:The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of pathological response (PR), disease control and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using oxaliplatin (OX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with concurrent radiotherapy for treating locally advanced rectal cancer.Materials and methods:Between November 2002 and December 2010, 90 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were retrospectively analysed. All patients underwent preoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions) with concurrent OX (80 mg/m(2) i.v., day 1) and a 120-h continuous infusion of 5-FU (1,000 mg/m(2) per day). Surgery was performed within 6 weeks after completion of CRT treatment.Results:Complete pathological response was obtained in six patients (6.7%), and 39 (43.3%) had their disease downstaged. The median follow-up period was 4.7 years (6 months to 9 years). Local recurrence occurred in two patients (2.2%), one of whom developed also liver metastases. Distant metastases not associated with local relapse occurred in 23 (25.6%) patients. Overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival were 62.9% and 52.8%, respectively. CRT was well tolerated, with only one grade 3 (1.2%) haematological toxicity (neutropaenia).Conclusions:Neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy based on OX and 5-UC associated with radiotherapy is well tolerated, with good results in terms of pathological response, disease control and survival, in rectal cancer patients.
