Purpose:The purpose of this study was the evaluation of prognostic factors for long-term survival and progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment of noncolorectal cancer liver metastases through MR-guided laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT).Patients and methods:We included 401 patients (mean age, 57.3 years) with liver metastases from different primary tumors who were treated with LITT. Long-term survival and progression-free-survival rates were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox regression model tested different parameters that could be of prognostic value. The tested prognostic factors were as follows: the location of primary tumor, TNM classification, extrahepatic metastases, hepatic resection or neoadjuvant transarterial chemoembolization or systemic chemotherapy before LITT, the number of initial metastases, the volume of metastases, and the quotient of total volumes of metastases and necroses per patient.Results:The median survival was 37.6 months starting from the date of LITT. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year survival rates were 86.5%, 67.2%, 51.9%, 39.9%, and 33.4%, respectively. The median PFS was 12.2 months. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year PFS rates were 50.6%, 33.8%, 26%, 20.4%, and 17%, respectively. The initial number of metastases, the volumes of metastases, and the quotient of the volumes of metastases and necroses influenced the long-term survival and the PFS.Conclusions:Laser-induced thermotherapy is a minimally invasive method in the treatment of hepatic metastases of noncolorectal cancer, and it shows good results in long-term survival and PFS. The initial number of metastases and their volume are the most important prognostic factors. The status of the lymph nodes, the existence of other extrahepatic metastases, the location of the primary tumor, and different neoadjuvant therapies are of nonprognostic value.
