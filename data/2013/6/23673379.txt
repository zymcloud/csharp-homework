A new and easy fast-screening test (the Ad-DR (adenoviral vector-dioxin response) bioassay) for dioxins in biological samples from highly dioxin-contaminated areas was developed. The aryl-hydrocarbon-receptor (AhR) reporter system was utilized to transport a dioxin-responsive-element (DRE) via an adenovirus vector into rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cells before each experiment; these DRE-H4IIE cells were utilized in the Ad-DR bioassay. Biological extracts were simultaneously analyzed by the Ad-DR bioassay and high resolution gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). A good correlation was found between the results of the HRGC/HRMS assay and those of the Ad-DR bioassay (R(2) = 0.920, p < 0.001). The bio-analytical equivalent (BEQ) value found in fish or crab caught in the abandoned pentachlorophenol plant (AP) was extremely high compared with the BEQ in fish or crab caught in two rivers nearby this abandoned plant. Dioxins were more heavily bioaccumulated in fish viscera than in fish muscles or in the whole fish. Two-way analysis of variance tests identified the significant effects of fish collection site, fish or crab tissue sample and the interaction between them on dioxin levels in the tissues of these aquatic animals. In conclusion, the Ad-DR bioassay is a useful tool to determine dioxin levels in samples of fish and crab. Compared with fish tissues, where a sample is taken (in the PCP plant or nearby rivers) is the most important factor to determine bioaccumulation of dioxins in fish.
