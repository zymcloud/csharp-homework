Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to represent a major worldwide problem. Although treatments such as resection, transplantation, and ablation may provide a chance for a cure, these options are often precluded because of advanced disease presentation. Palliative treatments include transarterial embolization and systemic therapies. This review will summarize the state of the science for embolic therapies in HCC (conventional and drug-eluting chemoembolization, radioembolization) as well as discuss related topics including HCC staging, assessment of response, and ongoing clinical trials.
