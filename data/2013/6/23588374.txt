The present study showed that the combination of dasatinib and combretastatin A-4 (CA-4) exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity in multiple types of cancer, including ovarian, hepatocellular, lung and prostate carcinoma. The enhanced apoptosis induced by dasatinib plus CA-4 was accompanied by a greater extent of mitochondrial depolarization, caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in HO-8910 cells. Furthermore, elevated expression of Mcl-1 led to a reduced apoptosis induced by dasatinib plus CA-4, highlighting that downregulated Mcl-1 was necessary for the potentiating effect of dasatinib to CA-4-triggered apoptosis. A clear increase in Î³-H2AX expression was observed in the dasatinib+CA-4 group compared with the mono-treatment groups, indicating that dasatinib plus CA-4 may induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) in HO-8910 cells. Moreover, the increased anticancer efficacy of dasatinib combined with CA-4 was further validated in a human HO-8910 ovarian cancer xenograft model in nude mice. Our study is the first to show that the combination of dasatinib with CA-4 could be a novel and promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer.
