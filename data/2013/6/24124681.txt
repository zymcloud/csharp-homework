Objective:To assess the clinical efficacies of three types of anatomical hepatic inflow occlusion method in hepatectomy for liver neoplasms.Methods:A non-randomized concurrent controlled trial was performed from January 2011 to October 2012, a total of 180 consecutive patients with liver neoplasms underwent hepatectomy similarly. They were divided into 3 groups according to the hepatic inflow occlusion methods during resection: HHV group (hemi-hepatic vascular inflow occlusion, n = 60), MPV group (main portal vein inflow occlusion, n = 60) and HPP group (hemi-portal vein preserved inflow occlusion, n = 60). The primary endpoints were intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirement while the secondary outcomes were assessed with operating duration, postoperative morbidity, hospital stay, gastrointestinal function and postoperative liver injury.Results:No significant differences existed among three groups in demographic and tumor characteristics and operation-related background (P > 0.05). No mortality happened in 30 days postoperatively in all patients. Intraoperative volume of blood loss had no significant differences among three groups (P = 0.272). Among the patients requiring transfusion, HPP group had the least transfusion requirement (HHV group: (5.00 ± 1.51) U, MPV group:(3.50 ± 1.41) U, HPP group: (2.50 ± 0.93) U, P = 0.004). MPV group showed a significant shorter operating duration (HHV group: (227 ± 59) min, MPV group:(198 ± 56) min, HPP group:(221 ± 79) min, P = 0.042). No significant differences were found among three groups in hospital stay (P = 0.673) or postoperative morbidity (P = 0.735), including hepatic insufficiency, infection and ascites. HHV group showed an earlier recovery of gastrointestinal function (HHV group: (60 ± 12) h, MPV group:(69 ± 9) h, HPP group:(64 ± 8) h, P = 0.000).MPV group had a significantly lower level of aminotransferase at Day 1 and 3 postoperation (d1 ALT: HHV group: (403 ± 271) U/L, MPV group:(304 ± 211) U/L, HPP group: (448 ± 396) U/L, P = 0.033; d1 AST: HHV group: (394 ± 271) U/L, MPV group:(278 ± 189) U/L, HPP group: (432 ± 405) U/L, P = 0.017; d3 ALT: HHV group: (309 ± 193) U/L, MPV group:(232 ± 161) U/L, HPP group:(325 ± 277) U/L, P = 0.048; d3 AST: HHV group:(136 ± 105) U/L, MPV group:(91 ± 73) U/L, HPP group:(120 ± 87) U/L, P = 0.024).But no significant differences were found among three groups regarding total bilirubin, albumin, prealbumin and prothrombin time activity (P < 0.05) during any postoperative stage.Conclusion:All three types of anatomical vascular occlusion method are both safe and efficacious in hepatectomy. But no single method has absolute advantage over the other two. HPP method has the best hemostatic effect, MPV offers better postoperative liver function and HHV promotes early recovery of gastrointestinal function.
