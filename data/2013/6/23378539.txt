Background:To update and compare mortality from primary liver cancer (PLC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in Europe in 1990-2010.Materials and methods:We used data from the World Health Organization (WHO) to compute age-standardized (world population) mortality rates, and used joinpoint analysis to identify substantial changes.Results:Between 2002 and 2007, PLC rates in the European Union (EU) declined from 3.9 to 3.6/100,000 men. Around 2007, the highest male rates were in France (6.2/100,000), Spain (4.9), and Italy (4.0), while the lowest ones were in Sweden (1.1), the Netherlands (1.2), and the UK (1.8). In women, mortality was lower (0.8/100,000 in 2007 in the EU), and showed more favourable trends, with a decline of over 2% per year over the last two decades as compared with 0.4% in men, in the EU. In contrast, the EU mortality from ICC increased by around 9% in both sexes from 1990 to 2008, reaching rates of 1.1/100,000 men and 0.75/100,000 women. The highest rates were in UK, Germany, and France (1.2-1.5/100,000 men, 0.8-1.1/100,000 women).Conclusions:PLC mortality has become more uniform across Europe over recent years, with an overall decline; in contrast, ICC mortality has substantially increased in most Europe.
