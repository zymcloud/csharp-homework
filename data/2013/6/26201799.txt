Purpose:The effectiveness of imaging (including apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [DWI]) and laboratory variables for predicting early tumor recurrence and overall survival after surgery in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are analyzed.Methods:The present study included 116 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent partial hepatectomy. Patients were classified into two groups: patients with and without early recurrence (Results:Twenty patients (17 %) developed early recurrence after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that tumor ADC (p = 0.0002), aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.0121), and serum prothrombin time activity percentage (p = 0.0082) were statistically significant for predicting early recurrence. The optimal ADC cutoff value for predicting early recurrence obtained from receiver operating characteristic analysis was ≤0.898 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. In patients with ADC ≤0.898 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, the 3- and 5-year survival rates (77 and 56 %, respectively) were significantly decreased compared with those in patients with ADC >0.898 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s (97 and 97 %, respectively; p = 0.0015).Conclusions:Low tumor ADC value by DWI was a risk factor for early postoperative HCC recurrence and was associated with lower patient survival rates.
