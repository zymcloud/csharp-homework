Inflammation has been considered as one of the hallmarks of cancer, and chronic hepatitis is a major cause of liver cancer. This review will focus on the pathogenic role of inflammation in hepatocarcinogenesis and will discuss recent advances in understanding the chronic hepatitis-liver cancer link based on hot spots in liver cancer research, including cellular interaction, cytokines, microRNA and stem cells. All of these mechanisms should be taken into consideration because they are crucial for the development of more efficacious therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating human chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
