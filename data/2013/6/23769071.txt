Background:Locoregional interventional bridging treatment (IBT) before liver transplantation (LT) is an accepted neoadjuvant approach in liver transplant patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the effect of postinterventional tumor necrosis on posttransplantation outcome is known.Methods:A total of 93 consecutive liver transplant patients with HCC were included in this prospective trial. Fifty-nine patients underwent pretransplantation IBT, by either transarterial chemoembolization (n = 51) or radiofrequency ablation (n = 8). The extent of tumor necrosis assessed at explant pathology (â‰¥50% tumor necrosis rate = extended post-IBT tumor necrosis; Results:Extended tumor necrosis was assessed in 44 patients among the IBT population, and tumor necrosis rate was Conclusions:Extended tumor necrosis should be the major objective of neoadjuvant IBT in liver transplant patients with HCC, because it significantly improves posttransplantation outcome. Thereby, even patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria may achieve excellent survival rates.
