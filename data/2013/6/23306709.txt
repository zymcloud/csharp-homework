Objectives:To investigate the value of CT spectral imaging in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) during the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PP).Methods:Fifty-eight patients with 42 HCCs and 16 FNHs underwent spectral CT during AP and PP. The lesion-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) at different energy levels, normalised iodine concentrations (NIC) and the lesion-normal parenchyma iodine concentration ratio (LNR) were calculated. The two-sample t test compared quantitative parameters. Two readers qualitatively assessed lesion types according to imaging features. Sensitivity and specificity of the qualitative and quantitative studies were compared.Results:In general, CNRs at low energy levels (40-70 keV) were higher than those at high energy levels (80-140 keV). NICs and LNRs for HCC differed significantly from those of FNH: mean NICs were 0.25 mg/mL ± 0.08 versus 0.42 mg/mL ± 0.12 in AP and 0.52 mg/mL ± 0.14 versus 0.86 mg/mL ± 0.18 in PP. Mean LNRs were 2.97 ± 0.50 versus 6.15 ± 0.62 in AP and 0.99 ± 0.12 versus 1.22 ± 0.26 in PP. NICs and LNRs for HCC were lower than those of FNH. LNR in AP had the highest sensitivity and specificity in differentiating HCC from FNH.Conclusions:CT spectral imaging may help to increase detectability of lesions and accuracy of differentiating HCC from FNH.Key points:• CT spectral imaging may help to detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). • CT spectral imaging may help differentiate HCC from focal nodular hyperplasia. • Quantitative analysis of iodine concentration provides greater diagnostic confidence. • Treatment can be given with greater confidence.
