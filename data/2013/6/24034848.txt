Objective:To construct glypican-3 (GPC-3) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and investigate the effects of GPC-3 transcription silencing on hepatoma cell invasion and angiogenesis mechanisms.Methods:GPC-3-specific shRNA and non-target control shRNA were constructed and transfected into the human hepatoma cell lines HepG2, MHCC-97H, and Huh7. shRNA-mediated silencing of GPC-3 expression was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels by fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription (FQRT)-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The effect of silenced GPC-3 expression on cell proliferation was detected by EdU and sulforhodamine B assays, on migration by wound healing (scratch) assay, on invasion by transwell chamber assay, and on apoptosis by luminescence assay of caspase-3/7 activity. The effect of silenced GPC-3 expression on angiogenesis-related signaling factors was detected by FQRT-PCR (for the glioma-associated oncogene homolog-1 hedgehog signaling factor, GLI1, and the beta-catenin Wnt signaling factor, b-catenin), immunofluorescent staining (for the insulin-like growth factor-II, IGF-II), and ELISA (for the vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF). Pairwise comparisons were made by the independent sample t-test, and multiple comparisons were made by one-way ANOVA.Results:In all cell lines, transfection with the GPC-3-specific shRNA significantly reduced GPC-3 mRNA levels (% reduction as compared to the non-target control shRNA: HepG2, 89.2+/-6.0%, t = -25.753, P less than 0.001; MHCC-97H, 75.3+/-4.9%, t = -26.487, P less than 0.001; Huh7, 73.6+/-4.6%, t = -27.607, P less than 0.001); the GPC-3 protein levels were similarly reduced. The GPC-3 shRNA-silenced cells showed significantly reduced proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities, as well as significantly increased apoptosis. The shRNA-mediated GPC-3 silencing was accompanied by significant down-regulation of b-catenin mRNA (HepG2, 46.9+/-0.6%; MHCC-97H, 67.5+/-2.7%; Huh7, 56.3+/-8.4%) and significant up-regulation of GLI1 mRNA (HepG2, 49.2+/-28.6%; MHCC-97H, 54.6+/-24.4%; Huh7, 31.6+/-15.7%). At 72 h after transfection, the HepG2 cells showed significant down-regulation of VEGF protein (54.3+/-1.5%, t = 46.746, P less than 0.001).Conclusion:GPC-3 contributes to migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and apoptosis of hepatoma cells, possibly through its interactions with the Wnt/b-catenin and Hedgehog signaling pathways. GPC-3 may represent a useful target for gene silencing by molecular-based therapies to treat hepatocellular carcinoma.
