Purpose:The aim of the current study was to investigate whether pure laparoscopic partial hepatectomy can be safely performed using a newly developed vessel sealing device, BiClamp.Methods:Nine cases of pure laparoscopic partial hepatectomy were performed by simply transecting liver parenchyma using the BiClamp. Four patients had a cirrhotic liver. The median tumor diameter was 1.5 cm (range, 1.0 to 2.7 cm). The tumors were located in segment (S) 3 in 3 cases, S4 in 1 case, S5 in 2 cases, S6 in 1 case, and S8 in 2 cases. Simultaneous cholecystectomy was performed in 4 cases.Results:The median operation time was 187 minutes (range, 83 to 423 min) and the median estimated blood loss was little (range, little to 417 mL). All patients were discharged from the hospital without any adverse postoperative consequences.Conclusions:BiClamp is an effective device for transecting liver parenchyma during pure laparoscopic partial hepatectomy, even in cirrhotic livers.
