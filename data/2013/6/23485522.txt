Background & aims:Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT-scan) is a standard of care for the radiological diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis. This technique, however, is not validated to exclude intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) which may develop in patients with cirrhosis, as well.Methods:To assess the features of contrast CT-scan in the diagnosis of ICC, we reviewed all CT-scan films obtained in cirrhotic patients with a histologically documented ICC, taking in consideration the pattern and dynamics of the arterial, portal venous and delayed phases of contrast uptake.Results:Thirty-two patients had 40 nodules of ICC (22 male; median age 62years; 13 hepatitis C) that were identified either during surveillance with abdominal ultrasound (21 patients, 66%) or incidentally (11 patients, 34%). ICC was either multifocal or â‰¥ 30 mm in 11 of the former and 10 of the latter group (52% vs. 91%, pConclusions:ICC in cirrhotic patients displays distinct vascular patterns at CT-scan that allow for differentiation from HCC.
