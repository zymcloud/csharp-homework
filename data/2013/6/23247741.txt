Background:Standard oncologic liver resections performed on elderly patients (≥70 years old) have been shown to be safe and effective. The aim of this study was to analyze operative and oncologic short-term outcomes of totally laparoscopic liver resections (TLLR) performed on elderly patients for malignancies.Methods:We performed a retrospective statistical analysis of prospectively recorded data of TLLR performed from October 2008 to February 2012 by a single hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgeon. Patients were divided into two groups according to age (Result:A total of 60 TLLR for malignancies were identified of which 25 patients (42 %) were aged ≥ 70 years (Group A) and 35 (58 %) were aged Conclusion:This retrospective comparative study shows that TLLR performed on elderly for liver neoplasm are feasible and safe and lead to short-term outcomes similar to those of younger patients.
