Large cystic renal tumours can be confused with hepatic lesions even on crosssectional imaging. Careful clinical, sonographic and imaging analysis is needed for establishing correct diagnosis. We report a case of papillary cystic renal carcinoma in a 60 year old man, which was confused with amoebic liver abcess and was initially drained. Subsequent recurrence of symptoms prompted us to re-evaluate the case and repeat sonography confirmed the extrahepatic origin of mass based on simple observation that the liver and mass were moving separately on inspiration. Later guided aspiration from solid component of the mass confirmed the diagnosis as renal cell carcinoma. He was successfully treated with radical nephrectomy with uneventful post-operative recovery.
