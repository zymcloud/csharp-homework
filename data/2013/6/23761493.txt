An 80-year-old man with known metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, not on current treatment, was presented with bleeding gingival and penile masses. Bleeding from both sites was able to be controlled with local treatment and subsequent discontinuation of his clopidogrel. The gingival mass was biopsied and was found consistent with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. Owing to the concern of recurrent bleeding, the penile mass was not biopsied. Given the significant progression of his disease, the patient was discharged to hospice care.
