Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence following liver transplantation is associated to bad prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 95 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC. Recurrence rate and variables associated with recurrence were reviewed. According to the findings on the explanted livers they were divided in two groups: Milan (M) 67% and non-Milan (NM) 33%. Global recurrence rate, and M-group and NM-group recurrence rates were 19%; 12% and 32%, respectively (P = 0.001). Although in the univariate analysis we found some factors associated to recurrence (hemocromathosis, year of transplant, bilobar distribution, vascular invasion and previous chemoembolization), they were not independent predictors of recurrence in the multivariate analysis. Actuarial survival in cirrhotic patients with and without HCC at 1, 3 and 5 years was 86% and 91% (NS), 77% and 88% (NS), and 67% and 86% (P = 0.002), respectively; whereas actuarial survival of the M and NM groups was 86% and 71%; 82% and 61%, and 78% and 58%, respectively (P = 0.02). We had a satisfactory five-year global survival in our series even though one third of our patients grafted for HCC were outside Milan criteria.
