Background:In pancreatitis, total pancreatectomy (TP) is an effective treatment for refractory pain. Islet cell auto-transplantation (IAT) may mitigate resulting endocrinopathy. Short-term morbidity data for TP + IAT and comparisons with TP are limited.Methods:This study, using 2005-2011 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data, examined patients with pancreatitis or benign neoplasms. Morbidity after TP alone was compared with that after TP + IAT.Results:In 126 patients (40%) undergoing TP and 191 (60%) patients undergoing TP + IAT, the most common diagnosis was chronic pancreatitis. Benign neoplasms were present in 46 (14%) patients, six of whom underwent TP + IAT. Patients in the TP + IAT group were younger and had fewer comorbidities than those in the TP group. Despite this, major morbidity was more frequent after TP + IAT than after TP [n = 79 (41%) versus n = 36 (29%); P = 0.020]. Transfusions were more common after TP + IAT [n = 39 (20%) versus n = 9 (7%); P = 0.001], as was longer hospitalization (13 days versus 9 days; P < 0.0001). There was no difference in mortality.Conclusions:This study is the only comparative, multicentre study of TP and TP + IAT. The TP + IAT group experienced higher rates of major morbidity and transfusion, and longer hospitalizations. Better data on the longterm benefits of TP + IAT are needed. In the interim, this study should inform physicians and patients regarding the perioperative risks of TP + IAT.
