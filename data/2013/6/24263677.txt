Perturbation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling in hepatocytes persistently infected with hepatitis viruses promotes both fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis (fibro-carcinogenesis). Insights into hepatocytic fibro-carcinogenesis have emerged from recent detailed analyses of context-dependent and cell type-specific TGF-β signaling processes directed by multiple phosphorylated forms (phospho-isoforms) of Smad mediators. In the course of hepatitis virus-related chronic liver diseases, chronic inflammation, ongoing viral infection, and host genetic/epigenetic alterations additively shift hepatocytic Smad phospho-isoform signaling from tumor suppression to fibro-carcinogenesis, accelerating liver fibrosis and increasing risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After successful antiviral therapy, patients with chronic hepatitis can experience less risk of HCC occurrence by reversing Smad phospho-isoform signaling from fibro-carcinogenesis to tumor suppression. However, patients with cirrhosis can still develop HCC owing to sustained, intense fibro-carcinogenic signaling. Recent progress in understanding Smad phospho-isoform signaling should permit use of Smad phosphorylation as a tool predicting the likelihood of liver disease progression, and as a biomarker for assessing the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing fibrosis and cancer risk.
