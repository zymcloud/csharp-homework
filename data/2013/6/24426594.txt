Multiple synchronous primary malignancies have been reported since the 19th century. A number of proposed theories as to the predisposing factors have been discussed. The criteria to diagnose multiple primary malignancies have been revised by Warren and Gates. We hereby present a case of an asymptomatic individual detected with a synchronous hepatocellular carcinoma and a renal cell carcinoma, its presentation, diagnosis, and the management. The occurrence of synchronous hepatocellular carcinoma with renal cell carcinoma is very rare and only a few cases have been reported. Synchronous extrahepatic primary malignancies have been reported in a few studies across the world though with a varied incidence rate. The occurrence seems to be in the older age group without gender differentiation. The extrahepatic malignancies were more common in cirrhotic livers though the overall survival does not differ between patients with hepatocellular carcinoma alone and hepatocellular carcinoma with synchronous extrahepatic malignancies.
