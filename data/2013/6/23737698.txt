Radiofrequency ablation (rfa) is a standard treatment for small, unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas (hccs). However, rfa for larger tumours is less successful, and intravenous lyso-thermosensitive liposomal doxorubicin during rfa is one technique postulated to potentially address that limitation. This drug-plus-device combination therapy was used to completely treat a hcc in a patient who underwent liver transplantation 79 days later.
