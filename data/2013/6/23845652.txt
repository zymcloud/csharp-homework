Hepatic adenomas are rare benign liver tumors seen most commonly in young women on oral contraceptives. Large hepatic adenomas are at risk of malignant transformation and require treatment in select patients, usually by surgical resection. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become a widely used and accepted tool for the curative treatment of small primary hepatocellular carcinomas in adults; however, its use in the treatment of other liver lesions, such as hepatic adenoma, has only recently been described. Use of RFA for liver lesions in pediatric population remains novel. We present a case of large hepatic adenoma successfully treated with RFA in a child with chronic liver disease secondary to alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. RFA may be an attractive option in pediatric liver tumor management in selected cases because of its less invasive characteristics.
