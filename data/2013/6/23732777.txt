Background/aims:Recently, it has been reported that HACE1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, is epigenetically inactivated in human Wilms' tumors and HACE 1 expression was also down-regulated in colorectal and gastric carcinomas.Methodology:In this study, methylation status of the HACE1 gene was examined in primary carcinomas and the corresponding normal tissues derived from 27 patients with HCC using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP).Results:Methylation of the HACE1 gene was detected in 18 out of the 27 (67%) HCCs, suggesting that the methylation of HACE1 was frequently observed in HCC. The clinicopathological data were then correlated with these results. In the value of serum AFP (Î±-fetoprotein), a significant difference was observed (p=0.0025).Conclusions:All stages of HCCs presented HACE1 methylation, indicating that the HACE1 gene has been methylated from the early stages of HCCs.
