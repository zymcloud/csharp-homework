Objectives:Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) is associated with poor prognosis of various human cancers. However, the clinical and prognostic significance of CHI3L1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is largely unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate the expression of CHI3L1 in human HCC cell lines, clinical HCC specimens and its association with expressions of phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt), E-cadherin and prognostic significance.Methods:The protein level of CHI3L1 in HCC cell lines was evaluated by western blot. The mRNA and protein levels of CHI3L1 in 19 self-paired HCC specimens were assessed by RT-PCR and western blot assays. The clinical and prognostic significance of CHI3L1 in 70 cases of HCC patients was determined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, expressions of p-Akt and E-cadherin were also assessed.Results:The protein level of CHI3L1 paralleled with increased malignant potential of HCC cell lines (P Conclusions:CHI3L1 plays an essential role in HCC malignancies and may be served as a valuable prognostic biomarker for HCC patients.
