CT during aortography (CTAo) using IVR 64-multidetector-row CT (IVR-64MDCT) enables the rapid and simultaneous depiction of both the hepatic and extrahepatic feeding arteries in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and can be achieved using a reasonable volume of contrast medium. The scan time is approximately 6 s from the diaphragm to the kidney using CTAo with 64MDCT with a slice thickness and slice interval of 0.5 mm. The hepatoma feeding arteriogram appears in the angiographic monitor after CTAo, and can then be used to guide catheterization. We introduce the process for creating a hepatoma feeding arteriogram, synthesized from the following three volume-rendered images: background bone, aorta to hepatic-branch artery, and hepatoma to feeding artery. Uniquely, the hepatoma feeding arteriogram enables investigation of the feeding artery from the tumor side, rather than from the aorta side, and appears superior to selective arteriography in terms of detecting small HCC and its accompanying fine feeding arteries. Identification of these arteries by CT angiography with intravenous contrast medium injection is difficult because of the similarity in CT values between the feeding artery and the surrounding liver, thereby preventing the creation of a hepatoma feeding arteriogram. CTAo accelerates the process of deciding upon the catheter treatment strategy, shifting the decision to the point at which the feeding artery is investigated, because the hepatoma feeding arteriogram enables instant identification of the feeding artery and its connection to the hepatic branch artery. CTAo with IVR-64MDCT can potentially contribute to remarkable advances in IVR, especially transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for HCC.
