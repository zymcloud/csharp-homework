Background & aims:The gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often depicts non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules during the hepatobiliary phase in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is unclear whether the presence of these nodules is associated with HCC recurrence after hepatectomy. We conducted a prospective observational study to investigate the impact of the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules on the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI on the recurrence of HCC after hepatectomy.Methods:A total of 77 patients who underwent hepatectomy for primary, non-recurrent, hypervascular HCC were prospectively followed up after hepatectomy. Post-operative recurrence rates were compared according to the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules on preoperative Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI.Results:Recurrence rates after hepatectomy were higher in patients with non-hypervascular hypointense nodules (risk ratio 1.9396 [1.3615-2.7222]) and the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules was an independent factor associated with postoperative recurrence (risk ratio 2.1767 [1.5089-3.1105]) along with HCC differentiation and portal vein invasion. While no differences were found in the rate of intrahepatic metastasis recurrence based on the preoperative presence of non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules, the rate of multicentric recurrence was significantly higher in patients with preoperative non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules.Conclusions:Patients with preoperative non-hypervascular hypointense hepatic nodules detected during the hepatobiliary phase of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI are at higher risk of HCC recurrence after hepatectomy, mainly due to multicentric recurrence.
