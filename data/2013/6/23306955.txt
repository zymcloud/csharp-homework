Background:Performance status (PS) is closely linked with survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated its impact on treatment strategy for small HCC(s).Methods:A total of 360 and 362 HCC patients within the Milan criteria undergoing surgical resection (SR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), respectively, were prospectively enrolled. Patients were classified into PS 0 (n = 558) and PS ≥1 (n = 164) groups. Propensity score analysis was performed, and 168 and 35 matched pairs were selected from patients with PS 0 and ≥1, respectively.Results:The SR group was younger and had a higher male-to-female ratio, higher prevalence of hepatitis B, lower prevalence of hepatitis C, better PS, better liver functional reserve, and larger tumor burden than the RFA group (all p 0.05).Conclusions:For HCC patients within the Milan criteria and classified as PS 0, SR provides a better long-term survival compared with RFA. Performance status may enhance treatment selection and stratify the risk of survival in these patients.
