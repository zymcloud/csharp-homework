Activation of p53-independent pathways plays an important role in phytochemical-induced apoptosis and is considered to be a crucial factor in the invasion and metastasis of cancer. Previous studies have shown that combined effects of Stephania tetrandra with medicinal herbs exhibit beneficial effects in cancer patients. Tetrandrine, an active component of Stephania tetrandra has been reported to have anticancer properties in cancer cells. However, the mechanism(s) of action of tetrandrine in liver cancer have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of tetrandrine in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The results showed that tetrandrine inhibited HCC cell proliferation by suppression of cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase. Changes in the expression levels of Bax, Bcl, p53, survivin, PCNA, PARP and p21 were observed. In addition, tetrandrine increased caspase-3 expression and induced DNA fragmentation in Huh-7 cells. The results suggest that the anti-cancer effect of tetrandrine in Huh-7 cells may be mediated by p53-independent pathways.
