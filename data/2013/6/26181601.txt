In January 2008, a 67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In February 2010, she had tarry stools and anemia resulting from gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE). Argon plasma coagulation (APC) treatment for GAVE was performed at that time. She revisited our hospital in July 2010 because of tarry stools and anemia caused by GAVE recurrence, which required 5 APC sessions and blood transfusion to control the bleeding. In October 2010, she arrived at our hospital by ambulance because of hemorrhagic shock resulting from GAVE recurrence. Despite performing 5 APC sessions and multiple blood transfusions, the tarry stools and anemia persisted during the hospitalization period. In December 2010 and January 2011, second-stage selective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the right gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries using microcoils was performed for the treatment of the refractory GAVE. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed after TAE revealed the disappearance of mucosal diffuse spotty redness. In addition, no complications such as gastric ulcer and necrosis were observed. Selective TAE, effectively resolved the GAVE and anemia, and no recurrence has been observed during the last 24 months. Therefore, TAE may be a safe and radical treatment for refractory GAVE.
