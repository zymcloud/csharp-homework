MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-protein-coding RNAs, which have emerged as integrated and important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. It has been demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exist in protein-coding genes. Accumulated studies have evaluated the association of miRNA SNPs with cancer risk, especially in Asian population, which included a series of related studies. However, the results remain controversial for the different genetic backgrounds, living habits and environment exposed. To evaluate the relationship between SNPs in miRNAs and cancer risk, 21 studies focused on Asian population were enrolled for the pooled analysis for three polymorphisms rs2910164, rs11614913, rs3746444 in three miRNAs miR-146aG>C, miR-196a2C>T, miR-499A>G using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For rs2910164 polymorphism, C allele was observed association with decreased overall cancer risk. In addition, subgroup analysis revealed of rs2910164 C allele decreased hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cervical cancer and prostate cancer risk among Chinese population. For rs11614913 polymorphism, TT genotype was observed to be associated with decreased cancer risk, especially for cancer type of colorectal cancer (CRC), lung cancer and country of Korea, North India. Whereas, rs3746444 G allele was an increased cancer risk factor in Chinese population, especially for breast cancer. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicated that rs2910164 C allele was associated with decreased cancer risk in Chinese population. However, the association varied from different cancer types. Furthermore, TT genotype of rs11614913 was associated with decreased cancer risk. While different cancer types and countries contributed to different effects. Whereas, rs3746444 G allele was a risk factor in Chinese population, and the association varied from different cancer types.
