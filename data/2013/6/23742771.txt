Background:Hepatic resection is the main treatment modality for hepatic tumors. Advances in diagnostic technique, preoperative preparation, surgical technique, and postoperative management increased the success rate. The present study aimed to evaluate hepatectomy and resection of inferior vena cava tumor thrombus (IVCTT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and the relationship between IVCTT classification and selection of surgical technique.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 13 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone hepatectomy with IVCTT resection between May 1997 and August 2009. Age, gender, diagnosis, findings of physical examination, results of preoperative laboratory investigations, radiological examination, criteria for resection, postoperative pathological results, incisions, operative technique, intraoperative transfusion, drains, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were evaluated for all patients.Results:Type I IVCTT (10 patients) was posterior to the liver and below the diaphragm; type II IVCTT (2 patients) was above the diaphragm but still outside the atrium; and type III IVCTT (1 patient) was above the diaphragm and in the right atrium. Type I was treated by radical hepatectomy and removal of IVCTT with total hepatic vascular exclusion. Type II was treated by radical hepatectomy and removal of IVCTT by incision of the diaphragm. Type III was treated by hepatectomy and resection of the thrombus from the right atrium under cardiopulmonary bypass. There were no surgical complications and one patient has been survived for 4 years with cancer-free status. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the 1- and 2-year survival rates were 53.8% and 15.4%, respectively.Conclusion:Surgical treatment is safe and feasible for treatment of IVCTT in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and surgical resectability can be judged according to the classification of tumor thrombus.
