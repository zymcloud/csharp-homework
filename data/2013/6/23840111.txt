Prolonged exposure to mycotoxins in the diet is related to cancer, among other diseases. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70%-90% of primary liver cancers and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Secondary metabolites, like aflatoxins and ochratoxin A (OTA), produced by some fungi species stocked in an inappropriate manner are considered an important way to increase HCC incidence. Future epidemiologic studies of HCC should focus on good practices in food preparation, food storage and the consumption of OTA-containing foods.
