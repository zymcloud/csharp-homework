Aim:To investigate the safety and efficacy of anus-preserving rectectomy via telescopic colorectal mucosal anastomosis (TCMA) for low rectal cancer.Methods:From August 1993 to October 2012, 420 patients including 253 males and 167 females with low rectal cancer underwent transabdominal and transanal anterior resection, followed by TCMA. The distance between the anus and inferior margin of the tumor ranged from 5 to 7 cm, and was 5 cm in 6 patients, 6 cm in 127, and 7 cm in 287 patients. Tumor-node-metastasis staging showed that 136 patients had stage I, 252 had stage II and 32 had stage III. Fifty-six patients with T3 or over received preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.Results:The postoperative follow-up rate was 91.9% (386/420) with a median time of 6.4 years. All 420 patients underwent radical resection. No postoperative death occurred. Postoperative complications included anastomotic leakage in 13 (3.1%) patients and anastomotic stenosis in 7 (1.6%). The local recurrence rate after surgery was 6.2%, the hepatic metastasis rate was 13.2% and the pulmonary metastasis rate was 2.3%. The 5-year survival rate was 74.0% and the disease-free survival rate was 71.0%. Kirwan classification showed that continence was good in 94.4% of patients with stage I when scored 12 mo after resection.Conclusion:TCMA for patients with low rectal cancer leads to better quality of life and satisfactory defecation function, and lowers anastomotic leakage occurrence, and might be one of the safe operative procedures in anus-preserving rectectomy.
