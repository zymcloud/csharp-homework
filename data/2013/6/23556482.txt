Objective:It is accepted that inflammation promotes malignant progression in the development of cancers. Whether, this is true for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains as an open question. We examined the relationship between the inflammatory histology activity index (HAI) in the background liver cirrhosis (LC) and the histological grading of the HCC in the hepatectomized HCC patients with HCV-associated LC.Material and methods:Out of 264 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatic resection, 197 had HCV-associated LC. Among them, 52 patients with a small solitary HCC nodule (Results:The average HAI in the 15 patients with moderately differentiated HCC (4.3 ± 0.8, mean ± SD) was significantly larger than that in 11 patients with well differentiated HCC (3.5 ± 0.6, p = 0.036). The HAI in the 24 patients whose HCC nodules contained poorly differentiated HCC (5.2 ± 1.1) was significantly larger than that in patients with moderately differentiated HCC (p = 0.025). Thus, the HAI order was well differentiated group Conclusions:Inflammation in the background non-cancerous cirrhotic portion would evoke malignant progression in HCC development from HCV-associated LC.
