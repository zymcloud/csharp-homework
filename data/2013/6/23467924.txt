Background:Using a right liver (RL) graft improves the outcomes in adult living donor liver transplantation (ALDLT). Here we report the recent excellent outcomes of 238 consecutive RL transplantations in ALDLT.Methods:Between January 2005 and June 2009, 238 consecutive adult recipients underwent RL transplantation; The middle hepatic vein (MHV) was reconstructed using artificial vascular grafts in 209 cases. Among these study subjects, UNOS status 1 and 2A were 12 (5.0 %) and 20 (8.4 %) patients, and the mean medical MELD score, was 19.9. Hepatitis B virus was the most common original liver disease in 184 patients (77.3 %). Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed in 133 patients (56.3 %), and 102 patients (76.1 %) met the radiologic Milan criteria. The mean graft-versus-recipient weight ratio was 1.14 %. The primary endpoint of this study was the patient and graft survival rate. The mean follow-up period was 32 (0-69) months.Results:The most common major complication was biliary complication (n = 62; 26 %). The 1-, 2-, and 5-year patient survival rates were 96, 95, and 94 %, and the graft survival rates were 99, 99, and 98 %. There were 4 hospital deaths (1.6 %). Eighteen late mortalities were observed after recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 17) and one case of lymphoma recurrence. One case of graft failure 33 months after ALDLT was attributed to cholestatic fibrosing hepatitis B saved by re-ALDLT. On multivariate analysis, no drainage of MHV branches and accompanying HCC beyond Milan criteria were the risk factors for poor patients' survival rate (p Conclusions:Further technical innovation would be required to overcome biliary complications. The technical innovation using right liver draining MHV branches improved both patient and graft survival outcomes of ALDLT. Despite these advances, selection criteria for HCC are still hurdles, even in RL transplantation.
