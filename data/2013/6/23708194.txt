Joint therapy is a promising area of study in cancer treatment. In this paper, we prepared Mn-Zn ferrite (Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4) magnetofluid using PEI as a surfactant, and investigated the anticancer effect of Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) combined with radiotherapy on hepatocellular carcinoma. Both in vitro and in vivo results suggest that this combined treatment with MFH and radiation has a better therapeutic effect than either of them alone. The apoptotic rate and necrotic rate of the combined treatment group was 38.80 and 25.20%, respectively. In contrast, it was only 7.49 and 3.62% in the radiation-alone group, 15.23 and 7.90% in the MFH-alone group, only 3.52 and 2.16% in the blank control group, and 23.56 and 27.56% in the adriamycin group. The cell proliferation inhibition rate of the combined treatment group (88.5%) was significantly higher than that of the radiation-alone group (37.5%), MFH-alone group (60.6%) and adriamycin group (70.6%). The tumor volume inhibition and mass inhibition rate of the combined treatment group was 87.62 and 88.62%, respectively, obviously higher than the 41.04 and 34.20% of the radiation-alone group, 79.87 and 77.92% of the MFH-alone group and 71.76 and 66.87% of the adriamycin group. It is therefore concluded that this combined application of MFH and radiation can give good synergistic and complementary effects, which offers a viable approach for treatment of cancer.
