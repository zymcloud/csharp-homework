Introduction:Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) are a worldwide problem. Morbidity and mortality due to CLDs could be avoided or reduced by targeting the main risk factors, including obesity and alcohol use.Methods:To describe the evolution of the key determinants of CLDs in Quebec, we studied the trends in obesity, alcohol use, viral hepatitis B and C, CLD mortality and hospitalization rates, and the liver cancer incidence rate between January 1, 1981, and December 31, 2009.Results:We observed an increase in the obesity indicators among young men and in alcohol use among adolescent girls and middle-aged women. The overall hepatitis B and C incidence and CLD mortality rates are falling. However, liver cancer and mortality rates, especially among men and the elderly, are on the rise.Conclusion:These results highlight the importance of targeted public health interventions and of maintaining or improving access to care for CLDs.
