Background:After effective treatment with antiviral agent, patients with low serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level had a low incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV reactivation after HCC surgery is associated with HCC recurrence. To date, there are no universal guidelines for the perioperative antiviral treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B, let alone antiviral therapy in patients with HBV-related HCC. The present analysis is trying to develop a perioperative anti-HBV treatment protocol.Data sources:A literature search of PubMed was performed, the key words were "perioperative" "antiviral therapy", "hepatocellular carcinoma" and "chronic hepatitis B". All of the information was collected.Results:Relevant documents showed that reactivation of HBV replication played a direct role in the late recurrence of HCC after surgical resection. The well control of viral load before and after operation significantly increased tumor-free survival. Many drugs are used in antiviral therapy including interferon alpha and nucleoside analogues. Foscarnet, two-agent or even multiagent of nucleoside analogues is necessary for perioperative antiviral treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B related HCC.Conclusions:HBV reactivation after HCC surgery induces hepatitis flare and hepatocarcinogenesis, thus lifelong and vigorous control of HBV is very important in patients with chronic hepatitis B and HBV-related HCC. A uniform guideline is necessary to rapidly reduce HBV DNA to a lower level in perioperation.
