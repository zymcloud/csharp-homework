Alpha fetoprotein is a fetal specific glycoprotein which falls rapidly after birth. High level of alpha fetoprotein is suspicious of hepatocellular carcinoma but may be elevated in chronic viral hepatitis. A 35-year-old presented to us with jaundice for 7 days. He had chronic hepatitis B infection for last 12 months and was taking medicines irregularly for same. He had high alpha fetoprotein levels (740.9 ng/ml) without evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma which reduced with antiviral therapy. Such elevation can be explained due to hepatic inflammation and viral replication.
