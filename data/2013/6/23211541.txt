PCBs are carcinogens, but for many decades it was assumed that PCBs may not possess initiating activity. Initiation is a process that involves changes in the DNA sequence, often, but not exclusively produced through DNA adduction by a reactive compound or reactive oxygen species (ROS). DNA adducts can be detected by (32)P-postlabeling, a method that Dr. Ramesh Gupta co-developed and refined. Today these types of assays together with other mechanistic studies provide convincing evidence that specific PCB congeners can be biotransformed to genotoxic and therefore potentially initiating metabolites. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of PCBs' genotoxic potential and mechanism of action, emphasizing the contributions of Dr. Ramesh Gupta during his tenures at the Universities of Kentucky and Louisville.
