Gremlin 1 and noggin are inhibitors of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. They are vital during early development but their role in adult tissues has remained largely unresolved. The BMP signaling pathway has also been implicated in tumorigenesis, however with emphasis on the role of the ligands and receptors. We performed a concurrent survey of gremlin 1 and noggin protein expression in multiple normal and cancer samples, using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing 96 samples from 34 different normal organs/tissue sites and 208 samples of 34 different tumor types. In majority of both normal and tumor samples, gremlin 1 and noggin expression was negative or weak. However, normal stomach and skin demonstrated distinct gremlin 1 and noggin expression indicating a role in adult tissues. Likewise, strong expression of both antagonists was detected in Leydig cells of testis. In the tumor panel, the expression patterns were more variable but elevated BMP antagonist expression was detected for the first time in few cases, such as glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and diffuse B-cell lymphoma for gremlin 1 and renal granular cell tumor and thyroid papillary carcinoma for noggin. Even though gremlin 1 and noggin were not widely expressed in adult tissues, in a subset of organs their expression pattern indicated a potential role in normal tissue homeostasis as well as in malignancies.
