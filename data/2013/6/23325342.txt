Background:In Mainland China, many selection criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) liver transplantation, such as the Hangzhou, the Chengdu, and the Fudan criteria, have been established. No comparisons have been made among the outcomes using the Hangzhou, Chengdu, and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria in patients who underwent successful downstaging therapies.Methods:After successful downstaging therapies, 72 patients met the UCSF criteria, 86 met the Chengdu criteria, and 102 met the Hangzhou criteria. The data on these HCC patients were retrospectively analyzed, and various outcomes, such as survival and the tumor-free survival rate, were compared among the three groups.Results:No significant differences were observed among the three groups with regard to the downstaging protocols, baseline characteristics, or liver function. However, the patients who met the Hangzhou criteria had significantly larger tumor targets than those who met the Chengdu or UCSF criteria (P Conclusion:Because they have contributed to similar outcomes but to larger HCC patient pools, the Hangzhou criteria for HCC transplantation should be comprehensively accepted in China for HCC patients after successful downstaging therapies.
