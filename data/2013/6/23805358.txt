The use of direct-acting antiviral agents (e.g., telaprevir, boceprevir) has improved response rates in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infections. Substantial number of drug-drug interactions are anticipated with the use of telaprevir, a cytochrome P450 3A and P-glycoprotein substrate and inhibitor. Herein we describe a patient with HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma treated simultaneously with a telaprevir-containing regimen and localized chemotherapy (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization) with doxorubicin. No clinically relevant interactions or adverse events developed while on antiviral therapy.
