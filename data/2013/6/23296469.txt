HRQoL is impaired in cirrhosis. Establishing the relevance of depression, anxiety, alexithymia and cirrhosis stage on the patients' HRQoL. Sixty cirrhotics underwent a neuropsychological assessment, including ZUNG-SDS, STAI Y1-Y2 and TAS-20. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) was detected by PHES, HRQoL by Short-Form-36 (SF-36). Depression was detected in 34 patients (57 %, 95%CI = 44-70 %), state-anxiety in 16 (27 %, 95%CI = 15-38 %), trait-anxiety in 17 (28 %, 95%CI = 17-40 %), alexithymia in 14 (31 % 95%CI = 16-46 %) and MHE in 22 (37 %, 95%CI = 24-49 %). Neuropsychological symptoms were unrelated to cirrhosis stage, hepatocellular carcinoma or MHE. A significant correlation was observed among psychological test scores and summary components of SF-36. At multiple linear regression analysis including Child-Pugh and MELD scores, previous-HE and the psychological test scores as possible covariates, alexithymia and depression as well as to the Child-Pugh score were significantly related to the SF-36 mental component; while trait-anxiety was the only variable significantly and independently related to the SF-36 physical component. Depression, state and trait-anxiety and alexithymia symptoms are frequent in cirrhotics and are among the major determinants of the altered HRQoL.
