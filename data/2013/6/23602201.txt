Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the main cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. The risk for the development of HCC increases with the severity of liver inflammation and fibrosis. The hepatic inflammation caused by HCV involves host regulatory immune response, which is mediated by cytokines with anti-viral role upon the interaction of viral polypeptides with innate and adaptive immunity. Two cytokines; tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) play key roles in the regulation of cellular immune response in HCV infection. The aim of the present study was to determine the levels of IL-10 and TNF-α, as well as the ratio of TNF-α and IL-10 serum levels in patients with HCV and HCC caused by HCV (HCC-HCV). The study included 173 patients with chronic HCV. TNF-α and IL-10 serum levels were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc.). In the present study, 54 patients presented liver mild fibrosis, 68 had severe fibrosis and 51 patients had HCC. After adjustment in the multivariate regression analysis, the following variables remained significantly associated with HCC-HCV occurrence: diabetes (p=0.012 OR 10.44 CI 1.66-65.60), IL-10 lower levels (p
