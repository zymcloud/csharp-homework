Background:Although poor liver function is associated with a high morbidity rate and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, the exact effects of liver pathology on the surgical outcomes of HCC patients are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to assess how the liver pathology of HCC patients affects their prognosis and complications rate after liver resection.Methods:Between January 2006 and November 2010, 149 consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients, including 79 noncirrhosis patients and 70 cirrhosis patients, were enrolled in this study.Results:Among the noncirrhotic patients, operative time, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion requirement, tumor size, and serum retinol binding protein (RBP) levels were significantly higher in the complications group than in the complications-free groups. On the other hand, in the cirrhotic patients the prothrombin time (PT) and indocyanine green retention value at 15 min (ICGR15) of the complications group were significantly lower and higher, respectively, than those of the complications-free group. In the noncirrhotic patients, recurrence-free survival and overall survival did not differ between the complications and complications-free groups. On the other hand, in the cirrhotic patients, the recurrence-free survival and overall survival of the complications-free group were significantly longer than those of the complications group.Conclusions:In the noncirrhotic patients, surgical complications had no prognostic effect, whereas they had a significant survival impact in the cirrhotic patients. The surgical strategy for HCC should be based on the patient's pathological background.
