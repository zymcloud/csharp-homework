Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and its frequency is expected to increase. The possibility of identifying early stage curative cancer has supported the recommendation of surveillance by hepatic ultrasonography every 6 months in individuals with an annual incidence of cancer that exceeds 1.5%. Computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is diagnostic if contrast uptake within the nodule is demonstrated in the arterial stage and washout is evident. Liver tissue examination is warranted in indeterminate nodules larger than 1 cm, and stromal invasion is the pathological hallmark. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system indicates the most appropriate evidence-based therapy. Liver resection is preferred for nodules
