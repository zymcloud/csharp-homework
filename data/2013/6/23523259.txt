Aim:This study explores the hypoglycemic effects of borapetoside A, the most active principle among three major diterpenoids (borapetosides A, B, and C) isolated from ethanol extract of Tinospora crispa vines.Methods:We employed mouse mitogenic C2C12 and hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells in this study. Furthermore, the mice were divided into three groups, including streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus, diet-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus, and normal control. The mice in each group were treated with assigned vehicle control, borapetoside A, or other active agents.Results:Borapetoside A was shown to increase the glycogen content and decrease the plasma glucose concentration in a concentration or dose-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo. The hypoglycemic effects in the normal mice and the mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus were associated with the increases of the plasma insulin levels; whereas, the insulin levels remained unchanged in the mice with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Borapetoside A not only attenuated the elevation of plasma glucose induced by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, but also increased the glycogen synthesis of IL-6 treated C2C12 cells. Moreover, the elevated protein expression levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were reversed after borapetoside A treatment twice a day for 7 days.Conclusions:The hypoglycemic effects of borapetoside A were mediated through both the insulin-dependent and the insulin-independent pathways. Furthermore, borapetoside A was shown to increase the glucose utilization in peripheral tissues, to reduce the hepatic gluconeogenesis, and to activate the insulin signaling pathway; they thereby contributed to the lowering of the plasma glucose. Comparison of the structures of three borapetosides suggests clearly that the C-8 stereochemistry plays a key role in hypoglycemic effect since the active borapetoside A and C possess 8R-chirality but the inactive borapetoside B possess 8S-chirality. The location of glycoside at C-3 for borapetoside A but C-6 for borapetoside C and the formation of lactone between C-4 and C-6 for borapetoside A, could account for the different potency in hypoglycemic action for these two compounds.
