Background and aims:Macroscopic portal vein invasion complicating hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of cirrhosis is associated with a very low survival. To prevent the malignant progression from a portal branch to the main portal trunk, we have placed noncovered metallic stents extending from the portal trunk to the contralateral tumor free portal pedicle.Methods:Fifty-Four patients (age: 60 ± 11 years) were treated. Thirty-four (60%) patients were Child A and 20 (40%) were Child B-C. Tumoral thrombosis involved 1st or 2nd order branches in 41 (82%) patients and partially the main trunk in 13 (24%). Open surgical insertion (via ileal vein) as an alternative to a percutaneous approach was used in 14 (24%) patients.Results:Early mortality ( 30 µmol/L and open surgical insertion were predictive of short-term mortality. In the good group, overall survival at 6, 12, and 24 months were 69%, 61%, and 46%, respectively.Conclusions:The transhepatic deployment of metallic stent seems to improve survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by portal vein tumoral thrombosis and could allow subsequent treatments.
