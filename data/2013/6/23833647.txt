There are no sensitive and specific biomarkers that aid in the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of beclin 1 (BECN1) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)p65 in patients with HCC, to evaluate their value as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were used to detect the expression of hepatic BECN1 and NF-kBp65 in patients with HCC, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or cirrhosis, as compared with the expression levels in healthy subjects. The expression level of the BECN1 protein in the HCC tissue was significantly high compared with that in the cirrhotic, hepatitis and normal tissues. The expression of the BECN1 protein in the hepatitis tissue was significantly high compared with that of the cirrhotic and normal tissues. The expression of the BECN1 mRNA in the cancer tissue was significantly high compared with that of the cirrhotic and normal tissues, and the expression of the BECN1 mRNA in the hepatitis tissue was significantly higher than that of the cirrhotic and normal tissues. The expression of the NF-κBp65 protein in the cancer tissue was significantly high compared with that of the cirrhotic, hepatitis and normal tissues. The expression of the NF-κBp65 mRNA in-the cancer tissue was significantly high compared with that of the cirrhotic, hepatitis and normal tissues. BECN1 expression was positively correlated with NF-κBp65 expression in HCC. The abnormal expression of BECN1 and NF-κBp65 was closely associated with the development of HCC. Finally, a search in GeneGo pathway database observed a link between BECN1 and NF-κBp65 through multiple proteins. These results indicate that BECN1 and NF-κBp65 are upregulated in HCC, and that they may serve as useful biomarkers for HCC.
