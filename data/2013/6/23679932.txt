Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common lethal malignancies. The prognosis is poor despite progress in early diagnosis. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) represents an important local therapy. More recently the embolic agent itself is used as a drug loaded carrier. An overview of the present situation in the field of TACE has been made, taking into account the materials constituting the embolizing agents and the way of controlled drug release.Areas covered:Clinical overview of TACE with attention to the present limits and problems of this technique; focus on the present situation of the materials (polymers) used for the preparation of the microparticulate systems to administer with attention to the new possible materials.Expert opinion:The use of TACE techniques is important in the treatment of HCCs. However, these techniques need to be improved, in particular taking into account the use of new materials for the preparation of embolizing agents able to control drug release.
