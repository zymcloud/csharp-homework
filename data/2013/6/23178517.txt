Background/aims:We retrospectively compared the therapeutic effect of microwave coagulation needle (Lap-MCT) and radiofrequency ablation needle (Lap-RFA).Methodology:Between January 2001 and May 2012, 71 patients underwent laparoscopic ablation therapy for HCC with no extra hepatic metastasis. These patients were divided into 3 groups, according to the surgical strategies: Lap-MCT (n=40), Lap-MCT+RFA (n=13) and Lap-RFA (n=18). The patient background, tumor characteristics, cumulative survival rate, recurrence-free survival rate, time of operation and duration of hospitalization were compared between the groups.Results:The maximal tumor size, the number of tumors and the hepatic reserve from each group had no significant difference. Likewise, the time of operation and the duration of hospitalization had no significant difference. However, the number of needle punctures in the Lap-MCT group was significantly larger than that in the Lap-RFA group (pConclusions:In the laparoscopic setting, MCT and RFA are equally effective in terms of short- and long-term results.
