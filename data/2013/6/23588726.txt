IgM antibodies bound to different cancer antigens have shown recently a higher diagnostic value, compared with the corresponding free molecule, giving rise to a new family of biomarkers. High or increasing levels of Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen (SCCA)-IgM immune complexes were associated with more advanced liver disease and increased risk of development of HCC. Rheumatoid factor (RF) represents a long-standing problem of interference for immunometric assays. The aim of the present study was to examine the specificity of SCCA-IgM in relation to the presence of RF reactivity in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Sera of 73 patients with cirrhosis, infected with HCV, (mean age ± SD: 66 ± 13 years; M/F: 45/28), including 21 patients with HCC, were studied. SCCA-IgM immune complexes levels were measured by a commercial ELISA. To evaluate the possible interfering effect of RF, the standard calibrator, positive for SCCA-IgM, was spiked with serial dilutions of a RF positive or negative serum. SCCA-IgM immune complexes were positive in 35 out of 73 (48%) patients, while RF activity was found in 10 out of 73 (14%) patients. Patients with cirrhosis with RF activity had significantly higher levels of SCCA-IgM, compared to RF negative cases; however, no significant correlation between SCCA-IgM and RF values was observed. In samples created artificially the same results in terms of reactivity for SCCA-IgM were obtained, regardless of the presence of RF activity. These findings support the lack of correlation between the two parameters found in sera of patients infected with HCV.
