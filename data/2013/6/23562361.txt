Background and aim:Fast-track surgery (FTS), combining several techniques with evidence-based adjustments, has shown its effectiveness to accelerate recovery, reduce morbidity and shorten hospital stay in many operations. This randomized controlled study was carried out aiming to compare the short-term outcomes of partial hepatectomy for liver cancer managed with FTS or with conventional surgery (CS).Methods:To compare the short-term effects between FTS and CS, a randomized controlled trial was carried out for liver cancer patients undergoing partial hepatectomy from September 2010 to June 2012.Results:Patients with liver cancers before receiving partial hepatectomy were randomized into the FTS group (n = 80) and the CS group (n = 80). Compared with the CS group, the FTS group had significantly less complications (P Conclusions:FTS was safe and efficacious. It lessened postoperative stress reactions and accelerated recovery for patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for liver cancer.
