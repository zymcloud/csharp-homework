Background:Management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often involves many subspecialist providers, as well as a broad range of treatment options. This study sought to evaluate referral and treatment patterns among patients with HCC at a large academic medical center.Methods:Data from our cancer registry between 2003-2011 were abstracted on 394 patients who were primarily diagnosed/treated for HCC at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH); data on patients who were diagnosed/treated with HCC elsewhere and who received secondary treatment at JHH (n = 391) were also abstracted for comparison purposes.Results:Among the main cohort, the most common specialties to be consulted were surgery (n = 225, 57.1%), gastroenterology (n = 225, 57.1%), and interventional radiologist (n = 206, 52.3%), while only 96 (24.4%) were referred to medical oncology. Factors associated with surgical consultation included younger age (odds ratio (OR) 3.35, 95% CI 1.62-6.92), tumor size
