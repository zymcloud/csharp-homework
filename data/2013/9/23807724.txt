Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumours and it carries a poor prognosis due to a high rate of recurrence or metastasis after surgery. Bmi-1 plays a significant role in the growth and metastasis of many solid tumours. However, the exact mechanisms underlying Bmi-1-mediated cell invasion and metastasis, especially in HCC, are not yet known. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the expression of Bmi-1 in HCC samples and its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic value, we also investigated related mechanisms underlying Bmi-1-mediated cell invasion in HCC. Our results showed that Bmi-1 is upregulated in HCC tissues compared to matched non-cancer liver tissues; and its expression is positively associated with tumour size, metastasis, venous invasion and AJCC TNM stage, respectively; multivariate analysis showed that high expression of Bmi-1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. In addition, the shRNA-mediated inhibition of Bmi-1 reduced the invasiveness of two HCC cell lines in vitro by upregulating phosphatase and the tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) expression, inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway and downregulating the expression and activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These data demonstrate that Bmi-1 plays a vital role in HCC invasion and that Bmi-1 is a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
