Background:The most practical measure to augment the available number of liver grafts and thus reduce waiting list mortality is to increase the donor age limit. We hypothesized that with careful selection of old liver donors without age limit it should be possible to obtain good patient and graft survival.Methods:The present study comprises 351 adults who underwent liver transplantation. They were divided into three groups according to the age of the liver donors: group 1: 226 recipients of donors 70 years. A comparative study among the groups was performed.Results:Patient survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were, respectively, 81.0, 76.1, and 71.1 % in group 1; 83.8, 74, and 72.2 % in group 2; and 76, 70.0, and 62.9 % in group 3 (P = NS). Graft survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was, respectively, 74.8, 69.0, and 64.1 % in group 1; 82.7, 71.4, and 69.6 % in group 2; and 71.4, 64.8, and 58.3 % in group 3 (P = NS). We analyzed the use of older grafts in recipients with HCV cirrhosis and did not find significant differences in patient and graft survival at 1, 3, and 5 years. In multivariate analysis increased donor body mass index and decreased recipient albumin were associated with lower patient and graft survival.Conclusions:Because patient and graft survival rates are not affected by donor age, well-selected older donor livers can be safely used if they show good function and preharvesting conditions.
