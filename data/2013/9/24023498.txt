Aim:To propose an appropriate staging system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) classification.Methods:Here, 288 in-patients with HCC were studied and divided into three groups: those with expansive growth, invasive growth (including satellite nodules, nodule fusions and direct tumor invasion of adjacent organs), or disseminative growth (including vascular involvement, regional lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis). A survival analysis was performed using a Kaplan-Meier analysis, and prognostic factors for overall survival were determined by the Cox proportional hazards regression model.Results:The overall survival (OS) of patients with invasive tumor growth was shorter than that of patients with expansive tumor growth (27.796 ± 3.730 and 57.398 ± 4.873 mo, respectively, P Conclusion:These data led to the proposal of a new staging system: the Expansive-Invasive-Disseminative growth staging classification.
