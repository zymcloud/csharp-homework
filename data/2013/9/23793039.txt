Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the key fibrogenic cells of the liver. HSC activation is a process of cellular transdifferentiation that occurs upon liver injury, but the mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis are unknown. Nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an oxidative stress-mediated transcription factor with a variety of downstream targets aimed at cytoprotection. However, Nrf2 has recently been implicated as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of liver fibrosis. This review focuses on the transcriptional repressors that either control liver injury or regulate specific fibrogenic functions of liver fibrosis. We also show that Nrf2 may reveal significant gene expression changes, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may ameliorate liver fibrosis.
