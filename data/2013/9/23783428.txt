MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by inhibiting translation of complementary mRNAs and/or targeting them for degradation. MicroRNAs play crucial roles in development, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition, recent studies indicate that they are important regulators of virus-host interactions. MicroRNA-125a is a homolog of C. elegans lin-4, the first discovered microRNA, shown to dictate the onset of larval stages in the nematode. In this review, we focus on the gene structure of microRNA-125a, its evolution, its expression pattern in mammalian organs and tissues, and its functional targets. Overall, the available data indicate that microRNA-125a plays crucial roles both in development and in the adult tissues. In fact, it (1) contributes to the control of phase transitions in development and/or cell differentiation; (2) regulates the expression of several target proteins that are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration; (3) interferes with the expression of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen in liver cells, thus counteracting viral replication. These findings suggest that delivery of microRNA-125a mimics or treatments that modulate its cellular expression may be valuable tools for the development of new therapeutic strategies for human diseases, including cancer and viral hepatitis B.
