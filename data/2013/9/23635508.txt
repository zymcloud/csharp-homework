Background/aims:The aims of this study were to compare long-term prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI).Methodology:Two hundred and thirteen patients with HCC were initially treated with PEI or RFA at Saga University Hospital between 1990 and 2004. The present study included 190 patients: 98 treated with PEI from 1990 to 1999, and 92 with RFA from 2000 to 2004. The association of treatment method with survival prognosis was evaluated by multivariate analysis.Results:There were no significant differences in gender, etiology, and tumor stage between the two groups. Five-year survival rate in the PEI group was 40% and 51% in the RFA group. According to tumor stage, there were no differences in 5-year survival rate between the two groups for tumor stage I and III. For stage II patients, RFA had better survival than PEI (48% vs. 28%, p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis indicated that RFA was more effective for long-term survival than PEI in patients with tumor stage II (p = 0.04).Conclusions:Compared to PEI, RFA improved survival in patients with stage II HCC, indicating a therapeutic advantage of RFA.
