Aims:Hepatic resection can cure hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the optimal extent of resection remains controversial. Major hepatectomy could minimize a tumor recurrence, but it is harmful due to decreased hepatic functional reserve. [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans are known as their reflection tumor differentiation and biological activity in HCC. To evaluate a benefit of major hepatectomy for HCC, we performed this retrospective analysis in patients with well-preserved hepatic function, and further analyzed in the subset identified by preoperative FDG-PET.Methods:We reviewed the medical records of 189 patients with HCC who underwent curative resection between August 2004 and December 2010 at two institutes. All patients underwent anatomical resection, either by major or minor hepatectomy.Results:Median overall survival did not differ significantly between the major and minor hepatectomy groups (29.4 versus 26.3 months, p = 0.269). However, the major hepatectomy group had a better recurrence-free survival (24.5 versus 19.9 months, p = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, the presence of intrahepatic metastasis independently predicted overall survival (p = 0.009), but other examined variables did not. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were significantly better following major hepatectomy rather than minor hepatectomy in patients whose preoperative FDG-PET indicated that the maximum standardized uptake value of the tumor (SUVtumor) was ≥4 and the tumor-to-nontumor SUV ratio (TNR) was ≥1.5.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that preoperative FDG-PET may be useful in identifying patients with favorable hepatic reserve who are most likely to benefit from major rather than minor hepatectomy.
