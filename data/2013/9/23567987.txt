Background/aims:A modified UICC staging system is used in Korea. We evaluated prognostic factors and assessed the survival outcomes for modified UICC T3 stage HCC after surgical resection.Methodology:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 204 patients with HCC who underwent curative hepatectomy between January 2006 and June 2010.Results:The mean tumor size and resection margin were 7.1 ± 3.8 cm and 11.9 ± 11.6 mm, respectively. Portal vein invasion was seen in 68 patients (33.3%), and bile duct invasion was found in 17 patients (8.3%). Two patients (1.0%) died after surgical resection due to the development of decompensated liver failure. The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates were 46.4%, 35.0%, and 26.3%, and 81.7%, 64.7%, and 44.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that PIVKA-II ≥200 mAU/mL, younger age, and serum albumin levels were closely associated with tumor recurrence with modified UICC T3 stage HCC and that female gender, PIVKA ≥200 mAU/mL, cirrhosis, and serum albumin levels were independent factors for patient survival.Conclusions:PIVKA-II is useful for determining patient survival and the risk of recurrence in modified UICC T3 stage HCC patients.
