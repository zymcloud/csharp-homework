As the utility of liver-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) increases, it is pertinent to optimize and expand protocols to improve accuracy and foster evolution of techniques; in turn, positive impacts should be seen in patient management. This article reports on the latest expert thinking and current evidence in the field of liver-specific MRI, as discussed at the 6(th) International Forum for Liver MRI, which was held in Vancouver, Canada in September 2012. Topics discussed at this forum described the use of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI for the assessment of liver function at the segmental level; to increase accuracy in the diagnosis of liver metastases; to overcome current challenges in patients with cirrhosis, including management of arterial hypo-/isovascular, hepatobiliary phase hypointense nodules; and the data which would be required in order to recommend the use of this modality in hepatocellular carcinoma management guidelines. Growing evidence suggests that gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can help to improve the management of patients with a number of different liver disorders; however, more data are needed in some areas, and there may be a case for developing an interpretation guideline for gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI findings to aid standardization.
