Objectives:To examine the clinicopathologic features of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HC-CC), which the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed classifying into 2 types, and the expression of delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1), as well as putative stem cell markers, such as NCAM/CD56 and CD133.Methods:In this study we examined the expression of stem cell markers using immunohistochemistry.Results:Thirty-six cases of combined HC-CC were subclassified into 24 cases, with more than 5% stem cell features (group B) and 12 cases with less than 5% stem cell areas (group A). The postoperative overall survival rate was worse for group B than for group A. DLK1 was frequently expressed in group B cases compared with group A, hepatocellular carcinoma, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cases.Conclusions:The 2010 WHO classification seems important for elucidating the pathogenesis of stem cell-related liver cancers.
