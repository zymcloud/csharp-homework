Anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleos(t)ides analogs (NA) exert selective pressures on polymerase (pol) and surface (S) genes, inducing treatment resistance and increasing the risk of vaccine escape mutants. The rate of emergence for these mutations is largely unknown in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV undergoing dual-active therapy. In a 3-year, repeat-sampling, prospective cohort study, HBV viral genome sequences of 171 HIV-HBV coinfected patients, presenting with HBV viremia for at least one visit, were analyzed every 12 months via DNA chip. Logistic and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine risk factors specifically for S gene mutations at baseline and during follow-up, respectively. HBV-DNA levels >190 IU/mL substantially decreased from 91.8% at inclusion to 40.3% at month 36 (P Conclusion:Vaccine escape mutants selected by NA exposure were frequent and steadily increasing during follow-up. Although the high antiviral potency of TDF can mitigate incident mutations, other antiviral options are limited in this respect. The public health implications of their transmission need to be addressed.
