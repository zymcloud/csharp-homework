Purpose:To compare the fixed-time- and the test-injection method with respect to the image quality of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the adequacy of timing of the hepatic arterial phase (HAP) in Gd-EOB-DTPA (EOB) enhanced MRI.Materials and methods:We studied 63 patients with computed tomography (CT) -proven hypervascular HCC: 30 (group 1) were scanned HAP using the fixed-time delay method (protocol 1); in the other 33 (group 2), we applied the test-injection method (protocol 2). We compared the protocols with respect with tumor-to-liver contrast (TLC), contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR), and relative enhancement of the liver and tumor (REL , RET ) during HAP. Two radiologists compared the adequacy of HAP, image contrast, image noise, and overall image quality.Results:Under protocol 2, TLC, CNR, and REL and RET of hypervascular HCC were significantly higher (P Conclusion:At EOB-enhanced hepatic dynamic MRI, the test-injection method yielded better image quality of hypervascular HCC and improved adequacy of timing of HAP.
