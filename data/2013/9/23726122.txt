Purpose:To compare the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) while conforming to the Milan criteria.Materials and methods:The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was waived due to the retrospective study design. One hundred ninety-eight patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Eighty-five patients with 98 lesions received RFA, and 113 patients with 131 lesions underwent MWA. Complete ablation rates, local recurrence rates, disease-free survival rates, cumulative survival rates, and major complications were compared between the two treatment groups.Results:Complete ablation rates were 99.0% for RFA and 98.5% for MWA (P=1.000). Local recurrence rates were 5.2% for RFA and 10.9% for MWA (P=0.127). Disease-free survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 80.3%, 61.8%, 39.5%, and 19.0% in the RFA group and 75.0%, 59.4%, 32.1%, and 16.1% in the MWA group, respectively (P=0.376). Cumulative survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 98.7%, 92.3%, 82.7%, and 77.8% in the RFA group and 98.0%, 90.7%, 77.6%, and 77.6% in the MWA group, respectively (P=0.729). Major complication rates were 2.4% and 2.7% in the RFA group and the MWA group, respectively (P=1.000). There were no patient deaths due to treatment.Conclusion:RFA and MWA have the same clinical value in treating HCC conforming to the Milan criteria. RFA and MWA are both safe and effective techniques for HCC as clinical application.
