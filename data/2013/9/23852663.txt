Reinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) after liver transplantation (LT) may favor the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and combination therapy with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues may reduce HBV recurrence after LT. To test associations between HBV, HCC, and survival, we performed a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing LT for HBV between January 1985 and December 2010 at 7 US transplant centers. After we divided the patients into 3 eras based on evolving strategies in antiviral therapy (1985-1994, 1995-2004, and 2005-2010), we reviewed 16 variables to determine whether there were associations between survival and HCC recurrence. Seven hundred thirty-eight patients underwent transplantation for HBV, and 354 (48.0%) had concomitant HCC, which recurred in 58 patients (16.4%). Three-year survival was much better in era 3 versus era 1 (87% versus 40%, P = 0.001), and the incidence of HCC recurrence was lower (12% versus 29%, P = 0.009). The lungs were the most frequent first site of HCC recurrence, and they were followed by the liver. A multivariate analysis showed that HBV reinfection, HCC recurrence, and HBIG use were associated with worse survival (P
