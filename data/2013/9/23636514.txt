Background:There is a growing body of evidence suggesting the equivalence and in some cases superiority of laparoscopic liver resection versus open resection. Fewer data exist regarding the financial impact of laparoscopic liver resection.Methods:Retrospective review of 98 consecutive patients at a single institution from 2007 through 2011 undergoing first time hepatic resection was performed. Laparoscopic and open cases were compared primarily on OR and hospital charges. Deviation-based cost modeling and weighted average mean cost for the two procedures were used to determine both financial and clinical efficacy on the basis of differences in length of stay, complications, and charges.Results:There were 57 laparoscopic and 41 open cases included in the study. Right hepatectomy was the most common procedure performed in both the laparoscopic (n=23, 40.4%) and open (n=22, 53.7%) groups. Patients in the laparoscopic group were significantly more likely to have an "on course" postoperative hospitalization (73.7 vs. 26.8%; pConclusions:The cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic hepatectomy appears to vary with the complexity of the procedure. Overall, laparoscopy offers a cost advantage; however, with more complex procedures such as right hepatectomy, higher up-front operating room charges offset the financial benefits of less complicated hospitalization.
