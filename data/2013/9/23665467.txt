Background/aims:To compare the detection rate of 64-slice CT, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and C-arm computed tomography (C-arm CT) in small lesions with a diameter ≤3.0 cm of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:Sixty-six patients with HCC underwent 64-slice CT, DSA, and C-arm CT, and were followed up by lipiodol CT two weeks after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Whose result was used as diagnostic reference. The number of detected lesions with diameter ≤3.0 cm in each imaging modality was counted independently by 4 radiologists.Results:A total of 174 lesions out of the 66 patients were confirmed by lipiodol CT, among which 47.7% were detected by 64-slice CT, 82.2% by DSA, and 97.1% by C-arm CT. McNemar test showed the statistical difference in detection rate between each two methods of CT, DSA and C-arm CT (all pConclusions:Compared to 64-slice CT and DSA, C-arm CT has the best sensitivity by detecting small lesions of HCC, and thus may play a guiding role in TACE procedure.
