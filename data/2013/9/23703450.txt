Background:Major modification of the 7th tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was divided into 6th stage IIIA to 7th IIIA (multiple tumors, any>5 cm) and IIIB (tumors involving a major vessel). This study aimed to validate 6th and 7th TNM systems in prognostic prediction, then analyze the impact of time, Child-Pugh classification and treatment modalities in survival.Methods:A total of 5,611 and 3,217 HCC patients were enrolled between 1986-2002 (past period) and 2003-2010 (recent period), respectively. The Akaike information criteria (AIC) within a Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to demonstrate the discriminatory ability for staging systems.Results:The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of past and recent periods were 44.8, 24.9, 17.1%, and 65.5, 44.5, 34.6%, respectively (pConclusion:The 7th TNM provided better prognostic prediction than the 6th TNM after dividing into IIIA and IIIB. Survival rates of HCC have been improving in recent decades.
