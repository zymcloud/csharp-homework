Background. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, selection criteria for transarterial hepatic selective internal radiotherapy are imprecise. Additionally, radiographic parameters to predict outcome of transarterial hepatic selective internal radiotherapy have not been fully characterized. Patients and methods. Computed tomography (CT) scans of 23 patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma before and after transarterial hepatic selective internal radiotherapy with yttrium-90 microspheres were retrospectively reviewed. Selected radiographic parameters were evaluated and correlated with progression-free survival and overall survival. Response to treatment was assessed with Response RECIST 1.1 and Morphology, Attenuation, Size, and Structure (MASS) criteria. Results. On the post-SIRT CT, 68% of tumors demonstrated decreased size (median decrease of 0.8 cm, P = 0.3); 64% had decreased attenuation (median decrease 5.7 HU, P = 0.06), and 48% demonstrated increased tumor necrosis (P
