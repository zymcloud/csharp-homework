Background/aims:Helicobacter pylori infection induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression, and these factors may engage in cross-talk. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of H. pylori on EGFR signaling pathways and to determine whether celecoxib has an inhibitory effect on this pathway.Methods:The AGS cell line was cocultured with H. pylori G27 and the isogenic cagE- mutant. The expression of COX-2, EGFR, heparin binding-epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was measured by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Next, Western blot analyses of COX-2, EGFR, total Akt, phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (pGSK3β) were performed after incubating H. pylori-treated AGS cells for 24 hours with various concentrations of celecoxib (0, 10, 20, and 30 µmol/L).Results:H. pylori infection upregulated the mRNA levels of COX-2, EGFR, HB-EGF, and TGF-β, as detected by RT-PCR. However, AGS cells treated with cagE- mutants, which have a defective type IV secretion system, did not exhibit EGFR upregulation. Celecoxib had inhibitory effects on the H. pylori-induced overexpression of COX-2 (p=0.015), EGFR (p=0.025), pAkt (p=0.025), and pGSK3β (p=0.029) by Western blot analysis.Conclusions:H. pylori with an intact type IV secretion system activated the COX-2 and EGFR-Akt pathways in the AGS cell line. As celecoxib exhibited inhibitory effects on the EGFR signaling pathway, the cross-talk of COX-2 and EGFR likely mediates H. pylori-induced gastric cancer.
