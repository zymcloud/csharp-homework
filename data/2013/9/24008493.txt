Background:Although piggyback technique has gained widespread acceptance for liver transplantation in general, there is an exceptional lack of data on the choice of appropriate surgical technique for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of surgical technique on outcomes after liver transplantation for HCC.Material and methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 90 HCC patients who underwent liver transplantation with the conventional (n=19) or piggyback (n=71) technique. Both techniques were compared with respect to intraoperative variables and long-term outcomes, determined by 3-year overall (OS) and recurrence-free (RFS) survival. The potential role of confounding factors was excluded in a series of Cox proportional regression models.Results:The piggyback technique was associated with shorter procedure duration (p=0.0005), shorter anatomical anhepatic phase (pConclusions:Given its superior long-term outcome, piggyback transplantation might be considered primarily for HCC patients.
