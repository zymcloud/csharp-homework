Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is traditionally associated with chronic liver injury resulting from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or excessive consumption of alcohol. In addition, recent evidence links HCC to diabetes.Aims:Since these risk factors are prevalent among US veterans, we analyzedcontribution of various etiologies toHCC incidence in this population.Methods:Clinicopathological correlates of 150 male US veterans diagnosed with HCC between 2001 and 2010 were analyzed and compared to frequency-matched (2:1) non-cancer controls in a single center.Results:HCC was associated with cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR], 250.84; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 86.92-723.88; p Conclusions:While HCC in US veterans is overwhelmingly linked to cirrhosis due to "traditional" risk factors, it also occurs with a separate clinical profile characterized by diabetes and no evidence of cirrhosis, suggesting distinct mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis and needs for surveillance.
