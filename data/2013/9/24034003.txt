Introduction:From 2011 a program was developed for liver transplant recipients with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≥30. We examined its effectiveness and impact on the other subjects on the waiting list.Materials and methods:We analyzed requests received between January 2011 and May 2012 for the primary pathology, the outcome, the average waiting time, and the origin of the organ. We examined the ordinary waiting list for mortality rates and numbers of transplantations over this period (group A) versus a comparable preceding period (group B).Results:There were 38 requests for 33 patients. Their primary pathologies were cirrhosis associated with viral infection (n = 15), delayed graft failure (DGF; n = 5), biliary cirrhosis (n = 4), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 3 including 2 with cirrhosis), cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 3), postalcoholic cirrhosis (n = 2), metabolic disease (n = 2), and iatrogenic disease (n = 1). Of the requests, 25 were successfully dealt with, whereas 5 requests were temporarily suspended and 2 were permanently suspended because of better or worse patient conditions. There were 6 deceased patients. Transplanted organs came from the inter-regional area in 64% of cases. The average waiting time was 5.9 days. Within group A were a 311 transplantations among 723 waiting list patients on with a 13.7% mortality rate. Within group B were 305 transplantations among 871 wait-listed patients with a 14% mortality rate.Discussion:The liver transplantation program for recipients with MELD scores ≥ 30 allowed recipients in critical condition to receive grafts without altering substantially the opportunities for recipients on the elective waiting list.
