Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been reported to be related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 as biomarkers for HCC among high-risk patients. Materials and Methods. 80 individuals were enrolled in this study; they were categorized into 4 groups: group 1 healthy individuals (NC) (n = 20), group 2 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients (n = 20), group 3 cirrhotic patients (LC) (n = 20), and HCC group (n = 20). Using ELISA technique serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) were evaluated in all groups. Results. The mean serum levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in HCC than in LC, HCV, and NC groups (13.99 ± 1.80, 7.49 ± 0.43, 5.78 ± 0.74, and 2.57 ± 0.31), respectively (P
