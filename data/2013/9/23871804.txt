Aims:This study was to investigate whether the clinically acceptable colchicine concentrations had anti-cancer effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their anti-cancer mechanisms.Main methods:Two human HCC cell lines (HCC24/KMUH, HCC38/KMUH) and two human cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) cell lines (F28/KMUH, F59/KMUH) were investigated by proliferative assay, microarray, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and nude mouse study using clinically acceptable colchicine concentrations.Key findings:Both 2 and 6ng/mL colchicine significantly inhibited the cellular proliferation of all cell lines tested (PSignificance:Clinically acceptable colchicine concentrations have anti-cancer effects on HCC. This drug has potential for the palliative treatment of HCC.
