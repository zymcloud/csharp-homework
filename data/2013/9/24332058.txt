Objective:To explore the prognostic factors in patients with gastric cancer (GC) or adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) combined with malignant pleural and/or abdominal effusion.Methods:Clinicopathological data of 111 GC or AEG patients with malignant pleural and/or abdominal effusion treated in our hospital from January 2001 to December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed.Results:The median survival time for the whole group of 111 patients was 6 months. Effusion disappeared in 12 patients, was reduced in 36 cases, with no changes in 15 cases, and increased in 48 patients. The effusion control rate was 56.8%. Effusion was better controlled in female patients, with simple abdominal ascites, Karnovsky performance scores ≥ 80, with no liver metastases, effusion at initial diagnosis, and effective response to systemic chemotherapy.Univariate analysis showed that patients of female sex, Karnovsky performance scores ≥ 80, effusion present at initial diagnosis, simple abdominal ascites, minimal volume of effusion, absence of liver metastasis, control of effusion, initial treatment with effusions and effective response to systemic chemotherapy, normal hemoglobin, albumin, direct and indirect bilirubin levels showed better prognosis (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that liver metastases, control of effusions were independent prognostic factors in patients with gastric cancer and adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (all P < 0.05).Conclusions:Female patients, simple abdominal ascites, KPS scores ≥ 80, ascites at initial diagnosis, no liver metastases and effective systemic chemotherapy seem to have a better control of the malignant effusion. Patients with no liver metastases and effective control of effusion have a longer survival time.
