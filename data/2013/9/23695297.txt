Background:The incidence and number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of colorectal cancer patients are lower than in other cancer types, which may point to a particular biology of colorectal cancer affecting CTC detection.Methods:We detected CTCs in the peripheral and mesenteric blood of colorectal cancer patients by use of 2 independent technologies on the basis of different biological properties of colon cancer cells. Seventy-five patients diagnosed with localized (M0, n = 60) and metastatic (M1, n = 15) colorectal cancer were included. Peripheral and mesenteric blood samples were collected before tumor resection. We performed CTC enumeration with an EpCAM-independent enrichment method followed by the Epispot assay that detected only viable CK19-releasing CTCs. In parallel, we used the FDA-cleared EpCAM-dependent CellSearchÂ® as the reference method.Results:The enumeration of CK19-releasing cells by the CK19-Epispot assay revealed viable CTCs in 27 of 41 (65.9%) and 41 of 74 (55.4%) (P = 0.04) patients in mesenteric and peripheral blood, respectively, whereas CellSearch detected CTCs in 19 of 34 (55.9%) and 20 of 69 (29.0%) (P = 0.0046) patients. In mesenteric blood, medians of 4 (range 0-247) and 2.7 CTCs (range 0-286) were found with Epispot and CellSearch (P = 0.2), respectively, whereas in peripheral blood, Epispot and CellSearch detected a median of 1.2 (range 0-92) and 0 CTCs (range 0-147) (P = 0.002).Conclusions:A considerable portion of viable CTCs detectable by the Epispot assay are trapped in the liver as the first filter organ in CRC patients.
