Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rare soft tissue tumor, with a low-grade malignant potential, occurring predominantly in children and young adults. Association between AFH and other malignancies has been rarely reported. A 27-year-old man who presented with a palpable abdominal mass was diagnosed as having testicular cancer with multiple liver and lung metastases. At 16 months after chemotherapy, a follow-up computed tomographic scan revealed a supraclavicular mass measuring 3 cm in size, which was suspected to be a recurrence. The patient underwent surgical excision, and the mass was pathologically diagnosed as a AFH. The patient has had no local recurrence and no distant metastasis for 12 months after resection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of AFH as a second tumor in a patient with testicular cancer.
