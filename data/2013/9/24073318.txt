Background/aims:No standard chemotherapy has been established for advanced gallbladder cancer. The authors studied the activity and tolerability of a gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) combination in unresectable gallbladder cancer (GBC).Methods:Adult patients with pathologically confirmed unresectable GBC were prospectively recruited at three centers. No patient had received prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients received cycles of gemcitabine at 1,000 mg/m(2) on day 1, followed by oxaliplatin at 100 mg/m(2) on day 2, every 2 weeks. The primary study endpoint was time to progression.Results:Forty patients with unresectable GBC were enrolled. The median age was 60 years (range, 38 to 79 years). All patients showed good performance status. Of the 33 analyzable patients, 12 achieved partial response (36%), 17 stable disease (52%), and four progressive disease (12%). No patient achieved a complete response. The tumor control rate was 88%. At a median follow-up of 6.8 months, the median time to progression was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7 to 6.9), and median overall survival was 6.8 months (95% CI, 6.1 to 7.5). Nine of the 40 patients (23%) experienced at least a grade-3 adverse event, but no patient experienced a grade-4 adverse event.Conclusions:GEMOX combination therapy is a feasible option and is well tolerated in unresectable GBC.
