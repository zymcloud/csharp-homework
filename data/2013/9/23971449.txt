Objective:The purpose of this article is to prospectively evaluate the optimal scan delay for gadoxetate disodium-enhanced hepatic arterial phase MRI of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using MR fluoroscopic triggering and a slow-injection technique.Subjects and methods:Sixty-three patients (37 men and 26 women; age range, 33-92 years; mean age, 68.2 years) underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI; there were 33 hypervascular HCCs (size range, 8-57 mm; mean size, 19.8 mm) in 19 patients. The time from the start of contrast agent injection to its arrival in the abdominal aorta (time to arrival) and the time from contrast agent arrival to peak enhancement (time to peak) were determined using MR fluoroscopy using IV slow injection at 1 mL/s of contrast material and a saline chaser. All patients underwent four-phase whole-liver imaging with a 3D keyhole gradient-echo sequence during a single breath-hold immediately after confirmation of aortic peak enhancement. Delays from peak aortic enhancement to k-space filling were 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, and 20-28 seconds, respectively, in the four phases. Time to arrival, time to peak, and HCC-to-liver contrast were evaluated.Results:The time to arrival (range, 11-24 seconds; mean, 16.2 seconds) and the time to peak (range, 3-10 seconds; mean, 6.8 seconds) showed considerable variation among patients. HCC-to-liver contrast peaked at the first phase in 58% of cases, at the second phase in 42% of cases, and at the third and fourth phases in 0% of cases. Mean HCC-to-liver contrast in the first and second phases was significantly higher than that in the third and fourth phases (pConclusion:Optimal scan delays for imaging hypervascular HCCs with gadoxetate disodium-enhanced hepatic arterial phase MRI was 7-12 seconds after the peak aortic enhancement using a slow-injection protocol.
