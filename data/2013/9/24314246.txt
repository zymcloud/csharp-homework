Objective:To compare morphological differences of three drug-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell subclones (Huh-7/ADM, Huh-7/CBP, Huh-7/MMC) and their parental Huh-7 cell line, to analyze differential microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in these cells and, finally to screen for the abnormal expressed miRNAs in drug-resistant HCC cells.Methods:Cellular morphology was observed by histology and transmission electron microscopy. MiRNA microarray was used to analyze the differential miRNA expression profiles in these cells (Huh-7, Huh-7/ADM, Huh-7/CBP, Huh-7/MMC) followed by real time quantitative PCR validation.Results:The drug-resistant cells had more intracytoplasmic organelles and were larger in size along with increased cytological pleomorphism than the parental Huh-7 cells. Compared with the parental Huh-7 cells, 32 simultaneously up-regulated and 22 down-regulated miRNAs were found in three drug-resistant cells. Up-regulation of miR-15a, miR-16, miR-27b, miR-30b, miR-146a, miR-146b-5p, miR-181a, miR-181d and miR-194 was verified by RT-qPCR.Conclusion:Drug-resistant HCC cells have abnormal expressed miRNAs, which may be explored to further investigate the association of miRNA expressions with multidrugs resistance in HCC.
