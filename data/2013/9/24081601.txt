A 25-year-old man who was normally fit and well, presented with a 2-year history of progressively worsening tremor. His tremor was generalised, affecting head, neck and all four limbs. One of the patient's brothers had suffered from similar problems, but never sought medical attention. Examination revealed a generalised tremor, of greater amplitude on the patient's left side, which increased in its amplitude upon exertion. Slit-lamp examination revealed bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings and serum caeruloplasmin was found to be low, while 24 h urinary copper excretion was elevated. A diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and an abdominal ultrasound was performed, revealing evidence of portal hypertension and a hyperechoic hepatic nodule, later confirmed to be hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient underwent partial hepatic resection and was started on D-penicillamine.
