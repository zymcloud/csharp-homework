Background/aims:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the mainstay of management for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the survival rates of patients with unresectable HCC following TACE performed in a single center.Methodology:The authors retrospectively assessed the electronic medical records of 512 patients in whom HCC was newly diagnosed from January 2008 to December 2012 at a single tertiary medical center. Patients with decompensated hepatic function were excluded. Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy was performed using one drug or combinations of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and doxorubicin. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS). Survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method.Results:A total of 512 HCC patients (425 men and 87 women; mean age, 58.9 years; age range, 38.3-86.1 years) were treated with TACE in a single center. The overall survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 62%, 43%, and 37%, respectively. The overall median survival time from the start of TACE treatment was 15 months.Conclusions:TACE is an effective minimally invasive therapy option for palliative treatment of HCC patients.
