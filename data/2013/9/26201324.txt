It has been suggested that the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is related to the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells. Although CSCs populations may be recognized by use of stem cell markers and/or their functional capacities, their profiles might be diverse, because of the heterogeneity of HCC among individuals. Recent studies indicate that activation of CSCs is related to dysregulation of crucial molecular signaling pathways able to alter the intrinsic properties of normal stem cells. This short review describes the latest evidence of the presence of CSCs, alteration of several developmental and oncogenic pathways, CSC-related microRNAs, and drug resistance in HCC. This information may aid the development of potential novel therapy targeting CSCs in HCC.
