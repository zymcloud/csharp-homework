Background & aims:The dysfunction of miRNAs has been demonstrated to participate in the development of various tumors. However, whether miRNAs are involved in metastasis and progression of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) remains unknown.Methods:A new designed gain-of-function miRNA screening technology was applied to filter out pro-metastatic miRNAs in GBC. Their expression in GBC tissues was validated by real-time PCR. The biological functions of miRNAs were intensively studied by transwell, immunoblot, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization assays. Tumorigenicity and liver metastasis were further examined in nude mice.Results:Of 880 miRNAs, 17 were filtered out as the prominent metastatic inducers of GBCs. Among them, the upregulation of pro-metastatic miR-20a was closely associated with local invasion, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis of 67 followed-up GBC patients, clinically. Patients with higher miR-20a expression exhibited worse overall survival (OS and median OS time was 5 and 20 months, respectively) than the lower expression group. A dramatically increased TGF-β1 level was found in GBC patients, which was responsible for the elevation of miR-20a. The ectopic expression of miR-20a could induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhance metastasis of GBC cells in vitro and in vivo, by directly targeting the 3' UTR of Smad7, and subsequently promoting nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Conversely, the blockage of miR-20a by specific antagomir effectively restored the expression of Smad7 and attenuated TGF-β-induced cell metastasis.Conclusions:TGF-β1-mediated activation of the miR-20a/Smad7/β-catenin axis plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and worse prognosis of GBCs and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in the future.
