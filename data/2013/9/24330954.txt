Objective:To evaluate the effect of preoperative transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on hepatocellular carcinoma located in caudate lobe.Methods:Totally 29 cases of caudate lobe hepatocellular carcinoma admitted from January 2001 to December 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Among the 29 patients, 23 were male and the other 6 were female. The median age was 52 years. According to receiving preoperative TACE or not, the 29 cases were divided into two groups: preoperative TACE plus surgery (group A, n = 11) and surgery only (group B, n = 18). The surgical results and long-term survival were compared between two groups.Results:After TACE, the diameter of the tumour reduced by over 33.3% in 3 patients, 10.0% to 33.3% in 6 patients, and less than 10.0% in 2 patients. The duration of surgery and intraoperative blood loss in group A were (298 ± 39) minutes and (1031 ± 310) ml, respectively. The duration of surgery and intraoperative blood loss in group B were (281 ± 54) minutes and (868 ± 403) ml, respectively. No significant difference was found in terms of these two groups (t = 1.006, P = 0.324; t = 1.223, P = 0.232). In addition, 6 cases in group A developed complications and 4 cases in group B did so. Only one patient died because of postoperative complication, and this patient belonged to group A. No significant difference was found between two groups (χ(2) = 0.028, P = 0.868; χ(2) = 0.633, P = 0.426). The 5-year survival rate was 56.8% in group A and 34.9% in group B. The difference did not reach significant difference (P = 0.132).Conclusions:For hepatocellular carcinoma located in caudate lobe, preoperative TACE does not significantly increase the surgical difficulty and impair the safety. In addition, preoperative TACE has the tendency to provide benefit to long-term survival.
