Background:Liver transplantation (OLT) can entail a high risk of blood loss requiring transfusions, which increase morbidity and mortality. In recent years many efforts have been spent to improve the surgical and anesthetic management to decrease transfusion rates during OLT. Preoperative predictors for transfusion in OLT, remain uncertain.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the 219 OLT performed from 2005 to 2011 focusing on blood product (BP) transfusions. Statistical analysis sought the impact of transfusions on OLT outcomes to identify possible independent predictors of higher BP requirements.Results:The 1- and 3-year survival rates were 86.6% and 76.45% for patients and 81.0% and 71.8% for grafts respectively. The mean intra- and perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion rates were 12.3 ± 11.7 U and 15.5 ± 13.0 U respectively. A statistical analysis demonstrated a significant influence of BP transfusion on post-OLT complications and survivals. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score to be the only independent predictor of perioperative RBC transfusions.Conclusions:Our results confirmed the link between intra- and perioperative transfusions and outcome of OLT patients. MELD score resulted the only independent variable associated with increased perioperative RBC transfusions.
