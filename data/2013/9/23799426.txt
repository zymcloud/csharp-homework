Background:Recipients of ABO-incompatible (ABOi) living-donor kidney transplants often undergo more intense immunosuppression than their ABO-compatible counterparts. It is unknown if this difference leads to higher cancer risk after transplantation. Single-center studies are too small and lack adequate duration of follow-up to answer this question.Methods:We identified 318 ABOi recipients in the Transplant Cancer Match Study, a national linkage between the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and population-based U.S. cancer registries. Seven cancers (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, thyroid cancer, pancreatic cancer, and testicular cancer) were identified among ABOi recipients. We then matched ABOi recipients to ABO-compatible controls by age, gender, race, human leukocyte antigen mismatch, retransplantation, and transplant year.Results:There was no demonstrable association between ABOi and cancer in unadjusted (incidence rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-1.71; P=0.3) or matched control (incidence rate ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-2.23; P=0.5) analyses.Conclusion:To the extent that could be determined in this registry study, current desensitization protocols are not associated with increased risk of cancer after transplantation.
