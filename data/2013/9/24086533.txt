Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHC-CC) and some hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) express stemness-related markers, such as epithelial adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and keratin 19 (K19), the expression of which has been reported to be associated with more aggressive behavior therein than in HCCs without. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a potential oncogene, is known to promote stem cell proliferation. In the present study, YAP1 expression and clinicopathological features were evaluated and compared among three groups comprising 36 HCCs that expressed both EpCAM and K19, 64 HCCs that did not express EpCAM and K19, and 58 cHC-CCs, which consisted of 38 cases of the classical type and 20 cases of the intermediate-cell subtype. YAP1 expression was more frequently noted in EpCAM(+)/K19(+) HCCs (55.6%) and in cHC-CCs (67.2%) than in EpCAM(-)/K19(-) HCCs (17.2%) (P
