Background & aims:Since data is limited regarding the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Crohn's disease (CD) patients who present with stenosing disease in the colon, this study was undertaken to assess CRC risk in such patients, using a population-based, Veszprem province database, which includes incidental patients diagnosed between January 1, 1977 and December 31, 2011.Methods:Data from 640 incidental CD patients were analyzed (M/F ratio: 321/319, age-at-diagnosis: 28 years (IQR: 22-38)). Both hospital and outpatient records were collected and comprehensively reviewed.Results:CRC was diagnosed in six CD patients during a follow-up of 7759 person-years. Sixty-two patients presented with colonic/ileocolonic disease and a stenotic lesion in the colon with a follow-up of 702 person-years (median: 10.5, IQR: 5-16years). Colorectal cancer developed in 6.5% (equalling 0.57/100 person-years), the SIR (6.53, 95% CI: 2.45-17.4) was increased with four patients observed versus 0.61 expected. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probability of developing CRC was 5.5% and 7.5% after 5- and 10 years, respectively, versus 0.4% in patients with other phenotypes (HR: 18.8, p<0.001). A sensitivity analysis included patients with stenosing colonic lesion at diagnosis or during follow-up (n=91, follow-up: 1180 person-years, median: 12, IQR: 6-17years). The probability of developing CRC was 3.6% and 4.9% after 5- and 10 years, respectively.Conclusions:The risk of CRC in CD patients presenting with or developing a stenotic lesion in the colon is high even after a short disease duration, suggesting the need for careful surveillance.
