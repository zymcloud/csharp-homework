Background:The surgical resection of huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still controversial. This study was designed to introduce our experience of liver resection for huge HCC and evaluate the safety and outcomes of hepatectomy for huge HCC.Methods:A total of 258 hepatic resections for the patients with huge HCC were analysed retrospectively from December 2002 to December 2011. The operative outcomes were compared with 293 patients with HCC >5.0 cm but Results:The 1-, 3-, 5-year overall survival rates after liver resection were 84, 62, and 33 %. Overall survival and disease-free survival in huge HCC group and HCC >5.0 cm but Conclusions:Hepatic resection can be performed safely for huge HCC with a low mortality and favorable survival outcomes. Solitary huge HCC has the better surgical outcomes than nodular huge HCC.
