Background:Angiocidin plays a key role in angiogenesis and tumor progression. High angiocidin expression is detected in some kind of solid tumors and tumor vascular endothelial cells. Several reports have shown the inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth caused by angiocidin. However, the role of angiocidin in liver cancers growth is still unclear.Objectives:To examine angiocidin expression in SMMC-7221 and HepG2 cells and the role of angiocidin in liver cancer cell growth.Methods:RT-PCR and western blot are used in this study to detect angiocidin expression. SiRNA and MTT experiments are used in exploring the role of angiocidin in tumor cell growth.Results:Our study showed high angiocidin expression in two kinds of liver cancer cells. Angiocidin protein production in HepG2 cells were reduced significantly by siRNA. When HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNA-angiocidin, these cells showed very low proliferation activity compared with control cells. Our study suggests that reduction of angiocidin may contribute to decreased proliferation activity in liver cancer cells.Conclusion:Angiocidin is highly expressed in liver cancer cells, and it may play a key role in tumor growth of liver cancers.
