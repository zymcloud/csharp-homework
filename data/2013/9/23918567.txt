Purpose:Sorafenib is an effective systemic agent for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. To increase its efficacy, we evaluated the feasibility and benefit of sorafenib combined with radiotherapy.Materials and methods:From July 2007 to July 2011, 31 patients were treated with a daily dose of 800 mg of sorafenib and radiotherapy. Among them, 13 patients who received radiotherapy on the bone metastasis were excluded. Thirteen patients received 30-54 Gy of radiotherapy on the primary tumor (primary group) and 5 patients received 30-58.4 Gy on the measurable metastatic lesions (measurable metastasis group). Tumor responses at 1 month after the completion of radiotherapy and overall survival were evaluated.Results:The in-field response rate was 100% in the primary group and 60% in the measurable metastasis group. A decrease of more than 80% in the tumor marker Î±-fetoprotein was observed in 7 patients in the primary group (54%). Toxicities of grades 3-4 were hand-foot syndrome in 3 (17%) patients, duodenal bleeding in 1 (6%) patient, thrombocytopenia in 3 (17%) patients and elevation of aspartate transaminase in 1 (6%) patient. The median overall survival was 7.8 months (95% confidence interval, 3.0-12.6).Conclusion:The combined treatment of sorafenib and radiotherapy was feasible and induced substantial tumor responses in the target lesions. The results of this study emphasize the importance of individualized approach in the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and encourage the initiation of a controlled clinical trial.
