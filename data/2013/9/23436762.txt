The present investigation reports the changes in the electrical properties of hepatic tissue in the frequency range of 100 Hz to 5 MHz at an early stage of liver carcinogenesis using the four-pin electrode method. The hepatocarcinogenesis model was developed by intraperitoneal injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) to male Balb/c mice. Histopathological assessment revealed high-grade dysplasia in the liver of NDEA-treated animals. The ultrastructural investigations indicated the presence of large and clumped cells with inconspicuous cell boundaries. The treatment resulted in significant changes in the dielectric properties of the tissues. A decrease in tissue conductivity along with an increase in relative permittivity was observed. The biophysical changes correlated well with histoarchitectural and morphological changes. The alterations in architectural arrangement and membrane structure of cells may be responsible for the observed changes in the dielectric properties.
