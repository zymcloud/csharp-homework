Aim:To detect whether the up-to-seven should be used as inclusion criteria for liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Between April 2002 and July 2008, 220 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who were diagnosed with HCC and underwent liver transplantation (LT) at our liver transplantation center were included. These patients were divided into three groups according to the characteristics of their tumors (tumor diameter, tumor number): the Milan criteria group (Group 1), the in up-to-seven group (Group 2) and the out up-to-seven group (Group 3). Then, we compared long-term survival and tumor recurrence of these three groups.Results:The baseline characteristics of transplant recipients were comparable among these three groups, except for the type of liver graft (deceased donor liver transplant or live donor liver transplantation). There were also no significant differences in the pre-operative Î±-fetoprotein level. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival and tumor-free survival rate for the Milan criteria group were 94.8%, 91.4%, 89.7% and 91.4%, 86.2%, and 86.2% respectively; in the up-to-seven criteria group, these rates were 87.8%, 77.8%, and 76.6% and 85.6%, 75.6%, and 75.6% respectively (P Conclusion:Considering that patients in the up-to-seven criteria group exhibited a considerable but lower survival rate compared with the Milan criteria group, the up-to-seven criteria should be used carefully and selectively.
