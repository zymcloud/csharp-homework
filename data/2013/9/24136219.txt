Background:The aim of this study was to identify factors related to the recurrence of non-B or non-C (NBNC) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Study design:Between April 2000 and March 2012, out of 621 consecutive HCC patients at our institution, 543 who underwent initial hepatectomy and had no extrahepatic metastases were enrolled in the study. Multivariate analysis were performed to identify risk factors for poor disease-free survival (DFS).Results:The 5-year DFS rate of NBNC (34 %) was better than that of hepatitis virus B (30 %, P = 0.011) and hepatitis virus C (21 %, P Conclusions:The prognoses of NBNC patients were better than those of patients with viral infections. Among the NBNC patients, preoperative excessive alcohol intake decreased DFS rate of HCC occurrence after surgery.
