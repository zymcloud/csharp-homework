Aims:This prospective pilot study investigated the feasibility of perfusion computed tomography parameters as surrogate markers of angiogenesis and early response following sorafenib administration in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Ten patients were evaluated with perfusion computed tomography before starting sorafenib and after 3 months. Blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time, hepatic arterial fraction, and permeability surface-product were compared in tumour lesions and in hepatic parenchyma at baseline and at follow-up. Correlation between these parameters and changes in alpha-fetoprotein levels was calculated.Results:At baseline, blood volume, blood flow, hepatic arterial fraction and permeability surface values were higher in lesions compared to those in hepatic parenchyma, while mean transit time was lower (pConclusion:This pilot study suggests that after sorafenib treatment an increase in mean transit time observed in tumour lesions is inversely correlated with alpha-fetoprotein reductions after therapy. Mean transit time may represent a possible marker of response irrespectively of alpha-fetoprotein values.
