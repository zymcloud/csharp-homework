Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Currently, there are no treatment options available for a large number of these patients. One of the mechanisms that may contribute to tumor growth is the lack of an effective immune response toward viral antigens or other tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). Immunotherapy has been tested as a potential therapeutic option for these patients. Several methods of immune modulation for augmenting antitumor immunity are being explored and have been shown to be effective in suppressing HCC growth in animal models. Activation of HCC-specific response can be accomplished by targeting hepatitis B or C viral antigens, alpha-fetoprotein, or other TAAs. This review summarizes part of the recent data on the use of adoptive transfer of immunity against viral antigens, oral immune modulation against TAAs, and the use of pulsed innate immune cells and gut adjuvants for the suppression of HCC; it reviews some additional new immunotherapeutic approaches.
