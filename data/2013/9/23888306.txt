Background:Nonsurgical biliary drainage is considered as a priority for obstructive jaundice associated with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Successful drainage allows the patient to receive antitumor therapy, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, only limited data are available on clinical outcomes in patients who treated biliary drainage with subsequent TACE.Objective:This study evaluated the clinical outcome of biliary drainage with subsequent TACE in unresectable HCC patients with obstructive jaundice.Design:This was a retrospective study.Setting/subjects:A total of 60 patients received endoscopic biliary drainage (ERBD) or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in two tertiary care referral centers.Measurements:Successful drainage and survival were measured.Results:Successful drainage was achieved in 39 (65%) patients. The median survival of 39 patients in whom successful drainage was achieved, regardless of which procedure was performed, was much longer than that of 21 patients without successful drainage (147 days versus 38 days, respectively, PConclusions:Effective palliation by successful biliary drainage with subsequent TACE might prolong the survival in patients with obstructive jaundice caused by unresectable HCC.
