Background:Limited data exist regarding echinocandins as antifungal prophylaxis in liver transplant recipients.Methods:The efficacy and safety of targeted prophylaxis with micafungin or amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) was assessed in a sequential cohort of high-risk patients (posttransplantation dialysis, retransplantation, or reoperation) and compared with those without high risk who did not receive prophylaxis. Outcomes were assessed at 90 days.Results:Micafungin versus ABLC recipients were older (P=0.0065) and more likely to have hepatocellular carcinoma (P=0.025). High-risks, that is, dialysis (55.6% vs. 79.2%), retransplantation (5.6% vs. 12.5%), and reoperation (38.9% vs. 20.8%) did not differ between the two groups. Invasive fungal infections developed in 11.1% (2 of 18) of micafungin recipients, 8.3% (2 of 24) of ABLC recipients, and 3% (7 of 234) of patients without high risks (P=0.12). In nondialyzed patients, ABLC versus micafungin recipients had significantly higher serum creatinine on day 14 (P=0.04). However, renal and hepatic function, rejection, graft loss, and mortality did not differ for the two groups on day 90.Conclusions:Targeted prophylaxis with micafungin or ABLC decreased the risk of mycoses in high-risk recipients compared with that in low-risk recipients. Compared with ABLC, however, micafungin appeared to be associated with lower early-renal dysfunction and no additional risk of hepatic dysfunction.
