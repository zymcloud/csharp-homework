Background:Liver transplantation (OLT) is the gold standard therapy for patients with cirrhosis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within Milan Criteria (MC). We evaluated the impact of the etiology of the underlying liver disease on long-term outcomes of patients undergoing OLT for HCC within MC having a Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score Methods:From November 2002 to December 2009, we performed 203 primary OLTs from brain-dead donors in recipients with HCC and cirrhosis with biochemical MELD scores below 15. We excluded 31 patients outside MC on the explant pathology of the native liver. The remaining 172 were divided into 3 groups according to the etiology of the underlying cirrhosis: hepatitis C virus-positive (HCV+; n = 78; 45%), hepatitis B virus-positive (HBV+; n = 65; 38%) and other indications (n = 29; 17%). The groups were compared for donor and recipient features, donor-recipient match, and transplant variables. The study endpoint was long-term patient survival.Results:The groups were similar, except for a greater prevalence of hepatitis B core antibody-positive grafts in the HBV+ group and less frequent HCC bridging procedures in the other indications group. After a median follow-up of 72 months, HCC recurrence was observed in 8 (4.7%) patients (6 HCV+, 2 other indications), 5 of whom died. Overall 5-year patient survival of 82%, revealed significant differences among groups: 98.3% in HBV+, 67.1% in HCV+, and 85.8% in other indications (HBV+ vs other indications: P = .01; HBV+ vs HCV+: P = .0001; HCV+ vs other indications: P = NS). In the HCV+ group, recurrent HCV hepatitis was the most frequent cause of death. Upon multivariate analysis, HBV positivity in the recipient was an independent predictor of better patient survival (hazard ratio = 0.10, 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.64, P = .013).Conclusions:Etiology of the underlying cirrhosis significantly influenced the long-term survival after OLT of patients with HCC within MC and MELD
