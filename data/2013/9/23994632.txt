Yes-associated protein (YAP), the downstream effector of Hippo signaling pathway as well as c-Myc has been linked to hepatocarcinogenesis. However, little is known about whether and how YAP and c-Myc interacts with each other. In this study, we find YAP-c-Myc interaction is critical for liver cancer cell both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, both c-Myc and YAP proteins are closely correlated in human liver cancer samples. Mechanistically, YAP promotes c-Myc transcriptional output through c-Abl. By contrast, c-Myc enhances protein expression independent of transcription. Taken together, our study uncovers a novel positive auto-regulatory feedback loop underlying the interaction between YAP and c-Myc in liver cancer, suggesting YAP and c-Myc links Hippo/YAP and c-Myc pathways, and thus may be helpful in the development of effective diagnosis and treatment strategies against liver cancer.
