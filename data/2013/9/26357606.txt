A number of disease-associated genetic markers for common liver diseases have been identified using genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The GWAS strategy is based on genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism typing technologies, which are now commercially available, accompanied by statistical methods to identify host genetic factors that are associated with target diseases or complex genetic traits. One of the most striking features of the GWAS strategy is the ability to identify unexpected disease-associated genetic markers across the entire human genome. Here, we describe the technological aspects of the GWAS strategy with examples from actual GWAS reports related to hepatitis research, including drug response for patients with chronic hepatitis C, susceptibility to primary biliary cirrhosis, and hepatitis-B-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
