We report a case of double liver cancer in an elderly woman with chronic hepatitis C. The patient was diagnosed with two liver tumors when she was in her 70s, and she underwent hepatectomy for the same. Histopathological examination determined that the two tumors were distinct. One was a well-to-moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the other was a combined hepatocellular carcinoma and mucinous cholangiocarcinoma (ChC). The HCC component was positive for cytokeratin 19, and it infiltrated into the portal vein and artery and the gall bladder. The ChC component was positive for hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1) staining and infiltrated into the bile duct. There has been no cancer recurrence at 6 months after surgery. Double cancer of the liver with these histological types is extremely rare and interesting, given the origin and differentiation of liver cancer.
