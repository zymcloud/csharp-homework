Objective:To investigate the expression and clinical significance of Nusap1 in hepatical carcinoma.Methods:The expression of Nusap1 protein in 61 specimens of hepatical carcinoma was examined by immunohistochemistry. Based on the levels of Nusap1 expression, the 61 specimens were divided into a high Nusap1 expression group and a low Nusap1 expression group. The correlation between Nusap1 expression with clinicopathologic features and prognosis of hepatical carcinoma was analyzed.Results:The rate of high Nusap1 expression was 54.1% in hepatical carcinoma. The rate of high Nusap1 expression was 21.3% in noncarcinoma, with significant difference between the 2 groups (P0.05). Survival analysis suggested that the 6 month and 12 month noncarcinoma survival rate was significantly lower in the high Nusap1 expression group [33.3% (11/33), 17.9% (5/33)] than that in the low Nusap1 expression group [89.3% (25/28), 53.6% (15/28); PConclusion:Nusap1 is overexpressed in hepatical carcinoma and is a valuable prognostic factor for hepatical carcinoma.
