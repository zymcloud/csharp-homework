Background/aims:Liver metastases are associated with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The objective of this study is to determine the possible indicators in identifying the predictive value of serum CEA, CA19-9 and CA-125 in diagnosis of liver metastases from CRC in the Chinese population.Methodology:We randomly selected 101 CRC patients with liver metastases and 81 patients without liver metastases. Several clinical pathological factors were analyzed for the correlation with liver metastases. The predictive value of CEA, CA19-9 and CA-125 for liver metastases from CRC was evaluated.Results:There was no significant difference in gender, age, hepatitis B history, serum AFP level or lesion location. Patients with liver metastases had a tendency to have higher serum CEA, CA19-9 and CA-125 level. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum CEA level (p<0.001), CA19-9 level (p<0.001) and CA-125 level (p=0.001) were independent prognostic predictors for liver metastases. Combination of CEA, CA19-9 and CA-125 can enhance their sensitivity in diagnosis of synchronous and metachronous liver metastases. Serum CA19-9 level, combined test of CA19-9 and CA-125, combined test of triple markers have higher sensitivities in synchronous metastasis than those in metachronous metastasis.Conclusions:Combination test would enhance the sensitivities of serum CEA, CA19-9 and CA-125 levels, which are important in predicting liver metastases from CRC in the Chinese population, either synchronous or metachronous.
