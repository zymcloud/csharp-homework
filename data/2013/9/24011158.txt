Objective:To explore the clinical relevance between HAb18G/CD147 expression and malignant tumors, including esophageal cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The expression and localization of CD147 in six kinds of malignant tumors, their adjacent tissues, and lymph node metastasis specimens were studied by immunohistochemical SP staining. Then the relationships between CD147 expression and degree of tumor differentiation, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis were analyzed.Results:CD147 expression was significantly elevated in tumors compared with their adjacent tissues. CD147 expression was positively correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation, depth of invasion, and lymph node metastasis. CD147 expression was significantly increased in infiltrating deep tissues of colon cancer, cervical cancer, and esophageal cancer (PConclusion:CD147 expression was significantly higher in tissues of poor differentiation, deep invasion, and lymph node metastasis. This indicated that CD147 may be a prognostic indicator for malignant tumors.
