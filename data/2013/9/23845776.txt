Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated to infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Genetic variations may play an important role in the development of HCC in HCV patients. Ghrelin exerts anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and hepatoprotective effects on chronically injured hepatic tissues. Ghrelin gene shows several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including -604G/A, Arg51Gln, and Leu72Met. Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations namely C282Y and H63D may cause hepatic iron overload, thus increasing the risk of HCC in HCV patients.Aim:To investigate the association of progression of HCC with ghrelin and HFE gene polymorphisms in HCV Egyptian patients.Methods:Seventy-nine chronic HCV patients (thirty-nine developed HCC and forty did not), and forty healthy control subjects were included in the study. The polymorphisms were evaluated by PCR/RFLP analysis, and related protein levels were measured by either ELISA or colorimetric assays.Results:The three tested SNPs on ghrelin gene were detected in the studied groups, only one SNP (Arg51Gln) showed significantly higher GA, AA genotypes and A allele frequencies in hepatitis C patients who developed HCC than in hepatitis C patients without HCC and controls. Of the two mutations studied on HFE gene only H63D heterozygous allele was detected, and its frequency did not statistically differ among studied groups.Conclusion:Our results suggest that A allele at position 346 of the ghrelin gene is associated with susceptibility to HCC in hepatitis C patients.
