Introduction:The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of de novo tumors (DNT) of the upper aerodigestive tract in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods:Among 225 consecutive OLT performed between January 2002 and January 2012, a total of 205 patients received a first liver allograft. Eleven (4.9%) patients developed DNT (lung, pancreas, bowel, esophagus, larynx, tongue, tonsil, and lymphoma). Among these, we observed 5 patients with DNT of the upper aerodigestive tract.Results:The 5 patients with DNT of the upper aerodigestive tract underwent OLT for alcoholic cirrhosis. There were 4 men and 1 woman with a mean age at transplantation of 47 years. The mean period of alcohol abuse was 90 months. The tumors occurred after a mean post-transplantation time of 39 months. The immunosuppressive regimen included Tacrolimus, mTOR, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and low-dose steroids. We observed 2 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, 1 case of tonsillar cancer, 1 case of larynx carcinoma, and 1 case of tongue carcinoma. All patients underwent surgical excision. After surgery, 4 patients received chemotherapy and 2 patients radiotherapy. At present, among the 5 patients with DNT of the upper aerodigestive tract, only 2 are alive without disease and 1 is alive with a local recurrence.Conclusion:The incidence of DNT of the upper aerodigestive tract after OLT is higher among patients receiving a transplant for alcoholic cirrhosis. This could be due to an additional effect of post-transplantation immunosuppression in patients exposed to alcohol before transplantation. We suggest a careful post-transplantation follow-up and more attention to improve early diagnosis.
