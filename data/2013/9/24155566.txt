This report describes the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of an adrenocortical carcinoma with distant metastasis in a Sprague-Dawley rat. Macroscopically, a single large mass was observed in the adrenal gland, and multiple nodules were noted in the lung, liver and thyroid. Histologically, the adrenal tumor consisted of a solid growth of eosinophilic round cells with nuclear atypia. Vascular invasion was present, and multiple metastatic lesions were also observed in the lungs, liver, and mediastinal lymph nodes. Immunohistochemically, the nuclei of these tumor cells were positive for Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1). In the thyroid, tumor cells histologically resembling adrenal cells were immunohistochemically negative for SF-1 but positive for calcitonin; thus the lesion was diagnosed as thyroid C-cell carcinoma. From these results, the present case was diagnosed as adrenocortical carcinoma with distant metastases. SF-1 could be a valuable marker for the differential diagnosis of adrenocortical tumors versus other endocrine tumors such as C-cell carcinoma.
