Aim:To investigate the dynamic features of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) expression in rat hepatocarcinogenesis, and the relationship between IGF-IR and hepatocytes malignant transformation at mRNA or protein level.Methods:Hepatoma models were made by inducing with 2-fluorenylacetamide (2-FAA) on male Sprague-Dawley rats. Morphological changes of hepatocytes were observed by pathological Hematoxylin and eosin staining, the dynamic expressions of liver and serum IGF-IR were quantitatively analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The distribution of hepatic IGF-IR was located by immunohistochemistry. The fragments of IGF-IR gene were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and confirmed by sequencing.Results:Rat hepatocytes after induced by 2-FAA were changed dynamically from granule-like degeneration, precancerous to hepatoma formation with the progressing increasing of hepatic mRNA or IGF-IR expression. The incidences of liver IGF-IR, IGF-IR mRNA, specific IGF-IR concentration (ng/mg wet liver), and serum IGF-IR level (ng/mL) were 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.63 ± 0.17, and 1.33 ± 0.47 in the control; 50.0%, 61.1%, 0.65 ± 0.2, and 1.51 ± 0.46 in the degeneration; 88.9%, 100%, 0.66 ± 0.14, and 1.92 ± 0.29 in the precancerosis; and 100%, 100%, 0.96 ± 0.09, and 2.43 ± 0.57 in the cancerous group, respectively. IGF-IR expression in the cancerous group was significantly higher (P Conclusion:IGF-IR expression may participate in rat hepatocarcinogenesis and its abnormality should be an early marker for hepatocytes malignant transformation.
