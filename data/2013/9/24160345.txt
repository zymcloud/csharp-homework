Objective:To confirm the malignant phenotype of hepatocarcinoma cell (HCC) lines at various stages of differentiation (MHCC97L, MHCC97H and HCCLM3) and to explore their expression levels of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers.Methods:The invasive and proliferative properties of each HCC line were assessed by transwell assay and the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) colorimetric assay. Sensitivity to chemotherapy was assessed by treatment with oxaliplatin and determination of the half inhibitory concentration (IC50). The expression of CD90, EpCAM and CD24 was measured by flow cytometry.Results:The number of cells that migrated through the invasion assay membrane were significantly different between the three HCC lines: HCCLM3 (30.57 +/- 8.95) more than MHCC97H (21.33 +/- 4.17) more than HCC97L (9.33 +/- 3.85), P less than 0.01. The IC50 was significantly different between the three HCC lines: HCCLM3 (36.57 +/- 6.95) mumol/L more than MHCC97H (26.35+/-3.88) mumol/L more than MHCC97L (17.68 +/- 3.25) mumol/L. The CSC marker with the highest expression on all three HCC lines was CD90 (HCCLM3: 0.92% +/- 0.21%, MHCC97H: 1.98% +/- 0.23%, and MHCC97L: 2.55% +/- 0.34%), followed by EpCAM (2.11% +/- 0.32%, 3.23% +/- 0.18%, and 4.38% +/-0.49%, respectively), and CD24 as the lowest (0.68% +/- 0.37%, 1.22% +/- 0.26%, and 1.36% +/- 0.24%, respectively).Conclusion:Higher expression of CSC markers on HCC lines is associated with a stronger invasive ability and higher sensitivity to chemotherapy.
