Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1 (BAG-1) is a multifunctional anti-apoptotic protein which regulates an array of cellular processes, including apoptosis, signaling, proliferation, transcription, and cell motility and has been reported to be over-expressed in a number of human malignancies. To investigate the possible involvement of BAG-1 in tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we performed Western blot analysis in eight paired samples of HCC and adjacent peritumoral tissues and immunohistochemistry in 65 paraffin sections of HCC, which both showed an enhanced expression of nuclear BAG-1 isoform in HCC tissues. Statistical analysis confirmed that overexpression of nuclear BAG-1 in HCC tissues was significantly associated with histological grading (P
