Background:Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) is now suggested to participate in the process of metastatic tumor formation. However, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) the process is still not well revealed.Methods:Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were obtained from 13 patients with HCC in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University. The expression of E-cadherin, Fibronectin, N-cadherin, Vimentin, Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha), Snail and Slug was assessed in primary tumors and their corresponding metastases by immunohistochemical staining. Next, the expression of HNF4alpha and E-cadherin in four HCC cell lines was examined. Furthermore, SK-Hep-1 cells were transfected with human HNF4alpha expression vector, and the change of E-cadherin expression was assessed.Results:45.2% (14/31) of the lesions in the metastases showed increased E-cadherin expression compared with the primaries, suggesting the possible occurrence of MET in metastatic tumor formation of HCC, as re-expression of E-cadherin is proposed to be the important hallmark of MET. The occurrence of MET was also confirmed by the reduced expression of Fibronectin (54.8%, 17/31), N-cadherin (38.7%, 12/31) and Vimentin (61.3%, 19/31) in the metastases. 45.2% (14/31) of the lesions in the metastases also showed increased HNF4alpha expression, and 67.7% (21/31) and 48.4% (15/31) of metastases showed decreased Snail and Slug expression respectively. Statistical results showed that the expression of HNF4alpha was positively related with that of E-cadherin, and negatively correlated with that of Snail, Slug and Fibronectin, suggesting that the expression change of the MET markers in the metastatic lesions might be associated with HNF4alpha. Among the four HCC cell lines, both HNF4alpha and E-cadherin expressed high in Hep3B and Huh-7 cells, but low in SK-Hep-1 and Bel-7402 cells. Furthermore, the expression of E-cadherin increased accordingly when SK-Hep-1 cells were transfected with human HNF4alpha expression vector, further confirming the role of HNF4alpha in the regulation of E-cadherin expression.Conclusions:Our clinical observations and experimental data indicate that HNF4alpha might play a crucial role in the metastatic tumor formation of HCC, and the mechanism may be related with the process of phenotype transition.
