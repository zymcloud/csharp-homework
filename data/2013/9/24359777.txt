Aims:To investigate the antitumor effects of extracts from Oxytropis falcata on human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells in vitro and in transplanted murine H22 tumors in vivo.Methods:Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells were determined and tumor growth inhibition in H22 tumors was investigated. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V-FITC/ PI double staining.Results:MTT assay revealed that essential oil and flavonoids of O. falcata (named EOOF and FOF) inhibited proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 value of EOOF and FOF were 0.115 and 0.097 mg·mL(-1), respectively. Cell cycle was arrested at G(1) phase, and induction of apoptosis occurred in SMMC-7721 cells when subjected to FOF. Growth inhibition in H22 solid tumors transplanted mice was significantly pronounced after being treated with FOF, and the inhibition ratio were 56.1% and 70.8% at the concentration of 30 and 60 mg·kg(-1).Conclusion:The results suggest that FOF promotes apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells and inhibits H22 tumor growth, resulting in a potential antitumor effect on hepatic cancer.
