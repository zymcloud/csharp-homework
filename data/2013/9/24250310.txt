Background:The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is generally very poor with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15% since most of them are diagnosed clinically at their late stage. However, the differential diagnosis between alpha fetoprotein(AFP) negative HCC and cirrhotic nodules is still difficult.Objectives:To evaluate the diagnostic value of glypican-3(GPC3) in patients with AFP negative hepatitis B related HCC.Methods:The liver tissue GPC3 (GPC3L) expression was tested from 426 for surgery and 179 of needle biopsies of hepatitis B related HCC patients using immunohistochemistry staining. Serum GPC3 (GPC3S) and AFP were also measured.Results:Among surgical HCC samples, 80.0% of GPC3L expression was positive, however, in paracarcinomatous and cirrhotic nodules were negative. In needle biopsy tissues, GPC3L positively expression was in 74.9%. The sensitivity of AFP>400 µg/L was 25.4%. The GPC3S >3.5 µg/L was determined as a positive. The area of ROC curve of GPC3S was 0.68(95% CI 0.56-0.79,PConclusions:GPC3 may be helpful in improving diagnosis of HCC and in differentiating diagnosis between AFP negative HCC and cirrhotic nodules.
