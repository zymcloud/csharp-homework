Objectives:Liver cancer is one of the highest rate diseases in southeastern Asia. Recently, many of functional foods and alternative medicines are very popularly utilized to prevent chronic diseases and cancer in Taiwan. In this study, we wanted to select and develop some of novel effectual agents or phytochemicals of γ-mangostin for clinical management or prevent hepatocellular carcinoma cell (HCC).Methods:Lipid peroxidation (LPO) is an autocatalytic mechanism which induced tissue injure and carcinogenesis. In this study, the inhibitory activity of γ-mangostin on oxidative damage induced rat mitochondria LPO, the free radical scavenging of γ-mangostin and the apoptotic effects of γ-mangostin on HepG2 cells were investigated.Key findings:γ-Mangostin processed activity to inhibit LPO and scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. γ-Mangostin showed antiproliferative activity and induced nuclear condensation and apoptotic bodies appearance under Giemsa staining by microscopic observation. In addition, γ-mangostin showed increases of hypodiploid cells via propidium iodide, 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, and 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide staining by flow cytometry analysis in HepG2 cells.Conclusions:γ-Mangostin has demonstrated free radical scavenging activity, and antiproliferative and apoptotic activity in HepG2 cells. The proof suggests that γ-mangostin is a lead compound candidate for clinical management or prevent HCC.
