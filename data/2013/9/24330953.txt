Objective:To explore the clinical application technology of completely laparoscopy hepodectomy (LH).Methods:From June 2006 to December 2011, the 126 cases of LH were performed, the data including operating time, blood loss and postoperative complications, etc, were analyzed retrospectively. The patients included 87 males and 39 female and they were 28-83 years old with an average age of 44.5 years old. The parenchyma was transected using laparoscopic ultrasonic scalpel and ligasure, accomplished with endoscopic linear stapler. Of all the patients, the diseases performed LH including primary liver carcinoma (45 cases), liver hemoangioma (58 cases), colon carcinoma with livermetastasis (23 cases), liver focar (5 cases), liver granuloma (1 case), liver adenoma (4 cases). The operations included left hemihepatectomy (n = 17), left lateral lobectomy (n = 34), right hemihepatectomy (n = 15), segmentectomy (n = 22), local resection (n = 59).Results:Of all the patients, mean blood loss was 180 ml (10-1250 ml), mean surgical time was 142 minutes (43-220 minutes), mean postoperative hospital day was 2.2 days (3-12 days). Postoperative complications including eight cases of bile leakage, recovered after 1-3 weeks by appropriately draining. The patients with malignant tumor were followed up for 18 months (12-46 months), recurrence happened in 12 cases and four cases was died of recurrence and metastasis.Conclusions:LH is a safe, feasible and effective procedure for the treatment of benign liver disease and malignant liver neoplasm as long as the patient is properly selected, it should be recommended for radical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
