Acute myeloid leukemia presenting as leukemia cutis (LC) with hepatocellular carcinoma is extremely rare. The current study presents a case of a 53-year-old male with generalized cutaneous nodules on the face and anterior chest wall. Laboratory tests, including bone marrow biopsy revealed acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4) with skin and tonsilar involvement. Liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 6-cm mass in hepatic segments 4 and 8, and a liver biopsy demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma cells and immature blast cells coexisted. Although LC has been reported in Korea, a case of LC associated with acute myelomonocytic leukemia was diagnosed simultaneously with hepatocellular carcinoma and tonsillar involvement. The present study describes this case with a review of the literature.
