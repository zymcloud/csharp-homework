Background & aims:Hepatitis D virus (HDV) has decreased in Europe, but recent reports indicate a rising trend. We report the epidemiological changes, clinical progress, and effect of treatment on the natural course of HDV infection in Greece during the last 13 years.Methods:Prospective data were extracted from the HepNet.Greece Cohort-Study.Results:Since 1997, 4673 chronic HBV (CHB) cases (4527 adults, 146 children) have been followed prospectively. Two thousand one hundred thirty-seven patients were tested for anti-HDV [101 (4.7%) positive]. Anti-HDV testing in Greece decreased significantly (57.0% before 2003, 35.3% thereafter; pConclusions:In Greece, HDV serology is currently tested in only one-third of HBsAg-positive patients. HDV prevalence is lower in native Greeks compared to immigrants, who may contribute >50% of the HDV infection burden in Greece. Data show that HDV infection is a rapidly progressive disease, but interferon-based treatment may alter its course.
