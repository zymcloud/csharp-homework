Objective:To investigate the effect of high mobility group-box protein 1 (HMGB1)-siRNA on invasion and migration of human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and further to explore its mechanism.Methods:HMGB1-siRNA was synthesized with RNA interference and transferred into HepG2 cells to down-regulate the expression of HMGB1. The invasion and migration activities were assayed by Transwellâ„¢ assay and monolayer wounding healing assay. The levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and tissue inhibitor of MMP-2 (TIMP-2) were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting in HepG2 cells after treatment with 40 nmol/L HMGB1-siRNA for 24 h.Results:The migration and invasion abilities of HepG2 cells were inhibited by 40 nmol/L HMGB1-siRNA markedly. Compared with the control group, MMP-2, MMP-9, ICAM-1 were down-regulated, TIMP-2 was up-regulated significantly by HMGB1-siRNA (PConclusion:HMGB1-siRNA can inhibit the invasion and migration abilities of human hepatoma cells by down-regulating the expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ICAM-1 and up-regulating the expression of TIMP-2.
