A 67-year-old man with bladder cancer who was treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumour(TUR-Bt)and chemotherapy at the age of 59 years was diagnosed as having urothelial cancer by biopsy 8 years later. Detailed examination revealed the presence of synchronous triple cancer, with hepatocellular cancer and gastric cancer. Subsequently, semi-total gastrectomy, partial hepatectomy(S6), radio frequency ablation(S5, S7), and cholecystectomy were performed. Histologically, the gastric tumor was a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, the hepatic tumor was a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, the bladder tumor was a transitional cell carcinoma, and the ureteral tumor was an urothelial carcinoma.
