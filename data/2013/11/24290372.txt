Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate physiological and pathological processes by suppressing target gene expression. Altered expression of miR-30a-3p has been demonstrated in several cancers. However, little about how miR-30a-3p functions in these cancers has been reported, and the role of miR-30a-3p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the role and underlying molecular mechanism of action of miR-30a-3p in HCC.Methods:A total of 110 HCC patients, primarily treated by surgical removal of tumors, were involved in the study. HCC cell line Bel-7402 was selected to characterize the function of miR-30a-3p in vitro.Results:Our results showed that in 83.6% of the 110 HCC patients, expression of miR-30a-3p was significantly downregulated (P Conclusions:our data suggest that miR-30a-3p is downregulated in HCC and acts as a tumor suppressor in vitro. Regulation of vimentin, E-cadherin and MMP3 by miR-30a-3p suggests a useful therapeutic strategy for tumors with reduced miR-30a-3p expression.
