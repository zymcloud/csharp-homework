Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recently, comprehensive whole genome and exome sequencing analyses for HCC revealed new cancer-associated genes and a variety of genomic alterations. In particular, frequent genetic alterations of the chromatin remodeling genes were observed, suggesting a new potential therapeutic target for HCC. Sequencing analysis has further identified the molecular complexities of multicentric lesions and intratumoral heterogeneity. Detailed analyses of the somatic substitution pattern of the cancer genome and the HBV virus genome integration sites by using whole-genome sequencing will elucidate the molecular basis and diverse etiological factors involved in liver cancer development.
