We report a rare case of laparoscopic resection of lesions caused by extrahepatic seeding of hepatocellular carcinoma following percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA). A 52-year-old man had undergone RFA for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in April 2012. After 5 months, his serum tumor marker levels increased remarkably, and computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm tumor and a small 1 cm nodule on the side of the spleen. He also had intrahepatic recurrence, but those lesions seemed to be controlled by transarterial embolization. Therefore, we performed laparoscopic resection of the extrahepatic lesion in November 2012. Histopathological examination revealed a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Two months later, the patient's serum tumor marker levels had decreased dramatically. The remaining intrahepatic recurrence has been stable, and we have not detected any other extrahepatic recurrence thus far. Our case supports the utility of surgical resection for the treatment of extrahepatic seeding of hepatocellular carcinoma.
