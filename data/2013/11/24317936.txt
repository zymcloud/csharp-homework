Background:Due to advances in interferon (IFN) therapy for chronic hepatitis C, most elderly patients, and even many of those with advanced hepatic fibrosis, now achieve a sustained virological response (SVR). However, carcinogenesis remains problematic in these patients. Hence, we aimed to elucidate risk factors for hepatocarcinogenesis in SVR patients and to present an appropriate follow-up protocol for improving outcomes.Methods:We retrospectively studied 562 consecutive SVR patients for a median observation period of 4.8 years.Results:Hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed in 31 patients (5.5%). Respective cumulative incidences were 3.1, 10.1, and 15.9% at 5, 10, and 15 years after completion of IFN therapy. The proportional hazards model identified moderate or advanced fibrosis stage, advanced age, habitual alcohol consumption, and alpha-fetoprotein elevation as determinants of carcinogenesis, with hazard ratios of 10.7 (p Conclusion:We recommend that SVR patients be observed at 6-month intervals, at a minimum, to facilitate diagnosis at an early stage, for as long as possible after completion of therapy even if not at an advanced stage of fibrosis.
