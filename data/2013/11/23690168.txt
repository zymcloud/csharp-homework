Twelve hepatocellular nodules were characterized in the resected livers from 3 patients (2 men and a woman) with alcoholic cirrhosis. Imaging techniques suggested that the nodules were hypervascular and may be hepatocellular carcinoma. Five nodules (4-31 mm in diameter) were serum amyloid A-positive hepatocellular neoplasm, which shares features with inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma. The remaining 7 nodules (5-8 mm) were focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules showing focal or no immunostaining for serum amyloid A. The serum amyloid A-positive hepatocellular neoplasms showed increased cellular density, inflammatory infiltrate, sinusoidal dilatation, and ductular reaction to various degrees. These histologic features tended to be less extensive in focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules. Three of 4 serum amyloid A-positive hepatocellular neoplasms showed slight hypointensity in the hepatobiliary phase on the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhancement. In contrast, 3 focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules showed iso-intensity in the hepatobiliary phase. This study further confirms characteristics of serum amyloid A-positive hepatocellular neoplasm arising in alcoholic cirrhosis that share features with inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas. Serum amyloid A-positive hepatocellular neoplasms sometimes co-exist with focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules and may show different findings on Gd-EOB-enhanced MR imaging.
