Primary vaginal cancer represents only 1% to 2% of malignant neoplasm of the female genital tract. Here, we report a 68-year-old woman who showed a vaginal tumor extending to urethra and clitoris, a 10 cm-sized mass in left adnexa and multiple metastases in lung and liver. Vaginal biopsy showed squamous cell carcinoma of vagina and she was diagnosed as International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IVB vaginal cancer. Palliative surgery including left salpingectomy, tumorectomy, and clitoris mass excision was performed. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) with six cycles of 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin was administered. The patient had a complete remission of 20 months after treatment. At a 40-month follow-up, there was no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis. We can suggest that CCRT is very effective in treating primary squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina, not only in locally advanced but also systemically involved vaginal cancer in selected cases.
