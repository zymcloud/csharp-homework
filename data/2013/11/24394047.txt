Esophageal cancer (EC) often occurs synchronously or metachronously with other primary cancers; however, the occurrence of multiple primary cancers (MPC) of the esophagus and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is relatively rare. We reviewed the records of patients with MPC of the esophagus and HCC treated at our hospital during the past decade. Of the 537 EC patients, 126 (23.5%) had MPC. Of these 126 patients, 4 (3.2%) had MPC of the esophagus and HCC. MPC of the esophagus was synchronous in 1 patient and metachronous in the other 3. HCC was diagnosed by liver biopsy in 2 patients and by imaging studies in the other cases. The patient with synchronous MPC underwent surgery for MPC and HCC simultaneously and was alive 34 months later. We believe that liver tumors occurring with EC should be evaluated carefully by liver biopsy or imaging studies, and simultaneous surgery could be considered for the treatment of synchronous MPC of the esophagus and HCC.
