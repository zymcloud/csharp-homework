Recent evidence has demonstrated that slow responders may benefit from antiviral treatment in HCV/HIV coinfection. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment in individuals with genotype 1 coinfected with HIV, with peg-interferon in combination with ribavirin, compared to the inclusion (versus non-inclusion) of slow responders. A Markov model was developed that simulated the progression of liver disease in a hypothetical cohort of one thousand men over 40 years of age, considering the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) perspective and a 30-year timeline. The extension of treatment to slow responders provided a 60% increase in the number of individuals who eliminated HCV and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 44,171 BRL/QALY, below the acceptability threshold proposed by World Health Organization. Sensitivity analysis did not alter the results. The inclusion of HCV/ HIV-coinfected slow virologic responders in the treatment protocol is shown to be a cost-effective strategy for the SUS.
