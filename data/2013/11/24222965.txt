Aim:To assess diagnostic accuracy of Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) promoter methylation in body fluids (serum, plasma and whole blood) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Relative information about study characteristics and incidence of RASSF1A methylation was collected. Quality of all included studies was evaluated by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled using a random-effect model, and a summary receiver operating characteristic curve was used to demonstrate the overall diagnostic performance. Positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with 95%CI were also calculated. Meta-regression was applied to analyze observed heterogeneity, and Deeks' test was performed to detect publication bias.Results:After a systematic literature review, seven studies with a total of 302 cases of HCC and 250 cases of chronic liver diseases were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.70 (95%CI: 0.49-0.85) and 0.72 (95%CI: 0.54-0.85), respectively. The PLR was 2.51 (95%CI: 1.64-3.86), NLR was 0.41 (95%CI: 0.25-0.68), and DOR was 6.13 (95%CI: 3.17-11.84). The χ(2) values of sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR and DOR were 59.41 (P 0.05). No significant publication bias was detected by Deeks' test (P = 0.346).Conclusion:We showed the potential diagnostic value of RASSF1A methylation in body fluids in HCC patients and it may improve diagnostic accuracy combined with the α-fetoprotein test.
