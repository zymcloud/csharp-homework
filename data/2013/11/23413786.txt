Aim:Recently, knowledge for indications of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has been robustly accumulated in. For further improvement, risks should be reexamined in recent cases. In this study, we investigated preoperative risk factors in cirrhotic patients who underwent LDLT in recent era.Methods:Seventy-four cirrhotic patients who underwent LDLT at our institution between 2003 and 2011 were included. Recipient and donor age and sex, existence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), preoperative Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride, total cholesterol, serum creatinine, hemoglobin A1c, graft : recipient weight ratio, ABO compatibility and choice of calcineurin inhibitor were analyzed. A proportional hazard model was applied and P Results:In multivariate analysis, recipient age (hazard ratio = 1.188, P = 0.011) and FBG (hazard ratio = 1.009, P = 0.016) showed as significant independent factors. Theoretical mortalities were 9.2%, 21.9% and 51.7% in patients with normal FBG at 55, 60 and 65 years old, respectively, and 34.3% and 53.6% in patients with FBG of 150 and 200 mg/dL, respectively, at 60 years old.Conclusion:Recipient age and FBG remain important risk factors for LDLT in cirrhotic patients even in the recent era. These factors should be considered for selecting liver transplant candidates in cirrhotic patients.
