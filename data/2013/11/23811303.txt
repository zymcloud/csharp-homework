Background & aims:Portal vein embolization (PVE) is a standard technique for patients not amenable to liver resection due to small future liver remnant ratio (FLR). Radiation lobectomy (RL) with (90)Y-loaded microspheres (Y90) is hypothesized to induce comparable volumetric changes in liver lobes, while potentially controlling the liver tumor and limiting tumor progression in the untreated lobe. We aimed at testing this concept by performing a comprehensive time-dependent analysis of liver volumes following radioembolization.Methods:83 patients with right unilobar disease with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; N=67), cholangiocarcinoma (CC; N=8) or colorectal cancer (CRC; N=8) were treated by Y90 RL. The total liver volume, lobar (parenchymal) and tumor volumes, FLR and percentage of FLR hypertrophy from baseline (%FLR hypertrophy) were assessed on pre- and post-Y90 CT/MRI scans in a dynamic fashion.Results:Right lobe atrophy (p=0.003), left lobe hypertrophy (pConclusions:Radiation lobectomy by Y90 is a safe and effective technique to hypertrophy the FLR. Volumetric changes are comparable (albeit slightly slower) to PVE while the right lobe tumor is treated synchronously. This novel technique is of particular interest in the bridge-to-resection setting.
