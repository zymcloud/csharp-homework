Purpose:Although the use of laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer has been widespread, it has remained controversial whether it can be applied for the patients with advanced gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to clarify the safety and usefulness of totally laparoscopic gastrectomy for patients with advanced gastric cancer.Patients and methods:Totally laparoscopic gastrectomy was applied for a total of 38 patients with pStage IB-III advanced gastric cancer at our institute. The surgical and long-term results were analyzed in those patients.Results:Twenty-seven patents underwent distal gastrectomy and 11 patients underwent total gastrectomy. The mean number of dissected lymph nodes was 41 (range, 16-87). The mean length of the operation and amount of blood loss was 324 min and 123 ml, respectively. Two cases of postoperative bleeding were noted, while neither anastomosis-related complications nor in-hospital death was observed. The follow-up period after surgery was 8-72 months. Postoperative recurrence was observed in 6 patients (peritoneal dissemination: 3 patients, pleural dissemination: 1 patient, liver metastasis: 1 patient, ovarian metastasis: 1 patient). The overall survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 94.7%, 76.3% and 76.3%, respectively.Conclusion:Totally laparoscopic gastrectomy is safe and can lead to satisfactory long-term outcomes in cases of advanced gastric cancer. Prospective controlled studies are warranted to confirm our findings.
