Background:Surgical resection is the standard treatment for liver metastases, although for the majority of patients this is not possible. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an alternative local-regional therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of SBRT for secondary liver tumours from a combined multicentre database.Methods:Variables from patients treated with SBRT from four Academic Medical Centres were entered into a common database. Local tumour control and 1-year survival rates were calculated.Results:In total, 153 patients (91 women) 59 ± 8.4 years old with 363 metastatic liver lesions were treated with SBRT. The underlying primary tumour arose from gastrointestinal (GI), retroperitoneal and from extra-abdominal primaries in 56%, 8% and 36% of patients, respectively. Metastases, with a gross tumour volume (GTV) of 138.5 ± 126.8 cm(3) , were treated with a total radiation dose of 37.5 ± 8.2 Gy in 5 ± 3 fractions. The 1-year overall survival was 51% with an overall local control rate of 62% at a mean follow-up of 25.2 ± 5.9 months. A complete tumour response was observed in 32% of patients. Grade 3-5 adverse events were noted in 3% of patients.Conclusion:Secondary liver tumours treated with SBRT had a high rate of local control with a low incidence of adverse events.
