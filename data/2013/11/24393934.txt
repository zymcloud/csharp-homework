We report a case of multiple bilobar hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC) that was successfully treated with a multidisciplinary treatment including preoperative percutaneous isolated hepatic perfusion and hepatectomy. The patient was a 61- year-old man who was detected as having HCC mainly in segment 4 and 8 of the liver and multiple bilobar intrahepatic metastasis during follow-up evaluation for chronic hepatitis B. Curative resection was difficult because the patient had insufficient liver function and because of the location of the tumor. Hence, we performed preoperative percutaneous isolated hepatic perfusion (PIHP) to control the multiple HCC. Seven weeks after the PIHP, the tumor size had reduced, and therefore we performed an extended left hepatic lobectomy. In addition to these treatment modalities, we performed transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) 3 times owing to recurrent HCC in the right liver lobe. Considering that HCC in segment 8 can be treated with TACE, we performed partial hepatectomy. As of the last follow-up visit, the patient was alive without disease recurrence. Thus, preoperative PIHP may improve the resectability rate in patients with multiple bilobar HCC for which curative resection is difficult to perform.
