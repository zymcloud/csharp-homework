Maytenus is the largest genus of the family Celastraceae and the species Maytenus ilicifolia (popularly known as 'Espinheira Santa'). It is widely used in traditional Brazilian medicine to treat stomach conditions including nausea, gastritis, and ulcers. In this study, the apoptotic effects of a spray-dried extract of M. ilicifolia (SDEMI) was evaluated using human hepatocellular cells (HepG2), colorectal carcinoma cells (HT-29), and normal keratinocytes (HaCaT). Cells were treated with SDEMI for 4 and 24 h, then were assayed for levels of apoptosis, caspase-3, and Bcl-2 by flow cytometry, immunostaining, and Western blot, respectively. Significant differences between groups were determined using analysis of variance (P
