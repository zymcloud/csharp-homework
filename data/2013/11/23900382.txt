The left ventricular apical core biopsy performed during implantation of a left ventricular assist device (VAD) is a well-known diagnostic procedure in confirming cardiomyopathies leading to end-stage heart failure. We describe a patient in whom disseminated malignancy was revealed by means of the apical core biopsy after extracorporeal life support and left ventricular assist device implantation as a bridge to transplantation. This case emphasizes the importance of thorough oncological screening before VAD implantation and the possible consequences of circulating tumour cells in this device-assisted circulation.
