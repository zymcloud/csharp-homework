We evaluated the effects of brucine on N-nitrosodiethylamine (DENA)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis was done by intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) followed by promotion with phenobarbital. The rats were exposed to dietary brucine for 4 weeks prior to initiation, and the treatment was continued for 22 consecutive weeks. Brucine decreased the incidence, total number, multiplicity, size and volume of preneoplastic hepatic nodules in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of DENA induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as evidenced by changes in histopathological architecture, increased activity of cytochrome P450, decreased activity of glutathione Stransferase (GST) as well as decreased antioxidant status, enhanced lipid peroxidation, increased liver marker enzymes. Western blot analysis showed decreased expression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 with activation of caspase-3 and increased expression of Bax. Immunohistochemical demonstrated the decreased expression of the PCNA and VEGF. These results indicate that brucine prevents lipid peroxidation and hepatic cell damage and also protects the antioxidant system in DENA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
