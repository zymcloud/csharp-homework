Background:Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL) represents less than 5% of all malignant hepatic tumors in childhood. It is considered an aggressive neoplasm with an unfavorable prognosis. The aim of this paper is to present a single center experience in the treatment of children with UESL.Materials and methods:Ten children with UESL were treated between 1981 and 2012. Age at diagnosis ranged from 4 months to 17 years (median age, 6 years and 9 months). Surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CHT) was performed in 7 patients, and in 3 patients primary surgery was done. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in all 10 patients (CYVADIC, CAV, CAV/ETIF/IF+ADM, CDDP/PLADO). Right hemihepatectomy was performed in 1 patient, extended right hemihepatectomy in 6, and partial resection of the right lobe (segments V-VI, segment V) in 2 patients. One patient with unresectable tumor affecting both lobes was listed for liver transplantation (LTx).Results:Follow-up from diagnosis ranged from 50 to 222 months (mean 138 months). Among 9 patients treated with partial liver resection, distant metastases/local recurrence was not observed in any, and disease-free survival in this group is 100% (9 patients alive). The patient that underwent liver transplantation died of multiorgan failure 4 months postoperatively. However, this patient was misdiagnosed as having hepatoblastoma (HBL) and received PLADO chemotherapy. The overall survival rate is 90%.Conclusion:Excellent results with long-term survival can be achieved in children with UESL with conventional therapy, including a combination of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery, even in large extensively growing tumors.
