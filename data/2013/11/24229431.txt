Background:Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world. However, the molecular pathogenesis of HCC is not well-understood, and the prognosis for patients with HCC remains very poor.Methods:To disclose detailed genetic mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a view toward development of novel therapeutic targets, we analyzed expression profiles HCCs and their corresponding noncancerous tissues by using bioinformatics method.Results:In this paper, we report the identification of genes whose expression has been altered and the changed bio-pathways during hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatoma cells infect intracellular and intercellular signal transduction through Focal adhesion and cause abnormal expression of important intracellular signaling pathway. In addition, it is worth mentioning that some small molecules still restored to the state similar to normal cells, such as bambuterol and lovastatin. This member gene set would serve as a pool of lead gene targets for the identification and development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers to greatly improve the clinical management of HCC patients with different risks of recurrence after curative partial hepatectomy.Conclusions:The study has great significance for gene therapy and pharmacotherapy and provides a new treatment entry point and a potential new clinical drug for HCC patients.
