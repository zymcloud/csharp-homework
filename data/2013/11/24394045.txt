Recurrent esophagus cancer has an extremely poor prognosis in spite of systemic chemotherapy. Herein, we report cases of long survival after recurrence owing to topical treatment. The first patient was a 75-year-old man. He was diagnosed with clinical stage IIA esophagus cancer and underwent subtotal esophagectomy. The pathological stage was IIIB. Liver metastases appeared in S8 and S5, 8 months after surgery. Systemic chemotherapy and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization were performed. He had kept CR but died due to brain metastasis 1 year and 4 months after the recurrence. The second patient was a 68-year-old man. He underwent esophagectomy for clinical stage IIIB esophagus cancer. The pathological stage was also IIIB. Five metastases were seen in the bilateral lobes of the liver 8 months after surgery. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and stereotactic irradiation were performed and he has been in complete remission for a year. Topical treatment may represent an important strategy for treating liver metastasis from esophagus cancer.
