Background:Gadoxetic acid is a recently developed hepatobiliary-specific contrast material used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which enables highly sensitive detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aim:We performed a meta-analysis of all available studies of the diagnostic performance of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI) for detection of HCC in patients with chronic liver disease.Methods:Databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for relevant original articles published from January 2000 to April 2012. Pooled estimation and subgroup analysis data were obtained by statistical analysis.Results:Across 10 studies of 570 patients, Gd-EOB-MRI sensitivity was 0.91 (95 % CI 0.77, 0.97) and specificity was 0.93 (95 % CI 0.85, 0.97). Overall, LR+ was 13.6 (95 % CI 5.6, 33.2), LR- was 0.10 (95 % CI 0.04, 0.27), and DOR was 140.36 (95 % CI 28, 696). Among patients with high pre-test probabilities, MRI enabled confirmation of HCC; among patients with low pre-test probabilities, MRI enabled exclusion of HCC. Worst-case-scenario (pre-test probability, 50 %) post-test probabilities were 93 and 9 % for positive and negative MRI results, respectively. In studies in which both Gd-EOB-MRI and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) were performed, Gd-EOB-MRI was more sensitive than CE-CT (0.93 vs. 0.78; p 2 cm) did not affect the diagnostic accuracy of the test (p > 0.05).Conclusions:A limited number of small studies suggest Gd-EOB-MRI has good diagnostic performance in the detection of HCC among patients with chronic liver disease. It is also confirmed to be a reliable tool for evaluation of small early-stage HCC.
