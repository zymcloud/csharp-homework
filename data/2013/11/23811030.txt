Background & aims:Adherence to antiviral treatment is important to achieve sustained virological response (SVR) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We evaluated the efficiency of a multidisciplinary support programme (MSP), based on published HIV treatment experience, to increase patient adherence and the efficacy of pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin in CHC.Methods:447 patients receiving antiviral treatment were distributed into 3 groups: control group (2003-2004, n=147), MSP group (2005-2006, n=131), and MSP-validation group (2007-2009, n=169). The MSP group included two hepatologists, two nurses, one pharmacist, one psychologist, one administrative assistant, and one psychiatrist. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov model.Results:Adherence and SVR rates were higher in the MSP (94.6% and 77.1%) and MSP-validation (91.7% and 74.6%) groups compared to controls (78.9% and 61.9%) (pConclusions:MSP improves patient compliance and increases the efficiency of antiviral treatment in CHC, being cost-effective.
