Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a component of the replication complex associated with various cellular proteins. It has been reported that G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) is a potential NS5A-binding factor, as identified in a yeast two-hybrid screens of human cDNA library using viral proteins as baits [1]. In this study, we demonstrated the interaction between GPS2 and NS5A in mammalian cells by coimmunoprecipitation analysis and found that both exogenously and endogenously expressed GPS2 interacted with NS5A of genotype 1b and 2a. Mutagenesis study demonstrated that Domain I of NS5A and coiled-coil domain of GPS2 are responsible for the interaction. Knockdown of GPS2 in hepatoma cell lines suppressed the replication of HCV RNA, which can be rescued by the expression of an RNAi-resistant GPS2. Furthermore, overexpression of GPS2 enhanced the association of NS5A with a proviral cellular factor, human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAP-A), while knockdown of GPS2 disrupted interaction between VAP-A and NS5A. Taken together, our results suggest that GPS2 acts as a bridge between NS5A and VAP-A and is required for efficient HCV replication.
