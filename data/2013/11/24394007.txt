We evaluated the surgical outcomes and prognostic factors of primary colorectal cancer with peritoneal dissemination. Between 1990 and 2012, a total of 81 cases of operated primary colorectal cancer with peritoneal dissemination were reviewed. According to the classification by the degree of peritoneal dissemination, the 3-year overall survival rate of patients with P1, P2, and P3 were 22%, 14%, and 16%, respectively. A significant difference was not observed between these 3 groups. According to the degree of surgical curability, the 1-year and 3-year overall survival rates of the patients with curability B were 75% and 30%, respectively. The overall survival rate of patients with curability B was higher than those of curability C (p< 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that the curability of operation (p=0.03) and the existence of hepatic metastases (p=0.01) were significant prognostic factors affecting overall survival. The median relapse-free survival time of patients with curability B was 7.8 months. Nevertheless, long-term survivor cases existed in this group. These findings suggest that complete resection of the primary tumor and metastatic lesions is important to prolong survival term.
