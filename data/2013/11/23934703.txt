Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its associated liver diseases have characteristics of familial clustering in China. However, the reasons for this are not understood fully. To address this issue, the prevalence HBV infection and the characteristics of unfavorable prognoses in clustering of infection in families in northwest China were investigated. Families with clustering of infection and unfavorable prognoses were enrolled, and general information and serum samples were collected. The clinical features and sequelae of HBV infection were compared among the blood relatives (including the first-, second-, and third-degree blood relatives) and spouses using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. A total of 102 clusterings of infection families with unfavorable prognoses were interviewed. In the first-, second-, and third-degree blood relatives and spouses, the prevalences of cirrhosis of the liver were 29.2%, 11.9%, and 8.7%, respectively, while those of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were 21.8%, 1.4%, and 4.3%, respectively (P
