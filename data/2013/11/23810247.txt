Background:The identification of new biomarkers to predict the aggressiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and supplement the current set of prognosis and treatment algorithms is an important clinical need. Extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) circulating in the blood are a new class of highly promising disease markers.Aim:Here we investigated the prognostic potential of miR-1 and miR-122 in sera from patients with HCC.Methods:RNA was extracted from 195 sera of HCC patients and 54 patients with liver cirrhosis, obtained at the time of study enrolment. miR-1 and miR-122 levels were correlated with overall survival (OS), Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, clinical chemistry parameters and tumor specific treatment.Results:Patients with higher miR-1 and miR-122 serum levels showed longer OS than individuals with lower miR-1 and miR-122 serum concentrations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.440, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.233-0.831, P=0.011 for miR-1 and HR 0.493, 95% CI 0.254-0.956, P=0.036 for miR-122, respectively). Serum miR-1 and miR-122 concentrations did not differ significantly between patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis. An age-, sex-, tumor stage and treatment-adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that miR-1 serum levels (HR 0.451, 95% CI 0.228-0.856, P=0.015) were independently associated with OS, whereas serum miR-122 was not. miR-1 serum levels showed no relevant correlation with clinical chemistry liver parameters, whereas serum miR-122 correlated with clinical chemistry parameters of hepatic necroinflammation, liver function and synthetic capacity.Conclusion:Our data indicate that serum miR-1 is a new independent parameter of OS in HCC patients and may therefore improve the predictive value of classical HCC staging scores.
