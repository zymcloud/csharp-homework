The selective induction of apoptosis is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The antitumor effects of oridonin have been reported in several types of malignant tumors. However, the effects of oridonin on MHCC97-H cells, a highly metastatic human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, have not been reported. The present study aimed to determine the effect of oridonin on the apoptosis of MHCC97-H cells and to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that are involved. Compared with the untreated control cells, oridonin significantly decreased (P
