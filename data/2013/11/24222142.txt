Background/aim:the ideal sequence of targeted agents for advanced kidney cancer is still unknown. In the present study we assessed the clinical benefit of two different sequential approaches, namely sorafenib, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORi) and sunitinib, or sunitinib (an mTORi) and sorafenib.Patients and methods:we retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 40 advanced kidney cancer patients treated with one of the two above sequences.Results:a total of 26 patients were treated with the sequence sorafenib-mTORi-sunitinib and 14 with the sequence sunitinib-mTORi-sorafenib. The actuarial overall median progression-free survival (PFS) in the sorafenib-mTORi-sunitinib group and in the sunitinib-mTORi-sorafenib group were 21.9 and 22.8 months, respectively (log-rank test: p=0.928). In the sorafenib-mTORi-sunitinib group, patients in first-, second- and third-line therapy experienced PFS of 11.7, 5.1 and 9.1 months, respectively, while in the sunitinib-mTORi-sorafenib group PFS was 14.4, 4.3, and 3.9 months, respectively.Conclusion:Our results suggest there is no significant difference between the two sequence modalities.
