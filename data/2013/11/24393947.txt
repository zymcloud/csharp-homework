We treated a 41-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease. He experienced leg edema. Following additional examinations, we diagnosed the patient with hepatocellular carcinoma and ascites with liver cirrhosis. Due to renal dysfunction, he could not undergo treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE)or transcatheter arterial infusion(TAI). Therefore, he was treated with specific substance of maruyama(SSM), and survived.
