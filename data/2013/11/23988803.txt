Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) is a minimally invasive procedure used for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinomas. PRFA is regarded as a much safer alternative to surgical resection or orthotopic liver transplantation. However, serious complications, including cardiac tamponade, have been reported. Two cases of severe cardiac tamponade during PRFA were successfully treated.
Cardiac tamponade; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver carcinoma; Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation; Thermoablation.
