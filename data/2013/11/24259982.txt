Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is one of the important complications of glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia) because it can be transformed into hepatocellular carcinoma. Although surgical resection is a standard treatment of choice for solitary HCA, multiple HCAs in GSD-Ia patients present as therapeutic challenges for curative treatment. Therefore, treatment strategy according to malignant potential is important in management of HCAs in GSD-Ia. The authors present a case of histologically proven multiple HCAs without β-catenin mutations occurred in a GSD-Ia patient treated successfully with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation as a minimally invasive therapy.
