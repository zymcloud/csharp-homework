Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prototype tumor wherein angiogenesis plays a vital role in its progression. The role of VEGF, a major angiogenic factor in HCC is known; however, the role of anti-angiogenic factors simultaneously with the angiogenic factors has not been studied before. Hence, in this study, the serum levels of major angiogenic [Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)] and anti-angiogenic (endostatin, angiostatin) factors were analyzed and correlated with clinico-radiological features and with outcome. A total of 150 patients (50 HCC, 50 cirrhosis and 50 chronic hepatitis) and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of VEGF, Ang-2, endostatin, and angiostatin were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HCC shows significantly elevated serum levels of angiogenic factors VEGF and Ang-2 and of anti-angiogenic factors endostatin and angiostatin. ROC curve analysis for serum VEGF yielded an optimal cut-off value of 225.14 pg/ml, with a sensitivity of 78 % and specificity of 84.7 % for a diagnosis of HCC and its distinction from other group. Using this value, the univariate and multivariate analysis revealed significantly poor outcome in patients with higher levels of serum VEGF (p = 0.009). Combinatorial analysis revealed that patients with higher levels of both angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors showed poor outcome. Serum VEGF correlates with poor survival of HCC patients and, therefore, serves as a non-invasive biomarker of poor prognosis. Moreover, elevated levels of anti-angiogenic factors occur endogenously in HCC patients.
