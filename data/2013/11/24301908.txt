We conducted a case-control study of a possible association of miR-499A>G rs3746444 and miR-146aG>C rs2910164 with risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Samples from 172 hepatocellular carcinoma patients and 185 cancer-free controls were collected from October 2008 to December 2011. PCR-RFLP analysis was performed to determine the polymorphisms in each individual. The MAFs of miR-146aG>C and miR-499A>G in controls were similar to that known from the SNP database, and frequencies of genotypes in controls were in line with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We found that miR-499 AG was significantly associated with decreased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with miR-499 AA genotype (adjusted odds ration = 0.74, 95% confidence interval = 0.24-0.96). However, subjects carrying miR-146a GG had a non-significant 0.62-fold decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. We did not find a significant association of miR-146aG>C rs2910164 and miR-499A>G rs3746444 polymorphisms with hepatocellular carcinoma risk in the Chinese population. Further investigations are warranted to clarify the relationship between miRNA polymorphisms and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma risk in various ethnic populations.
