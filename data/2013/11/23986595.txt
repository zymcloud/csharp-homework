Hepatitis C virus (HCV) orchestrates the different stages of its life cycle in time and space through the sequential participation of HCV proteins and cellular machineries; hence, these represent tractable molecular host targets for HCV elimination by combination therapies. We recently identified multifunctional Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1 or YBX1) as an interacting partner of NS3/4A protein and HCV genomic RNA that negatively regulates the equilibrium between viral translation/replication and particle production. To identify novel host factors that regulate the production of infectious particles, we elucidated the YB-1 interactome in human hepatoma cells by a quantitative mass spectrometry approach. We identified 71 YB-1-associated proteins that included previously reported HCV regulators DDX3, heterogeneous nuclear RNP A1, and ILF2. Of the potential YB-1 interactors, 26 proteins significantly modulated HCV replication in a gene-silencing screening. Following extensive interaction and functional validation, we identified three YB-1 partners, C1QBP, LARP-1, and IGF2BP2, that redistribute to the surface of core-containing lipid droplets in HCV JFH-1-expressing cells, similarly to YB-1 and DDX6. Importantly, knockdown of these proteins stimulated the release and/or egress of HCV particles without affecting virus assembly, suggesting a functional YB-1 protein complex that negatively regulates virus production. Furthermore, a JFH-1 strain with the NS3 Q221L mutation, which promotes virus production, was less sensitive to this negative regulation, suggesting that this HCV-specific YB-1 protein complex modulates an NS3-dependent step in virus production. Overall, our data support a model in which HCV hijacks host cell machinery containing numerous RNA-binding proteins to control the equilibrium between viral RNA replication and NS3-dependent late steps in particle production.
