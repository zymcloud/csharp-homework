Aim:Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) around IL-28B and interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression are predictors of response to standard therapy involving IFN for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We analyzed the association between these predictors to improve the prediction of the response to IFN therapy after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Data were collected from 74 patients with HCV-induced HCC. The IL-28B genotype and hepatic ISG mRNA levels were analyzed to clarify their association, focusing on the progression of liver fibrosis.Results:Fifty patients were identified as having major alleles (rs8099917 TT) and the remaining 24 patients had minor alleles (rs8099917 TG or GG). Hepatic ISG15 expression was lower in the IL-28B major group than that in the IL-28B minor group (P Conclusion:Hepatic ISG15 expression is associated with IL-28B polymorphisms, while IP-10 is strongly affected by liver fibrosis.
