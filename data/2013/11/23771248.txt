Background:Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection induces persistent but ineffective immune activation that contributes to necroinflammation, fibrosis, and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to determine the relationship of intrahepatic total HBV (ih HBV) DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) with necroinflammation and fibrosis, and their impact on prognosis after resection in HBV HCC patients.Methods:Data are from 111 patients treated with primary liver resection for HBV HCC at Mount Sinai, New York (1991-2008). ih HBV DNA and cccDNA were quantitated by real-time PCR. Necroinflammation was graded according to histologic activity index (HAI), and liver fibrosis was staged by the modified Ishak method.Results:A total of 106 (95%) and 89 patients (80%) had detectable ih HBV DNA and cccDNA, respectively, while 43% had detectable serum HBV DNA. cccDNA made up a small proportion of ih HBV DNA (median cccDNA/ih HBV DNA ratio = 0.022). Higher levels of ih HBV DNA were associated with higher HAI and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), while a lower ratio of cccDNA/ih HBV DNA was associated with higher HAI, ALT, and Ishak fibrosis stage. ih HBV and cccDNA were not associated with survival, but the lowest quintile of cccDNA/ih HBV DNA ratio (Conclusions:A lower cccDNA/ih HBV DNA ratio was associated with greater necroinflammation and liver fibrosis, and was independently associated with poor overall survival. Thus, intracellular virus loads and relative proportions of virus DNA reflect histologic damage in the liver and influence the clinical outcome of HBV HCC patients.
