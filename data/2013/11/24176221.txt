Background:Lup-20(29)-en-3H-ol (Lupeol), a dietary triterpene, has been shown to possess multiple pharmacological activities including anti-tumor effectsMethods:In the current study, we noted that low doses of lupeol (Results:The results demonstrated that lupeol and S14161 could exert a synergistic antitumor effect resulting in chemo-sensitization of HCC to low doses of lupeol. Using an in vivo HCC model, we further demonstrated that lupeol and S14161 synergistically inhibited tumor growth without any adverse effects on body weightConclusion:Our studies showed that the activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway resulted in the tumor-promoting effect with low doses of lupeol. Combining PI3-kinase inhibitor with lupeol could synergistically augment the anti-tumor effect of lupeol and might be an applicable strategy for HCC therapy.
