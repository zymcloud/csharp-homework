Novel liposomes composed of L-Î±-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and trehalose surfactant (DMTreCn) were produced by the method of sonication in buffer solution. The thickness of fixed aqueous layer of DMTreCn was larger than that of DMPC liposomes and increased in a dose-dependent manner. The remarkable inhibitory effects of DMTreCn on the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Hep-G2 and HuH-7) cells were obtained along with apoptosis, without affecting the growth of normal cells. DMTreCn induced apoptosis of Hep-G2 and HuH-7 cells through the activation of caspase-3, 8 and 9. Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of Bcl-2 family protein (BAX) were recorded, indicating that DMTreCn induced apoptosis of Hep-G2 and HuH-7 cells through mitochondrial pathway via BAX. It is noteworthy that the remarkable inhibitory effects of DMTreCn on the growth of human HCC cells were obtained along with apoptosis for the first time.
