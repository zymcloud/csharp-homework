The patient was a 57-year-old man who was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The tumor, 13 cm in diameter, occupied almost the entire right lobe and directly permeated the gallbladder. In addition, invasion of the portal vein umbilical region was seen from an inside area progress department. Because of the small remnant liver volume due to 3 procedures for right area excision and because liver failure was a concern after the operation, we decided to perform extended right hepatectomy for which we retained one S4 Glisson's capsule. Radiotherapy was planned for portal vein tumor thrombus after the operation. We started radiotherapy( 2.0 Gy√ó25) on postoperative day 14, and the patient was discharged without complications on postoperative day 55. We initiated the internal administration of tegafur-uraci(l UFT 400 mg/day) on postoperative day 44 and continued the treatment for half a year; however, metastasis was frequently noted in the lungs on computed tomography (CT) at 9 months after the operation. We administered low-dose 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin( FP, intravenous) therapy combined with sorafenib( 800 mg/day), and the patient is being followed up. No recurrence has been noted in the liver at 16 months after the operation.
