Here, we report the efficacy of dual treatment with hepatic resection and percutaneous isolated hepatic perfusion (PIHP) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC). Recently, we introduced treatment with combined particle therapy and PIHP for unresectable HCC in cases of insufficient liver function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PIHP for local control in the liver after particle therapy. From 2006 to 2013, 6 patients underwent particle therapy for the main lesion and subsequent PIHP for remnant liver lesions. Their mean age was 64 years, and the mean size of the main lesion was 6.2 cm (range, 2.0-10.8 cm). All patients had liver cirrhosis. After particle therapy, PIHP was performed by hepatic arterial infusion of 100 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and 30 mg/m2 of mitomycin C. With regard to side effects, neutropenia occurred in all patients but no serious hepatobiliary injury was observed. The response rate for PIHP was 50% (partial response: 3 and stable disease: 3). The mean overall survival time was 26.9 months after particle therapy. In conclusion, even after particle therapy, PIHP is a safe treatment and is associated with a good local control rate for remnant HCCs. Further accumulation of data is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment strategy in terms of prognosis.
