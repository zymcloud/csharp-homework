Metastatic spine disease (MSD) is a complex disease entity requiring multi-discipline and multi-modality approach to obtain the most reasonable clinical outcomes. As one of these trials, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been tried. Here, we describe four cases of metastatic spine lesions (2 hepatomas, 1 lung cancer, 1 breast cancer) that were treated with intraoperative RFA to control the lesion and to limit tumor contamination. During 3-month follow-up, most patients experienced effective pain relief and improvement of their functional status. However, their final results were diverse. There were no complications related to this procedure. In two cases, the treated lesions were re-evaluated radiologically using PET-CT and diffusion-weighted MRI. Up to the time of this report, the patients are well without progressive deterioration of the treated lesion. With review of the related literatures, we discuss the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic approach as one of options for the treatment of MSD with neurologic manifestations.
