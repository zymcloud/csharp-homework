Background:Associations between transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk remained controversial. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to investigate these associations.Methods:We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases for studies before March 2013. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the strength of association.Results:A total of 14 studies were included in this meta-analysis. TGF-β1 +869C/T polymorphism was significantly associated with HCC risk (OR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.22-2.47, p=0.002). In addition, a significant association between -509C/T polymorphism and HCC risk was observed (OR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.15-1.70, p=0.0007). Furthermore, significant associations between these polymorphisms and HCC risk were found in Asians and population-based studies.Conclusions:Our meta-analysis suggested that the TGF-β1 +869C/T and -509C/T polymorphisms may be risk factors for developing HCC.
