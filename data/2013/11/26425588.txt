Spontaneous hepatic hemorrhage is a rare condition that may be caused by an underlying hepatic tumor, most commonly hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatic adenoma. A spontaneous rupture of a hepatic metastasis from a gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor is also extremely rare, and the majority of affected patients present with hypovolemic shock or an acute abdomen. In this article, we report the case of a 65-year-old man with a spontaneous rupture of a hepatic metastasis from a gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor that presented as hypovolemic shock. Cross-sectional imaging studies (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) play a significant role in the diagnosis of this condition and guides its management.
