A 69-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis B and esophageal varices was admitted to our hospital because of a hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC) measuring 3 cm in segment S3. Computed tomography( CT) scan revealed splenomegaly, and the platelet count was 6.0×104/μL. Partial hepatectomy and splenectomy were performed sequentially under laparoscopic guidance in a right half-lateral decubitus position, using 7 working ports. The operation time was 237 min, and the amount of bleeding was 26 mL. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the 10th day after the operation.
