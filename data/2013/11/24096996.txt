Gallbladder carcinoma is characterized by poor prognosis. It spreads by direct, lymphatic, vascular, neural, intraperitoneal, and intraductal routes. The most commonly involved organ is the liver followed by regional lymph nodes. Extra-abdominal metastases are comparatively rare. We present a case of solitary breast metastasis from recurrent gallbladder carcinoma mimicking a primary breast cancer in (18)F-FDG PET/CT.
