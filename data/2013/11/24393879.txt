We examined the clinical course of patients with multiple liver metastases (≥10) from colorectal cancer after hepatectomy. Of 455 patients, 336 patients had 1-4 metastases, 71 had 5-9 metastases, and 48 had ≥10 metastases (31 patients had undergone chemotherapy along with hepatectomy and 17 had not undergone chemotherapy). Chemotherapy was effective in improving the 5-year survival rate of patients with 5 or more metastases. The 5-year survival rate in patients who underwent hepatectomy along with chemotherapy (52.7%[1-4 metastases], 49.9%[5-9 metastases], and 42.3% [≥10; n=5]) was better than that in patients who did not undergo chemotherapy( 56.1%[not significant: ns], 13.1% [p=0.0003], and 0%[p<0.0001], respectively). Five patients with ≥10 liver metastases survived for 5 years after hepatectomy, of which, 1 received FOLFOX (Leucovorin plus 5-FU plus oxaliplatin) adjuvant chemotherapy, 2 received preoperative FOLFOX, and 2 received LV5FU2 (5-FU plus Leucovorin) hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. Our results suggest that long-term improvement in prognosis could be possible with aggressive repeat hepatectomy along with effective chemotherapy.
