Background:Previously, we proposed expanded selection criteria for liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the Kyoto criteria, involving a combination of tumor number ≤10, maximal diameter of each tumor ≤5 cm, and serum des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin levels ≤400 mAU/mL, and we have used these criteria since January 2007. In the present study, the usefulness of the criteria was validated prospectively as well as retrospectively.Methods:One hundred ninety-eight patients with HCC who underwent living donor LT (LDLT) from February 1999 through December 2011 were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and recurrence rates were investigated in patients classified according to the Kyoto criteria, the Milan criteria, or previous treatments for HCC. Tumor biological aggressiveness, including microvascular invasion and histologic differentiation, according to selection criteria was also examined.Results:The 5-year overall survival for patients within the Kyoto criteria (n = 147; 82%) was greater than that for the 49 patients exceeding them (n = 49; 42%; P Conclusion:The Kyoto criteria are useful expanded criteria for LDLT for HCC and could help to achieve favorable outcomes.
