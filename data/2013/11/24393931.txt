We report a case of multiple intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC) that was successfully treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization( TACE) and sorafenib therapy. A 73-year-old man was diagnosed as having multiple intrahepatic recurrence in segment 2 (S2) and segment 7 (S7) of the liver on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans 4 years after he underwent liver resection. He was treated with 5 cycles of TACE. Two years and 6 months after the initial TACE, we found that the patient had become refractory to TACE, and therefore, we initiated sorafenib therapy. The response to treatment was stable disease (SD) for 9 months, but the patient's tumor marker levels increased and the tumor gradually increased. Therefore, he underwent additional TACE for the intrahepatic lesions. The patient is still alive with recurrences 4 years and 8 months after the initial recurrence.
