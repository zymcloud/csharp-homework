Case 1: Case 1 involved a 42-year-old woman who had been diagnosed as having advanced breast cancer (Stage III B). She had previously received 6 courses of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and 5-fluorouracil CEF, 14 courses of weekly paclitaxel, and 2 courses of vinorelbine( VNR). After the courses of chemotherapy, she underwent modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Two years after surgery, lung metastases were found, and the patient received 6 courses of weekly paclitaxel and 13 courses of nab-paclitaxel. However, the lung metastases progressed after the courses of chemotherapy, and therefore, we decided to administer eribulin as third-line chemotherapy. Eribulin was effective against the lung metastases for more than 1 year. Case 2: Case 2 involved a 52-year-old woman who had been diagnosed as having Stage IIB breast cancer. She had received 4 courses of CEF and 4 courses of docetaxel as neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, she underwent breast-conserving surgery with axillary lymph node dissection. Five years postoperatively, multiple liver metastases were found, and the patient received 3 courses. However, the liver metastases progressed after this chemotherapy. Subsequently, we administered nab-paclitaxel; however, it produced severe side effects. We then decided to administer eribulin as second-line chemotherapy. Eribulin was effective against the liver metastases for more than 1 year.
