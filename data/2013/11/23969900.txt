Although most hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is related to viral infection, there is a substantial population of HCC patients (5-20%) who are negative for both markers of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection [non-B, non-C (NBNC) hepatitis] in Japan and the incidence of NBNC-HCC has recently tended to increase. The most common cause of liver disease in developed countries is non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which includes non‑alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its related complications. Increased body mass index and diabetes mellitus are associated with developing NAFLD and NASH, which is a severe form of NAFLD. Furthermore, increasing clinical evidence supports the fact that NAFLD and NASH can progress to liver cirrhosis and even HCC. A detailed understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, molecular mechanism, clinical features and prognosis of NBNC-HCC could improve our screening and therapy of this disease. In this review, we primarily focus on clinical aspects of NBNC-HCC and refer to our current knowledge of this cancer.
