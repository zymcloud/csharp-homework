Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and the management of HCC has radically changed in recent years. Over the last few years, many elderly patients have been considered less amenable to effective treatments compared to younger patients, due to the accumulation of different diseases during their lives. This assumption has now been reviewed and some key points have been outlined such as the necessity of a careful selection of patients, which may lead to satisfactory results after the treatment of elderly patients with HCC. The purpose of this study was to make a comprehensive analysis of results from the literature concerning the multimodal treatment of HCC in elderly patients, analyzing the therapeutic options such as liver resection, ablative treatments, liver transplantation and targeted chemotherapy.
