Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be derived from malignant transformed adult hepatic progenitor cells. However, the regulatory factors and molecular mechanisms underlying the process are not well defined. Our previous microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis revealed a significant decrease of miR-200a level in F344 rat HCC side population (SP) fraction cells versus their normal counterparts. In the present study, we further investigated the effect of miR-200a on hepatic oval cell (HOC) phenotypes. We first confirmed downregulated miR-200a levels in rat hepatoma cells compared with WB-F344 cells. Next, by lentivirus-mediated loss-of-function studies, we showed that stable knockdown of miR-200a confers a mesenchymal phenotype to WB-F344 cells, including an elongated cell morphology, enhanced cell migration ability and expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-representative markers. Concomitantly, several cancer stem cell (CSC)-like traits appeared in these cells, which exhibit enhanced spheroid-forming capacity, express putative hepatic CSC markers and display superior resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assays and western blot analysis identified β-catenin (CTNNB1) as a direct and functional target of miR-200a. Knockdown of miR-200a partially activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and silencing of β-catenin functionally attenuated anti-miR-200a effects in vitro in WB-F344 cells. At length, in vivo xenograft assay demonstrated the acquisition of tumorigenicity of WB-F344 cells after miR-200a siliencing. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-200a may function as an important regulatory factor in neoplastic transition of HOCs by targeting the β-catenin pathway.
