Purpose:This study aimed at investigating the safety of hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in obese patients with cirrhosis in Japan.Methods:We reviewed the clinical records of 202 patients with liver cirrhosis, who underwent hepatic resection for HCC between January, 2001 and August, 2011. The patients were divided into three groups according to their body mass index (BMI): the normal body weight (BMI Results:The normal body weight, obese class I, and obese class II groups comprised 138 (68.3 %), 55 (27.2 %), and 9 (4.5 %) patients, respectively. The incidence of non-B non-C cirrhosis was higher in the obese class II group (22 %) than in the normal body weight group (14 %, p = 0.034). Intraoperative blood loss tended to be higher in the obese class II patients than in the other two groups. Postoperative complications and mortality did not differ significantly among the three groups. According to multivariate analysis, obesity was not a risk factor for postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification Grade III or higher) or mortality.Conclusion:Hepatic resection for HCC can be performed safely in obese patients with cirrhosis.
