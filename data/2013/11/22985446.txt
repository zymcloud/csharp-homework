Introduction:Hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia is a common complication of cirrhosis with portal hypertension. We evaluated the role of splenectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in terms of the improvement of biochemical indices and liver volume.Methods:Nineteen patients with HCC underwent liver resection and splenectomy from January 2000 to December 2009. Thirty-nine patients who underwent liver resection during the same period were enrolled as case-matched controls. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. We analysed the results of biochemical tests, disease-free survival and overall survival and measured the liver volume before and at 90 days after operation.Results:Preoperative white blood cell counts (P = 0.001), platelet counts (P = 0.021), total bilirubin (P â‰¤ 0.001) and prothrombin time by international normalized ratio (P = 0.043) were significantly different. However, these results had converged to similar levels 90 days after the operation. The degree of increment in liver volume were similar (P = 0.763). In splenectomy group, portal vein thrombosis developed in eight patients and all patients except one recovered using only conservative treatments. There was an operative mortality because of liver failure by thrombosis.Conclusions:Although splenectomy may induce thrombosis, liver failure and subsequent mortality, splenectomy may improve liver function and expand the indication of liver resection if postoperative management is conducted conservatively.
