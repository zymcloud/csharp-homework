Background:The aim of this study was to characterize changes in outcome following hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) over a 30-year period.Patients and methods:The clinical records of 372 patients who underwent a macroscopic curative hepatectomy for treatment of HCC between 1980 and 2009 were retrospectively examined. Patients were divided into two groups: an early group (1980-2000) and a late group (2001-2009). The relationship between the chronological treatment period and the surgical outcomes was investigated.Results:The disease-free survival (DFS) was comparable between the early and late groups (at 5 years: 30.3% vs. 31.2%, p=0.526), however, the overall survival (OS) of the late group was significantly better than the one of the early group (at 5 years: 80.1% vs. 50.4%, pConclusion:The results of hepatectomy for HCC have improved over time by use of various combination therapies after initial HCC recurrence. A repeat hepatectomy may be an acceptable treatment option for HCC recurrence in selected patients.
