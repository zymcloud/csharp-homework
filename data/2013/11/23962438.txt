Purpose:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of modified cisplatin-based transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for inoperable hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) larger than 5 cm in diameter, and the factors associated with tumor response and survival.Materials and methods:From January 2007 to November 2009, 163 patients who underwent modified cisplatin-based chemoembolization for inoperable large HCCs were evaluated. Predominant tumors were as large as 25 cm (median, 8.6 cm). Seventy-nine patients had a solitary tumor, and 84 had two or more tumors. Tumor response was evaluated per modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors.Results:After chemoembolization, 65% of patients showed a tumor response. On multivariate analysis, tumor size (P Conclusions:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is safe and effective for large HCCs. Tumor size and PV invasion are significant predictors of tumor response and, Child-Pugh class A disease, surgical resection after chemoembolization, RF ablation after chemoembolization, and tumor response are good prognostic factors for survival.
