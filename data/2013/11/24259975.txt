Aim:To elucidate the variety of ways early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can appear on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging by analyzing T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and gadolinium-enhanced dynamic studies.Methods:Seventy-three patients with well-differentiated HCC (wHCC) or dysplastic nodules were retrospectively identified from medical records, and new histological sections were prepared and reviewed. The tumor nodules were categorized into three groups: dysplastic nodule (DN), wHCC compatible with Edmondson-Steiner grade I HCC (w1-HCC), and wHCC compatible with Edmondson-Steiner grade II HCC (w2-HCC). The signal intensity on pre-contrast MR imaging and the enhancing pattern for each tumor were recorded and compared between the three tumor groups.Results:Among the 73 patients, 14 were diagnosed as having DN, 40 were diagnosed as having w1-HCC, and 19 were diagnosed as having w2-HCC. Hyperintensity measurements on T2-weighted axial images (T2WI) were statistically significant between DNs and wHCC (P = 0.006) and between DN and w1-HCC (P = 0.02). The other imaging features revealed no significant differences between DN and wHCC or between DN and w1-HCC. Hyperintensity on both T1W out-phase imaging (P = 0.007) and arterial enhancement on dynamic study (P = 0.005) showed statistically significant differences between w1-HCC and w2-HCC. The other imaging features revealed no significant differences between w1-HCC and w2-HCC.Conclusion:In the follow-up for a cirrhotic nodule, increased signal intensity on T2WI may be a sign of malignant transformation. Furthermore, a noted loss of hyperintensity on T1WI and the detection of arterial enhancement might indicate further progression of the histological grade.
