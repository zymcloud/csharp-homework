Purpose:The role of infiltrating B cells in hepatocellular carcinoma has been overlooked for many years. This study is aimed to delineate the distribution, prognostic value, and functional status of B cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma.Experimental design:Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the distribution and clinical significance of infiltrating CD20(+) B cells in a series of 120 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The results were further tested in an independent series of 200 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The functional status of CD20(+) B cells was determined by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and in vitro coculture assay.Results:Infiltrating CD20(+) B cells were predominantly concentrated in the tumor invasive margin, compared with the peri- and intratumor areas. High density of margin-infiltrating B lymphocytes (MIL-B) positively correlated with small tumor size, absence of vascular invasion, and increased density of CD8(+) T cells (P Conclusions:The profile of CD20(+) B cells in situ is a new predictor of prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and provides a novel target for an optimal immunotherapy against this fatal malignancy.
