Background:Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is an ideal tool for noninvasive, quantitative monitoring of tumor progression/regression in animal models. The effectiveness of different treatment strategies is displayed by an altered intensity of bioluminescence, demonstrating a change of the tumor burden. The aim of this study was to establish a reliable, reproducible colorectal hepatic metastases cancer animal model.Methods:Cells of the human colon carcinoma cell line HCT-116 Luc(pos) expressing the firefly luciferase enzyme gene were used. HCT-116 Luc(pos) cells (2.5 Ã— 10(6)) were injected through the portal vein into the liver of immunoincompetent nude mice. BLI was used to analyze intrahepatic tumor burden and growth kinetic.Results:HCT-116 Luc(pos) cells demonstrated a progressive and reproducible growth in the liver after intraportal injection. Four days after injection, the animals were analyzed for tumor growth by BLI, and mice without or too low bioluminescence signals were excluded (between 10% and 20% animals). HCT-116 Luc(pos) intrahepatic tumors responded successfully to different dosages (5 and 10 mg/kg) of 5-fluorouracil.Conclusions:BLI is an important tool with many potential advantages for investigators. The measurement of intrahepatic tumor growth by imaging luciferase activity noninvasively provides valuable information on tumor burden and effectiveness of therapy. Thus, the presented intrahepatic metastases model based on the growth of HCT-116 Luc(pos) cells is suitable for in vivo testing of different cancer therapy strategies.
