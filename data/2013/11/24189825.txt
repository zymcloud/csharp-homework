A 69-year-old female was referred to our hospital with hematochezia. Dynamic computed tomography demonstrated a large tumor with rim enhancement and central necrosis that invaded into the transverse colon. The tumor was resected, and histopathological examination revealed mixed adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma with partial abscess formation. On the basis of a literature review and the findings from the present case, rim enhancement with central necrosis on imaging appears to be characteristic of this disease.
