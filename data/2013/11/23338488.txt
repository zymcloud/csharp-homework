Background:Our aim was to determine how well ablative margin (AM) grading assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ferucarbotran administered prior to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) predicts local tumor progression in comparison with enhanced computed tomography (CT).Methods:101 hepatocellular carcinomas were treated by RFA after ferucarbotran administration. We performed T2*-weighted MRI after 1 week and enhanced CT after 1 month. The assessment was categorized in three grades: AM(+): high-intensity area with continuous low-intensity rim; AM zero: high-intensity area with discontinuous low-intensity rim; and AM(-): high-intensity area extending beyond the low-intensity rim.Results:AM(+), AM zero, AM(-) and indeterminable were found in 47, 36, 8 and 10 nodules, respectively. The overall agreement rate between MRI and enhanced CT for the diagnosis of AM was 71.3%. The Îº coefficient was 0.523 (p Conclusion:AM assessment by MRI using ferucarbotran can predict local tumor progression after RFA and enable early and less invasive diagnosis.
