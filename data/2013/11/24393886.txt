A 76-year-old woman was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC), and partial hepatectomy was performed in 2007. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed for recurrent HCCs in 2009. Ileocecal resection was performed for peritoneal dissemination of HCC localized in the ileocecal area, and sorafenib therapy was initiated in October 2009. TACE was performed for recurrent HCCs in December 2009 and March 2010. Positron emission tomography( PET) revealed a solitary intrahepatic recurrent HCC and left ovarian metastasis, and partial hepatectomy and left ovariectomy were performed in June 2010. Multiple lung metastases were detected, and systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin was initiated in February 2011. The lung metastatic tumors disappeared after 3 courses of treatment. The patient is disease free at 2 years after treatment. We encountered a case of advanced recurrent HCC is which complete response (CR) was achieved with multimodality therapy using sorafenib and surgical treatment.
