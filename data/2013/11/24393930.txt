A 44-year-old man with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was admitted to our institution. Abdominal computed tomography( CT) revealed diffuse HCC in the right lobe, with a tumor thrombus in the main trunk and contralateral branch of the portal vein. Right lobectomy and tumor thrombectomy were performed. Three months later, oral tegafur-uraci( l UFT) administration( 300 mg/day) was initiated. Twelve months after surgery, intrahepatic recurrence was detected on CT scans. Therefore, the patient was treated with transcatheter arterial infusion( TAI) and percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT). Since then, no evidence of HCC recurrence has been noted for 46 months after the initial treatment.
