Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a lymphoproliferative disorder secondary to chronic immunosuppression and is the most common malignancy in transplanted patients [Kamdar et al. Curr Opin Organ Transplant, 2011; 16:274-280]. Although PTLD usually presents as B or T cell lymphoma, plasmacytomas have been reported, mostly in the adult population. Six cases of pediatric plasmacytoma-like PTLD have been reported, all of which were treated with vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD), high dose dexamethasone alone, or dexamethasone + thalidomide [Tcheng et al. Pediatric Blood Cancer, 2006; 47:218-223; Perry et al. Blood, 2013; 8:1377-1383]. We present two cases of pediatric plasmacytoma-like PTLD in combined liver and small bowel transplant patients both successfully treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone based on multiple myeloma protocols [Kyle and Rajkumar, Clin Lymphoma Myeloma, 2009; 9:278-288; Adams and Kaufmann, Cancer Invest, 2004; 22:304-311].
