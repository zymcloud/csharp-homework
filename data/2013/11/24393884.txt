Case 1 involved a 63-year-old woman who had multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) associated with hepatitis C virus infection. She was treated with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), followed by oral administration of sorafenib (200 mg/day). However, a lesion on the left lateral segment of the liver enlarged rapidly. Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed combined hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma. Case 2 involved a 54-year-old man who had multiple recurrent HCCs associated with hepatitis C virus infection after undergoing hepatectomy twice. Oral administration of sorafenib (200 mg/day) was initiated. The intrahepatic lesions decreased in size, but metastasis in an enlarged lymph node behind the portal vein was suspected. Laparoscopic partial hepatectomy and lymph node dissection were performed. HCC metastasis in the lymph node and partial necrosis in the intrahepatic lesions were identified histopathologically. Case 3 involved a 56- year-old man who had multiple recurrent HCCs associated with hepatitis C virus infection. TACE was performed thrice, and oral administration of sorafenib( 400-600 mg/day) was initiated. The lesion in the right lateral segment of the liver decreased in size but lesions in the left lateral segment were enlarged. Therefore, laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy was performed.
