Recent data suggest an association of serum ferritin (SF) with waiting list (WL) and postliver transplant (LT) outcomes. To assess the predictive capacity of SF on pre- and post-LT outcomes, and to identify whether recipient or donor liver siderosis is associated with post-LT survival; a retrospective analysis of 1079 patients assessed for first LT, 2000-2007 was performed. Iron deposition in the liver tissue was assessed using a semi-quantitative grading system. Median age was 54 (18-82) years and 67% were male. Seventeen per cent had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Median Model for End-stage Liver Disease MELD score was 14 (6-40), ferritin was 174 μg/l (4-4597) with 36.5% had a SF ≥ μg/l. Age (OR = 1.028) and MELD score (OR = 1.158) were independently associated with WL mortality (P
