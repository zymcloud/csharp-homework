We have proposed risk factors for tumor recurrence, such as tumor nodule ≥ 5 cm and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin ≥ 300 mAU/mL after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to clarify the risk factors for HCC recurrence and mortality within our criteria. We enrolled 152 adult recipients who had undergone LDLT for end-stage liver disease with HCC who met our criteria. The recurrence-free survival rates after LDLT were calculated. Risk factors for tumor recurrence were identified. On univariate analysis, factors affecting recurrence-free survival were pretransplant treatment for HCC, neutrophil-to-lumphocyte ratio (NLR) >4, alpha-fetoprotein ≥ 400 ng/mL, ≥ 5 nodules, and bilobar tumor distribution. Multivariate analysis identified that NLR >4 and ≥ 5 nodules were independent risk factors for tumor recurrence after LDLT (P = .003 and P = .002, respectively). Two-step selection criteria enable selection of patients who have high-risk of tumor recurrence.
