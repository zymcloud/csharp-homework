Discovering differentially expressed proteins in various biological samples requires proteome quantification methods with accuracy, precision, and wide dynamic range. This study describes a mass defect-based pseudo-isobaric dimethyl labeling (pIDL) method based on the subtle mass defect differences between (12)C/(13)C and (1)H/(2)H. Lys-C protein digests were labeled with CD2O/(13)CD2O and reduced with NaCNBD3/NaCNBH3 as heavy and light isotopologues, respectively. The fragment ion pairs with mass differences of 5.84 mDa were resolved by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and used for quantification. The pIDL method described here resulted in highly accurate and precise quantification results with approximately 100-fold dynamic range. Furthermore, the pIDL method was extended to 4-plex proteome quantification and applied to the quantitative analysis of proteomes from Hca-P and Hca-F, two mouse hepatocarcinoma ascites syngeneic cell lines with low and high lymph node metastasis rates.
