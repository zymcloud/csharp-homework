Background:The role of clinically significant portal hypertension on the prognosis of cirrhotic patients undergoing hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is debated.Aims:In this study, our aim was to assess the role of clinically significant portal hypertension after hepatic resection for HCC in patients with cirrhosis.Methods:We assessed the prognostic role of the presence of clinically significant portal hypertension (oesophageal/gastric varices/portal hypertensive gastropathy or a platelet count Results:Median survival was similar in patients with and without clinically significant portal hypertension (79 vs 77 months, P = 0.686). Child-Pugh score 5 was the only variable significantly associated with survival by Cox multiple regression (P = 0.007). In Child-Pugh score 5 patients with single HCC ≤ 5 cm or in those with single HCC ≤ 2 cm and normal bilirubin, there was no survival difference between patients with and without clinically significant portal hypertension (median survival: 94 vs 78 months, P = 0.121 and >100 vs 86 months, P = 0.742).Conclusions:Presence of clinically significant portal hypertension has no influence on survival of patients with well-compensated cirrhosis undergoing hepatic resection for HCC.
