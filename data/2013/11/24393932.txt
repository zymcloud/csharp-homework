A 59-year-old man was diagnosed as having hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) from the left branch to the main trunk and multiple liver tumors in the right lobe. He first underwent 8 courses of fluorouracil arterial infusion and interferon therapy( FAIT).The PVTT shrunk following combination therapy; however, the liver tumors were enlarged and metastasis was noted in the right adrenal gland. Treatment with sorafenib was initiated. Ten months later, additional reduction of PVTT was noted with no changes in the multiple liver tumors. After confirmation of sufficient portal flow, we performed transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).After having undergone, in total, 4 rounds of TACE with sorafenib, the patient underwent radiofrequency ablation( RFA) for the right adrenal gland metastasis. The patient is still alive, in good health. Our findings from this case suggest that, in some patients having advanced HCC with PVTT, long- term survival can be achieved when the intrahepatic lesions are controlled by various adequate therapies.
