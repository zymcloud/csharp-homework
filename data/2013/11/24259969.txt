Aim:To investigate whether an ablative margin (AM) > 1.0 cm might reduce chance of recurrence for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors 3.1 to 5.0 cm in size, compared with an AM of 0.5-1.0 cm.Methods:From October 2005 to December 2012, 936 consecutive patients with HCC who received radiofrequency ablation were screened. Of these, 281 patients, each with a single primary HCC tumor of 3.1 to 5.0 cm in size on its greatest diameter, were included in the study. Based on the AM width, we categorized patients into the 0.5-1.0 cm group and the > 1.0 cm group. Local tumor progression (LTP)-free survival, intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR)-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year LTP-free survival rates and IDR-free survival rates were significantly higher in the > 1.0 cm group compared with the 0.5-1.0 cm group (97.5%, 86.3%, 73.6%, 49.5% and 26.4% vs 91.3%, 78.4%, 49.5%, 27.8%, and 12.8%; 95.1%, 90.3%, 77.0%, 61.0% and 48.3% vs 95.2%, 85.9%, 62.6%, 47.2% and 28.5%; P 1.0 cm group (P = 0.010). There were no significant differences in complication rates between the two groups. Both univariate and multivariate analyses identified AM as an independent prognostic factor linked to LTP, IDR, and OS.Conclusion:For HCC tumors > 3.0 cm and â‰¤ 5.0 cm, AM > 1.0 cm could reduce chances of recurrence compared with AM of 0.5-1.0 cm, emphasizing the need for a more defensive strategy using AMs > 1.0 cm for ablating HCC tumors of 3.1 to 5.0 cm.
