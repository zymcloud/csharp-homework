Backgrounds/aims:Combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is an uncommon subtype of primary liver cancer that has rarely been reported in detail. This study was performed in order to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of cHCC-CC in single center.Methods:The clinicopathological features of patients diagnosed and operated with cHCC-CC at Chonbuk National Hospital between July 1998 and July 2007 were retrospectively studied by comparing them with patients with only hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had undergone a hepatic resection during the same period.Results:Ten out of 152 patients who had undergone a hepatic resection were diagnosed with cHCC-CC and thus included in this study (M : F=8 : 2, median age: 52±11.1 years). According to the parameters of the 7th American Joint Committee on Cancer T staging, there were 76 (50.0%), 44 (28.9%), 9 (5.9%), 18 (11.8%) and 5 (3.3%) patients with T stages 1, 2, 3a, 3b and 4, respectively. The overall survival period was longer in the HCC only group (68±40.4 months) than in the combined cHCC-CC group (23±40.1 months) (pConclusions:Even after the hepatic resection in the HCC, the prognosis is poorer if the patient has cholangiocellular components compared to the usual HCC.
