Curative resection can be achieved in some cases of multiple liver metastases that are initially unresectable by multistage hepatectomy. We report the case of a patient who underwent 2 hepatectomy procedures for liver metastases of advanced colon cancer after conversion chemotherapy and 2-stage hepatectomy; this treatment resulted in long-term survival.
