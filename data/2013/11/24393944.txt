Twenty patients( 30 nodules) with metastatic liver cancer( MLC) and 10 cases with hepatocellular carcinoma( HCC) treated by stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) were analyzed. SRT was administered at 48.0 or 52.8 Gy/4 Fr/1 wk. The response rate (RR) in MLC patients was 78%, and 11 patients survived longer than 1 year and 9 patients survived as long as 2 years. Clinical analysis suggests that the ideal indications for SRT in MLC are solitary nodules in patients without extrahepatic disease who have undergone systemic chemotherapy. Although RR of SRT for HCC was as high as 85%, intrahepatic recurrence was observed in all patients and 6 patients died within 1 year. Further analysis is needed to determine the indication for SRT in HCC patients.
