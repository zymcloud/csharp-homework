Background:Deregulated Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3 K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways are significant in hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation (HCC). In this study we evaluated differences in the antiproliferative effect of dual PI3 K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition of non liver cancer stem cell lines (PLC and HuH7) and liver cancer stem cell (LCSC) lines (CD133, CD44, CD24, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1-positive cells).Materials and methods:Flow cytometry was performed on the resulting tumors to identify the LCSC markers CD133, CD44, CD24, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1. Methylthiazol tetrazolium assay was used to assess cellular proliferation. Finally, a Western blot assay was used to evaluate for inhibition of specific enzymes in these two signaling pathways.Results:Using flow cytometry, we found that LCSC contain 64.4% CD133 + cells, 83.2% CD44 + cells, and 96.4% CD24 + cells. PKI-587 and sorafenib caused inhibiton of LCSC and HCC cell proliferation. PLC cells were more sensitive to PKI-587 than LCSC or Huh7 (P Conclusions:LCSC (CD133+, CD44+, CD24+) were able to develop very aggressive tumors with low cell concentrations at 4 to 6 wk. Cells CD133+, CD44+, CD24+, which demonstrated at least moderate resistance to therapy in vitro. The combination of PKI-587 and sorafenib was better than either drug alone at inhibiting of LCSC and on HCC cell proliferation.
