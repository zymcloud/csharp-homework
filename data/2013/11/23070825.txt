Solitary mediastinal metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare. We report a case of solitary mediastinal metastasis arising from HCC treated by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). A 75-year-old man underwent hepatic resection and transcatheter arterial embolization for HCC. The level of protein induced by vitamin K antagonist was subsequently found to be elevated. Computed tomography showed a 2-cm mediastinal tumor. (18)F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography revealed slight uptake by the tumor. VATS was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was metastatic HCC of the lymph nodes. The postoperative course was uneventful, with a postoperative hospital stay of 6 days. There has been no recurrence at 4 months after surgery. VATS is a minimally invasive and useful treatment for solitary mediastinal metastasis of HCC.
