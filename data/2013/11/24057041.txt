Purpose:The purpose of this multicenter phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination of irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab as first-line chemotherapy in Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.Methods:Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were eligible for enrollment. On day 1 of a 14-day cycle, patients received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg, irinotecan 150 mg/m², and L-leucovorin 200 mg/m² as an intravenous infusion, followed by 5-FU 400 mg/m² as an intravenous bolus and then 5-FU 2,400 mg/m² as an 46-h intravenous infusion. This treatment cycle was repeated. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).Results:We enrolled 40 patients, but one withdrew consent before starting treatment. The remaining 39 patients received a total of 509 cycles of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (median 11 per patient; range 1-30). The median PFS was 11.5 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 22.0 months, and the 1-year OS rate was 81.8 %. All 39 patients had adverse events. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and stomatitis occurred in 21 (53.9 %) and 4 (10.3 %) patients, respectively.Conclusion:Our results suggest that FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab is a clinically effective regimen with a manageable toxicity profile as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
