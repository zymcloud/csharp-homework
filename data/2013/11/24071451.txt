Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for more than 600,000 deaths per year due to it being a highly invasive tumor. The α-dicarbonyl, methylglyoxal demonstrates efficacy at reducing tumor burden, however the anti-cancerous activities of 3-deoxyglucosone, have never been studied.Aims:To determine the anti-cancerous potential of methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone on liver tumor cells.Methods:The in vitro effects of methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone were studied by investigating migration, invasion, and adhesion of Huh-7, HepG2, and Hep3B cells.Results:3-Deoxyglucosone inhibited migration of Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. Methylglyoxal decreased migration of HepG2 cells. Additionally, 3-deoxyglucosone and methylglyoxal impaired invasion, and adhesion of Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. In Hep3B cells, a p53 null cell line, 3-deoxyglucosone and methylglyoxal had no effect on migration, invasion, or adhesion. However, both compounds inhibited invasion of wild-type p53 transfected Hep3B cells. Silencing of p53 in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells abrogated the effects of the α-dicarbonyls on cell invasion. 3DG and MG did not alter p53 total protein but promoted nuclear translocation of p53.Conclusions:These studies suggest that 3-deoxyglucosone and methylglyoxal impair invasion, migration, and adhesion of hepatocellular carcinoma. The effects of both compounds on cell invasion are dependent on p53 and imply that α-dicarbonyls could be efficacious in the treatment of p53-expressing invasive liver tumors.
