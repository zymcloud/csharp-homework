Centromere protein H (CENP-H) has been shown to be significantly upregulated in many types of cancers and is associated with disrupted cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation and genetic instability. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression and localization of CENP-H in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determine whether its overexpression is a prognostic biomarker for HCC. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (pcr), real-time qPCR and western blotting were used to compare CENP-H expression at the mRNA and protein levels in HCC samples and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous samples. CENP-H protein levels were determined in 60 paired paraffin-embedded HCC tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the correlation with clinicopathological features and patient prognosis was analyzed. In addition, an immunofluorescence assay was performed to test the expression and localization of CENP-H protein in HCC cells. Results showed that levels of CENP-H mRNA and protein were higher in HCC samples than in the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous samples. In 60 paired paraffin-embedded tissues, CENP-H was upregulated in the HCC samples (38/60, 63.3%) relative to the adjacent non-cancerous samples (21/60, 35%, P=0.003), and a higher level of upregulation was associated with tumor size (P=0.032); higher histological grade (P=0.001); more advanced TNM stage (P=0.002) and Chinese clinical stage (P=0.008); and poorer prognosis. In addition, consistent with the results of IHC, the immunofluorescence assay showed that CENP-H was localized in the nucleus of Hep3B cells. CENP-H was overexpressed in HCC, and its level of upregulation was an independent prognostic indicator, suggesting that CENP-H may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.
