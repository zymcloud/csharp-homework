3-Oxo-29-noroleana-1,9(11),12-trien-2,20-dicarbonitrile (ONTD) is a novel synthetic derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), which has the ability to inhibit the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the mechanisms by which ONTD exerts its inhibitory effects remain elusive. The present study was conducted to investigate the cytotoxicity of ONTD in Bel-7402 cells and its molecular mechanisms. We found that ONTD depleted intracellular GSH, increased the level of ROS, and consequently induced mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) leading to the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c (Cyt c) to the cytosol. Mitochondrial alteration and subsequent apoptotic cell death in ONTD-treated Bel-7402 cells could be blocked by addition of exogenous antioxidants N-acetylcystein (NAC), GSH and the MTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA). In addition, ONTD activated the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) but not extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK 1/2). When the cells were exposed to SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor), the deregulation of the expression of apoptotic proteins was attenuated. Furthermore, 40 mg/kg ONTD significantly reduced tumor weight (-70.62%, p
