The fucosyltransferase (FUT) family is the key enzymes in cell-surface antigen synthesis during various biological processes such as tumor multidrug resistance (MDR). The aim of this work was to analyze the alteration of FUTs involved in MDR in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Using mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, the composition profiling of fucosylated N-glycans differed between drug-resistant BEL7402/5-FU (BEL/FU) cells and the sensitive line BEL7402. Further analysis of the expressional profiles of the FUT family in three pairs of parental and chemoresistant human HCC cell lines showed that FUT4, FUT6 and FUT8 were predominant expressed in MDR cell lines. The altered levels of FUT4, FUT6 and FUT8 were responsible for changed drug-resistant phenotypes of BEL7402 and BEL/FU cells both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, regulating FUT4, FUT6 or FUT8 expression markedly modulated the activity of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and MDR-related protein 1 (MRP1) expression. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by its specific inhibitor wortmannin, or by Akt small interfering RNA (siRNA), resulted in decreased MDR of BEL/FU cells, partly through the downregulation of MRP1. Taken together, our results suggest that FUT4-, FUT6- or FUT8-mediated MDR in human HCC is associated with the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the expression of MRP1, but not of P-gp, indicating a possible novel mechanism by which the FUT family regulates MDR in human HCC.
