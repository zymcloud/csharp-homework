We report a case of 90-year-old patient who underwent preoperative 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) volumetric analysis using SYNAPSE VINCENT imaging software and anatomical resection of segment VIII using ultrasound-guided vessel compression. Preoperative abdominal CT revealed a liver mass measuring 5.0 cm in diameter, and the patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver function was preserved. Preoperative 3D volumetry using SYNAPSE VINCENT revealed the volume of the entire liver to be 1,339 mL and the volume of segment VIII to be 327 mL. Anatomical hepatic resection of segment VIII was performed using ultrasound-guided vessel compression. Operative duration was 372 min and estimated blood loss was 760 mL. Resected liver volume was 290 g. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and there has been no evidence of recurrence since the surgery.
