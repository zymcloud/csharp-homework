The purpose of this study was to evaluate S-1 plus oxaliplatin( SOX) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The clinical features and management of 10 patients with this disease seen at the Hirosaki University Hospital between 2011 and 2013 were examined. Of these patients, 30% were treated with bevacizumab, and the mean number of courses was 3.3. There were no adverse events of severity greater than Grade 3, and no patient required treatment interruption because of toxicity. SOX administered every 3 weeks was associated with a partial response rate of 40% and a tumor control rate of 100%; progressive disease was not observed. Curative resection was performed in all patients except in 1 with liver metastasis. With regard to the pathological findings, 2 cases were of Grade 0; 4 cases, of Grade 1a; and 2 cases, of Grade 2. Postoperative complications such as anastomotic leakage were observed in 80% of the patients. Thus, SOX administration without a central venous drug injection port was very useful because most patients could receive SOX treatment on an outpatient basis. However, the frequency of postoperative complications associated with this treatment is increasing, and therefore, it is important to accumulate more evidence.
