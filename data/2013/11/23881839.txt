Partial hepatectomy (PH) alters serum concentrations of substances involved in cellular proliferation, leading to the compensatory liver hyperplasia. Furthermore, angiogenesis is mainly stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is a fundamental requirement either in liver regeneration or in tumours growth. This study looks at the expression of VEGF, DNA synthesis (DNAs) and mitotic activity (MA) in hepatectomised (H) and hepatectomised-tumour bearing (HTB) mice throughout a 24 h period. Adult male mice were sacrificed every 4 h from 26 to 50 h post-hepatectomy. H mice show a circadian rhythm in VEGF expression with a maximum value of 2.6 ± 0.1 at 08/46 h of day/hours posthepatectomy (HD/HPH); in DNAs, the maximum value was 3.4 ± 0.3 at 16/30 (HD/HPH) and in MA it was 2.3 ± 0.01 at 12/50 (HD/HPH). In HTB animals the peak of VEGF expression appears at 16/30 (HD/HPH) with a maximum value of 3.7 ± 0.1, the peak of DNAs was at 00/38 (HD/HPH) with a value of 4.6 ± 0.3 and the maximum value of MA of 08/46 (HD/HPH) with a value of 3.01 ± 0.3. We can conclude that the presence of the tumour induces modifications in the intensity and the temporal distribution of the circadian curves of VEGF expression, DNAs and MA of hepatectomised animals.
