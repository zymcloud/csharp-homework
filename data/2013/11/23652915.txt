Background:Many controversies exist on the different outcomes of living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) or deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recipients.Aims:We aimed to determine the difference in outcomes between HCC patients who underwent LDLT or DDLT after successful downstaging therapy.Patients and methods:Eighty-three adult patients were diagnosed with advanced HCC and received a liver transplantation after various successful downstaging therapies: 31 patients underwent LDLT and 52 patients underwent DDLT. We retrospectively collected and analyzed the data of these two groups.Results:The LDLT and DDLT groups showed similar overall complication rates and mortality rates. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence-free rates were 77.4, 71, and 62.7% after LDLT and 80.7, 69.2, and 60.5% after DDLT (P=0.771). The overall patient survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 90.3, 74.2, and 71% after LDLT and 90.4, 71.2, and 67.3% after DDLT (P=0.860). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-transplant hepatitis B virus recurrence rates were 4, 5, and 10.5%, respectively, for the patients who underwent LDLT and 2.6, 6.7, and 10.7%, respectively, for the patients who underwent DDLT (P=0.918).Conclusion:These data strongly suggest that no significant differences in postoperative complications, tumor recurrence rate, survival rate, and hepatitis B virus recurrence exist between DDLT and LDLT patients.
