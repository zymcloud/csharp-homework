Objective:To explore the application value of 320-row computed tomography (CT) 4D digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 40 HCC patients received 320-row CT contrast scans. The 4D DSA images were obtained on the basis of baseline data. The normal anatomy and anatomical variations of hepatic artery, tumor supplying arteries, tumor vessels, tumor staining were observed by comparing DSA (n = 20).Results:320-row CT 4D DSA could show 6-7 levels of intrahepatic arterial branch. Normal hepatic artery anatomy was found in 35 cases (87.5%, Michels I type) and variations in 5 cases (12.5%). The diagnose accordance rate was 100% between 4D DSA and DSA in showing the anatomy and variation of hepatic artery. Among them, 320-row CT 4D DSA showed tumor staining (n = 40), tumor vessels (n = 28), tumor supplying arteries (n = 26) and two hepatic supplying arteries (n = 3). The number of tumor supplying arteries observed by 4D DSA (n = 20) was 18 versus 19 by DSA. Compared with DSA, the accurate rate of 4D DSA was 94.7% (18/19) in detecting tumor supplying arteries.Conclusion:As a noninvasive vascular examination modality, 320-row CT 4D DSA can accurately visualize normal anatomy and variation of hepatic artery, dynamically display tumor staining and reproducibly delineate the three-dimension relationship between tumor and blood vessels. In consistency with DSA in detection blood supply of HCC, 320-row CT 4D DSA provides a rapid, DSA-like and non-invasive alternative.
