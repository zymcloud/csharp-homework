Purpose:To report 10-year outcomes of treating hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) by combination therapy of chemoembolization and radiofrequency (RF) ablation.Materials and methods:Combination therapy was administered in 277 patients with 382 treatment-naïve HCCs. Therapeutic effects, safety, survival rate, and prognostic factors were evaluated.Results:Tumor enhancement disappeared after 466 RF sessions in all tumors, resulting in a complete response rate of 100% (277 of 277) based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors. Local tumor progression developed in 15 patients (5.4%; 15 of 277) during the mean follow-up of 44.9 months±29.1 (range, 6.0-134.4 mo). Overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 56.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.5%-60.2%) and 22.5% (95% CI, 19.3%-25.6%) at 5 years and 23.5% (95% CI, 17.7%-29.2%) and 9.3% (95% CI, 6.3%-12.4%) at 10 years. The Child-Pugh class was the only significant prognostic factor detected in both the univariate (P3 cm) and the tumor number (single vs multiple) were significant independent factors affecting recurrence-free survival. No death was related to the combination therapy. The major complication rate was 3.2% (15 of 466).Conclusions:RF ablation combined with chemoembolization is a safe and useful therapeutic option for treating HCCs. Prognostic factors detected in this study help to stratify patients who benefit from this combination therapy.
