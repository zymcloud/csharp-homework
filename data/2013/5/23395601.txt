Although data support adverse prognosis of overlap subtype of chronic grant-versus-host disease (GVHD), the importance of site of gastrointestinal (GI) and type of hepatic involvement is not known. Using data from the Chronic GVHD Consortium observational cohort study (N = 567, total of 2115 visits), we examined whether the site of GI (esophageal, upper GI, or lower GI) and type of hepatic (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase) involvement are associated with overall survival (OS) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM), symptoms, quality of life (QOL) and functional status measures. In multivariate analysis utilizing data from enrollment visits only, lower GI involvement (HR, 1.67; P = .05) and elevated bilirubin (HR, 2.46; P = .001) were associated with OS; both were also associated with NRM. In multivariable analysis using all visits (time-dependent covariates), GI score greater than zero (HR, 1.69; P = .02) and elevated bilirubin (HR, 3.73; P < .001) were associated with OS; results were similar for NRM. Any esophageal involvement and GI score greater than zero were associated with both symptoms and QOL, whereas elevated bilirubin was associated with QOL. We found no consistent evidence that upper GI involvement, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, or NIH liver score add prognostic value for survival, overall symptom burden, or QOL. These data support important differences in patient-reported outcomes according to GI and hepatic involvement among chronic GVHD-affected patients and identify those with elevated bilirubin or higher GI score at any time, or lower GI involvement at cohort enrollment, as patients at greater risk for mortality under current treatment approaches.
