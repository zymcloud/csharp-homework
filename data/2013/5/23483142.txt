Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks third in cancer-related mortality due to late diagnosis and poor treatment options. Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated protein and organelle degradation process which is characterized by the formation of double-membrane vesicles, known as autophagosomes. Increasing evidence reveals that autophagy functions as a survival mechanism in liver cancer cells against drug-induced apoptosis. In this study, we found that autophagy was suppressed by miR-101 in the HCC cell line HepG2. miR-101 inhibited autophagy via targets including RAB5A, STMN1 and ATG4D. Moreover, miR-101 enhanced apoptosis induced by cisplatin in the HepG2 cell line. The possible mechanism of this effect may be through inhibition of autophagy. Our results indicate a novel and critical role for miR-101 and autophagy in the chemoresistance of cisplatin in HCC. We propose that gene therapy targeting miR-101/autophagy should be investigated further as a potential alternative therapeutic strategy for HCC.
