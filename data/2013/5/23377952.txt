Purpose:To explore the effect of lipiodolized transarterial chemoembolization (lip-TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients at different risk of recurrence after curative resection.Methods:One thousand nine hundred and twenty-four consecutive HCC patients who underwent curative resection were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who underwent resection only were classified into control group, while those received adjuvant lip-TACE were classified into intervention group. Patients were further stratified into 4 groups, that is, tumor â‰¤5 cm with low or high risk factors, as well as tumor >5 cm with low or high risk factors for recurrence. Tumor number and microscopic tumor thrombus were defined as risk factors for recurrence. The effect of adjuvant lip-TACE on early (Results:There was no significant difference in recurrence curve between intervention group and control group in each stratum. Adjuvant lip-TACE showed an overall survival benefit in patients with tumor >5 cm and presenting high risk factors, mainly for those with time to recurrence (TTR) Conclusion:Adjuvant lip-TACE had no preventive effect on recurrence, but may be of benefit to detect early recurrence.
