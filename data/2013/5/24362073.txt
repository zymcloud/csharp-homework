Background & aims:Liver resection is generally restricted to patients without clinically significant portal hypertension (Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient - HVPG - ⩽10mmHg) and several teams perform transjugular HVPG measurements as part of the pre-operative work-up. The present study investigates whether a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT)-based assessment could be as accurate as the invasive transjugular measurement.Methods:A cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by resection (n=36) or transplantation (n=39) was selected (mean age: 61±9.2years, male/female ratio: 4/1). Pre-operative CTs were read by two independent investigators, and potential CT-based HVPG predictors were compared to the transjugular HVPG measurements. A validation was conducted on another cohort of 70 non-surgical patients.Results:The invasive HVPG values were significantly correlated to liver/spleen volume ratio, spleen volume, platelet count, and peri-hepatic ascites (p10mmHg was best predicted by the liver/spleen volume ratio (AUC: 0.883 [0.805-0.960]) and the peri-hepatic ascites (p10mmHg (AUC: 0.911 [0.847-0.975]), with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 92%, 79%, 91%, and 81%. The model was also accurate in the validation cohort with an AUC of 0.820 [0.719-0.921]. The computed formula was:Conclusions:The proposed CT-based model showed a high accuracy in the prediction of HVPG and, if further confirmed by prospective validation, could replace the invasive transjugular assessment in patients not requiring a biopsy of the non-tumoral liver.
