A 38-year-old man was given a diagnosis of as sigmoid colon cancer and underwent sigmoid colectomy. Post-operative pathological staging was stage IIIb. He then underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. One year and 4 months after the surgery, CT scans revealed multiple liver and lung metastases. He was given mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab, which was changed later to FOLFIRI+bevacizumab. After these chemotherapies, he was admitted to the hospital due to sudden abdominal pain and high grade fever. Obstructive jaundice was initially diagnosed, but detailed study of initial CT revealed intragastric wall abscess. After the drainage of the abscess, his conditions improved. We speculated that the abscess formation was caused by mucosal damage due to bevacizumab.
