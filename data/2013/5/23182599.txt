Background:Impact of patient and tumour baseline characteristics on the overall survival is not well characterized in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib.Aims/methods:Univariate/multivariate analyses were conducted to identify retrospectively the impact of baseline characteristics on the survival of 110 patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib.Results:Median survival of the whole cohort was 6.7 months, median survival in Child-Pugh A, B, C patients was 10.5, 6.1 and 3.0 months and median survival of patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C/D was 6.8/2.6 months. Presence of ascites, presence of macrovascular invasion and BCLC stage D (mainly determined by Child-Pugh C status and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status>2) remained independent prognostic factors for the survival on multivariate analysis. Particularly, the presence of macrovascular invasion significantly influenced survival both in patients with liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B.Conclusion:Well maintained liver function and performance status are prerequisites for sorafenib treatment in patients with advanced HCC. Our findings do not support routine clinical use of sorafenib in Child-Pugh B patients. Evaluation of ascites and particularly macrovascular invasion might help to identify patients more likely to benefit from sorafenib treatment.
