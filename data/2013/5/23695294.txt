Antibody-mediated coagulation factor deficiencies constitute a rare disorder that may develop in elderly patients without any history of a bleeding diathesis. Patients may present with severe and sometimes catastrophic bleeding. We report two cases of postoperative hemorrhage caused by a coagulation factor deficiency. In Case 1, massive intraabdominal bleeding occurred on day 3 after pancreaticoduodenectomy for bile duct cancer, and was caused by an acquired inhibitor of coagulation factor VIII. Hemostasis was achieved and the factor VIII inhibitor titer decreased to zero with activated prothrombin complex concentrates, prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide. In Case 2, intraabdominal bleeding occurred on day 7 after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma, and was caused by an acquired inhibitor against factors II (prothrombin) and V. This patient was treated with hemostatic agents containing bovine thrombin during surgery and also with prednisolone. We report these cases to highlight that antibody-mediated coagulation factor deficiencies should be considered when an elderly patient suffers sudden postoperative hemorrhage and to stress the importance of prompt diagnosis because of the risk of potentially life-threatening hemorrhage.
