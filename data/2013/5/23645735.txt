Aim:To evaluate the feasibility of carbogen-challenge blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing the early response of liver tumors to chemoembolization in a rat hepatoma model.Materials and methods:In a 9.4-Tesla scanner, a multiple gradient-recalled echo sequence was utilized for R2* measurement at 11 and 13 days after tumor implantation, first during room air breathing and then with carbogen gas (95% O2/5% CO2) breathing, to calculate the percentage changes of R2* values [ΔR2*(%)]. Transarterial chemoembolization was conducted 12 days after tumor implantation.Results:The ΔR2* value of the tumors was 10.61 ± 8.94% on pre-chemoembolization images and -0.16 ± 1.85% on post-chemoembolization images. There was a significant difference in the ΔR2* value of the tumors between pre-chemoembolization and post-chemoembolization BOLD MRI (p=0.013).Conclusion:Carbogen-challenge BOLD MRI can be a non-invasive and useful method for the evaluation of early response of liver tumors to chemoembolization.
