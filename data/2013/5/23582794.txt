We report for the first time the influence of ANXA7 gene on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC). We down-regulated ANXA7 in human HCC cell line (HepG2) using siRNA method. By Western Blot analysis, we confirmed about 70% down-regulation of the gene in the shRNA-ANXA7 transfected cells (shRNA-ANXA7-HepG2) compared to the non-specific sequence shRNA transfected cells (control-shRNA-HepG2) and the un-manipulated-HepG2 cells. We used CCK-8 cell proliferation kit and observed about 65% reduction in the shRNA-ANXA7-HepG2 cells where the two controls exhibited comparable cell proliferation rates. Also, by using PI staining followed by flow cytometry, we noticed a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 with more than one fold reduction of shRNA-ANXA7-HepG2 cell population in the S-phase of the cell cycle. Also of particular note was a significant aneuploidy in the controls compared to zero aneuploidy in the ANXA7 down-regulated cells. Migration of the cells was detected using Boyden's transwell chamber and scratch wound healing assay which showed 50% and 30% respective reductions in shRNA-ANXA7-HepG2 cells migration. Furthermore, the control-shRNA-HepG2 cells and the un-manipulated-HepG2 cells invaded through the ECM-coated transwell plates two times more than the shRNA-ANXA7-HepG2 cells. We have found ANXA7 to be functioning like a tumour promoter in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and could have a potential as a therapeutic window into the management of liver cancer.
