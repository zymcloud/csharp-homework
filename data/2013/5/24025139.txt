Objective:To explore the therapeutic efficacy of a combined treatment modality using transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicated with main branch intraportal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).Methods:Clinical data was collected retrospectively for patients diagnosed with and treated for HCC plus main branch PVTT at our hospital between January 2007 and January 2010. The total study population (n = 51) consisted of 38 males and 13 females, with an average of 50.1 years (range: 24-73). Among these patients, 26 had been treated with TACE + PEI (group A) and 25 had been treated with TACE alone (group B). Short-term changes in PVTT (i.e. disappearance, shrinkage, and/or stability) and tumor (i.e. complete response, partial response, and/or stable disease) were assessed by using the t-test (continuous variables) or the Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests (categorical variables). Between-group differences in survival time were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test.Results:The follow-up time ranged from 3-24 months after treatment, and no serious treatment-related complications were recorded for any of the patients (0/51). The time of TACE treatment was significantly longer for the patients receiving the combination therapy (group A: 3.21.4 vs. group B: 2.40.9, t = 2.22, P = 0.032). The patients in group A received between 2-8 PEI treatments. The TACE + PEI combined treatment showed significantly better therapeutic efficacy for PVTT (group A: 19/26 vs. group B: 10/25, X2 = 5.685, P = 0.019). The tumor response was significantly better in patients treated with TACE + PEI at post-treatment month 3 (group A: 20/26 vs. group B: 18/25, X2 = 0.163, P = 0.705) and month 6 (group A: 17/20 vs. 10/19, X2 = 2.58, P = 0.027). Finally, the average survival time was significantly better in patients treated with TACE + PEI (group A: 12.856.02 months (range: 5-23) vs. group B: 8.653.39 months (range: 4-16), t = 3.051, P = 0.004).Conclusion:TACE + PEI combination therapy for main branch PVTT in HCC patients is more efficacious than TACE alone, and is associated with a longer survival time.
