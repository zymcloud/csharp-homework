Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis are fatal diseases. This study aimed to investigate survival time and palliative care in terminal HCC and/or liver cirrhosis compared with lung cancer. Between January 2004 and December 2010, we enrolled 116 patients with terminal cirrhosis and/or HCC or lung cancer admitted to a municipal hospital in Japan; 48 had liver cirrhosis, 35 HCC and 33 lung cancer. By retrospective chart review, we evaluated: (i) rate of usage of narcotic analgesics and (ii) survival time from onset of coma (Glasgow Coma Scale less than 8). Time between coma and death was significantly shorter in the liver disease patients (cirrhosis and/or HCC: 7.0 h) than in lung cancer (44.0 h, p = 0.045). Total bilirubin was higher in HCC compared with cirrhosis (p
