Background:Diagnosis and management of Barrett's oesophagus are controversial. Technical improvements in real-time recognition of intestinal metaplasia and neoplastic foci provide the chance for more effective target biopsies. Confocal laser endomicroscopy allows to analyze living cells during endoscopy.Aims:To assess the diagnostic accuracy, inter- and intra-observer variability of endomicroscopy for detecting in vivo neoplasia (dysplasia and/or early neoplasia) in Barrett's oesophagus.Methods:Prospective pilot study. Patients referred for known Barrett's oesophagus were screened. Endomicroscopy was carried out in a circular fashion, every 1-2 cm, on the whole columnar-lined distal oesophagus. Visible lesions, when present, were analyzed first. Targeted biopsies were taken. Confocal images were classified according to confocal Barrett classification. Endomicroscopic and histological findings were compared.Results:Forty-eight out of 50 screened patients underwent endomicroscopy. Visible lesions were observed in 3 patients. In a per-biopsy analysis, Barrett's-oesophagus-associated neoplasia could be predicted with an accuracy of 98.1%. The agreement between endomicroscopic and histological results was substantial (Îº=0.76).Conclusions:This study suggests that endomicroscopy can provide in vivo diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus-associated neoplasia. Because it allows for the study of larger surface areas of the mucosa, endomicroscopy may lead to significant improvements in the in vivo screening and surveillance of Barrett's oesophagus.
