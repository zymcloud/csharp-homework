Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths, worldwide. MicroRNAs, inhibiting gene expression by targeting various transcripts, are involved in genomic dysregulation during hepatocellular tumorigenesis. In previous studies, microRNA-198 (miR-198) was shown to be significantly downregulated in HCV-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, the function of miR-198 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth and gene expression was studied. In hepatoma cell-types with low levels of liver-specific transcription factor HNF1α indicating a low differentiation grade, miR-198 expression was most downregulated. However, miR-198 treatment did not restore the expression of the liver-specific transcription factors HNF1α or HNF4α. Importantly, overexpression of miR-198 in Pop10 hepatoma cells markedly reduced cell growth. In agreement, comprehensive gene expression profiling by microarray hybridisation and real-time quantification revealed that central signal transducers of proliferation pathways were downregulated by miR-198. In contrast, genes mediating cellular adherence were highly upregulated by miR-198. Thus, the low expression of E-cadherin and claudin-1, involved in cell adhesion and cell-cell contacts, was abolished in hepatoma cells after miR-198 overexpression. This definite induction of both proteins by miR-198 was shown to be accompanied by a significantly impaired migration activity of hepatoma Pop10 cells. In conclusion, miR-198 acts as a tumor suppressor by repression of mitogenic and motogenic pathways diminishing cell growth and migration.
