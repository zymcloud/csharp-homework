The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the expression levels of the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the microRNA (miRNA) miR-92 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and paracancerous tissue. Immunohistochemistry [streptavidin-peroxidase (SP)] and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRTâ€‘PCR) were used to detect the expression of PTEN and miR-92 in 15 cases of HCC and the corresponding paracancerous tissues. The correlation between PTEN and miR-92 was analyzed. The expression of PTEN mRNA and protein was significantly lower in HCC compared with that in paracancerous tissues (P
