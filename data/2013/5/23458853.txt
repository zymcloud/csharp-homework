Objectives:The aim of the study was to clarify the clinical significance of single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging in terms of technetium-99m galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy. To this end, we examined the relationship using data from surgical records of 67 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatectomy.Materials and methods:Liver functional parameters or functional volume was estimated by 99mTc-GSA scintigraphy and computed tomography volumetry was used to estimate morphological volume.Results:Liver uptake ratio at 15 min (LHL15) was correlated with the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15; R=-0.608, PConclusion:Under the ICGR15 test as the standard for preoperative hepatic function, auxiliary application of LHL15 and functional volumetry provides useful information on hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing hepatectomy.
