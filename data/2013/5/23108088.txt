Background/aims:Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a widely applied standard treatment option for treatment-na誰ve patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the treatment strategy in patients with multi-nodular recurrences has not been well addressed. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TACE for recurrent HCC.Methodology:Two hundred seventeen consecutive patients who received curative ablation therapy for HCC were followed up. Forty-three of the 217 underwent TACE for recurrent HCC, and the treatment efficacy after TACE was compared with that in 99 treatment-na誰ve patients who underwent TACE for multifocal HCC during the same period.Results:The overall survival rates of the patients after TACE for recurrent HCC were not different (P=0.136) from those of the treatment-na誰ve patients after TACE. No serious adverse events related to TACE were observed in either group. Serum albumin levels (>3.5g/dL, p=0.001), alpha-fetoprotein levels (Conclusions:TACE for multifocal recurrent HCC is safe and effective, with good survival results, similar to those of initial TACE for treatment-na誰ve patients with multifocal HCC.
