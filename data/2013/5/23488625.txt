The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between MDR1 gene polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. Genomic DNA of 1431 subjects was extracted from peripheral blood and genotyping was performed using the created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction (CRS-PCR). We found that the c.1465C > T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) increased HCC risk in all genetic models (p T may contribute to the risk of HCC. No significantly increased HCC risk was detected in c.159G > T SNP. Our data indicated that the genetic variants of MDR1 gene may be a valuable molecular marker for HCC.
