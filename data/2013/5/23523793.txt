We evaluated the effects of naringenin on N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Administration of NDEA induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as evidenced by changes in histopathological architecture, increased activity of cytochrome P450, decreased activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) as well as decreased antioxidant status, enhanced lipid peroxidation and increased liver marker enzymes. Pre- and post-treatment with naringenin effectively suppressed NDEA-initiated hepatocarcinoma and the associated preneoplastic lesions by modulating xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs), alleviating lipid peroxidation (through both free radical scavenging and the enhanced antioxidant status), and decreased levels of liver marker enzymes. These results indicate that naringenin prevents lipid peroxidation and hepatic cell damage and also protects the antioxidant system in N-nitrosdithylamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
