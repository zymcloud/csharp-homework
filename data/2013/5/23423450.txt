Background:Although mortality after liver resection has declined, posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) remains a major cause of operative mortality. To date there is not consensus on a definition for PHLF. However, there have been many efforts to define PHLF causing operative mortality. In the present study we sought to identify early predictors of death from irreversible PHLF.Materials and methods:We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 359 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent liver resection between March 2000 and December 2010. Various biochemical parameters from postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, 5, and 7 were analyzed and compared with the "50-50" criterion.Results:Operative mortality was 4.7 %. Prothrombin time (PT) Conclusions:In patients with chronic liver disease who will undergo liver resection the combination of PT
