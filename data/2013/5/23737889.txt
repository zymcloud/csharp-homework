The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of thalidomide in the hepatocellular carcinoma nude mouse model in order to provide new insights into a comprehensive clinical intervention for hepatocellular carcinoma. MHCC97 cells were routinely cultured, passaged and adjusted to a single cell suspension with a concentration of 2Ã—107/ml. Six-week-old, BALB/C male nude mice were anesthetized and fixed in the prone position, then a subcapsular injection of the single cell suspension was administered into the spleen and their abdomens were closed. A laparotomy and left hepatic lobectomy was performed 14 days later and the abdomens were closed once again. Subsequent to the establishment of the hepatocellular carcinoma model, the nude mice were randomly divided into three groups, each consisting of 12 mice. The early intervention group were immediately provided with the post-operative thalidomide intervention, the late intervention group were provided with the post-operative thalidomide intervention one week subsequent to the surgery, and the negative control group were provided with a placebo intervention (0.9% physiological saline). Each intervention was continuously administered once per day for one week. The osteopontin (OPN) content of the liver tumors was detected using immunohistochemistry. The data were analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. There were significant differences in the OPN levels of the tumors among the early intervention, late intervention and negative control groups. Thalidomide may inhibit the generation of OPN and thereby inhibit the infiltration and metastasis of tumors; the immediate use of thalidomide following hepatectomy in the present study may block the invasion and metasis for liver cancer more effectively.
