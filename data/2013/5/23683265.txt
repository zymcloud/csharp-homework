Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is a rare tumor. It has variable clinical presentations and image findings. It can mimic benign or malignant hepatic tumors, and may be difficult to diagnose. We present a case in which a hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor was misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma because the tumor presented a typical enhancing profile and morphology of hepatocellular carcinoma on computed tomography, and the patient had liver cirrhosis. However, a thicker tumor capsule than that of typical hepatocellular carcinoma was noted while reviewing the computed tomography images. A capsule of inflammatory pseudotumor thicker than that of hepatocellular carcinoma has never been reported in the literature before, and could be an important diagnostic clue to differentiate inflammatory pseudotumor from hepatocellular carcinoma.
