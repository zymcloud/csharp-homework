Purpose:To access efficacy of percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) of liver metastases from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Materials and methods:From March 2007 to June 2012, 18 consecutive patients with NPC and liver metastases (15 men and three women; average age, 45.7 y; age range, 31-61 y) received computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous MWA treatment. A total of 27 ablations were performed involving 24 liver metastatic lesions in 18 patients with NPC. Average patient follow-up after ablation was 22.4 months (range, 2-52 mo). The average number of liver metastases per patient was 1.3 (range, 1-4 lesions), with lesion diameters ranging from 1.9 cm to 4.2 cm. Evaluation was then performed to assess percentage of complete necrosis, local tumor progression, and safety.Results:Technical success was achieved in all 27 MWA procedures performed. During follow-up, new metastatic lesions developed in four of 18 patients. Of these, two were liver metastases, and were successfully treated with repeat WMA. Only two major complications were observed: pneumothorax in a patient with an ablation pathway involving the thorax and postprocedural pain in two other patients. A median overall survival time of 41.4 months was observed (range, 2-50 mo); three of 18 patients died during follow-up.Conclusions:CT-guided MWA is safe and offers an effective treatment alternative for local tumor control in selected patients with liver metastases from NPC.
