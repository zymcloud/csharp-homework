A series of dual stimuli responsive synthetic polymer bioconjugate chimeric materials, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)55-block-poly(L-histidine)n [p(NIPAM)55-b-p(His)n] (n=50, 75, 100, 125), have been synthesized by employing reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of NIPAM, followed by ring-opening polymerization of α-amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides. The dual stimuli responsive properties of the resulting biocompatiable and membrenolytic p(NIPAM)55-b-p(His)n polymers are investigated for their use as a stimuli responsive drug carrier for tumor targeting. Highly uniform self-assembled micelles (∼55 nm) fabricated by p(NIPAM)55-b-p(His)n polymers display sharp thermal and pH responses in aqueous media. An anticancer drug, doxorubicin (Dox), is effectively encapsulated in the micelles and the controlled Dox release is investigated in different temperature and pH conditions. Antitumor effect of the released Dox is also assessed using the HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Dox molecules released from the [p(NIPAM)55-b-p(His)n] micelles remain biologically active and have stimuli responsive capability to kill cancer cells. The self-assembling ability of these hybrid materials into uniform micelles and their efficiency to encapsulate Dox makes them a promising drug carrier to cancer cells. The new chimeric materials thus display tunable properties that can make them useful for a molecular switching device and controlled drug delivery applications needing responses to temperature and pH for the improvement of cancer chemotherapy.
