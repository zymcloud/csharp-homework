Context:Osthole [7-methoxy-8-(3-methyl-2-butenyl) coumarin] isolated from the fruit of Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cuss, one of the commonly used Chinese medicines listed in the Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica in the Han Dynasty, had remarkable antiproliferative activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells in culture.Objectives:This study evaluated the effects of osthole on cell growth, nuclear morphology, cell cycle distribution, and expression of apoptosis-related proteins in HepG2 cells.Materials and methods:Cytotoxic activity of osthole was determined by the MTT assay at various concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 1.0 µmol/ml in HepG2 cells. Cell morphology was assessed by Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis and cell-cycle distribution was determined by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. Apoptotic protein levels were assessed by Western blot.Results:Osthole exhibited significant inhibition of the survival of HepG2 cells and the half inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) values were 0.186, 0.158 and 0.123 µmol/ml at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. Cells treated with osthole at concentrations of 0, 0.004, 0.02, 0.1 and 0.5 μmol/ml showed a statistically significant increase in the G2/M fraction accompanied by a decrease in the G0/G1 fraction. The increase of apoptosis induced by osthole was correlated with down-regulation expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and up-regulation expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and p53 proteins.Conclusion:Osthole had significant growth inhibitory activity and the pro-apoptotic effect of osthole is mediated through the activation of caspases and mitochondria in HepG2 cells. Results suggest that osthole has promising therapeutic potential against hepatocellular carcinoma.
