Background & aims:MicroRNA-218 (miR-218) can function as a tumour suppressor and inactivate cancer-promoting inflammation. However, role of miR-218 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. To determine the contribution of miR-218 genetic predisposition and its interaction with hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations to HCC risk.Methods:rs11134527 located at putative promoter region of pre-miR-218 was genotyped in 1012 healthy controls, 302 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects and 2011 subjects with chronic HBV infection (1021 with HCC) using quantitative PCR. HBV mutation was determined by sequencing.Results:rs11134527 variant genotypes in dominant model was associated with HCC risk compared with all HCC-free subjects [odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.43], HCC-free HBsAg-positive subjects (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.02-1.50) and HBsAg seroclearance subjects (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.08-1.96), adjusting for age and gender, and also associated with the generation of HBV preS deletion in men (adjusted OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.23-2.76). In multivariate regression analyses, rs11134527 in dominant model was associated with HCC risk (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.05-2.13), whereas its multiplicative interaction with viral mutation T1674C/G was inversely associated with HCC risk (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.21-0.96), adjusting for covariates including HBV mutations in the enhancer II-precore region; its interaction with HBV preS1 start codon mutation was associated with HCC risk (OR = 4.44, 95% CI = 1.27-15.55), adjusting for covariates including HBV mutations in the preS region.Conclusion:rs11134527 may be a novel genetic risk factor of HCC in HBV-exposed subjects, can facilitate HBV preS deletion generation and predispose the host to the effect of T1674C/G and preS1 start codon mutation in hepatocarcinogenesis.
