The polymorphisms in the interleukin (IL)-28B (interferon-lambda [IFN]-λ3) gene are strongly associated with the efficacy of hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance. Dendritic cells (DCs) sense HCV and produce IFNs, thereby playing some cooperative roles with HCV-infected hepatocytes in the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Blood dendritic cell antigen 3 (BDCA3)(+) DCs were discovered as a producer of IFN-λ upon Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation. We thus aimed to clarify the roles of BDCA3(+) DCs in anti-HCV innate immunity. Seventy healthy subjects and 20 patients with liver tumors were enrolled. BDCA3(+) DCs, in comparison with plasmacytoid DCs and myeloid DCs, were stimulated with TLR agonists, cell-cultured HCV (HCVcc), or Huh7.5.1 cells transfected with HCV/JFH-1. BDCA3(+) DCs were treated with anti-CD81 antibody, inhibitors of endosome acidification, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-specific inhibitor, or ultraviolet-irradiated HCVcc. The amounts of IL-29/IFN-λ1, IL-28A/IFN-λ2, and IL-28B were quantified by subtype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The frequency of BDCA3(+) DCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) was extremely low but higher in the liver. BDCA3(+) DCs recovered from PBMC or the liver released large amounts of IFN-λs, when stimulated with HCVcc or HCV-transfected Huh7.5.1. BDCA3(+) DCs were able to induce ISGs in the coexisting JFH-1-positive Huh7.5.1 cells. The treatments of BDCA3(+) DCs with anti-CD81 antibody, cloroquine, or bafilomycin A1 reduced HCVcc-induced IL-28B release, whereas BDCA3(+) DCs comparably produced IL-28B upon replication-defective HCVcc. The TRIF-specific inhibitor reduced IL-28B release from HCVcc-stimulated BDCA3(+) DCs. In response to HCVcc or JFH-1-Huh7.5.1, BDCA3(+) DCs in healthy subjects with IL-28B major (rs8099917, TT) released more IL-28B than those with IL-28B minor genotype (TG).Conclusion:Human BDCA3(+) DCs, having a tendency to accumulate in the liver, recognize HCV in a CD81-, endosome-, and TRIF-dependent manner and produce substantial amounts of IL-28B/IFN-λ3, the ability of which is superior in subjects with IL-28B major genotype.
