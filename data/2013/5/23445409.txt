Background & aims:To clarify the biological behaviour of small hypovascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because of insufficient evidence even though frequently encountered.Methods:The study covered naïve 4,474 patients who met solitary HCC ≤ 3 cm (mean, 2.1 cm), histopathologically proven and Child Pugh A or B. Macroscopic vascular invasion and distant metastasis were excluded. The hypovascularity of tumour was defined as hypo- or iso-enhancement in arterial phase of multiple dynamic imaging techniques.Results:Of them, 802 (18%) were hypovascular. The ratio of hypovascular HCC decreased as tumour size increased (P Conclusions:Hypovascular HCC was biologically less aggressive and developed with stepwise dedifferentiation and transformation to hypervascular appearance along with tumour growth. These results will help in leading correct diagnosis of small hypovascular tumour and assessing optimal treatment for hypovascular HCC ≤ 3 cm.
