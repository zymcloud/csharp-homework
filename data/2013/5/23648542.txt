A 78-year-old man was admitted for workup for a liver tumor. Both serum AFP and PIVKA-II levels were high (2260ng/ml and 806mAU/ml, respectively). Contrast-enhanced CT scan and MRI using Gd-EOB-DTPA demonstrated a liver tumor in segment 6 resembling the imaging patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a type 2 gastric cancer in the gastric antrum. Although the liver metastasis of the gastric cancer was undeniable, we performed partial resection of segment 6 of the liver and distal gastrectomy under a preoperative diagnosis of double cancer. Histopathologically, gastric tumor consisted of two components, such as well differentiated adenocarcinoma and hepatoid adenocarcinoma. The histology of the liver tumor was similar to that of the hepatoid component in the stomach lesion. Immunohistochemical staining revealed both the gastric and the liver tumors to be positive for AFP and PIVKA-II, yielding a definite diagnosis of AFP and PIVKA-II producing gastric cancer with liver metastasis. Because many cases of this disease have liver metastases at presentation with confusing images with HCC, the diagnosis of liver tumors should be carefully differentiated in the gastric cancer patients with liver tumors, high serum AFP and PIVKA-II levels.
