Haptoglobin is a liver-secreted glycoprotein with four N-glycosylation sites. Its glycosylation was reported to change in several cancer diseases, which prompted us to examine site-specific glycoforms of haptoglobin in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To this end, we have used two-dimensional separation composed of hydrophilic interaction and nano-reverse phase chromatography coupled to QTOF mass spectrometry of the enriched glycopeptides. Our results show increased fucosylation of haptoglobin in liver disease with up to six fucoses associated with specific glycoforms of one glycopeptide. Structural analysis using exoglycosidase treatment and MALDI-MS/MS of detached permethylated glycans led to the identification of Lewis Y-type structures observed particularly in the pooled hepatocellular carcinoma sample. To confirm the increase of the Lewis Y structures observed by LC-MS, we have used immunoaffinity detection with Lewis Y-specific antibodies. The presence of multiply fucosylated Lewis Y glycoforms of haptoglobin in the disease context could have important functional implications.
