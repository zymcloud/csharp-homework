The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical features of patients with isolated HCC metastases to the heart. A 66-year-old female hospitalized with a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranging from the right to the left lobe and with a tumor thrombus in the main portal vein, was treated with intraarterial cisplatin, 5-fluouracil, adriamycin and mitomycin. Computed tomography (CT) one month later revealed that the HCC had progressed with multiple lung metastases and moderate ascites. The patient had no symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography revealed a round, movable tumor with a diameter of 2 cm in the right atrium (RA). The patient succumbed to HCC five months later. An autopsy revealed HCC with portal tumor thrombi and metastases to the lungs, inferior vena cava (IVC) and RA. The metastases in the RA and IVC were not continous with the intrahepatic tumor and were histologically attached to the endocardium and endothelium, respectively. An isolated metastasis of a HCC of the RA and IVC is extremely rare. In conclusion, although the majority of isolated metastases of HCC to the heart were diagnosed by echocardiography and were treated with mainly surgery, they had poor prognosis. The echocardiography should be performed for patients with advanced HCC. A novel treatment including molecular targeted drugs is required.
