Objective:To investigate effects of biejiajian pill (BP) on the proliferation, adhesion, and invasion of hepatoma carcinoma cells (HepG2), and to primarily explore the mechanisms for fighting against metastasis and invasion.Methods:Using sero-pharmacological methods, HepG2 cells were respectively cultured by high and middle dose BP containing serums and the vehicle serum. Using MTT colorimetry, cell adhesion test, and Transwell invasion test, effects of BP on the proliferation, adhesion, and invasion of HepG2 cells were detected, thus further exploring the mechanisms for fighting against the metastasis and invasion of HepG2 cells.Results:High and middle dose BP containing serums could significantly prohibit the growth and proliferation, the adhesion and invasion of HepG2 cells on the basilar membrane. Besides, these effects were correlated with the concentrations of BP.Conclusion:BP could effectively inhibit the growth and proliferation, adhesion and invasion of HepG2 cells.
