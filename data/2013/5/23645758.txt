Background/aim:Dismal survival rates of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to the liver have been recorded. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with irinotecan eluting beads (DEBIRI) may be a safe palliative treatment with fewer serious adverse effects (SAEs). We aimed to establish the safety and efficacy of DEBIRI TACE in the treatment of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).Patients and methods:A retrospective analysis of DEBIRI TACE was performed. Response was assessed using the m-RECIST criteria. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) were used to record toxicity. Survival was estimated using Kaplan Meier analysis.Results:Twenty-eight patients treated with 47 DEBIRI TACE procedures were followed from September 2008 until February 2012. Twenty-two had metastases from colonic cancer and six metastases from rectal cancer; three patients (15%) had complete response, six (30%) partial response, four (20%) stable disease and disease progression was recorded in seven (35%); computer tomography (CT) scans were unavailable for eight patients. AEs included gastrointestinal and acid-base disturbances, hypertension, fever, insomnia, chest pain, pruritus, and neutropenia; five patients did not present AEs. The median time from diagnosis of liver metastases to initial DEBIRI treatment was 19.6 months. The median follow-up was 6.9 months. The median overall survival from first treatment was 13.3 months (95% confidence interval=6.8-19.8 months).Conclusion:DEBIRI is a well-tolerated treatment option that can be used safely in the palliative treatment of hepatic metastases from CRC.
