The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor thrombus formation in the main vasculature is extremely poor. Sorafenib combined with transarterial chemoembolization is a novel treatment approach for advanced HCC. In this study, we report two HCC patients with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus who underwent the combination treatment. The overall survival times for these two patients were 44 months and 35 months, respectively. Our report suggests that sorafenib combined with transarterial chemoembolization may be a viable choice for patients with advanced HCC even with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. Further studies are required to verify the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy for patients with advanced HCC with inferior vena cava tumor thrombus.
