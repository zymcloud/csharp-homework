Angiosarcoma of the liver is a rare disease; however, it ranks as the third most common primary liver malignancy. Diagnosis is difficult and prognosis is very poor. After the onset of clinical symptoms, the disease often progresses rapidly, decreasing the chances of curative treatment. We report the case of an 83-year-old male patient who presented with postprandial fullness. Upper abdominal ultrasound showed a hypervascular mass in segment 6 of the liver. The results of anatomopathological examination and immunohistochemistry were compatible with the diagnosis of primary angiosarcoma of the liver. Patient refused surgery (haepatectomy), and treatment was then initiated with transarterial chemoembolisation, followed by percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. The patient is currently cured based on clinical and radiological evidence. This case report is the first in the literature to describe the combined use of transarterial chemoembolisation with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of primary angiosarcoma of the liver.
