Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite improvements in local therapies, including surgical resection, liver transplantation, and transarterial embolization, the prognosis remains poor for the majority of patients who develop recurrence or present with advanced disease. Systemic therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib represents a milestone in advanced HCC but provides a limited survival benefit. Ongoing efforts to study hepatocarcinogenesis have identified an important role for c-MET signaling in the promotion of tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In this review, we summarize the preclinical data from human tissue, cell lines, and animal models that implicate c-MET in the pathogenesis of HCC. We also evaluate potential biomarkers that may estimate prognosis or predict response to c-MET inhibitors for more rational clinical trial design. Finally, we discuss the latest clinical trials of c-MET inhibitors in advanced HCC.
