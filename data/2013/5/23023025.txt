This article describes antioxidative and cytoprotective property of andrographolide, a major active component of the plant Andrographis paniculata (A. paniculata). High yields (2.7%) of andrographolide was isolated from the aerial parts of this plant via silica column chromatography. The purity of the compound was determined by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The structure was elucidated using techniques such as UV-visible spectrophotometry, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR), (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C NMR) and mass spectral analysis and the data obtained were comparable with reported results. It was observed that andrographolide exhibited significant antioxidative property (IC50 = 3.2 Âµg/ml) by its ability to scavenge a stable free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as compared to known antioxidants like ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) and the plant extract. The cytoprotective role of andrographolide against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) toxicity in human hepatoma HepG2 cell line was assessed using trypan blue exclusion test, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, by estimation of various leakage enzymes and by measuring the glutathione levels. The recovery obtained for andrographolide treatment in the presence of CCl4 was two-fold compared to A. paniculata extract for all other related biochemical parameters investigated. The results of the study indicate that andrographolide is a potent inhibitor of CCl4-mediated lipid peroxidation.
