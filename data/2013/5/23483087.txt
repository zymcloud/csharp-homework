The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be explained largely by the high rate of intrahepatic recurrence (IHR). Identification of genes related to IHR is needed to improve the poor prognosis and important for personalized medicine. Eighty-one HCC specimens were used in this study. We screened for IHR-related genes by DNA microarray analysis. The validation of screening was performed by using real-time PCR. The methylation levels in genomic DNAs were measured by quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Six hepatoma cell lines were used for examination of ABCB6 expressional regulation. Time-to-event analyses for recurrence after surgery were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis with cutoff values obtained from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. We confirmed that ABCB6 mRNA levels were significantly higher in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCCs with early IHR compared to HCV-related HCCs without early IHR (2.5-fold, P=0.01) and the corresponding non-cancerous livers (3.1-fold, P=0.05). Experiments with cell lines showed correlation between DNA methylation and mRNA levels of ABCB6. ROC analysis revealed that mRNA levels (0.81 area under the curve, 88% sensitivity and 72% specificity) and DNA methylation levels (0.81 area under the curve, 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity) of ABCB6 in HCV-related HCCs allowed for the accurate discrimination of the development of early IHR. Cox regression analysis revealed that ABCB6 mRNA levels was an independent risk factor for IHR of HCV-related HCC. Aberrant mRNA and DNA methylation levels of ABCB6 may serve as useful predictive biomarkers for early IHR of HCV-related HCC.
