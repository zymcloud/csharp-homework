Background:Studies have demonstrated the implication of HOXB9 in tumorigenesis, but its role in gastric carcinoma remains unknown.Aims:To investigate the expression and prognostic value of HOXB9 in patients with gastric carcinoma.Methods:The localization and expression of HOXB9 in gastric cancer cells lines were detected by immunofluorescence and western blot. The mRNA and protein expression level of HOXB9 was detected in subjects with gastric carcinoma and paired non-cancerous tissues. Correlation between HOXB9 expression and clinicopathological parameters, the association of HOXB9 expression with the patients' survival rate was also assessed.Results:HOXB9 was predominantly localized in the cell nucleus. A significant decrease in HOXB9 intensity in poorly differentiated gastric cancer cells is evident (P<0.01). A lower mRNA and protein expression level of HOXB9 was detected in gastric carcinoma (P<0.01). Decreased expression of HOXB9, poorly differentiation status and the presence of lymph node metastasis predict shorter overall survival (P<0.05). Patients without HOXB9 expression had a lower overall survival rate (P<0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed HOXB9 was an independent prognostic factor in gastric carcinoma (P<0.01).Conclusions:HOXB9 is down-regulation in gastric carcinoma and may be a novel prognostic marker for poorer clinical outcome for patients with gastric carcinoma.
