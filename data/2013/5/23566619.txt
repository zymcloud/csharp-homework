It is established that overnutrition is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Il has been proposed that hepatic steatosis leads to a subinflammatory response and to the production of mitogenic cytokines. Our team is focused on the role of mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) in two pathophysiological conditions that modulate liver growth: liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, and steatosis-associated tumorigenesis. Target kinases of mTOR seem more specifically involved in these processes: while S6K1 contributes to liver regeneration following hepatectomy, Akt2 is implicated in steatosis-associated tumorigenesis. In addition, recent data indicate that the transcription factor PPARÎ³, through an activation of glycolytic enzymes, could promote liver steatosis, hypertrophy and hyperplasia.
