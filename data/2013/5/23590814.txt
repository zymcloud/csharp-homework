DNA microarray-based transcriptome analysis with human hepatoma HepG2 cells was applied to evaluate the impacts of whole wastewater effluents from the membrane bioreactors (MBRs) and the activated sludge process (AS). In addition, the conventional bioassays (i.e., cytotoxicity tests and bioluminescence inhibition test), which were well-established for the evaluation of the overall effluent toxicity, were also performed for the same samples. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 2 to 926 genes, which were categorized to 0 to 225 biological processes, were differentially expressed after exposure to the effluents and the raw wastewater. Among the tested effluents, the effluent from a MBR operated at a relatively long solid retention time (i.e., 40 days) and small membrane pore size (i.e., 0.03 Î¼m) showed the least impacts on the HepG2 even at the level comparable to tap water. The observed gene expression responses were in good agreement with the results of cytotoxicity tests, and provided additional molecular mechanistic information on adverse effects occurred in the sublethal region. Furthermore, the genes related to "lipid metabolism", "response to endogenous stimulus", and "response to inorganic substance" were selected as potential genetic markers, and their expression levels were quantified to evaluate the cellular impacts and treatability of wastewater effluents. Although the harmful impacts and innocuous impacts could not be distinguished at present, the results demonstrated that the DNA microarray-based transcriptome analysis with human HepG2 cells was a powerful tool to rapidly and comprehensively evaluate impacts of whole wastewater effluents.
