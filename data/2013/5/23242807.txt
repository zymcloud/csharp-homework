Donor-transmitted malignancy is a rare complication of organ transplantation. This case illustrates a donor-transmitted adenocarcinoma in a patient 11 months after an orthotopic liver transplant for cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Diagnosis of donor-transmitted malignancy may be challenging and can be confused with HCC recurrence. A timely diagnosis is crucial as a delay may limit treatment options. Biopsy of newly found liver lesions and the use of karyotypic and microsatellite analysis may be essential for diagnosis. Protocols should be in place to help recognize and limit the incidence of donor-transmitted malignancy.
