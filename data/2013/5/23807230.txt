Background:This study examined the association of cholelithiasis post-cholecystectomy with subsequent cancers and evaluated the risk of cancer in patients with both cholelithiasis and cholecystectomy.Methods:The Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database was used to identify 15545 newly diagnosed cholelithiasis patients from 2000 to 2010, and 62180 frequency-matched non-cholelithiasis patients. A total of 5850 (37.6 %) with cholelithiasis patients received a cholecystectomy. The risk of developing cancer after cholecystectomy was measured using the Cox proportional-hazards model.Results:The incidence of developing cancer in the cholelithiasis cohort was 1.52-fold higher than that in the comparison cohort (p < 0.001). Compared with patients aged 20-34 years, patients in older age groups had a higher risk of developing cancer. The hazard ratio (HR) for developing gallbladder, extrahepatic bile duct, pancreatic, liver, stomach, and colorectal cancer was 59.3, 10.7, 3.12, 1.90, 1.71, and 1.36-fold higher for patients with cholelithiasis, respectively. After a cholecystectomy, the HR for developing stomach and colorectal cancer was 1.81-fold and 1.56-fold, respectively. The incidence rate ratio was higher for the first 5 years and over 5 years (5.05 and 4.46, respectively) (95 % confidence interval 4.73-5.39 and 4.11-4.84, respectively) in proximal colon and stomach cancer patients with cholecystectomies.Conclusions:Cholelithiasis patients have a higher risk of gastrointestinal cancer, particularly of gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct cancer. Post-cholecystectomy patients have a risk of colorectal and stomach cancer within the first 5 years and persisting after 5 years, respectively. This paper proposes strategies for preventing gastrointestinal cancer.
