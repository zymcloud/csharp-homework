Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype C is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition, HBV subgenotype C1 is the major subgenotype in Southern China. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was the specific mutation patterns in HBV/C1 associated with Southern Chinese patients with HCC.Methods:Mutations in HBV basal core promoter (BCP) and their association with HCC were assessed in a matched cross-sectional control study of 102 HCC and 105 chronic hepatitis (CH) patients (from Guangdong, China) infected with HBV/C1. Functional analysis of HBx mutants was performed by the colony formation assay and the luciferase assays.Results:T1762/A1764 double mutations was frequently found in patients infected with HBV/C1, regardless of clinical status (64.7% in HCC and 51.4% in CH, P>0.05). Unexpectedly, the adjacent V1753 or A1768 mutation significantly increased the risk of HCC (PConclusions:Accumulation of mutations involving V1753 or/and A1768 in addition to T1762/A1764 in BCP region were closely related to HCC among the patients infected with HBV/C1, particularly for HBeAg-positive-carriers. The increased risk of HCC caused by BCP variants may be attributable partially to modifying the biological functions of HBx.
