Purpose:To explore the significance of quantitative digital subtraction angiography (DSA; Q-DSA) in the assessment of chemoembolization endpoints.Materials and methods:Twenty patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with chemoembolization were included in the study. All DSA series before and after chemoembolization were postprocessed with Q-DSA. The maximal enhancement and time to peak (TTP) were measured for several homologous anatomic landmarks, including the origin and embolized site of the tumor-feeding artery, parenchyma of the tumor, and ostia of the pre- and postprocedure catheter. The TTP, tumor blood supply time, and maximal enhancement of the time density curve (TDC) were analyzed.Results:Of the 20 DSA series collected, 18 were successfully postprocessed. The TTPs of the landmarks before and after treatment were 3.60 seconds±1.02 and 3.57 seconds±0.78 at the ostia of the catheter, 3.91 seconds±1.01 and 4.09 seconds±1.14 at the origin site of the tumor-feeding artery, and 4.07 seconds±1.02 and 5.60 seconds±1.56 s the embolized site of the main tumor-feeding artery, respectively. Statistical differences were detected between pre- and postprocedural TTP of the embolized site of the feeding artery (PConclusions:Q-DSA may provide a feasible quantitative measurement in the assessment of chemoembolization endpoints.
