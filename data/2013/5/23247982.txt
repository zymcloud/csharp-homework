Purpose:To correlate early HBV-DNA suppression by antiviral treatment with posthepatectomy long-term survivals in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A retrospective study was conducted on patients with a baseline HBV-DNA load of >2,000 IU/ml. The cumulative rates of HBV-DNA undetectability at weeks 24 and 48, as well as long-term tumor recurrence and overall survivals were determined.Results:Of 1,040 patients with a high baseline HBV-DNA load, 865 patients received antiviral treatment. At a median follow-up of 42 months, 616 patients (59.2 %) had developed HCC recurrence and 482 patients (46.3 %) had died. The median time to recurrence was 25 months. In patients who received antiviral treatment, the cumulative rates of HBV-DNA undetectability (5 cm, blood transfusion, surgical margin 5 cm, surgical margin Conclusions:Early HBV-DNA suppression with antiviral treatment improved prognosis of patients with HBV-related HCC.
