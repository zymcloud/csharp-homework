Objective:To explore the potential of iodized linoleic acid (ILA) and its 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine ester (IFU) to inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro and tumors in vivo.Methods:ILA and its constituent component IFU were chemically synthesized, purified, and confirmed by 1H-NMR. The HCC cell lines, QGY-7703 (5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment sensitive) and SMMC-7721 (5-FU resistant), were treated with ILA, IFU, 5-FU, or traditional lipiodol for 72 hours. Survival rates of the treated cells were assessed by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium method, and used to calculate the IC50 and IC90. In addition, thirty nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with SMMC-7721 cells and randomly divided two weeks later into four treatment groups (n = 6 each) for intra-tumoral injection of ILA, IFU, 5-FU, lipiodol or DMSO (controls). The rate of tumor inhibition (RTI) was calculated for each group at week 4 after treatment.Results:For the cultured SMMC-7721 cells, the inhibitory concentrations for ILA, IFU, and 5-FU were: IC50: 134.38 mumol/L, 17.55 mumol/L, and 7.38 mumol/L; IC90: 192.88 mumol/L, 97.63 mumol/L, and more than 200 mumol/L. For the cultured QGY-7703 cells, the inhibitory concentrations for ILA, IFU, and 5-FU were: IC50: 109.55 mumol/L, 44.79 mumol/L, and 98.06 mumol/L; IC90: all, more than 200 mumol/L. In both cell types, the IC50 of lipiodol was more than 400 mumol/L. Compared with the RTI of the control mice (100%), the RTI of ILA-treated mice was 31.9% (t = 2.37, P less than 0.05), of IFU-treated mice was 56.9% (t = 4.91, P less than 0.01), and of 5-FU-treated mice was 31.0% (t = 2.59, P less than 0.05). The RTI of IFU was significantly stronger than that of either ILA or 5-FU (P less than 0.05). The lipiodol treatment showed no inhibition effect on tumors (P more than 0.05).Conclusion:ILA and IFU can effectively inhibit the growth of HCC cells in vitro and tumors in vivo. Furthermore, IFU outperforms ILA in inhibiting HCC growth.
