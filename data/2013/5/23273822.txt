Purpose:To investigate whether there is any correlation between standard endpoints and tumor perfusion measurements with Perfusion CT and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography (DCE-US) in patients with advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) treated with targeted therapy.Materials and methods:Nineteen patients were evaluated during targeted therapy (sorafenib n=16, sunitinib n=3). Changes in tumor perfusion measurements between baseline and month 1 were assessed and compared using RECIST progression criteria at month 2.Results:Median time to progression according to RECIST was 117 days and median time to death was 208 days. Perfusion CT values before treatment were significantly increased in HCC compared to the surrounding liver (n=17, PConclusion:Despite perfusion changes with both Perfusion CT and DCE-US in patients receiving treatment, only DCE-US at month 1 (with a decrease in the AUC of more than 40%) predicted non-progression at month 2 and may be a potential surrogate marker of tumor response during targeted therapy.
