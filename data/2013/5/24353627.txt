Objective:The study aim was to explore the role of DEK in tumor progression and prognostic of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:DEK protein in 178 samples of HCC was evaluated by immunohistochemical method. Additionally, the correlation between DEK expression and the clinicopathological features was evaluated by x(2) test or Fisher's exact test, the survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the relationship between prognostic factors and patient survival was also by the Cox analysis.Results:DEK protein expression was noted in 86 cases of HCC, and 61 cases of normal liver tissues. DEK positive rate were closely correlated with the tumor size, grade, AJCC stage and survival rate (PConclusions:DEK could promote aggressiveness of cancer behavior, and hence poor prognosis of the HCC. It might be an independent poor prognostic factor and can serve as a useful new therapeutic biomarker.
