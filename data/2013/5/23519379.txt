Liver transplantation is the optimal therapy for patients with non-resectable early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which is limited to the liver. During the sometimes long waiting period patients usually receive neoadjuvant bridging therapy to avoid tumor progression. The armamentarium of bridging therapies includes local ablative and systemic therapies as well as liver resection. The oncological benefit of neoadjuvant therapy for patients who receive a liver transplantation is unclear; however, bridging therapy keeps patients eligible for transplantation in the formal framework of current allocation rules. Moreover, response to therapy may serve as a surrogate marker for favorable tumor biology and may therefore help to guide the selection process for patients undergoing liver transplantation for HCC.
