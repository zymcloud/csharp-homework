Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate in a retrospective setting the patients' profile and results of those undergoing surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-volume surgical centers throughout the world.Background:Whether surgery for HCC is a suitable approach and for which subset of patients is still controversial. The EASL/AASLD (European Association for the Study of Liver Disease/American Association for the Study of Liver Disease) guidelines, based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification, leave little room for hepatic resection; inversely, other reports promote its wider application.Methods:On the basis of the network "Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Eastern & Western Experiences," data for 2046 consecutive patients resected for HCC in 10 centers were collected. According to the BCLC classification, 1012 (50%) were BCLC 0-A, 737 (36%) BCLC B, and 297 (14%) BCLC C. Analysis of overall survival and disease-free survival and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors were performed.Findings:The 90-day mortality rate was 2.7%. Overall morbidity was 42%. After a median follow-up of 25 months (range, 1-209 months), the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 95%, 80%, and 61% for BCLC 0-A; 88%, 71%, and 57% for BCLC B; and 76%, 49%, and 38% for BCLC C (P = 0.000). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were as follows: 77%, 41%, and 21% for BCLC 0-A; 63%, 38%, and 27% for BCLC B; and 46%, 28%, and 18% for BCLC C (P = 0.000). The multivariate analysis identified bilirubin, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, tumor size, and macrovascular invasion to be statistical and independent prognostic factors for overall survival.Conclusions:This large multicentric survey shows that surgery is in current practice widely applied among patients with multinodular, large, and macrovascular invasive HCC, providing acceptable short- and long-term results and justifying an update of the EASL/AASLD therapeutic guidelines in this sense.
