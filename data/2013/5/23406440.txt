Introduction:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common lethal malignancies. The prognosis is poor despite progress in early diagnosis. The initial treatment of choice is hepatic resection; unfortunately, not all patients are eligible for liver resection. Moreover, there are significant recurrences. Different liver-directed therapies have been developed to increase the number of patients eligible for liver resection. Among them, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is a technique of improving importance that involves the intra-arterial administration of anticancer drugs and embolization agents into the liver tumor. In the first part of this review, an overview of the present situation in the field of TACE has been made, referring in particular to the use of Lipiodol.Areas covered:Clinical overview of TACE with attention to the present limits and problems of this technique.Expert opinion:The use of TACE techniques is important in the treatment of HCCs. However, this technique needs to be improved in particular taking into account the use of new materials for the preparation of embolizing agents able to control the drug release.
