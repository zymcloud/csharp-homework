Objective:To investigate the effect and mechanism of EGCG on the proliferation and invasion of human hepatioma HepG2 cell.Methods:Hepatioma HepG2 cell was treated with EGCG at different concentrations. The effect of EGCG on HepG2 proliferation was examined by CCK-8. The apoptosis of HepG2 treated with EGCG was observed by fluorescence microscopy and FCM via Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The invasion of HepG2 was detected by Transwell assay. The expression of MMP-2 and VEGF was analyzed by ELISA.Results:HepG2 proliferation was inhibited after treated with EGCG. The IC25 of 24 h and 48 h was 58.19 and 54.19 mg/L. The IC50 of 24 h and 48 h was 133.90 and 78.97 mg/L. The apoptosis of HepG2 was induced significantly after treated with 60 and 135 mg/L EGCG, and the number of cells crossing Matrigel membrane was (28.33+/-7.66) and 0 (P<0.05), and the inhibitory rate of invasion was 69.47% and 100%. The expression of MMP-2 and VEGF decreased significantly.Conclusion:EGCG suppressed the proliferation and invasion of HepG2 with the possible mechanism of inducing apoptosis and down-regulating the expression of MMP-2 and VEGF in HepG2.
