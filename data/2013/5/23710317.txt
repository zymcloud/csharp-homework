Background/aims:This study reports treatment outcomes after helical intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for whom transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was considered ineffective or unsuitable.Methods:From January 2008 to December 2011, 22 unresectable HCC patients received helical IMRT. A daily dose of 1.8 to 4 Gy was delivered at five fractions per week to deliver a total dose of 30 to 60 Gy. The most-prescribed dose fractionation was a total dose of 50 to 57.5 Gy, with a daily dose of 2.3 to 2.5 Gy.Results:In the entire group, the objective response rate of the primary tumor was 72.7%. In the eight patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT), the objective response rate of PVT was 50.0%. Median disease progression-free survival was 11.8 months, and the 1-year disease progression-free survival rate was 40.2%. The median overall survival was 14.4 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 86.4% and 69.1%, respectively. PVT and Child-Pugh classifications were significant prognostic factors for overall survival in multivariate analyses.Conclusions:Helical IMRT in patients with unresectable HCC resulted in high treatment response and survival rates. This study suggests helical IMRT is a practical treatment option for HCC patients in whom TACE is unsuitable or ineffective.
