Bioassay-guided fractionation of the CHCl3 layer of Solanum violaceum areal parts methanolic extract led to the isolation of four new steroidal sapogenins, indiosides L-O (1-4), along with eight known steroids, one lignin, and a coumarin. Indioside L is a rare spirostanoid possessing a 1,4-dien-3-one moiety in ring A. Moreover, compounds 3 and 4 represent rare examples of spirostene with the 3β,7α-diol-5,6-ene moiety compared to the normal 3β,7β-diol-5,6-ene derivatives. The cytotoxic activity of the isolates (5-14) was evaluated against human hepatoma (HepG2 and Hep3B), human lung carcinoma (A549), and human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7).
