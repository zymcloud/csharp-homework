Background and objective:The impact of perioperative allogenenic blood transfusion (ABT) on clinical outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is conflicting and unclear. The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the association between ABT and HCC clinical outcomes. Outcomes evaluated were all-cause death, tumor recurrence and postoperative complications.Methods:Relevant articles were identified through MEDLINE search (up to November 2012). Meta-analyses were performed by using the fixed or random effect models. Study heterogeneity was assessed by Q-test and I(2) test. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots, Egger's and Begg's test.Results:A total of 5635 cases from 22 studies finally met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis indicated HCC patients with ABT had an increased risk of all-cause death at 3 and 5 years after surgery (respectively: OR = 1.92, 95% CI, 1.61-2.29,PConclusions:The findings from the current meta-analysis demonstrated that ABT was associated with adverse clinical outcomes for HCC patients undergoing surgery, including increased death, recurrence and complications. Therefore, ABT should not be performed if possible.
