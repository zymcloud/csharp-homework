Case-control studies on the association between mouse double-minute 2 homolog (MDM2) SNP309T>G polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma have provided either controversial or inconclusive results. To clarify the effect of MDM2 SNP309T>G polymorphism on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, a meta-analysis of all case-control observational studies was performed. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for various polymorphisms were estimated using random and fixed effects models. The Q-statistic was used to evaluate the homogeneity, and Egger and Begg tests were used to assess publication bias. Overall, the MDM2 SNP309T>G polymorphism was associated with a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (OR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.54-0.85 for allele contrast, p = 0.0005, phet = 0.004). The contrast of homozygotes and the recessive and dominant models produced the same pattern of results as the allele contrast. In the analysis stratified by ethnicity, significant associations were found in the Caucasian population in all of the genetic models. In addition, heterogeneity disappeared in subgroups of Caucasian subjects. Our pooled data suggest evidence for a major role of MDM2 SNP309T>G polymorphism in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma, especially among Caucasian populations.
