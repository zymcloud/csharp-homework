Reluctance to recommend lung cancer surgery for octogenarians is partly based on the expectation that the rate of complications and mortality is higher in this group of patients, and on the impression that the life expectancy of an octogenarian with lung cancer is limited by death from natural causes. Moreover, the belief that radiation therapy and observation yield similar results to surgery in early-stage disease have influenced low resection rates in this population. Nevertheless, advances in surgical techniques, anaesthesia and postoperative care have made surgical lung resection a safer procedure than it was in the past. Judging from the more recent findings, surgery should not be withheld because of postoperative mortality, but suboptimal or palliative treatment may be necessary in patients with poor physical or mental function. To enable informed decision-making, both patients and clinicians need information on the risks of surgical treatment. In this review, available information from the literature was collected in an effort to understand the real benefit of surgical treatment in octogenarians with non-small-cell lung cancer, and to determine what should be done or avoided during the selection course.
