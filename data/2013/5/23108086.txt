Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play pivotal roles in diverse biological processes. Altered expressions of miR-17-5p in several tumor types have been reported. However, the expression and clinical significance of serum miR-17-5p in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unclear.Methodology:The expression of miR-17-5p was measured in the serum of paired pre-operative and post-operative groups (n=96) as well as non-relapsed and relapsed groups (n=40) by qRT-PCR. Further study was performed to analyze the correlation of miR-17-5p expression with clinicopathologic variables and the relationship between miR-17-5p expression and the prognosis of HCC patients.Results:The expression of serum miR-17-5p was significantly down-regulated in post-operative group and upregulated in relapsed group. Moreover, the expression of serum miR-17-5p was remarkably associated with the metastasis status and TNM stages (PConclusions:The level of serum miR-17-5p is associated with development of HCC and can serve as a non-invasive biomarker for the prognostic prediction of HCC patients.
