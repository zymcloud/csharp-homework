Objective:To examine the association between serum calcium levels and the risk of liver cirrhosis.Methods:A nested case-control study was performed based on the nutritional intervention trial of esophageal carcinoma in Linxian, Henan province. Serum samples of 281 liver cirrhosis cases and 562 controls were tested for calcium concentrations, surface antigen (HBsAg) and core antibody (anti-HBc) on Hepatitis virus B and antibody on Hepatitis virus C (anti-HCV), using automatic serum biochemical analysis system and enzyme-linked immunoassay. Data on baseline characteristics were collected via a questionnaire. Serum calcium value was divided into tertiles and logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.Results:Individuals in the case group showed higher calcium levels (1.81 ± 0.84) mmol/L when compared to the controls (1.65 ± 0.79) mmol/L, with t = -2.640 and P = 0.008. The calcium levels were associated with the risk of liver cirrhosis (χ(2) = 6.888, P = 0.0319). Risks for the individuals in the highest tertile were doubled when compared to the lowest (adjusted OR = 2.261, 95%CI: 1.497 - 3.416, P = 0.002). A positive correlation was observed between serum calcium level and the risk of liver cirrhosis (χ(2) = 6.842, P = 0.0089).Conclusion:from our study revealed that the elevated serum calcium level might be an independent risk factor for liver cirrhosis. However, further investigations are anticipated to explore its potential mechanisms.
