Background:Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is emerging as a key mediator of carcinogenesis that characterizes host-environment interactions. Epidemiological studies investigating the association between two polymorphisms of IL-1B (-511C/T and +3954C/T) and cancer susceptibility have shown conflicting results. The aim of this study is to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship.Methods:Related studies were identified through a systematic literature search of PubMed and Web of Science from their inception to September 15, 2012. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the IL-1B -511C/T and +3954C/T polymorphisms and cancer risk were calculated. Heterogeneity among studies and publication bias were also tested.Results:The meta-analysis included 91 case-control studies in 85 publications, 81 studies for the -511C/T (19547 cases and 23935 controls) and 26 studies for the +3954C/T polymorphisms (8083 cases and 9183). The pooled results indicated that IL-1B +3954C/T (dominant model: OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.30) was significantly associated with increased overall cancer risk, especially among hospital-based case-control studies (dominant model: OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02-1.66). As for -511C/T, we observed an inverse relationship in cervical cancer (dominant model: OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.35-2.23) and hepatocellular carcinoma (dominant model: OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47-0.99). Moreover, -511C/T was associated with risk of specific subtypes of gastric carcinoma.Conclusion:This meta-analysis suggested that both the IL-1B -511C/T and +3954C/T polymorphisms might modulate cancer susceptibility. Further well-designed studies based on larger sample sizes should be performed to confirm the findings.
