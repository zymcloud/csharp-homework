Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) is an important force in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To extend our study, we examined here the role of AEG-1 in anti-metastatic effects of Huaier polysaccharide (HP) on the human HCC MHCC97-H cell line. AEG-1 shRNA contributed to the anti-proliferation effect of HP on MHCC97-H cells. Furthermore, results of Transwell insert chambers showed that low expression of AEG-1 could effectively facilitate HP to suppress MHCC97-H cell migration and invasion. We achieved this by reducing phosphoinositide 3-kinases (P13K) and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) expression as well as enhancing natural killer (NK) cell activity. Taken together, our data strongly suggested that AEG-1 shRNA could block the carcinogenesis and progression of MHCC97-H cells and highlight the therapeutic potential of HP in HCC treatment, at least by part, by inhibiting the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and enhancing the NK cell-mediated immune response. These findings may provide a new strategy for HCC treatment.
