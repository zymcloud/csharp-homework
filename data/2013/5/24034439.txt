Background & aims:Liver fibrosis is prognostic of outcomes among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We evaluated the accuracy of non-invasive markers and liver biopsy in predicting morbidity and mortality in CHC patients.Methods:Compensated CHC patients were evaluated over a 10-year period. Non-invasive markers including Hepascore, FIB-4, APRI and liver biopsy results were retrospectively collated. Follow-up morbidity and mortality data were obtained from the Western Australian Data Linkage System. The prognostic significance of baseline non-invasive markers and biopsy were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:A total of 406 subjects (64% male, mean age 48 Â± 11 years) were followed up for 2385 person-years, during which there were 22 (5.4%) deaths including 14 (3.4%) who died from liver disease or required liver transplantation. Sixteen (3.9%) subjects developed liver decompensation. Hepascore and liver biopsy (P 0.5 was associated with increased overall mortality [Hazard Ratio (95%CI) 6.7 (2.6-17), P Conclusion:Hepascore is predictive of overall and liver-related mortality and morbidity in CHC patients with comparable accuracy to liver biopsy. Hepascore may be a useful prognostic marker in clinical practice.
