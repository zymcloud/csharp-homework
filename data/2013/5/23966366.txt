Background:Increased age is linked with a higher cancer risk according to model calculations. Patients with severe atherosclerotic aortic stenosis are of old age, therefore, a high incidence of malignancies should be found.Purpose:To evaluate the prevalence of clinically significant and potentially malignant incidental findings at computed tomographic angiography (CTA) performed in patients with severe aortic stenosis being assessed as to their suitability for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).Material and methods:Between August 2008 and April 2010, CTA of the thoraco-abdominal aorta and the pelvic arterial vessels was performed in 131 patients. There were 62 women (47%) and 69 men (53%); the mean age was 81.6 years (range, 64-91 years). Incidental findings were recorded and categorized as potentially malignant, clinically significant, and clinically insignificant. Clinically significant findings were defined as those requiring immediate therapy, intervention or imaging, or follow-up examination.Results:Of the 131 study patients, 31 (23.7%) presented significant extravascular incidental findings, 19 (14.5%) in the thorax, and 12 (9.2%) in the abdomen. Five lesions (3.8%) were considered potentially malignant, three of them (2.3%) were new and highly suspicious for malignancies (two renal cell carcinomas and one hepatocellular carcinoma). In two patients (1.5%) mediastinal lymphadenopathy was found (recurrent malignant lymphoma und new metastases from known bladder cancer).Conclusion:The prevalence of highly suspicious malignant incidental findings in patients undergoing TAVR is 3.8% with an average age of 81.6 years which is not high compared to prevalence in the literature dealing with patients aged
