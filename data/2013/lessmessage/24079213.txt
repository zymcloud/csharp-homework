Background:Hepatectomy is an accepted standard of care for patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases (CLM). Given that it is unclear whether disparities exist between different patient populations, a population-based analysis was performed to analyze this issue with regards to resection rates and surgical mortality in patients with CLM.Methods:Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, characteristics and outcomes of adult patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and colorectal metastases that subsequently underwent a liver resection during the years 1993-2007 were identified. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the effects of demographic and clinical covariables on resection rates and in-hospital mortality.Results:Incident colorectal and liver metastases were identified in 138,565 patients; 3,528 patients (2.6%) underwent subsequent resection. African American and Hispanic race were associated with lower resection rates compared to Caucasian patients (adjusted OR 0.61 (0.52 - 0.71) and 0.81 (0.68 - 0.96) respectively). Medicaid insurance was associated with decreased resection rates compared to private insurance (AOR 0.47 (0.40 - 0.56)). The overall inpatient mortality rate was 3.1%. Multivariate analysis determined that mortality rate was correlated to both insurance status and geographic region.Conclusions:The national resection rate is significantly lower than has been reported by most case series. Race and insurance status appear to be correlated to the likelihood of surgical resection. In-hospital mortality is equivalent to the rates reported elsewhere, but is correlated to insurance status and region.
