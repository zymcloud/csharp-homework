Background:Glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is an important phase II enzyme that can protect cells from oxidative stress in various human cancers. However, few clinical studies were undertaken on the relationship between GSTP1 and oxidative stress in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study was therefore aimed to evaluate the potential associations between GSTP1 and oxidative stress in HCC patients.Methods:The GSTP1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was determined by flow cytometry from 38 HCC patients and 38 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The GSTP1 mRNA level in PBMCs was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the oxidative stress status, including plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), xanthine oxidase (XOD), reduced glutathione hormone (GSH) and glutathione-S-transferases (GST).Results:Significantly decreased GSTP1 protein expression was found in HCC patients than in CHB patients (PConclusion:We demonstrated that the reduced GSTP1 expression might contribute to oxidative stress in the development of HCC from CHB.
