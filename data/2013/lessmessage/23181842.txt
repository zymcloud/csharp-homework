Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV has also been associated with various common and uncommon glomerular diseases, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN). We report a patient with chronic HBV infection who presented with atypical features of IgAN with management and long-term follow-up. Much of the data on the treatment of HBV-associated glomerular diseases come from patients with membranous nephropathy, whereas the information on treatment of other glomerulopathies remains largely anecdotal. To the best of our knowledge, treatment of an adult patient with HBV-associated nephrotic syndrome from IgAN with pegylated interferon has not been previously reported. Treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b in our patient resulted in complete clinical remission of the nephrotic syndrome as well as a dramatic decrease in HBV viral load. Patient continued to remain in clinical remission 5 years after treatment.
