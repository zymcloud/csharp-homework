Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF), a heparin-binding growth factor, has a wide range of biological functions, including mitogenic activity and vascular development. Recent studies demonstrated that HDGF also acted as an oncogene with aberrantly increased activity in multiple human cancers; however, little is known about the biological function of HDGF in gallbladder cancer (GBC). In this study, we focused on the clinical significance and biological functions of HDGF in GBC and found that Nuclear HDGF protein overexpression was frequently detected in GBC tissues. Patients with nuclear HDGF-positive tumors had worse overall survival than patients with HDGF-negative tumors. Furthermore, treatment of GBC lines with HDGF-targeting siRNA oligonucleotides (HDGF-siRNA) significantly reduced the proliferation of GBC-SD and SGC-996 cell lines and diminished both anchorage-independent growth on soft agar and cell migration. These data indicate that HDGF acts as a putative oncogene in GBC and could be a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for GBC.
