Background/aims:The purpose of comprehensive treatment for early gastric cancer (EGC) is curing tumor, prevention of recurrence or metastasis. The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinical pathological characteristics of EGC, and to find out factors which influence lymph node metastasis.Methodology:Records of 417 patients with EGC who underwent surgery from January 1996 to December 2006 were collected. The information including general characteristics, tumor relevant factors, surgical complications, clinical manifestations and pathological features, were evaluated.Results:EGC accounted for 6.03% of total gastric cancer (GC) cases. In EGC subjects, mucosal cancer and sub-mucosal cancer accounted for 55.2% and 44.8%, respectively; 11.5% (48/417) of patients were found with positive lymph nodes metastasis, the incidence of lymph node metastasis was 5.64% (168/2979); 6 cases were found with liver metastasis; 96.64% of patients undertook radical surgical treatment; 5 cases with positive upper incisal margin (1.2%). Logistic regression analysis showed that multiple original tumors, lesions of over 2cm, tumor invasion to the submucosa, poor differentiation, and vascular tumor thrombus, were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in EGC.Conclusions:The risk factors of lymph node metastasis should be noticed and evaluated in EGC treatment.
