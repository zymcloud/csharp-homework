Background and aims:Abnormal body composition such as severe skeletal muscle depletion or sarcopenia has emerged as an independent predictor of clinical outcomes in a variety of clinical conditions. This study is the first study to report the frequency and prognostic significance of sarcopenia as a marker of nutritional status in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:We analyzed 116 patients with HCC who were consecutively evaluated for liver transplant. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area was measured by CT. Sarcopenia was defined using previously established cutpoints.Results:Ninety-eight patients were males (85%), and the mean age was 58Â±6 years. Sarcopenia was present in 35 patients (30%). By univariate Cox analysis, male sex (HR, 3.84; P=0.02), lumbar skeletal muscle index (HR, 0.97; P=0.04), INR (HR, 8.18; PConclusions:Sarcopenia is present in almost one third of patients with HCC, and constitutes a strong and independent risk factor for mortality. Our results highlight the importance of body composition assessment in clinical practice.
