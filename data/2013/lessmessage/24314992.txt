We report our experience with a 61-year-old patient with alcoholic and hepatitis C cirrhosis who underwent liver transplantation. On the 3rd postoperative day he presented a mediastinitis secondary to esophageal perforation produced by a Linton tube. An esophagectomy with jejunostomy was performed. Tacrolimus granules for oral suspension (Modigraf) were administered through the jejunostomy. This case report highlights the use of Modigraf and the absence of secondary effects. We observed biochemical parameters during the jejunostomy period. We discuss the administration strategy applied and whether tacrolimus granules for oral suspension by jejunostomy affect the bioavailability and its side effects.
