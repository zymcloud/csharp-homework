Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has long been the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, some aspects of the pathogenesis of HBV infection and genesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still inconclusive. An increasing number of published studies indicate that hepatitis B virus mutations are associated with risk of HCC. These variations include, in particular, mutations in ORF S,C,X gene regions. This mini-review summarizes results of clinical studies and molecular mechanisms on the possible relations of HBV mutations with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
