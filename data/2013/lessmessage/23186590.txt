Background/aims:To clarify any association between the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:The PubMed, CNKI databases were searched for all available articles. The OR corresponding to the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to assess the association between hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and susceptibility to HCC.Results:Seven case-control studies, with 1,663 cases and 1,675 controls, were available for this analysis. No association was found between hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism and HCC risk (dominant model: OR=0.695, 95% CI: 0.501-0.964, p=0.029; additive model: OR=0.682, 95% CI: 0.374-1.245, p=0.213; recessive model: OR=1.215, 95% CI: 0.711-2.078, p=0.476). Sensitivity analysis did not perturb the results.Conclusions:These findings indicated that hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism may not play a role in HCC development. However, larger scale studies are needed for confirmation.
