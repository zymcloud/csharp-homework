Background:Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are a relatively common malignancy in young men. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological features and survival of young Turkish patients with TGCT.Materials and methods:In this retrospective study, the clinical and pathological characteristics of young Turkish patients with TGCT who were monitored by the Department of Medical Oncology of a military hospital between 2008 and 2013 were investigated. Overall survival data were analyzed.Results:Ninety-six patients were included in the study. The mean age was 26.4 years. Among the patients, 17.7% had seminoma and 43.8% had mixed non-seminomatous germ cell tumors. Some 46.9% were Stage I, 30.2% were Stage II, and 22.9 were Stage III. Of the patients, 83.3% received chemotherapy, 25% underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND), 3.1% received radiotherapy, and 12.5% were followed-up without treatment. In addition, 18.8% of the patients were administered salvage chemotherapy due to relapse or progression. The 5-year overall survival rate was 90.2% for all patients. The 2-year overall survival rate was 100% for Stage I patients, 94% for Stage II patients, and 70.2% for Stage III patients. The difference between the survival curves of stages was statistically significant (p=0.029).Conclusions:In young Turkish patients with TGCT, good results were obtained with appropriate treatment, most receiving chemotherapy. The prognosis of the disease was good even in the advanced stage.
