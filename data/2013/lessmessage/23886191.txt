Background:S100A14 has recently been implicated in the progress of several types of cancers. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance and possible mechanisms of action of S100A14 in the invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:S100A14 expression in HCC was detected at mRNA and protein levels and its prognostic significance was assessed. Functional roles of S100A14 in HCC were investigated using MTT, BrdU, wound healing, transwell invasion assay and HCC metastatic mouse model.Results:S100A14 was significantly elevated in HCC tissues, correlated with multiple tumor nodes, high Edmondson-Steiner grade and vascular invasion. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the S100A14 expression level was a significant and independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) of HCC patients (hazard ratio=1.98, 95% confidence interval=1.14-3.46, P=0.013). S100A14 promoted cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis of HCC in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion:These results suggest S100A14 is a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.
