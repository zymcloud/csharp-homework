Splenectomy may be a treatment option in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis when there is no potential donor for liver transplantation. We retrospectively investigated the long-term outcome of splenectomy on survival in advanced cirrhotic patients with HCC and thrombocytopenia. Between 1999 and 2009, 46 cirrhotic patients with thrombocytopenia (Child-Pugh class B or C) who underwent splenectomy for the simultaneous or secondary treatment of HCC at our institute were evaluated. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 93.5, 76.0, and 37.9%, respectively. Splenectomy resulted in a significant reduction in mean portal venous pressure from 21.2 to 16.8 mmHg and improvements in liver function tests such as total bilirubin, prothrombin time, platelet count, Child-Pugh score for 3 years, and albumin for 2 years. The mean frequency of treatment for HCC recurrence after surgery was 3.0 times (range 1-11). Seven patients out of 16 scheduled for Interferon (IFN) therapy after surgery achieved a sustained virological response (SVR). Multivariate analysis identified SVR after IFN therapy as an independent significant prognostic factor (Hazard ratio 0.18, 95%CI 0.03-0.65, P=0.006). Postoperative complications including liver failure (n=1), portal thrombosis (n=7), ascites (n=5), and bacterial infections (n=4) were observed in 14 patients (30%). Splenectomy can be a feasible supportive therapy for the continuation of anticancer therapy and completion of IFN therapy based on improvements in liver function and thrombocytopenia with minimum complications in patients with HCC and advanced cirrhosis with no potential donor.
