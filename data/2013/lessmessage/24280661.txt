Background:Portal vein embolization (PVE) is considered to improve the safety of major hepatectomy. Various conditions might affect remnant liver hypertrophy after PVE. The aim of the present study was to clarify the factors that affect remnant liver hypertrophy and to establish a prediction formula for the hypertrophy ratio.Methods:Fifty-nine patients who underwent preoperative PVE for cholangiocarcinoma (39 patients), metastatic carcinoma (10 patients), hepatocellular carcinoma (8 patients), and other diseases (2 patients) were enrolled in this study. For the prediction of the hypertrophy ratio, a formula with stepwise multiple regression analysis was set up. The following parameters were used: age, gender, future liver remnant ratio to total liver (FLR%), plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (ICGK), platelet count, prothrombin activity, serum albumin, serum total bilirubin at the time of PVE and the maximum value before PVE (Max Bil), as well as a history of cholangitis, diabetes mellitus, and chemotherapy.Results:The mean hypertrophy ratio was 28.8%. The 5 parameters detected as predictive factors were age (p = 0.015), FLR% (p Conclusions:The prediction formula can prognosticate the hypertrophy ratio after PVE, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for major hepatectomy.
