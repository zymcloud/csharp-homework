Although surfactin is able to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and to induce cancer cell apoptosis, the molecular mechanism responsible for this process remain elusive. In this study, the signaling network underlying the apoptosis of human hepatoma (HepG2) cells induced by surfactin was investigated. It is found that the reaction oxygen species (ROS) production and intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) accumulation are both induced HepG2 cells apoptosis. The [Ca(2+)]i exaltation was partly depended on the Ca(2+) release from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and ryanodine (Ry) receptors channels, which both triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). The results showed that surfactin induced the ROS production and ROS production led to ERS. The occurrence of ERS increased the [Ca(2+)]i level and the processes associated with blocking extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. According to a comprehensive review of all the evidence, it is concluded that surfactin induces apoptosis of HepG2 cells through a ROS-ERS-Ca(2+) mediated ERK pathway.
