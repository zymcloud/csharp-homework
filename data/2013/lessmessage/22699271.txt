The prognosis of stage IV renal cell carcinoma is very poor, since non-operative modalities for advanced renal carcinoma have failed to yield effective results. In fact, there is no indication for radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy is not effective. Surgery, when indicated, seems to be the only therapeutic option possible.. Hepatectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma is very rarely reported, because multiple organ metastases ordinarily coexist. We report a case of a 61-year-old woman with a bilateral renal clear cell carcinoma, two synchronous liver metastasisi synchronous hepatic metastasis that were treated simultaneously with radical right nephrectomy, left upper pole kidney tumorectomy and right lateral liver sectorectomy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of a double liver metastasis and double renal carcinomas treated simultaneously. We discuss the specific features concerning the treatment of this unusual case.
