Background/aims:There is no consensus for laparoscopy first in patients with rectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases, whose metastases are confined to the liver. This study aimed to evaluate its indications for one-stage surgery in laparoscopy.Materials and methods:Eighteen patients with rectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases, who had undergone laparoscopic colorectal resection and simultaneous treatment for liver metastases, were retrospectively reviewed.Results:Concomitant with laparoscopic colorectal resection, eight patients received liver resection simultaneously; 10 patients underwent a variety of down-staging management including local ablation, right hepatic portal vein ligation, and implantation of chemotherapy pumps into the hepatic artery. The colo-anal/rectal anastomoses were performed with a stapler or "pull-though" mode though the anus. Three patients underwent two-stage liver resection following tumor down-staging. Median survival time was 22.3 months.Conclusions:Laparoscopy approach for rectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases is feasible in selected patients. Colon pull-through anastomosis was a potential method to avoid abdominal incision and decrease the risk of anastomotic leakage. It is worth further investigation regarding its advantages over traditional modalities with a prospective randomized controlled study.
