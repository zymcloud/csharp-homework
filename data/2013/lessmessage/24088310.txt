Background/aims:Interferon (IFN) improves the prognosis of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients. However, the effects of IFN therapy for second hepatectomy (Hx) for recurrent HCC have not been established.Methodology:Subjects included 96 patients who underwent a second Hx for recurrence of HCV-related HCC. Forty-four patients received IFN therapy past or postoperatively of the first Hx. Twenty of those patients attained a sustained viral response (SVR). The other 24 were non-responders (NR) and 52 patients who had not received IFN therapy (non-IFN) were classified as the NR/non-IFN group.Results:Overall survival (SVR group vs. NR/non-IFN group: 5-yr, 91.7 vs. 51.0%; p = 0.012) and disease-free survival (SVR group vs. NR/non-IFN group: 3-yr, 64.7 vs. 25.9%; p = 0.006) rates were significantly different in both groups. By multivariate analysis, NR/non-IFN therapy, was the independent risk factor for overall survival (p = 0.025) and disease-free survival (p = 0.006) after second Hx.Conclusions:SVR achieved past or postoperatively of the first Hx of HCV-related HCC significantly inhibits recurrence and consequently improves patient survival after second Hx for recurrent HCC. Patients with SVR to IFN therapy would be good candidates for second Hx for recurrent HCC.
