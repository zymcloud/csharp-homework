Association of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis with colon carcinoma has occasionally been reported. We report a case of acute cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis that developed over two weeks after liver resection due to metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. The primary tumor had earlier been resected and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. No actual infection was found and the medication was not changed recently except for the prophylaxis cephalosporin for five days at the time of liver resection. The patient received corticosteroid therapy and had remission of vasculitis at one month control but still ongoing haematuria. Eight months after liver resection colonoscopy, contrast enhanced whole-body computed tomography, tumour markers and urine red cell count showed no significant findings.
