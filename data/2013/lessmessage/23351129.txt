Liver transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis. This study was conducted to determine the impact of pre-transplant locoregional therapy (LRT) on HCC and our institution's experience with expansion to United Network of Organ Sharing Region 4 T3 (R4T3) criteria. Two hundred and twenty-five patients with HCC (176 meeting Milan and 49 meeting R4T3 criteria) underwent liver transplantation from 2002 to 2008. Compared with the Milan criteria, HCCs in R4T3 criteria displayed less favorable biological features such as higher median alpha-fetoprotein level (21.9 vs. 8.5 ng/mL, p = 0.01), larger tumor size, larger tumor number, and higher incidence of microvascular invasion (22% vs. 5%, p = 0.002). As a result, patients meeting Milan criteria had better five-yr survival (79% vs. 69%, p = 0.03) and a trend toward lower HCC recurrence rates (5% vs. 13%, p = 0.05). Pre-transplant LRT did not affect post-transplant outcomes in patients meeting Milan criteria but did result in lower three-yr HCC recurrence (7% vs. 75%, p
