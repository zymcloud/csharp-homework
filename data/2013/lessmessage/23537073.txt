Gastric cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer and the second cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The early diagnosis of gastric cancer is fundamental in decreasing the mortality rates. It has been shown that MPV level is a sign of inflammation in hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study is to examine whether MPV would be a useful inflammatory marker for differentiating gastric cancer patients from healthy controls. Thirty-one gastric cancer patients and 31 age-sexes matched healthy subjects included into the study. Patients with hypertension, hematological and renal disease, heart failure, chronic infection, hepatic disorder and other cancer were excluded from the study. MPV level was significantly higher in pre-operative gastric cancer patients compared to healthy subjects (8.31 fL vs. 7.85; p: 0.007). ROC analysis suggested 8.25 fL as the cut-off value for MPV (AUC: 0.717, sensitivity: 61%, specificity: 81%). Surgical tumor resection resulted in a significant decrease in MPV level (8.31 fL vs. 7.55 fL; p: 0.001). No significant difference was found in MPV level between the post-operative group and control subjects. We did not find statistically significant difference between MPV and TNM stages. In conclusion, changes in MPV values may be used as an easily available biomarker for monitoring the healthy patients for GC risk and may prompt physicians to make an early diagnosis of GC.
