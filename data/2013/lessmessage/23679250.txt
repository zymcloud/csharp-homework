Objective:This work aimed to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with c-arm cone-beam CT guided synchronous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treatment of large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:21 patients with large HCC were studied from January 2010 to March 2012. TACE combined with synchronous C-arm cone-beam CT guided RFA were performed on a total of 25 lesions. Conventional imaging examination (CEUS, enhanced CT or MRI) and AFP detection were regularly conducted to evaluate the technical success rate of combined treatment, complications, treatment response, time without disease recurrence and survival rate.Results:The technical success rate of combined treatment was 100%, without any significant complication. After 1 month, there were 19 cases with complete response and 2 cases with partial response, with an complete response rate of 90.4% (19/21) and a clinical effective rate of 100% (21/21). The complete response rates of single nodular lesions (100%, 17/17) was significantly higher than that of multiple nodular lesions (50%, 2/4) (P Conclusion:TACE combined with synchronous C-arm CT guided RFA is safe and effective for treatment of large HCC. The treatment efficacy for single nodular lesion is better than that for multiple nodular lesions.
