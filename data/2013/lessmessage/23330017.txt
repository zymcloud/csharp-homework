Hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant liver tumor between the age of 6 months and 3 years, but it is extremely rare in adults. Only Forty-five cases of adult hepatoblastoma were reported up to now in the world. Hepatoblastoma exhibits a wide range of epithelial and mesenchymal lines differentiation, but neuroendocrine differentiation of this tumor has rare been reported in the literature. Here, we reported a case of primary giant hepatoblastoma (about 11.4*7.9*15.3 cm) with neuroendocrine differentiation of a 32-year-old woman, which was misdiagnosed as neuroendocrine tumor.
