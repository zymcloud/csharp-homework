Aim:To evaluate the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using a suspension of a fine-powder formulation of cisplatin (DDPH) in lipiodol (LPD) in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The subjects were 262 HCC patients treated with TACE using a DDPH-LPD suspension. The DDPH-LPD suspension was prepared by mixing 50 mg of DDPH into 10 mL of LPD. TACE was repeated when treated lesions relapsed and/or new hepatic lesions were detected. These patients received additional TACE using the same agent. TACE was repeated until complete regression of the tumor was obtained. The primary efficacy endpoint of the current study was the objective early response rate. Secondary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival.Results:The objective early response rate was 43.6%. Cumulative PFS rates were 56.7% at 6 mo, 23.1% at 12 mo, 13.4% at 18 mo, and 10.5% at 24 mo. The median PFS was 6.6 mo. Cumulative survival rates were 90.6% at 6 mo, 81.9% at 12 mo, 70.5% at 24 mo, and 58.8% at 36 mo. Median survival time was 46.6 mo. All adverse reactions were controllable by temporary suspension of treatment. No serious complications or treatment-related deaths were observed.Conclusion:TACE using a suspension of DDPH in LPD may be a useful treatment for HCC.
