Introduction:Combined liver-kidney transplantation (LKT) is the best therapeutic option for patients with end-stage liver and kidney disease.Objectives:To analyze baseline characteristics and clinical outcome of LKT compared to isolated liver transplantation (LT).Material and methods:The study included 16 LKT performed between 1998 and 2006 and 32 LT matched by age, sex, date and indication for transplantation. Demographic, pretransplant, post-transplant and survival variables were analyzed.Results:As planned by the study design, mean age, distribution by sex and indication for LT were similar between groups. The most common indication for LT was HCV- and/or alcohol-induced cirrhosis. The most common indication for KT was renal failure, in most cases secondary to glomerulonephritis. Twelve patients (69%) were on dialysis before LKT. Hepatocellular carcinoma and diabetes mellitus pre-transplantation were similar between groups. However pretransplant arterial hypertension (AHT) was higher in LKT than LT (50% vs. 19%; p = 0.02). In the post-transplant: reoperation due to bleeding, bacterial infections, liver rejection, AHT and median creatinine levels at 1st and 3rd years were similar in LKT and LT. In contrast, early post-transplant dialysis was higher in LKT than LT (31% vs. 3%; p = 0.01). Survival rates at 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th years were similar in both groups (87.5%, 74%, 74% and 66% vs. 81%, 75%, 75% and 75% in LT and LKT, respectively).Conclusions:LKT is an effective therapeutic option in patients with end-stage liver and kidney disease. Most early and late complications and long-term survival are similar to those observed with LT.
