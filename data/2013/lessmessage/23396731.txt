This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of entecavir and/or tenofovir in compensated (CC) or decompensated (DC) hepatitis B cirrhotic patients in real-life clinical practice. Of the 48 patients, included between April 2007 and March 2010, 12 were DC. The mean age was 55 ± 12.2 years, 85.4% were Caucasians and 8 patients were HBeAg positive. Mean viral load was 5.2 ± 1.9 log(10) UI/mL. HBV-DNA undetectability at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were 53.3%, 78.3%, 83.7% and 97.1%, respectively, similar in CC and DC. At 6 and 12 months, ≥ 80% of CC achieved ALT normalization, while only 42.9% and 71.4% in DC. After a median follow-up of 27.1 (0.7-45.3) months, 43 patients were Child Pugh Turcotte (CPT) class A (n = 39 at entry). In DC, progressive improvement in the MELD scores was observed: 12.73 (SD 4.5), 10.4 (SD 3.6) and 8.2 (SD 2.6), at baseline, 12 and 24 months, respectively. During follow-up, 7 patients died, 4 received liver transplantation and 5 developed hepatocellular carcinoma. In three out of four DC who died due to hepatic causes, these events occurred between the first 0.7 and 6.7 months, and all were CPT class C. Cumulative survival in CC vs. DC at 12 and 24 months were 94.4% vs. 66.7%, and 88.2% vs. 57.1%, respectively (log rank p = 0.03). No severe adverse events associated with entecavir or tenofovir were reported. In conclusion, in compensated and decompensated cirrhotic patients, entecavir and tenofovir were effective and well tolerated.
