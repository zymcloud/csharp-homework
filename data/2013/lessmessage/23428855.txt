Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is widely performed in 32% of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at initial diagnosis and in 58% of those with recurrent HCC in Japan. However, the patient population which undergoes TACE is heterogeneous, and thus the 3-year survival rate varies from 26 to 47%. The selection criteria for TACE is 2-3 tumors >3 cm or 4 or more tumors in patients with liver damage A/B (corresponding well to Child-Pugh class A/B) and absence of vascular invasion and extrahepatic spread, as proposed by Japanese guidelines. The 3-year survival rate of TACE for patients with 2-3 tumors >3 cm or 4 or more tumors was 55 and 46%, respectively, in Child-Pugh A and 30 and 22%, respectively, in class B. These outcomes could help in understanding the various results of TACE in different backgrounds in the East and West. Recently, TACE with calibrated drug-eluting beads loaded with doxorubicin showed a similar tumor response and radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres demonstrated a similar median survival compared with conventional TACE. Based on these results, the combination of TACE and novel molecular targeted agents can be used to elucidate the synergic effect on survival.
