The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a genetic variant in the multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. This case-control study was conducted in a Chinese population of 645 HCC cases and 658 cancer-free controls. The genotype of the c.3751G>A genetic variant in the MDR1 gene was investigated by created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction (CRS-PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. Our data demonstrated significantly differences detected in the allelic and genotypic frequencies between HCC cases and those of cancer-free controls. Association analyses indicated that there were statistically increased risk of HCC in the homozygote comparison (AA versus (vs.) GG: OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.51-3.27, χ(2) = 16.90, P Ga/gg:OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.47-3.09, χ(2) = 16.68, P A genetic variant in the MDR1 gene is potentially related to HCC susceptibility in a Chinese Han population, and might be used as a molecular marker for evaluating HCC susceptibility.
