The aim of this study is to explore the inhibitory effects of RNA interference (RNAi) targeting NET-1 or combined with sorafenib on HCC in vitro and in vivo and the possible underlying mechanisms. The expressions of NET-1 mRNA and protein were detected by RT-QPCR and western blot. The ability of proliferation was determined by CCK-8 assay. Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry (FCM). Abilities of migration and invasion were measured by scratch-wound assay and transwell assay. MHCC97H cells with stable transfection of NET-1shRNA were injected subcutaneously to prepare nude mice model of HCC and Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 mRNAs of tumor tissues in different groups were examined. NET-1 mRNA and protein were reduced sharply in MHCC97H cells transfected with NET-1shRNA. The abilities of proliferation and migration were inhibited and apoptosis was promoted in either NET-1shRNA or sorafenib as compared with untreated cells in vitro and in vivo (P
