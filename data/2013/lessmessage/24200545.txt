Introduction:Primary hepatic lymphoma is a rare malignancy which misdiagnosis and mistreatment is very frequent. Differential diagnosis of the hepatic lesion, based on the noninvolvement of blood vessels, includes: fatty infiltration, cirrhosis, amyloid infiltration, primary hepatomas, and metastatic neoplasms.Presentation of case:We describe a case of a 69-year-old man who presented with 15% weight loss and general fatigue over the previous 9 months. Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly without lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 13cm×9cm×11cm tumor on the right liver associated with normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). After two negatives ultrasonography-guided needle liver biopsies, the third one showed diffuse infiltration of large sized lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemical findings demonstrated the B-lymphocyte lineage of the tumor. The patient received R-CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab) with good response.Discussion:It is important to recognize PHL because it responds favorably to chemotherapy and may have a better prognosis than hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic disease of the liver. When imaging findings on CT scans and MRI are nonspecific, a biopsy is needed not only for a definitive diagnosis but also for identifying the immunophenotype of the PHL. This type of lesion is highly chemosensitive and early aggressive chemotherapy may result in sustained remission.Conclusion:This case emphasizes the importance of effective recognition of PHL considering its good response to chemotherapy and the possibility of sustained remission if early aggressive treatment is implemented.
