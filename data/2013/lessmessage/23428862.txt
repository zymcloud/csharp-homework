Objective:External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is recommended as a therapeutic strategy for stage III hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in national guidelines of the Chinese Society of Liver Disease and in Korea Liver Cancer Study Group practice guidelines, but has not been considered a therapeutic option for HCC in Western countries. In this study, we review evidence supporting EBRT as an option for HCC treatment.Methods:Retrospective investigation was made of 775 patient records of intermediate/advanced HCC treated in our hospital during the last 10 years, including 98 patients with confined intrahepatic tumor, 181 with portal vein (PV) or inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombi, 191 with lymph node metastases, 55 with adrenal gland metastases, 205 with bone metastases, 13 with lung metastases and 32 with brain metastases.Results:Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization combined with radiotherapy was found to constitute an improved therapeutic strategy for unresectable but confined intrahepatic HCC with poor lipid accumulation. Survival of HCC patients with PV/IVC tumor thrombi was prolonged to 10.7 months by radiotherapy, and it was 8.0 months in patients with abdominal lymph node metastasis. Radiotherapy also shrinks adrenal and lung metastatic HCC lesions, resulting in median survival times of 13.6 and progression-free survival of 13.4 months, respectively. In bone metastatic HCC, radiotherapy significantly relieved symptoms, although median survival time was only 7.4 months. Radiotherapy is effective for treatment of intermediate/advanced stages of HCC. Although our finding is based only on retrospective analysis, no therapeutic option that provides better treatment than EBRT in this indication has thus far been identified. Because sorafenib has been recommended as a treatment strategy by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for HCC, we compared the survival after EBRT with sorafenib treatment on the basis of published clinical data. From this comparison, we found that EBRT treatment was more effective than sorafenib for improving patient survival when tested on tumors of comparable metastatic size.Conclusion:Based on the evidence reviewed, we propose that EBRT be included in the NCCN guideline as a treatment strategy for intermediate/advanced HCC.
