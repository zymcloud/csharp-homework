Background/aim:Cyclin G1 is a cell-cycle-regulatory protein that is frequently seen in elevated amounts in malignant tissue, including astrocytomas; melanoma; carcinoma of the esophagus, lung, and breast; as well as cancer of the cervix, uterus, and ovary. By contrast, it has demonstrated inhibitory activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methodology:We investigated the role of cyclin G1 in HCC tissue obtained from 76 donors using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis to explore its relationship with HCC pathology and univariate and multivariate analyses to explore its relationship with surgical prognosis and patient survival.Results:We found that cyclin G1 levels were increased in normal tissue compared with HCC tissue and vary over the course of the cell cycle, with equal distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm observed during normal serum support and accelerated release from the nucleus into the cytoplasm observed during serum starvation.Conclusion:Our findings suggest a role for cyclin G1 in anti-HCC gene therapy.
