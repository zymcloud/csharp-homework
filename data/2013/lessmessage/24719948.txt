Background/aims:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumor thrombi (BDTT) is a rare event. The Bmi1 gene has been reported to play important roles in cancer initiation and progression. In this study, the expression of Bmi1 in HCC with BDTT was investigated.Methodology:The expression of Bmi1 was examined immunohistochemically in HCC patients with BDTT (B+ group), HCC patients with vascular invasion (V+ group) and combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (C+ group), respectively. Besides, the Bmi1 mRNA level was investigated by real time PCR in the fresh samples obtained from 13 cases in B+ group, 10 cases in V+ group, and 6 cases in C+ group, respectively.Results:Immunohistochemical staining for Bmi1 showed Bmi1 was highly expressed in the B+ group in comparison with the C+ group and the V+ group, respectively. The Bmi1 mRNA level by real time PCR also showed that it was significantly up-regulated in B+ group compared with those of C+ group and V+ group, respectively. However, there was no statistically significant difference in Bmi1 levels between the subjects with vascular invasion and the subjects without vascular invasion.Conclusions:Bmi1 might play important roles in the development of BDTT in HCC.
