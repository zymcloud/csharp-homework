Purpose:Liver failure is a major cause of early mortality following hepatectomy. The future-remnant liver function is an important factor when assessing the risk for postoperative liver functional impairment. Several techniques have been established for this evaluation, including the indocyanine green (ICG) test. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ICG clearance in patients scheduled for liver resection regarding perioperative and postoperative risk factors.Methods:Thirty-one patients, scheduled for liver resection, underwent the ICG test. Peri-operative and postoperative variables were recorded and analyzed using non-parametric tests.Results:Procedures extended from wedge excisions to extended hepatectomies. Plasma disappearance rate (PDR) was found positively correlated with total blood loss, transfusion and operation duration. There were 11 primary hepatic malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas, 13 metastatic carcinomas, mainly of colorectal origin, and 7 benign lesions. The uninvolved liver parenchyma was normal in 20 (64. 5%) cases. Two patients died due to myocardial infarction and postoperative liver failure, respectively.Conclusion:The role of residual liver function and particularly the hepatic reserve assessment on liver surgery may be of most benefit in the routine stratification of risk, enabling surgical procedures to be performed with safety. The ICG clearance markers were found significantly correlated with perioperative risk factors in histologically "normal" liver parenchyma. In addition to computed tomographic (CT) volumetry, functional assessment of the hepatic reserve with the ICG test may persuade the preoperative planning and prevent postoperative liver failure.
