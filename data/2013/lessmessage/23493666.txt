The human X-ray repair complementing group 1 gene (XRCC1) is an important candidate gene influencing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility. The objective of this study was to detect the association between c.1161G>A and c.1779C>G variants of XRCC1 gene and HCC risk. This study was conducted in Chinese population consisting of 623 HCC cases and 639 controls. These two genetic variants could be genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The association of XRCC1 gene variants with the risk of HCC was investigated under different genetic models. Our findings suggested that the genotypes/alleles from c.1161G>A and c.1779C>G genetic variants were statistically associated with HCC risk. As for the c.1161G>A, the AA genotype was statistically associated with the increased risk of HCC compared to GG wild genotype (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.63-3.40, P G, the risk of HCC was significantly higher for GG genotype compared to CC wild genotype (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.51-3.12, P A and allele-G of c.1779C>G variants may contribute to the susceptibility of HCC (A versus G: OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.26-1.75, P
