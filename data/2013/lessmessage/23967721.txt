Haemangiopericytoma is a rare tumor of vascular origin. We report the case of patient with severe refractory anaemia due to peripheral destruction of red blood cells by spleen metastases. Anaemia was successfully treated by splenectomy. Afterwards, our patient developed liver and lung metastases and was treated, in a clinical trial, with gefitinib that stabilised the disease during nine years. These interesting features are discussed.
