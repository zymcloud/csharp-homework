Objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently recurs even after curative resection. The purpose of this study was to examine how background liver affects postoperative recurrence of HCC that underwent curative resection using expression of cancer-related molecules in the adjacent noncancerous liver of HCC patients.Methods:We examined expression of E-cadherin and vascular endothelial growth factor in noncancerous liver tissues of 133 HCC patients who underwent curative resection of tumors using immunohistochemical analysis. Associations between expressions of these molecules and disease-free survival of HCC were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:The average period of follow-up of the patients was 6.7 years. Multivariate analyses revealed that low platelet count and negative expression of E-cadherin in adjacent noncancerous liver were significantly associated with metastatic recurrence [p = 0.017, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.31 for low platelet count, and p = 0.009, HR = 1.43 for negative expression of E-cadherin, respectively].Conclusions:Expression levels of E-cadherin in adjacent noncancerous liver after surgical resection was associated with metastatic HCC recurrence later on. Analysis of E-cadherin expression should provide important information for predicting recurrence after curative resection of HCC.
