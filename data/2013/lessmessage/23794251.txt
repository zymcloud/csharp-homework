Interaction between tumor and stromal cells plays an important role in cancer progression. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of tumor-associated fibroblasts on regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. Sixty-five cases of HCC and the corresponding normal liver tissues were recruited for immunohistochemical assessment of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, a biomarker for activated fibroblasts. Clinicopathological data were also collected from HCC patients for association with α-SMA expression. Primary cell culture of fibroblasts from HCC tissues was used to generate conditioned medium for testing the effect on regulation of HCC cell migration capacity in the transwell cell migration assay. α-SMA protein was expressed in 84.0 % (21 out 25 cases) of the fibroblasts from the metastatic HCCs, 45 % (18/40) from HCCs without metastasis, and 19.2 % (5/26) from normal liver tissues, difference of which was statistically significant (P
