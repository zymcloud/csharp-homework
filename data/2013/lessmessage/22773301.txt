Background/aims:The detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in the peripheral blood is not only important for the diagnosis of FICC, but is also of critical importance for early detection of hematogenous metastasis of HCC. The purpose of this study was to measure Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) mRNA in the peripheral blood and telomerase activity in peripheral blood monocytes to determine their utility, in isolation and concert, in the early diagnosis of HCC.Methodology:Nested RT-PCR was employed to detect the mRNA expression of AFP in the peripheral blood, and PCR-ELISA was used to measure the telomerase activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with HCC, benign hepatic tumors, chronic liver diseases and healthy subjects.Results:Of the 30 HCC patients, 22 (73.3%) were positive for AFP, and 28/30 (93.3%) HCC patients were positive for telomerase activity. The mRNA expression of AFP was positively correlated with telomerase activity in HCC patients (r=0.6742, pConclusions:Detection of both mRNA expression of AFP in the peripheral blood and telomerase activity in PBMCs may prove to play an important role in achieving an early diagnosis of HCC.
