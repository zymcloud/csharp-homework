Hypointensity in the hepatocyte phase is believed to be a key feature of hypovascular early hepatocellular carcinoma, which indicates malignancy. The 3 cases we present suggest that the converse is not true. Three small hepatocellular lesions showed isointensity/hyperintensity on gadoxetic acid-enhanced, hepatocyte-phase magnetic resonance images and were pathologically confirmed as early hepatocellular carcinomas. We conclude that isointensity or hyperintensity in the hepatocyte phase does not always represent benignity of hepatocellular lesions in the cirrhotic liver.
