Background:The aim of the study was to determine the features of loss of heterozygosity in the mitofusin 2 gene and their association with clinicopathological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methodology:Loss of heterozygosity of four microsatellite loci were detected in tumors and their adjacent normal tissues of 29 surgically resected hepatocellular carcinomas using an ABI3130xl automated sequencer.Results:The results showed the incidences of loss of heterozygosity on microsatellite loci D1S2667, D1S2740, D1S434, and D1S228 were 21%, 23%, 21%, and 22%, respectively. Loss of heterozygosity in the mitofusin 2 gene was closely correlated with age, degree of differentiation, capsule integrity, and tumor size (P 0.05).Conclusions:Frequent loss of heterozygosity in the mitofusin 2 gene exists in hepatocellular carcinoma. Loss of heterozygosity, which represents a tumor suppressor gene pathway, may play a critical role in the occurrence and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
