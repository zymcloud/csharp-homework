Objective:The management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in elderly patients is significantly more complicated than in younger patients because of medical comorbidities, advanced status at diagnosis, reduced liver function and altered drug pharmacokinetics. Our objective was a revision of the charts of unselected elderly patients with HCC being treated with a reduced starting dose of sorafenib.Methods:Activity, adverse events and quality of life were evaluated during the treatment. Sixty patients (47 males and 13 females) aged more than 70 years old (range 70-90, median 76 years) were retrospectively reviewed.Results:One complete and one partial response were achieved in the series (overall response rate 3.3%). Stable disease accounted for 76.6% (46 out of 60 patients). The disease control rate (complete plus partial response plus stable disease) was 80%. Median time to progression (TTP) was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.2-8.7 months) and median survival was 10.0 months (95% CI, 5.0-14.9 months). Thrombosis correlated to TTP. Full doses of sora-fenib were reached in 11 out of 60 patients (18.3%). The evaluation of quality of life did not show any significant change during the study.Conclusions:Sorafenib at a reduced dose can be safely used in elderly HCC patients with maintenance of activity and increased tolerability.
