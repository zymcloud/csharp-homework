Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primary liver malignancy, mostly occurring in the context of chronic liver diseases leading to cirrhosis. Epidemiological data demonstrate the increasing incidence of HCC worldwide, mainly related to viral hepatitis and metabolic syndrome. Pathological analysis recognizes several types of HCC according to macroscopic and microscopic features. A subset of HCC can develop on normal liver and usually corresponds to specific variants, including fibrolamellar carcinoma mostly encountered in young population. Prognosis of HCC remains poor, depending on delayed tumor diagnosis, the clinical status of the patient but also tumor behavior with a great propensity for angioinvasion.
