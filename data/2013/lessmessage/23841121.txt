Background/aims:Intra-peritoneal lavage is well known and used in intra-peritoneal malignancy However, the clinical role for patients with rupture of HCC has not yet been established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of intraoperative peritoneal lavage for patients with rupture of HCC.Methodology:A retrospective study of operative findings, other factors, and outcome was performed in 66 patients with rupture of HCC who underwent distilled water peritoneal lavage (DWPL) during hepatectomy.Results:There was a trend towards a higher intra-peritoneal, extra-hepatic recurrence rate in patients without DWPL. Patients who underwent DWPL had a significantly better 5-year disease-free survival rate than control group, 11.5±4.6 months and 30.2±8.4 months (p=0.018), respectively, and better overall survival rate, 21.7±6.2 months, than control group, 57.3±11.2 months (p=0.001).Conclusions:DWPL during liver resection retards tumor recurrence and improves the intraoperative survival rate in patients with spontaneously ruptured HCC.
