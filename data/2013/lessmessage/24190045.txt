A patient with hepatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma (Epi-AML) with arterioportal venous shunting, who was successfully treated by a laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy, is presented herein. AML is an uncommon benign neoplasm of the liver. Tumors composed predominantly of epithelioid cells have been subcategorized into Epi-AML, and the treatment strategy for Epi-AML is currently undetermined. There are no reports describing Epi-AML with arterioportal venous shunting to date. An arterioportal venous shunting of the liver tumor was suggested to be one of the malignant signs of the liver tumor. It would be important to differentiate Epi-AML with arterioportal venous shunting from hepatocellular carcinoma and hypervascular metastatic tumors. Minimally invasive resection, such as laparoscopic hepatectomy, for patients having Epi-AML with arterioportal venous shunting may be recommended.
