Background:Currently, most available experience concerning prophylaxis against hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is limited to studies of small size and short follow-up. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a prophylactic regimen using lamivudine and individualized low-dose intramuscular hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) in LDLT.Methods:We used a database of adult-to-adult right-lobe LDLT procedures performed from June 2002 to April 2012 at our center for HBV-related end-stage liver diseases. Patients were divided into 3 groups: group A, HBV-related decompensated liver cirrhosis; group B, fulminant hepatitis B; and group C, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Results:During a mean follow-up of 38.3 ± 28.9 months, 8 of 165 (4.8%) recipients developed HBV recurrences. The mean time for HBV reinfection was 15.8 + 11.0 months after transplantation. The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year HBV recurrence rates were 3%, 7%, and 8.2%, respectively. Both patients with fulminant hepatitis B or HCC seemed to have higher rates of HBV recurrence than those with decompensated liver cirrhosis, albeit not significantly. The independent predictor of HBV recurrence was high HBV DNA level (≥10(5) copies/mL) at LDLT.Conclusions:Lamivudine and individualized low-dose intramuscular HBIG provides effective prophylaxis against HBV recurrence after LDLT. Pre-LDLT HBV DNA of ≥ 10(5) copies/mL was associated with HBV recurrence.
