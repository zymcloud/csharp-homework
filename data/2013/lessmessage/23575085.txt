We report a case of retroperitoneal intra-abdominal primary monophasic synovial sarcoma (SS) with hemangiopericytomatous (HPC) pattern in a 25-year-old male arising from the triangular ligament on the superior surface of liver encasing the inferior vena cava (IVC) and masquerading as a hepatic tumor. A large heterogeneously enhancing, well defined, lobulated, exophytic lesion was seen involving segment VIII of the liver with foci of calcification in the periphery. A biopsy, followed by total resection of the tumor, showed a spindle cell sarcoma with HPC pattern, which was consistent with monophasic SS on histology and immunohistochemistry. The unusual clinical presentation, radiology, pathology, and differential diagnosis will be discussed in detail.
