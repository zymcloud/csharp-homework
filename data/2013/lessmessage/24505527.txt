Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor and usually a fatal disease which can develop at any age in either sex. Differential diagnosis between malignant and benign adrenal mass is not easy which leads to significant clinical challenge for optimal treatment. Here we report a 22-year-old woman diagnosed with primary hyper aldostronism initially but disease relapsed during six months and magnetic resonance imaging revealed tumor with metastasis to the liver.
