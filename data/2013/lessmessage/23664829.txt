Interest in adenomas has been renewed by the discovery of the molecular changes in these tumors. The latest World Health Organization publication on gastrointestinal tract tumors (2010) includes four types of hepatic adenomas, which are well characterized immunohistochemically, genotypically and phenotypically. In these tumors, medical history and morphological behavior play an important role in determining the risk of malignancy, mainly in adenomas with a b-catenin mutation. The presence of steatosis, inflammation, vascular changes linked to response to L-FABP, serum amyloid A, and glutamyl synthetase help to classify these tumors into four groups: hepatocellular adenomas with the HNF1A mutation (H-HCA), those with the b-catenin mutation (b-HCA), inflammatory HCA (IHCA), and HCA without markers. The absence of glypican 3 expression, HSP 70 and perivenular mapping of glutamyl synthetase helps to distinguish these tumors from well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. We describe the clinical, morphological and immunophenotypic features of three patients diagnosed with hepatic adenomas in a 2-year period.
