Laparoscopic liver resections are gaining adherents among surgeons, as they show rapid recovery, shorter hospital stay and better cosmetic results. The use of a laparoscopic radiofrequency device was first carried out successfully in Brazil for resection of hepatocellular carcinoma of the segment VI in two cirrhotic patients. Although intraoperative bleeding remains a major challenge for the surgeon during laparoscopic liver resections, in both cases the hepatic vascular exclusion was expendable and there was no need for blood transfusion. Patients were discharged on the fourth postoperative day.
