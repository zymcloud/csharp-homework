Background/aims:To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of sorafenib combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma.Methodology:A retrospective analysis of 65 patients with advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma who had been administered sorafenib for more than one month and treated by TACE was performed. The tumor response was evaluated according to the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors and any side effects were recorded.Results:Twelve patients entered a partial remission, 42 entered a stable condition, and the disease progressed in 11 patients. The disease control and objective regression rates were 83.1% and 18.5%, respectively. The one-year survival rate was 63.1%. Among the cases, the median overall survival time was 17 months, and the median time to progression was 9 months. The overall side effects rate was 78.5% and most were relieved after treatment.Conclusions:Sorafenib combined with TACE is a safe and effective treatment of advanced primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
