Objectives:Elevated plasma fibrinogen levels are associated with tumor progression and poor outcomes in cancer patients. We investigated the prognostic value of pretreatment plasma fibrinogen levels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One hundred and thirteen patients with newly diagnosed HCC were retrospectively evaluated. We investigated the correlation between pretreatment plasma fibrinogen levels, clinicopathological parameters and overall survival. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the clinicopathological parameters associated with overall survival.Results:The median value of the pretreatment plasma fibrinogen level was 279 mg/dl. Elevated plasma fibrinogen levels were associated with larger tumor size, the presence of vascular invasion and higher Cancer Liver Italian Program scores. Lower plasma fibrinogen levels were associated with higher Child-Pugh grades. The overall survival rates in patients with pretreatment plasma fibrinogen levels â‰¥ 315 mg/dl were significantly lower than those with a pretreatment plasma fibrinogen level Conclusions:This study demonstrates that elevated pretreatment plasma fibrinogen levels are associated with tumor progression and are independently associated with a poor prognosis in patients with HCC.
