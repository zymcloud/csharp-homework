Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem with more than 2 billion infected individuals. HBV infection leads to diverse outcomes ranging from acute to chronic hepatitis, which may result in severe complications as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV is one of the most important human DNA viruses having strong oncogenic potential. Recently, many studies have reported on HBV X gene and PreC promoter mutations associated with HCC. In order to detect the prevalence of HBx gene and PreC promoter mutations possibly related to HCC, we have analyzed sera samples collected from 61 patients with chronic hepatitis B. We have detected TI653 mutation in 1 of 61 (1,63%), A1896 mutation in 10 of 61 (16,39%), and T1762 - A1764 dual mutation in 4 of 61 (6,55%). T1653 and T1762- A1764 dual mutations were suggested significantly related to HCC in earlier reported studies. Our findings demonstrate that HBx gene and PreC promoter mutations related to HCC are present in our region and prospective clinical chord studies would be useful for better patient management and of early diagnosis of possible HCC cases.
