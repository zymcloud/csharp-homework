Background:To evaluate the relative effectiveness of different treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the hepatic artery.Materials and methods:The study sample group consisted of 418 patients who were randomly selected from 2008 to 2012 with a first diagnosis of HCC and treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or without (TAE) chemotherapy or transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI). We collected data including tumor size preoperative and one month thereafter to compare change in areas across the three groups, along with various laboratory indexes for comparison.Results:The overall average change of areas was 240.8 ± 72.1 mm2. In the three groups it was 265.0 ± 58.0 mm2 vs. 250.5 ± 51.9 mm2 vs. 123.7 ± 26.2 mm2. In groups TACE and TAE values were larger than in group TAI (pConclusion:The groups TACE and TAE demonstrated more effective reduction of tumor size than group TAI. While lipiodol caused acute liver function damage, this proved reversible.
