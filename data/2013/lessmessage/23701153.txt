A 41-year-old male patient with hepatitis B underwent right tri-segmentectomy and total caudate lobectomy for a huge hepatocellular carcinoma associated with complete occlusion of the inferior vena cava with thrombosis of the infrahepatic inferior vena cava due to tumor compression. Five months later, he was readmitted for ascites and hyperbilirubinemia. Venography revealed stenosis and tortuosity of the left hepatic vein and the inferior vena cava, for which balloon angioplasty of the left hepatic vein and the inferior vena cava was performed using an 8-mm and 10-mm balloon, respectively. The left hepatic venous pressure decreased from 65 mmHg to 25 mmHg after dilatation. The patient made a satisfactory recovery thereafter and remains well with normal liver functions and without ascites. Balloon angioplasty may be useful for liver failure due to hepatic vein stenosis after hepatic resection.
