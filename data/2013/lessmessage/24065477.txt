Purpose:To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin-based preoperative chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.Methods:Between August 2008 and December 2011, 51 patients with histologically documented CRC and liver metastases were treated with first-line oxaliplatin-based therapy plus bevacizumab: FOLFOX 4 (oxaliplatin, folinic acid and 5-FU) plus bevacizumab or OXFL mod.Mayo (folinic acid, oxaliplatin and 5-FU) plus bevacizumab.Results:The mean patient age was 59.69+ 9.38 years (range 38-78) and 34 (66.67%) were male. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 7 (13.73%) patients, partial response (PR) in 29 (56. 86%) and stable disease (SD) in 6 (11.76%); progressive disease (PD) was registered in 9 (17.65%) patients. Disease control rate was 82.36% (42 patients). Liver resections were performed in 37 (72.55%) patients vs those without resection (p<0.01). The same regimen without bevacizumab was administered postoperatively to 18 (42. 86%) patients. The mean progression free survival (PFS) was 9.90Â±7.07 months (range 3-26) and was significantly longer in patients with postoperative therapy (p<0.001). Treatment-related toxicity appeared in 28 (54. 90%) patients vs those who did not (p<0.001) Independent of grade, nausea (19.61%), leucopenia (17.65%) and peripheral neuropathy (17.65%) were the most frequent toxicities. Chemotherapy was postponed in 9 (17.65%) patients due to grade 3-4 toxicities. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 toxicities were leucopenia (5.88%) and hypertension (3.92%).Conclusion:Bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin-based treatment is safe and efficient as preoperative treatment of mCRC with primarily unresectable liver metastases. Liver resection could offer a possibility for long-term survival in these patients.
