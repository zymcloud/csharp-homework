Telekin, a eudesmane-type sesquiterpene lactone compound isolated from Chinese folk medicine Carpesium divaricatum, has been reported to strongly inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. In this study, the involvement of a mitochondria-mediated pathway in the pro-apoptotic action of telekin was investigated in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays showed that telekin exhibited excellent anti-proliferation activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and low cytotoxicity to normal hepatocyte cells. Telekin-induced apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies, and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the extracellular surface, as revealed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear staining and flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis showed that telekin induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as increased the levels of intracellular free calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, Western blot results demonstrated that telekin induced the decrease in Apaf-1 and Bcl-2 expression, increase in Bax expression, release of cytochrome C, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in HepG-2 cells. These findings indicate that telekin activates the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and may merit further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
