Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common, chronic liver disease worldwide. Within this spectrum, steatosis alone is apparently benign, while nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. The pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis is not clearly known, but its main characteristics are considered insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased free fatty acids reflux from adipose tissue to the liver, hepatocyte lipotoxicity, stimulation of chronic necroinflammation, and fibrogenic response. With recent advances in technology, advanced imaging techniques provide important information for diagnosis. There is a significant research effort in developing noninvasive monitoring of disease progression to fibrosis and response to therapy with potential novel biomarkers, in order to facilitate diagnosis for the detection of advanced cirrhosis and to minimize the need of liver biopsy. The identification of NAFLD should be sought as part of the routine assessment of type 2 diabetics, as sought the microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease, because it is essential for the early diagnosis and proper intervention. Diet, exercise training, and weight loss provide significant clinical benefits and must be considered of first line for treating NAFLD.
