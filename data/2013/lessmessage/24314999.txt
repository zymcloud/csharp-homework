Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) significantly affects graft loss and mortality after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The aim of this study was to analyze the risk factors of HAT in our program, with special regard to the personal-technical factor. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 500 adult liver transplant recipients between 1995 and 2011. Operations were performed by a certain group of surgeons, with standardized technique. The incidence rate of HAT decreased since 1995 from 12% to 7.8%. In accordance with the literature, HAT associated with acute rejection, polytransfusion, and the duration of the hepatectomy, arterial variations/reconstructions, tiny arteries, and furthermore, the timing of the anastomosis in Hungary. However we did not find an association with other parameters, like cytomegalovirus infection, and hepatocellular carcinoma as indication. We created a "difficulty index" that consists of the technical parameters. The difficulty index together with surgical experience (number of OLTs performed) had an outstanding association with HAT. In conclusion, the incidence and risk factors for HAT are similar to the results published by others. However, personal factors, such as experience, timing, given anatomy, and tiredness, might also play a significant role in the occurrence of HAT.
