Background/aims:Lapraoscopic era provided a new alternative for rectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases (RCLM). However, there is no established consensus for laparoscopy "first" for patients with RCLM, whose metastasis is confined to the liver. This study aimed to evaluate its indications for one-stage surgery in laparoscopy.Methodology:Sixteen patients with RCLM, who had undergone laparoscopic colorectal resection and simultaneous treatment for liver metastasis, were retrospectively reviewed.Results:With concomitant laparoscopic colorectal resection, 6 patients received liver resection simultaneously; 10 patients underwent all sorts of down-staging managing including local ablation, right hepatic portal vein ligation and chemotherapy pumps implanted into hepatic artery for liver metastases. The colo-anal/rectal anastomoses were performed with a stapler or "pull-through" mode through the anus. Three patients underwent two-stage liver resection following tumor down-staging. Median survival time was 22.3 months.Conclusions:Laparoscopy approach first for rectal cancer and synchronous liver metastasis is feasible in selected patients, and can provide curative resection or benefit "down-staging" treatment. Colon "pull-through" anastomosis is a potential method to avoid abdominal incision and decrease the risk of anastomotic leakage. It is worth investigating its advantages over traditional approaches with a prospective randomized controlled study.
