RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway plays a pivotal role in numerous fundamental cellular functions including contraction, motility, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The pathway is also involved in the development of many diseases such as vasospasm, pulmonary hypertension, cancer and central nervous systems (CNS) disorders. The inhibitors of Rho kinase have been extensively studied since the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway was verified as a target for a number of diseases. Herein, we reviewed the advances in the studies of the roles of Rho/Rho-kinase in diseases and the development of Rho-kinase inhibitors in recent five years.
