Background:Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare mesenchymal tumor composed by blood vessels, adipose tissue and smooth muscle cells in variable proportions. Although it is most often diagnosed in the kidney, this tumor may originate from any part of the liver. It is often misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or other benign liver tumor. We describe a case of spontaneous rupture of hepatic angiomyolipoma in a young woman, with evidence of internal hemorrhage and hemoperitoneum.Case report:Liver tumor rupture is a rare but real surgical emergency. In our case it has been managed according to the trauma principles of the damage control surgery. At the time of the observation, the patient presented an instable condition, so the decision-making was oriented toward a less invasive first step of liver packing instead of a more aggressive intervention such as one shot hepatic resection.Conclusion:Damage control surgery with deep parenchymal sutures of the liver and pro-coagulant tissue adhesives packing abbreviates surgical time before the development of critical and irreversible physiological endpoints and permits a more confident second time surgery. This surgical management concept helps to reduce the mortality rate and the incidence of complications not only in traumatic liver damages, it works very well in spontaneous liver ruptures as well.
