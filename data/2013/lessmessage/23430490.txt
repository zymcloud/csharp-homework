Glycogen Storage Disease type III (GSD III) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which a mutation in the AGL gene causes deficiency of the glycogen debranching enzyme. In childhood, it is characterized by hepatomegaly, keto-hypoglycemic episodes after short periods of fasting, and hyperlipidemia. In adulthood, myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and liver cirrhosis are the main complications. To determine the genotype of the GSD III patients (n = 14) diagnosed and treated in our center, mutation analysis was performed by either denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis or full gene sequencing. We developed, validated and applied both methods, and in all patients a mutation was identified on both alleles. Five novel pathogenic mutations were identified in seven patients, including four missense mutations (c.643G>A, p.Asp215Asn; c.655A>G, p.Asn219Asp; c.1027C>T, p.Arg343Trp; c.1877A>G, p.His626Arg) and one frameshift mutation (c.3911delA, p.Asn1304fs). The c.643G>A, p.Asp215Asn mutation is related with type IIIa, as this mutation was found homozygously in two type IIIa patients. In addition to five novel mutations, we present new genotype-phenotype relationships for c.2039G>A, p.Trp680X; c.753_756delCAGA, p.Asp251fs; and the intron 32 c.4260-12A>G splice site mutation. The p.Trp680X mutation was found homozygously in four patients, presenting a mild IIIa phenotype with mild skeletal myopathy, elevated CK values, and no cardiomyopathy. The p.Asp251fs mutation was found homozygously in one patient presenting with a severe IIIa phenotype, with skeletal myopathy, and severe symptomatic cardiomyopathy. The c.4260-12A>G mutation was found heterozygously, together with the p.Arg343Trp mutation in a severe IIIb patient who developed liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, necessitating an orthotopic liver transplantation.
