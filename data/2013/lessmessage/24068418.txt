Introduction:Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) has been rarely reported in the liver.Patient, methods and results:We present a liver PEComa case diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. The patient was incidentally found to have an abnormal mass in the liver. MRI revealed early and strikingly homogeneous enhancement of the lesion. Partial hepatectomy was performed, and a pathological examination revealed signs of typical of PEComa. The patient was closely monitored for 12 months after the surgery, with no clinical or radiographic evidence of recurrence or metastatic disease.Conclusion:MRI diagnosis is applicable for PEComa.
