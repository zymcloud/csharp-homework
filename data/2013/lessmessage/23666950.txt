Background:The aim of our work is to assess the clinical outcomes of liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HIV-coinfected patients. This is a multicenter study involving three Italian transplant centers in northern Italy: University of Modena, University of Bologna, and University of Udine.Patients and methods:We compared 30 HIV-positive patients affected by HCC who underwent LT with 125 HIV-uninfected patients who received the same treatment from September 2004 to June 2009. At listing, there were no differences between HIV-infected and -uninfected patients regarding HCC features. Patients outside the University of California, San Francisco criteria (UCSF) were considered eligible for LT if a down-staging program permitted a reduction of tumor burden.Results:HIV-infected patients were younger, they were more frequently anti-HCV positive, and a higher number of HIV-infected patients presented a coinfection HBV-HCV. Pre-LT treatments (liver resection and or locoregional treatments) were similar between the two groups. Histological characteristics of the tumor were similar in patients with and without HIV infection. No differences were observed in terms of overall survival and HCC recurrence rates.Conclusion:LT for HCC is a feasible procedure and the presence of HIV does not particularly affect the post-LT outcome.
