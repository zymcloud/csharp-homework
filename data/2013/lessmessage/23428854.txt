We summarize here the consensus reached at the Symposium of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan held in Kanazawa on July 20th and 21st, 2012, on the role of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, dynamic CT is the first choice of imaging modality when HCC is suspected. EOB-MRI is useful for differentiation and definitive diagnosis of HCC when dynamic CT/MRI does not show conclusive findings for HCC. In addition, contrast- enhanced ultrasound with Sonazoid is useful for making a decision on whether or not to treat a hypovascular lesion
