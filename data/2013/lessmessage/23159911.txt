Introduction:Cancer in pregnancy is rare and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during pregnancy is even rarer. Due to limited experience, management of these patients remains challenging.Presentation of case:A 33-year old pregnant lady presented with HCC at 28 weeks of gestation. She underwent synchronous cesarean section and right hepatectomy at 32 weeks of gestation. The post-operative course was uneventful. She was discharged home on day 10 after surgery. Histolopathology confirmed HCC. The surgical resection margins were clear. At a follow-up of 3 months after surgery, the mother was disease free and the infant was well.Discussion:HCC during pregnancy is extremely rare. The experience in its management and outcomes are lacking. In managing any patient diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm in pregnancy, both the mother and the fetus have to be considered.Conclusion:With adequate preoperative assessment and a good management strategy, good results can be obtained for both the mother and the baby for a pregnant patient with HCC.
