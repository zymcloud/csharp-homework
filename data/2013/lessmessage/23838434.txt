Background/aims:The independent and interactive effects of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) factors on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic HBV/HCV dually-infected patients remain unclear.Methods:In a cross-sectional and case-controlled study, the HBV and HCV loads and genotypes and the sequences of pre-S and precore/core promoter regions were determined in 146 HCC patients and 167 chronic carriers with HBV/HCV dual infection.Results:Age (odds ratio (OR) 1.1), male sex (OR 2.3), pre-S deletion (OR 5.0), A1762T/G1764A mutant (OR 2.5), HCV genotype-1 (OR 2.4) and platelet count Conclusions:Pre-S deletion, A1762T/G1764A mutation and HCV genotype-1 are important in hepatocarcinogenesis in chronic HBV/HCV dual infection.
