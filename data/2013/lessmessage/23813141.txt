Telangiectatic hepatocellular adenoma is a rare, recently recognized subtype of benign liver tumor that may very rarely undergo transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma. We report an unusual case of a 75-year-old woman with no history of oral contraceptive use that underwent malignant transformation of a telangiectactic hepatocellular adenoma. No risk factors for adenoma development were identified in this otherwise healthy woman. Radiological characteristics, gross features and histopathology are herein described. In conclusion, telangiectatic hepatocellular adenoma can undergo malignant transformation. Further studies are needed to better clarify the factors associated with malignant progression.
