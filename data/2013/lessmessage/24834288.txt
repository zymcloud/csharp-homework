Aim:The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality rates and trends from Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in Iranian population from 1995 to 2003.Background:Cancer is the third most common cause of death in Iran. Gastrointestinal cancer is the most important causes of mortality due to cancer. The cancer mortality data is important to monitor the effects of screening program, earlier diagnosis, demographic data and other prognostic factors.Patients and methods:National death Statistic Reported by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOH&ME) from 1995 to 2003, stratified by age group, sex, and cause of death is included in this analysis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) [ICD-9; 153-154], Gastric cancer (GC) [ICD-9; 151], Pancreas cancer (PC) [ICD-9; 25], Esophageal cancer (EC) [ICD-9; C15] and Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ICD-9; 20] were expressed as the annual mortality rates/100,000, general and/or per gender, and age group.Results:The cause specific mortality rate of CRC slightly increased during the years under study and for GC and EC showed a sharp increasing. In contrast, the mortality rate of PC decreased slightly during the years under the study. The rate of HCC mortality moderately increased. All mortality rates were higher for male than female.Conclusion:Our study indicated remarkable increasing trends in mortality of GI cancer in Iran specifically for CRC and GC. Developing for a GC and EC for both primary prevention and early detection programs and providing the facilities for CRC screening, would be the options to control the mortality and burden of GI cancers in the future.
