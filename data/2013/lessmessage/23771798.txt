Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF), a potential predictive and prognostic marker in several human cancers, is the firstly reported member of the HDGF family of proteins containing a well-conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence. HDGF is implicated in tumorigenesis by direct angiogenic activity, and its expression is correlated with aggressive biological ability of cancer cells including proliferation and angiogenesis. So, we propose that HDGF may be a valuable factor in progression and prognosis for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) through its angiogenic and proliferative activity. So, HDGF, CD31 and Ki67 expression in the specimens of 60 patients suffering from PCNSL was investigated by immunohistochemistry in this study. Their correlations with clinicopathologic features and prognosis were evaluated to determine whether HDGF, CD31 and Ki67 expression levels correlate with the prognosis of the 60 patients suffering from PCNSL. We found that all PCNSL specimens showed HDGF, CD31 and Ki67 expression with different expression levels. Statistical analysis showed that HDGF had a positive correlation with CD31, but not with Ki67. Patients with higher HDGF and CD31 expression level had poorer overall survival rates than those with lower expression levels of HDGF and CD31, while Ki67 expression level did not correlate with overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and high expression of HDGF was independent prognostic indicator of patient survival.
