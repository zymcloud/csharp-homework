The expression of the Igf-1 gene in mice liver at different stages of development of hepatocellular carcinoma induced by diethylnitrozamine--from the initial diffuse tissue dysplasia and nodular hyperplasia to the development of multiple adenomas and carcinoma--has been analyzed. It was marked that the level of Igf-1 expression in all liver neoplasms decreased; it increased only in the liver tissue surrounding the carcinoma. The dependence of Igf-1 expression on inflammatory processes accompanying tumor growth was analyzed on the model of acute liver damage by diethylnitrozamine. It was established that the level of Igf-1 expression in liver tissue under acute damage in sexually mature mice was the same as in the control group. By the means of semiquantitative evaluation of the products of two Igf-1 splice isoforms--locally active (Mgf) and circulating (Igf- 1v4)--it has been shown that the amount of mRNA of both isoforms in hepatocellular carcinoma was lower, and in tissue surrounding the tumor higher, than in the samples of the control group. At the same time, the proportion of transcripts of isoforms was stable.
