The fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare primary liver cancer occurring in adolescents and young adults without chronic liver disease or known risk factors. Histologically, it is defined by lamellar bands of fibrosis surrounding well-differentiated tumor cells. Radiologic imaging typically demonstrates a large, solitary mass with calcifications and a central scar. Lymph node metastases in the porta hepatis are frequently diagnosed upon presentation. More patients with fibrolamellar carcinoma are candidates for surgical resection than those with conventional hepatocellular carcinoma, owing to their young age and absence of cirrhosis. The most important prognostic factor is surgical resection, which results in 5-year overall survival rates ranging between 50 and 76 %. Despite complete surgical resection, relapse rates are high, and novel therapies are needed to prevent and treat recurrent disease.
