Background/aims:Currently, the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system is used in hepatectomy patients for tumor staging of HCC patients. However this can only evaluate the histopathological factor. MELD score is an objective measure for liver function widely used as a severity index for priority on the waiting list for liver transplantation. Here we suggest a modified TNM staging system based on the MELD score and test its relation with post-operative outcome of HCC.Methodology:We retrospectively collected 922 HCC patients undergoing hepatic resection, with TNM stage I (n=239), stage II (n=375) and stage III (n=308); giving points 0 to 2 for each stage (from I to III). Pre-operative MELD score was calculated and assigned 0 points for MELD 8. The two scores were added together to form a modified MELD-base TNM stage score and tested the correlation of this new scoring system with outcome after liver resection.Results:The modified MELD-base TNM stage score resulted in score 0 (n=114), score 1 (n=247), score 2 (n=335), score 3 (n=164), and score 4 (n=62). The disease-free survival in each group showed significant difference (pConclusions:The MELD-based TNM staging system reliably separates patients with HCC into homogeneous groups with respect to post-resectional prognosis. Further prospective validation studies are required to confirm the feasibility of this strategy.
