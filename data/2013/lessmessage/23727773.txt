The binding mode and affinity of isoeuxanthone (1,6-dihydroxyxanthone) (1) and its piperidinyl derivative (1-hydroxy-6-(2-(1-piperidinyl)ethoxy)xanthone) (2) with calf thymus DNA were studied using absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and viscosity measurements. Results indicate that the two xanthones can intercalate into the DNA base pairs by the plane of xanthone ring and the binding affinity of the piperidinylethoxy substituted xanthone 2 is stronger than 1. In addition, the cytotoxic effects of both compounds were evaluated with the human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) and human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) using acid phosphatase assay. Analyses show that the piperidinylethoxy substituted xanthone exhibits more effective cytotoxic activity than isoeuxanthone against the two cancer cells. The effects on the inhibition of tumor cells in vitro agree with the studies of DNA-binding.
