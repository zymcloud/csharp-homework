Background:Due to the possible involvement of Glutathione S-transferase Mu-1 (GSTM1) and Glutathione S-transferase theta-1 (GSTT1) in the detoxification of environmental carcinogens, environmental toxins, and oxidative stress products, genetic polymorphisms of these two genes may play important roles in the susceptibility of human being to hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the existing research results are not conclusive.Methods:A systematic literature search using databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, etc.) for the eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria including case-control studies or cohort studies is evaluated using an updated systematic meta-analysis.Results:Significant increase in the risk of HCC in the Chinese population is found in GSTM1 null genotype (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.79, PConclusions:Our results indicate that both GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes are associated with an increased HCC risk in Chinese population. Peoples with dual null genotypes of GSTM1-GSTT1 are more susceptible to developing HCC. In conclusion, GST genetic polymorphisms play vital roles in the development of HCC in the Chinese population.
