Objective:To investigate the clinico-pathologic importance of Heparanase mRNA expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and its relationship with prognosis.Materials and methods:Fresh tumors and noncancerous liver tissues were obtained from 30 hepatocellular carcinoma patients after hepatectomy. Expression levels of Heparanase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were quantitatively analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.Results:The relative Heparanase mRNA expression level (Heparanase: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ratio) in hepatocellular carcinoma was lower than that in noncancerous tissue (P Conclusion:Reduced Heparanase mRNA expression might result in abnormal cell growth and correlate with hepatocellular carcinoma progression.
