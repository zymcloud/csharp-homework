Introduction:Visualization of tumor angiogenesis using radionuclide targeting provides important diagnostic information. In previous study, we proved that an arginine-arginine-leucine (RRL) peptide should be a tumor endothelial cell specific binding sequence. The overall aim of this study was to evaluate whether (99m)Tc-radiolabeled RRL could be noninvasively used for imaging of malignant tumors in vivo, and act as a new molecular probe targeting tumor angiogenesis.Methods:The RRL peptide was designed and radiosynthesized with (99m)Tc by a one-step method. The radiolabeling efficiency and radiochemical purity were then characterized in vitro. (99m)Tc-RRL was injected intravenously in HepG2 xenograft-bearing BALB/c nude mice. Biodistribution and in vivo imaging were performed periodically. The relationship between tumor size and %ID uptake of (99m)Tc-RRL was also explored.Results:The labeling efficiencies of (99m)Tc-RRL reached 76.9% Â± 4.5% (n = 6) within 30-60 min at room temperature, and the radiochemical purity exceeded 96% after purification. In vitro stability experiment revealed the radiolabeled peptide was stable. Biodistribution data showed that (99m)Tc-RRL rapidly cleared from the blood and predominantly accumulated in the kidneys and tumor. The specific uptake of (99m)Tc-RRL in tumor was significantly higher than that of unlabeled RRL blocking and free pertechnetate control test after injection (pConclusion:(99m)Tc-RRL can be used as a potential candidate for visualization of tumor angiogenesis in malignant carcinomas.
