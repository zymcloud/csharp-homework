To investigate the effect of artesunate nanoliposomes on cultured cells in vitro and hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in BALB/c-nu mice. Fluorescence polarization was applied for measurement of mitochondrial membrane fluidities; inhibition test of tumor cell proliferation in vitro was performed and nude mice xenograft model from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was established. Cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated by MTT assay on hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. Anisotropy (r-value) of blank nanoliposomes didn't change, it had no statistically significance between the blank nanoliposomes group and the control group, it indicated that artesunate had no obvious effect on L-O2 human normal liver cells. IC₅₀ values of artesunate nanoliposomes and artesunate API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) against HepG-2 cells were 15.997 and 19.706 μg/ml; IC₅₀ values of the same drugs against L-O2 normal human liver cells were 100.23 and 105.54 μg/ml, respectively. Tumor growth inhibitory effect of artesunate nanoliposomes was 32.7%, and artesunate API was 20.5%, respectively. HepG-2 cells treated with artesunate nanoliposomes showed dose-dependent apoptosis. The antitumor effect of artesunate nanoliposomes on human hepatoma HepG2 cells were stronger than that of artesunate API at the same concentration.
