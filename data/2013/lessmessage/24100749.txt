Background and goals:Several studies have demonstrated that sorafenib is effective in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in Child-Pugh A patients with unresectable HCC. The value of sorafenib treatment in different subgroups was examined.Materials and methods:A search of the literature published up to July 2012 was conducted. Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched and only randomized controlled trials were included.Results:Five randomized controlled trials consisting of 1462 patients with unresectable HCC were included. Meta-analyses demonstrated that sorafenib improved the control rate of the disease [relative risk, 1.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.55, 2.20; PConclusions:Sorafenib was a moderately effective and safe oral drug for use in Child-Pugh A patients with unresectable HCC. Sorafenib monotherapy is not recommended for treating intermediate-stage HCC. More research is needed on the efficacy of sorafenib treatment in patients with prior local therapy.
