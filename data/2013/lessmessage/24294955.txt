Despite the existence of efficient vaccines against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, these still represent a serious threat to human health worldwide. Acute HBV infections often become chronic, marked by liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Promising results with interferons alpha or gamma (IFN-α, γ) or nucleoside/nucleotide analogs in inhibiting HBV replication in vitro have led to therapeutic applications to chronic HBV patients, however, their results so far have not been satisfactory. The treatments were either not effective in all patients or had adverse effects. Certain progress was expected from expression of interferons targeted to liver by adenovirus vectors, however, this approach turned out to be limited by undesired expression of toxic viral genes and high production costs. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to inhibit HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells by human IFN-γ expressed through a non-viral vector, an eukaryotic plasmid. The results demonstrated that IFN-γ, targeted to HBV-replicating cells, significantly inhibited the virus growth without inducing apoptosis and indicated that local expression of this kind of cytokine may be a promising strategy of gene therapy.
