Aims:The aims of this study were to assess the outcomes of patients who underwent potentially curative hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a background of non-cirrhotic/non-fibrotic livers, and to determine prognostic factors that influenced survival.Methods:Over a 15-year period, all patients undergoing hepatectomy for HCC were identified. Collated data included demographics, laboratory analysis, operative findings and histo-pathological data. Survival differences between these factors following liver resection were determined.Results:57 patients were included with a median age of 70 years. The majority of patients underwent a hemi-hepatectomy or more radical resection (n = 37). Overall R0 resection rate was 90.4% (n = 51). The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 26.3% and 3.5%, respectively. The median follow-up period was 28 months. The 1-, 3- and 5- year disease-free survival was 65.4%, 41.8% and 39.1%, and the overall survival was 73.5%, 49.6% and 39.5%, respectively. AFP (p = 0.039) was the only predictor of poorer disease-free survival on univariate analysis. On multi-variable analysis, poorly differentiated tumour and large tumour size were independent predictors of overall survival.Conclusions:Liver resection is a feasible treatment option for HCC in non-cirrhotic/non-fibrotic livers with good survival outcome. Tumour size and differentiation are adverse predictors of outcome in these patients.
