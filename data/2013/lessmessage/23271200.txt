Objective:To evaluate whether parametric imaging with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is equal to experienced radiologists after review of CEUS in differentiating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH).Methods:An image processing software was used to quantitatively analyze the CEUS clips of 30 HCCs (mean diameter, 3.4±0.9 cm; range, 1.8-5.0 cm) and 30 FNHs (mean diameter, 3.0±1.1 cm; range, 1.1-5.0 cm). Low mechanical index contrast specific imaging modes and contrast agent of SonoVue® were applied for CEUS. Fourteen HCCs were pathologically diagnosed and 16 were clinically diagnosed, whereas all the FNHs were confirmed by pathological examination. Quantitative parameters of HCC and FNH were compared. The diagnostic performance between parametric imaging and two experienced readers was compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.Results:On parametric imaging, the rise time, time to peak and mean transit time for HCC and FNH were 16.7±11.1 s vs. 21.9±9.0 s (P=0.052), 29.9±14.1 s vs. 33.2±11.1 s (P=0.322), 115.0±90.9 s vs. 271.5±147.6 s (P0.05 compared with parametric imaging).Conclusion:Parametric imaging with CEUS is helpful for characterization the typical dynamic effects of microvascularization of HCC and FHH and is equal to experienced readers in the differential diagnosis between HCC and FNH.
