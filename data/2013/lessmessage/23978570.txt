Interleukin 18 (IL-18) gene polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with the outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Americans, Indians and Europeans. We aimed to investigate whether the association can be replicated in Chinese Han population. Three IL-18 variants, -656G>T, -137G>C and +105A>C, were genotyped in three independent Han cohorts consisting of 552 cases and 784 controls. By using logistic regression analysis and multiple testing, haplotype GCC were associated with a protection from susceptibility to HCV. After stratified analysis, both the carriage of -137C allele in the older or hemodialysis subgroup and the carriage of +105C allele in the younger subgroup were found to be significantly associated with a decreased risk of HCV susceptibility. By using logistic regression analysis and multiple testing for the resolution of HCV infection, our study showed that +105C allele and haplotype GGC displayed a negative effect on HCV persistence. After stratified analysis, a significantly decreased risk for HCV persistence was found in +105C allele in the subgroups of young, male or female, drug user or hemodialysis and HCV-1 or HCV mixed genotype. No significant association was observed between -656G>T and the outcomes of HCV infection. Our results demonstrated that the carriage of -137C allele, +105C allele, haplotype -656G/-137C/+105C and haplotype -656G/-137G/+105C of IL-18 gene may contribute to better outcomes of HCV infection in high-risk Chinese Han population.
