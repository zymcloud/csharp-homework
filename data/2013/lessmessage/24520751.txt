Introduction:Liver is made up of functionally indipendent parts or segments, and segmentation is based on course and ramification of blood vessels and bile ducts whereby each segment represents separate territory of the liver. Most severe complication is a postoperative liver insufficiency that demands complex treatment, is followed by high mortality and demans specific treatment including liver transpaltation.Materials and methods:Study was designed as retrospective and included patients who underwent liver resection at Clinic for abdominal surgery of Clinical Centre University Of Sarajevo (CCUS) during period 2010-2012. The study included 44 patients at the Clinic of abdominal surgery.Results:There were 6 (13.6%) hepatocellulare carcinomas, also 6 (13.6%) echinococcus cysts, the rest (72.8%) were different liver tumors. In the study group, following complication have been percepted; biliary leak (defined as the level of bilirubine in drainage fluid exceeding 5.0 mg/dl (> 85 micromol/l) more than 7 days), postoperative hipoalbuminemia, the need for reintervention as well as letal outcome. Complications were percepted in 7 patients (15.9%). In patient with no complication the lenght of hospitalization was 8-12 days while in thoose with complications hospitalization was prolonged to max 25 days.Conclusion:Majority of resections have beed done due to metastatic tumors, slightly lower number due to primary tumor (hepatocellulare carcinoma). Postoperative complications correlated with older age, comorbidity and higher blood loss during operation. One of the most often complications in our casuistics was biliary leak.
