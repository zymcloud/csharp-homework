In patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the prevalence of cirrhosis is higher among women than men, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops mainly in the cirrhotic stage among women. However, the long-term outcomes in female patients with NASH have not been fully elucidated, and age, gender and BMI were not simultaneously adjusted in previous studies on the prognosis of NASH. To elucidate the outcomes in female patients with NASH, we prospectively compared NASH patients with advanced fibrosis (advanced NASH) with hepatitis C virus-related advanced fibrosis (advanced CHC) patients and NASH patients with mild fibrosis (mild NASH) using study cohorts that were adjusted for body mass index (BMI) in addition to age. The median follow-up period was 92.5 months. Liver-related complication-free survival was significantly reduced in the advanced NASH group compared to the mild NASH group. No liver-related complications developed in the mild NASH group. The overall survival, liver-related complication- and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease-free survival were not significantly different between the advanced NASH and CHC groups. Female patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis may have a less favorable prognosis for liver-related complications than the matched cohorts with NASH and mild fibrosis, but may have a similar prognosis to the matched cohorts with CHC.
