Objectives:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently recurs even after curative resection. The purpose of this study was to identify factors predictive for postoperative recurrence of HCC in patients who underwent curative resection using immunohistochemistry.Methods:Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), E-cadherin and cyclin D1 in HCC tissue were analyzed for 133 HCC patients who underwent curative resection of tumors using immunohistochemical analysis. Relationships of expressions and disease-free survival of HCC were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results:The average period of follow-up of the patients was 6.7 years. Multivariate analyses revealed that only strong expression of VEGF in HCC tissue was significantly associated with metastatic recurrence (p Conclusions:Evaluating VEGF in HCC tissue after surgical resection has predictive value for metastatic HCC recurrence. The ability to risk stratify should improve the treatment strategies after hepatectomy.
