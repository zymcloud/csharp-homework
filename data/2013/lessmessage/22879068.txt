Protein tyrosine kinases are enzymes that are capable of adding a phosphate group to specific tyrosines on target proteins. A receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is a tyrosine kinase located at the cellular membrane and is activated by binding of a ligand via its extracellular domain. Protein phosphorylation by kinases is an important mechanism for communicating signals within a cell and regulating cellular activity; furthermore, this mechanism functions as an "on" or "off" switch in many cellular functions. Ninety unique tyrosine kinase genes, including 58 RTKs, were identified in the human genome; the products of these genes regulate cellular proliferation, survival, differentiation, function, and motility. Tyrosine kinases play a critical role in the development and progression of many types of cancer, in addition to their roles as key regulators of normal cellular processes. Recent studies have revealed that RTKs such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), c-Met, Tie, Axl, discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), and erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph) play a major role in glioma invasion. Herein, we summarize recent advances in understanding the role of RTKs in glioma pathobiology, especially the invasive phenotype, and present the perspective that RTKs are a potential target of glioma therapy.
