BACKGROUND. The liver possesses two distinct mechanisms for healing. Wound healing via hepatic stem cells recapitulates early development (hepatoblast proliferation), while liver regeneration resembles late embryonic growth (hepatocyte proliferation). Loss of control over both of these processes have been proposed as mechanisms that may contribute to poor outcomes in HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS. We used microarray gene expression profiles to examine the involvement of hepatic stem cell and hepatocyte proliferation markers and regulators in HCV-induced cirrhosis and HCC. We compared 30 cirrhosis and 49 HCC samples to 12 disease-free control livers. RESULTS. Cirrhosis and HCC expressed markers of stem cell. Inhibitors of hepatocyte proliferation (HP) were highly expressed in cirrhosis. Loss of these HP inhibitors in HCC patients was associated poor prognosis (94 vs. 38% 2-year recurrence- free survival, p = 0.0003). Principal Components Analysis discriminated cirrhotic and HCC tissues, and HCC patients with poor ( 2 year) recurrence-free survival. Loss of CDH1 expression correlated with up-regulation of hepatocyte proliferation promoters MET and YAP1. CDH1, MET, and YAP1 were independent predictors of recurrence-free survival by Cox regression when corrected for tumor stage (p
