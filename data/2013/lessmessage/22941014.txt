Detection of small Hepatocarcinoma (HCC) by screening of high-risk populations is important to increase the percentage of patients suitable for curative treatment, which would lead to prolongation of the mean survival of patients with HCC. It should be remembered that small HCC is not always necessarily equivalent to early HCC as defined histologically. With recent advances in diagnostic imaging modalities, including contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging with liver-specific contrast enhancement, accurate differential diagnosis of early HCCs from dysplastic nodules has become possible. Because a certain proportion of small HCCs is known to show microscopic vascular invasion, surgical resection would be the treatment of first choice. To minimize potential microscopic invasion, anatomic resection and/or resection with a wide margin should be performed, while preserving liver function to the maximum extent possible. Surgical resection, however, cannot prevent multicentric occurrence of HCC, which remains a major issue precluding curative treatment of HCC.
