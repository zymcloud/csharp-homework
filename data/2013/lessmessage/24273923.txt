Background:Increasing evidence has shown that the deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is closely related to the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To screen for HCC-specific miRNAs, this study investigated the differentially expressed miRNAs between HCC and matched non-tumorous tissue (NT).Methods:This study analyzed the differential expression profiles of miRNAs in 11 pairs of HCC and matched NT from 11 hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection patients with the RT2 miRNA PCR array containing 88 human cancer-related miRNAs. The fold change value was more than two between the HCC and the matched NT, which indicated that there was deregulation of miRNAs. The down-regulated let-7a was validated in another sample set of 34 tissues with the TaqMan RT-qPCR method.Results:Compared with the matched NT tissues, 9 miRNAs were up-regulated in the HCC tissues, and three were considered statistically significant (p 0.05).Conclusions:This study demonstrates that 18 miRNAs were deregulated in the HCC and matched NT tissues. The deregulated miRNAs suggest that further analyses with larger miRNA samples as a diagnostic marker are warranted.
