Scavenger receptors comprise a large family of structurally diverse proteins that are involved in many homeostatic functions. They recognize a wide range of ligands, from pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to endogenous, as well as modified host-derived molecules (DAMPs). The liver deals with blood micro-organisms and DAMPs released from injured organs, thus performing vital metabolic and clearance functions that require the uptake of nutrients and toxins. Many liver cell types, including hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, express scavenger receptors that play key roles in hepatitis C virus entry, lipid uptake, and macrophage activation, among others. Chronic liver disease causes high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hepatitis virus infection, alcohol abuse, and non-alcoholic fatty liver are the main etiologies associated with this disease. In this context, continuous inflammation as a result of liver damage leads to hepatic fibrosis, which frequently brings about cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. In this review, we will summarize the role of scavenger receptors in the pathophysiology of chronic liver diseases. We will also emphasize their potential as biomarkers of advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis and cancer.
