In 29 patients with various malignant tumors there was carried out an estimation of Thiotriazoline efficacy in the treatment of hepatotoxicity in the process of combined chemoradiation therapy. It has been showed that ten-day application of Thiotriazoline in double dose (2,5% solution intravenously by 4,0 ml twice within 24 hours and 1 tablet (100 mg) twice within 24 hours) in patients with I and II degree of hepatotoxicity at the background of combined chemoradiation therapy enabled to remove completely manifestations of cytolysis in 100% of patients, without changing regimen of chemotherapy. To normalize levels of biochemical indices of blood in III degree of hepatotoxicity, more a long intake of Thiotriazoline (about 4 weeks) was required. Regimen of chemoradiation therapy in the period of Thiotriazoline application was not changed.
