Rifampin, an antibiotic widely used for the treatment of mycobacterial infections, produces hepatic, renal and bone marrow toxicity in human and animals. In this study, the protective effects of vitamin C and n-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the toxicity of rifampin on HepG2 cells were investigated. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were cultured in 96-well M of rifampin in the presence of microplate and exposed to 10, 20, 50 and 100 vitamin C (0.1 mg/mL) and NAC (0.2 mg/mL). Protective effect of the two drugs against rifampin toxicity was assessed by MTT assay. Results show that both vitamin C and NAC significantly inhibited HepG2 cellular damage due to rifampin, and vitamin C was relatively more potent than NAC. Rifampin is metabolized by the liver and its toxic metabolites are responsible for the drugâ€ºs hepatic toxicity. Based on our results, it seems that reactive metabolites are the main agents responsible for rifampin hepatotoxicity. The importance of this finding is that if vitamin C or NAC do not affect the antibacterial activity of rifampin, they could be used as preventive agents in rifampin users.
