Breast cancer in men is 100 times less common than in women. The main risk factors include: the mutation of genes BRCA 1 and 2, Klinefelter's syndrome, alcohol, liver disease, obesity. Clinical examinations, mammography and ultrasound are informative and highly sensitive for early detection of these tumors, but are rarely implemented due to lack of awareness of general practitioners. Local treatment includes the Patey-Dyson mastectomy and radiation therapy. Adjuvant systemic therapy is determined by pTNM and typically involves tamoxifen.
