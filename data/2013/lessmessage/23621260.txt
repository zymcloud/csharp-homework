Purpose:The liver is the organ to which colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) most commonly metastasize, and surgical resection has been established as the most effective and potentially curative treatment for CRC with liver metastasis (LM). Therefore, surveillance of LM is vital for improvement of prognosis of CRC patients. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential value of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and marker enzymes in indicating LM with CRC.Methods:Three groups of eligible patients with metastatic cancers were retrospectively included: CRC patients with LM (CRC-LM) or without LM (CRC- NLM), and non-CRC patients with LM (NCRC-LM). All metastatic lesions were identified by CT or MRI. Data on characteristics of the patients, the primary site, the locations of metastasis, CA 19-9, CEA, and biochemical parameters were collected for analysis.Results:A total of 493 patients were retrospectively included. More alcohol consumption was found in CRC-LM than CRC-NLM. Some biochemical enzymes were found to be significantly higher in groups with LM than without (CRC-LM or NCRC-LM v.s CRC-NLM). Both CEA and CA 19-9 were much higher in CRC-LM than CRC-NLM or NCRC-LM. For CRC patients, CA 19-9, Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase, CEA and alcohol consumption were identified as independent factors associated with LM.Conclusion:Our analysis suggested the CA 19-9 might be a potential valuable indicator for LM of CRC in the clinic.
