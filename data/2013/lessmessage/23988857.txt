Background:Thrombocytopenia is a cirrhosis surrogate which is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development.Aims:To compare the clinical characteristics of HCC in the presence and absence of thrombocytopenia.Methods:The baseline clinical data of a large cohort of randomly presenting, biopsy-proven HCC patients was examined for phenotypic patterns, after organizing the data by tumor size and subdivision into tumor size terciles.Results:Small tumor size tercile I patients had the lowest platelet counts. Patients with higher platelets within each size tercile had the lowest bilirubin and prothrombin time and higher γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) levels. When patients with similar platelet and bilirubin levels were compared, α-fetoprotein, GGTP, and ALKP were significantly increased in patients with larger tumors and in the presence of portal vein thrombus. Large tumor size tercile III patients without thrombocytopenia had larger tumors, higher GGTP and ALKP, and lower bilirubin levels than did patients with thrombocytopenia.Conclusions:Thrombocytopenia occurred in 40.7% of patients with smaller tumors but only in 11.3% of patients with larger tumors. Patients without thrombocytopenia had elevated GGTP and ALKP and lower bilirubin levels, regardless of tumor size, but they also had larger tumors within the large tumor tercile.
