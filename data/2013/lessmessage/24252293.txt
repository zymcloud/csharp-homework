Cd(II) complexes of tridentate nitrogen donor ligand, 2,6-bis(3,4,5-trimethylpyrazolyl)pyridine (btmpp), Cd(btmpp)X2 (X:Cl, ONO or N(CN)2) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental and spectral (FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, UV-Vis) analyses, differential thermal analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The molecular structure of reported complex 1, revealed distorted square-pyramidal geometry around Cadmium. Complexes 1-3 and corresponding ligand were tested for cytotoxic activity against the human carcinoma cell lines HEP3B (hepatocellular carcinoma), PC3 (prostate adenocarcinoma), MCF7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and Saos2 (osteosarcoma). The results show that, complexes are more cytotoxic than the free ligand and complex 2 is the most cytotoxic complex for PC3.
