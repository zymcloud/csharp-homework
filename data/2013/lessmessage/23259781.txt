Incidence and mortality associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising throughout the world. Accurate, noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of HCC are urgently needed to reduce worldwide morbidity and mortality related to HCC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), 17- to 25-nucleotide noncoding RNAs that are frequently dysregulated in HCC, have shown great promise as tissue-based markers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. Moreover, they are stably expressed in serum and urine, and these circulating microRNAs (cmiRNAs) are emerging as novel noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection and prognosis of HCC. This article summarizes the latest findings on the role of circulating miRNAs as potential minimally invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HCC.
