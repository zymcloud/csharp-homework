The response rate and overall survival after sorafenib administration in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma are unsatisfactory. We herein present the case of a 65-year-old man with multiple lung metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Because the patient had liver cirrhosis of Child-Pugh B accompanied by pancytopenia, sorafenib administration was initiated at a dose of 400 mg daily. Although he received sorafenib for only 21 days, the patient exhibited complete regression of the tumors. There was no clinical evidence of recurrence without the administration of anticancer treatment. It is unique that short-term sorafenib treatment achieved a complete response.
