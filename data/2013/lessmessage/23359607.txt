Chemotherapy regiments have been widely used in the treatment of a variety of human malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A major cause of failure in chemotherapy is drug resistance of cancer cells. Resistance to doxorubicin (DOX) is a common and representative obstacle to treat cancer effectively. Individual microRNA (miRNA) has been introduced in the evolution of DOX resistance in HCC in recent studies. However, a global and systematic assessment of the miRNA expression profiles contributing to DOX resistance is still lacking. In the present study, we applied high-throughput Illumina sequencing to comprehensively characterize miRNA expression profiles in both human HCC cell line (HepG2) and its DOX-resistant counterpart (HepG2/DOX). A total of 269 known miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, of which 23 were up-regulated and 246 were down-regulated in HepG2/DOX cells, indicating that part of them might be involved in the development of DOX resistance. In addition, we have identified 9 and 13 novel miRNAs up- and down-expressed significantly in HepG2/DOX cells, respectively. miRNA profiling was then validated by quantitative real-time PCR for selected miRNAs, including 22 known miRNAs and 6 novel miRNAs. Furthermore, we predicted the putative target genes for the deregulated miRNAs in the samples. Function annotation implied that these selected miRNAs affected many target genes mainly involved in MAPK signaling pathway. This study provides us a general description of miRNA expression profiling, which is helpful to find potential miRNAs for adjunct treatment to overcome DOX resistance in future HCC chemotherapy.
