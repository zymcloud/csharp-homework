Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and chemoprevention represents a viable approach in lowering the mortality of this disease. Pomegranate fruit, an abundant source of anti-inflammatory phytochemicals, is gaining tremendous attention for its wide-spectrum health benefits. We previously reported that a characterized pomegranate emulsion (PE) prevents diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis though inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF- κ B). Since NF- κ B concurrently induces Wnt/ β -catenin signaling implicated in cell proliferation, cell survival, and apoptosis evasion, we examined antiproliferative, apoptosis-inducing and Wnt/ β -catenin signaling-modulatory mechanisms of PE during DENA rat hepatocarcinogenesis. PE (1 or 10 g/kg) was administered 4 weeks before and 18 weeks following DENA exposure. There was a significant increase in hepatic proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and alteration in cell cycle progression (cyclin D1) due to DENA treatment, and PE dose dependently reversed these effects. PE substantially induced apoptosis by upregulating proapoptotic protein Bax and downregulating antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. PE dose dependently reduced hepatic β -catenin and augmented glycogen synthase kinase-3 β expression. Our study provides evidence that pomegranate phytochemicals exert chemoprevention of hepatic cancer through antiproliferative and proapoptotic mechanisms by modulating Wnt/ β -catenin signaling. PE, thus, targets two interconnected molecular circuits (canonical NF- κ B and Wnt/ β -catenin pathways) to exert chemoprevention of HCC.
