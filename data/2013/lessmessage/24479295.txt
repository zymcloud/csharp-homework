We report a case of hepatic perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) in a woman who was not a carrier of viral hepatitis and had a normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level. CT scan showed a well-enhanced mass in the arterial-phase followed by early washout in the portal venous-phase in the lateral segment of the liver. Angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the liver with rapid washout of the contrast. If a hepatic tumor is found in a female patient with normal AFP level who is not a carrier of hepatitis and is free of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, tissue biopsy should precede treatment to avoid misdiagnosis of liver PEComa as hepatocellular carcinoma.
