Background:In our study, the LDH, albumin, hemoglobin, neutrophile, thrombocyte, lymphocyte counts and prognostic significance of neutrophile-lymphocyte and thrombocyte-lymphocyte ratios in NSCLC derived from these counts obtained during regular examinations of patients were examined.Materials and methods:Histopathologically diagnosed non-small-cell-lung cancer patients between 2008 and 2010 were included in the study. Before the treatment, full blood count including routine lymphocyte count, blood biochemistry examinations including liver (AST, ALT, total protein, Albumin), LDH and kidney (BUN, Cre) function tests were performed.Results:A total of 156 patients, 76 of whom (48.7%) were female and 80 of whom (51.3%) were male were included. Mean hemoglobin level was determined as 12. Overall survival was found to be significantly dependent on whether patients were anemic or not (p: 0.005). Mean LDH level was determined as 233.4. There was nosurvival difference between patients with and without high LDH (p: 0.532). In patients where NLR showed systemic inflammatory response, overall survival was 10.8 months whereas this duration was 19.6 months in patients where the systemic inflammatory response was negative (p: 0.012). In patients where TLR showed systemic inflammatory response, overall survival was 13.6 months whereas this duration was 21.9 months in patients where the systemic inflammatory response was negative (p: 0.04).Conclusions:Molecular methods have been changing rapidly in today's world and they manage the treatment besides defining the prognosis of patients. However, easily accessible and cheap laboratory parameters should be considered in the prognosis of patients besides these new methods.
