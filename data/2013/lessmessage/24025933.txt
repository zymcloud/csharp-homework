A multilocular cystic hepatic lesion detected at computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a common but nonspecific radiologic finding that can cause potential challenges for differential diagnosis. This imaging pattern may be observed in a wide spectrum of common and uncommon neoplastic or nonneoplastic entities. Neoplastic lesions include cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), metastases, mesenchymal hamartoma, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Nonneoplastic lesions include hepatic abscess, echinococcal cyst, intrahepatic hematoma, and biloma. The multiple coalescent cysts seen in polycystic liver disease may exhibit an imaging pattern similar to that of a multilocular cystic lesion. Mural nodularity, irregular thickness of the septa, ragged inner surface, and typical enhancement pattern in the solid portion of the lesion are often indicative of malignancy, although multilocular primary or secondary malignant tumors are uncommon. Recognition of the more common necrosis or cystic change of HCC and metastases induced by locoregional or systemic treatment also is important. The nonenhanced cystic component may be composed of different types of fluids (eg, serous, mucinous, proteinaceous, hemorrhagic, bilious, or mixed) or spontaneous or treatment-related necrosis, whereas the septa may be formed by a wide range of tissues depending on the lesion type. An understanding of the CT and MR imaging findings of these lesions and their respective pathologic correlation aids in accurate diagnosis.
