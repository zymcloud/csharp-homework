Squamous cell carcinoma is a very rare type of urachal malignancy, only a few cases being reported in the medical literature. We present the case of a 49-year-old male patient diagnosed with infected squamous cell urachal carcinoma with multiple pulmonary metastases, after complaints of lower abdominal pain, abdominal mass and fever, without respiratory symptoms. The abdominal ultrasonography and the CT scan revealed a tumoral mass in the lower abdomen in contact with the abdominal wall and the urinary bladder dome, displacing the small bowel. Pulmonary nodular lesions were described in the left lobe pyramid. The intraoperative diagnosis was necrotic urachal tumor with urinary bladder dome invasion and suspected pulmonary metastases, and tumor ablation with bladder dome resection and suture of the bladder were performed. The histopathological result was poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (G3), with negative resection margins. The patient recovered well after surgery, but the prognosis is very poor due to the metastatic stage in which the tumor was diagnosed, no standard chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of metastatic urachal carcinoma being known as effective until now.
