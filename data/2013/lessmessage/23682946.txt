Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphocytes which leads to solid tumors in the lymphoid organs involving lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow and skin. Primary cutaneous lymphoma, a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, can be classified as cutaneous T-cell or cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. These tumors are mostly T-cell origin and mainly locate on trunk, extremities and scalp or forehead. In this article, we report a 22-year-old female case without any symptoms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma except a sign mimicking nasolabial cyst in the nasolabial fold, who was pathologically diagnosed with cutaneous B-cell lymphoma following surgery.
