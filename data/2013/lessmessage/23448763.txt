Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver (IPL) are often difficult to differentiate before surgery. To date, colocalization of IPL and HCC has not been reported. We experienced a case of necrotic HCC surrounded by IPL-like tissue. The raised levels of alpha-fetoprotein and PIVKA-II declined to within the normal ranges after resection of the tumor. The IPL-like nodule most likely developed as a process of an inflammatory reaction such as abscess formation after the spontaneous destruction of the HCC. Our case is a warning that the presence of a 'pseudotumor' does not rule out the possible simultaneous presence of carcinoma.
