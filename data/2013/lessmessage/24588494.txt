Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been implicated as a risk factor for development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Multiple primary sites of oral SCC associated with HCV infection occurs infrequently. This case report describes a rare presentation of multiple primary SCCs of the tongue in a patient with recurrent HCV cirrhosis status post liver transplant that required interdisciplinary medical and surgical management. It is important for oral health care providers to understand the local and systemic implications of HCV infection and perform routine clinical examinations to monitor for development of oral lesions and associated complications.
