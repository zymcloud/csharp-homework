Introduction. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) is an accurate predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis, and has been used on liver allocation in Brazil since 2006. However, its impact on organ allocation, waiting list and post-transplant mortality is still poorly characterized. This study aimed to assess the impact of implementation of the MELD system on liver allocation and mortality after liver transplantation (LT) in Southern Brazil. Material and methods. Adult patients with chronic liver disease on the waiting list for primary deceased-donor LT were divided into two cohorts (pre- and post-MELD implementation) according to the date of waiting list placement. Disease severity, as assessed by MELD score at placement, was similar in both cohorts. Patients were followed for at least 18 months to assess the outcomes of interest (death/LT). Results. Higher MELD scores correlated with waiting list mortality, which increased 20% with each additional point (HR 1.2; 95%CI 1.14-2.26; p
