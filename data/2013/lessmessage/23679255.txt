Background:Areas of Iran have among the highest incidences of esophageal cancer in the world. Definitive chemo-radiotherapy (DCRT) is used for locally advanced esophageal cancer and for inoperable tumors asan alternative to surgical treatment.Materials and methods:This retrospective study was conducted in North- West Iran 2006-2011, including 267 consecutive patients with non-metastatic esophageal cancer. Eligible inoperable patients were treated with DCRT or definitive radiotherapy (DRT) alone. Radiotherapy (RT) was delivered at 1.8-2 Gy/day for five consecutive days in a given week. Chemotherapy (CT) consisted of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.Results:The median survival was 12.7 months with 1, 3 and 5 year survival rates of 55%, 18% and 11%, respectively. On univariate analysis, relations with age at diagnosis (p=0.015), N-stage (p=0.04), total dose of RT (p=0.001), fraction (p<0.001), Gap status (p=0.025), chemotherapeutic regimens (P=0.027), and 5-Fu Mg/m2 (P=0.004) were apparent. Comparing DCRT to DRT, there was a significant difference in survival. Multivariate analysis was performed for comparison between DCRT and DRT showed significant association with age group ≥65 to <65 (P=0.02; OR: 1.46), the total RT dose (Gy) ≥50 to <50 (P=0.01; OR: 0.65) and the fraction group ≥25 to <25 (P=<0.001; OR: 0.54).Conclusions:The survival rates of esophageal cancer treated with DCRT in North West of Iran is poor; therefore, early detection and improved treatment methods, with clinical trials are a high priority.
