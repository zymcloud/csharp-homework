Background:To investigate the role of surgical treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer, we compared the outcomes of chemoradiotherapy alone (CRT) to postoperative chemoradiotherapy (S/CRT), using, Regional Radiotherapy Center, database.Materials and methods:This retrospective study was conducted in North-West of Iran, included of 255 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer. Eligible operable and non-operable, were treated with S/CRT and CRT respectively. Radiotherapy (RT) was delivered at 1.8-2 Gy/day for five consecutive days in a given week. Chemotherapy (CT) consisted of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil.Results:From March 2006 to March 2011 255 patients: male/female 129/96, median age 68 (35-90), squamous/adeno 213/12, received CRT /S+CRT 166/59, median radiation dose 45 Â± 13.6 Gy, Median survival 13.5 (11-15), overall survival (OS) One/ Two/Three 57/21/16%, Died/alive 158/97, Univariate analysis prognostic factors: age/stag/differentiation/dose of RT/fraction/treatment, Multivariate analysis predictor factor: dose of RT/fraction.Conclusions:Although this treatment offers some possibility for improvement of patients with esophageal cancer, there remains a significant need for development of new drug and new therapeutic approaches that can substantially impact survival.
