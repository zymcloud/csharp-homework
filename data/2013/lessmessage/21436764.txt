Although it is common to find metastases of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder to the lymph nodes, lung, bone, and liver, cardiac metastases have only been rarely reported. We report a case of symptomatic metastasis of transitional cell cancer to the right ventricle. A 59-year-old man with a history of transitional cell bladder cancer status post cystectomy and chemotherapy, with neobladder placement, presented with hematuria, shortness of breath, murmur, and evidence of right-sided heart failure. On imaging workup, including transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac computed tomography, we found a large right ventricular mass. A review of the literature showed that there are only 9 cases of cardiac metastasis from transitional cell cancer reported; however, our case is unique because it is the only reported case of symptomatic improvement due to effective treatment with chemotherapy.
