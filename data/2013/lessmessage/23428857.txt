Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has become an important treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nowadays, RFA is generally recognized as an alternative treatment to partial hepatectomy for early HCC, especially for patients with impaired liver function and when liver transplantation is not indicated, although some authors consider that RFA can be used as a first-line treatment for early HCC. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is most commonly classified as palliative rather than potentially curative; there is evidence that TACE prolongs survival in patients with well-compensated liver disease and intermediate-stage HCC. Alone, TACE and RFA have their limitations; in particular, neither can result in adequate control of medium or large HCC. Sequential application of TACE and RFA is, therefore, increasingly being used in the treatment of HCC in patients with well-compensated liver disease. In this study, we will introduce our experience of TACE combined with RFA in the treatment of HCC in a cancer center in China.
