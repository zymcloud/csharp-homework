The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) causes problems in the chemotherapy of human cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate and establish the role of Eclipta alba as MDR reversal agent using multidrug resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (DR-HepG2). To develop DR-HepG2, hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) was transfected with 2-Acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and Aflatoxin B1 (AFB). Cytotoxic effects of the Eclipta alba hydroalcoholic extract (EAE) and standard anti-ancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX) were determined in DR-HepG2 and the parental cells HepG2 using MTT assay. The expression level of MDR1 gene and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) level was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting. From the present investigation, it was found that EAE (10 and 20 μg/ml) could significantly inhibit cell proliferation in DR-HepG2 whereas DOX (0.5 μg/ml) could not because of enhancement effect of MDR1/P-gp. This study demonstrated for the first time the antiproliferative activities of EAE in multidrug resistant DR-HepG2 cells. The findings revealed that Eclipta alba components are effective inhibitors of MDR1/P-gp.
