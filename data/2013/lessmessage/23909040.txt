The effectiveness of planning polychemotherapy (PCT) for cancer patients depends on the functional state of the liver. The use of remaxol was studied in 100 patients with advanced forms of cancer (including breast cancer) in a preventive mode in comparison with the control group (100 patients, essentiale group of 40 patients) and in the process of PCT. Remaxol, compared with the control group, allowed reducing the frequency of drug hepatotoxicity by 30 +/- 3.7% and by 6.5 +/- 2.9% in comparison with the group of patients who received essentiale.
