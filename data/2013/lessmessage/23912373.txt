The authors report the initial clinical experience of gadoxetic acid as a liver-specific magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast mediumin a private clinic in Brasil. This substance, which was recently approved for clinical use in the country, shows specific uptake by the hepatocytes, reaching a concentration peak around 10-20 minutes post-injection. Among the main indications for the use of this contrast medium in MR examinations are: diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, detection and treatment planning of liver metastases, and the differentiation between focal nodular hyperplasia and hepatocellular adenoma.
