Background:With the growing numbers of liver transplant recipients, it is increasingly important to understand the risks of de novo malignancy after liver transplantation.Aim:To characterize the incidence of de novo malignancy after liver transplantation compared with a control non-transplant population.Methods:We studied 534 Indiana state residents undergoing liver transplantation at our center between 1997 and 2004, followed through August 2010. The incidence and predictors of malignancy were determined. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of cancer in our cohort was compared with age-, gender-, and period-matched state population using the Indiana State Cancer Registry.Results:After a mean follow-up of 5.7 Â± 3.2 yr, 73 patients (13.7%) developed 80 cancers, with five- and 10-yr incidence rates of 11.7% and 24.8%, respectively. These included 24 (30%) skin, 16 (20%) hematologic, and 40 (50%) solid tumors. The most common solid cancers were aerodigestive. Compared with matched state population, liver transplant recipients had significantly higher incidence of all cancers (SIR: 3.1, 95% CI [Confidence interval]: 2.9-3.2), skin (melanoma) (SIR: 5.8, 95% CI: 4.7-7.0), hematologic (SIR: 7.1, 95% CI: 6.3-8.0), and solid (SIR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.5-2.8) tumors.Conclusion:There is a significantly increased risk of de novo malignancies after liver transplantation, highlighting the need for surveillance strategies in this population.
