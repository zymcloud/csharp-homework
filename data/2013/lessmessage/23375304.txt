Background:At many centers, various heparin doses have been administrated systemically during living donor partial hepatectomy in an effort to minimize the potential for graft vascular thrombosis, which could lead to delayed graft function. However, there is no consensus regarding the advisability of heparin administration during living donor hepatectomy for liver transplantation.Methods:We prospectively enrolled 270 donors between 2005 and 2011 to investigate donor and recipient outcomes between a low dose (25 IU/kg) and a conventional dose of heparin (50 IU/kg).Results:The low-dose heparin group did not show an increased incidence of vascular thrombosis: the rates of hepatic artery and portal vein thromboses were not significantly different between the two groups (P = .935 and P = .158, respectively). In addition, injection of low-dose heparin reduced donor complications with significant differences in postoperative hospital stay (P < .001), donor operative time (P < .001), hemoglobin/hematocrit decrease (P = .05/P = .02) and hemorrhagic complications (P = .004).Conclusions:Administration of low-dose heparin during living donor hepatectomy can be used without worsening vascular thrombosis or donor complications.
