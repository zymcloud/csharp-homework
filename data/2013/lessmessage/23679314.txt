Many studies have suggested that the XRCC1 Arg280His gene polymorphism might be involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results have been inconsistent. In this study, the authors performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between XRCC1 Arg280His and HCC susceptibility. Published literature from PubMed, EMBASE and CNKI Data was searched. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed- or random- effects models when appropriate. Begg's test was used to measure publication bias. A total of 7 case-control studies covering 1,448 HCC cases and 1,544 controls were included. No significant variation in HCC risk was detected in any of the genetic models overall. In the stratified analysis, four studies with sample sizes over 300 produced similar results. The corresponding pooled ORs were not substantially altered after the exclusion of three studies deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group, which indicated reliability for our meta-analysis results.
