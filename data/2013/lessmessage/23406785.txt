Background and aim:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in western countries. Despite its low sensitivity, the diagnosis of HCC still depends on detection of α-fetoprotein (AFP). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the combined analysis of AFP and des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) in a European cohort.Methods:We performed a single-center study (164 HCC/422 controls), in which the serum concentrations of AFP and DCP were determined.Results:AFP and DCP were elevated in HCC patients compared to controls (p Conclusion:The data suggest that AFP alone is not sufficient for the serological diagnosis of HCC in European patients, while a combination of AFP and DCP can increase the sensitivity even in early-stage patients.
