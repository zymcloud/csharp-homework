A 69-year-old woman, who underwent cadaveric liver transplantation for non-B, non-C liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma in April 2009, was admitted to our hospital because of graft dysfunction. Enhanced computed tomography revealed stenosis of the left branch of the portal vein, obstruction of the right branch of the portal vein at porta hepatis, and esophagogastric varices. Balloon angioplasty of the left branch of the portal vein under transsuperior mesenteric venous portography was performed by minilaparotomy. After dilatation of the left branch of the portal vein, the narrow segment of the portal vein was dilated, which resulted in reduction of collateral circulation. At 7 days after balloon angioplasty, esophageal varices were improved. The patient made a satisfactory recovery, was discharged 8 days after balloon angioplasty, and remains well.
