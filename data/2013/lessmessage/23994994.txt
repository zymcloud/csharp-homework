A 32-year-old man presented with a fever. A laboratory examination detected atypical lymphocytes and liver enzyme elevation. The serological tests for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were consistent with an acute infection pattern. Computed tomograpy showed bowel wall thickening, and colonoscopy revealed numerous ulcerations. The histological findings from the biopsy specimens from the colon were consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and in situ hybridization detected EBER-1 in the atypical lymphocytes. Because his clinical and endoscopic abnormalities improved without medication, we diagnosed the patient with EBV-associated enteropathy. We herein report a rare case of EBV-associated enteropathy that required careful differentiation from PTCL.
