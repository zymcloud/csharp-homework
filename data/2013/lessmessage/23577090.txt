Background:The hOGG1 gene encodes a DNA glycosylase enzyme responsible for DNA repair. The Ser326Cys polymorphism in this gene may influence its repair ability and thus plays a role in carcinogenesis. Several case-control studies have been conducted on this polymorphism and its relationship with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among East Asians. However, their results are inconsistent.Methods:We performed a meta-analysis of published case-control studies assessing the association of the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism with HCC risk among East Asians. PubMed, EMBASE, SCI, BIOSIS, CNKI and WanFang databases were searched. A random-effect model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Analyses were conducted for additive, dominant and recessive genetic models.Results:Eight studies were identified involving 2369 cases and 2442 controls assessing the association of the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism with HCC risk among East Asians. Applying a dominant genetic model, only in the Chinese population, the Cys allele was significantly associated with increased risk of HCC (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.12-2.17). However, two studies influenced this finding according to sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, considerable heterogeneity and bias existed among Chinese studies.Conclusion:There is limited evidence to support that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism is associated with HCC risk among East Asians. Well-designed and large-sized studies are required to determine this relationship.
