Two new oleanane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid saponins were isolated from the husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge and their structures were elucidated as 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl (1 → 6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-28-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1 → 2) [β-D-glucopyranosyl (1 → 6)] β-D-glucopyranosyl-21β,22α-dihydroxyl-olean-12,15-diene and 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl (1 → 2)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-28-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1 → 2) [β-D-glucopyranosyl (1 → 6)] β-D-glucopyranosy-21β,22α-dihydroxyl-olean-12-ene. Meanwhile, the cytotoxic activities of these two compounds were tested on human gastric cancer cell (SGC-7901) and hepatoma carcinoma cell (HepG-2).
