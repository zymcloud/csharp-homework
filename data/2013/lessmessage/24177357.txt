A new series of thiazolidinedione derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro α-glucosidase inhibition and anticancer activities. Compounds 3d, 3e and 3j showed potential α-glucosidase inhibition with IC₅₀ values ranging between 0.1 and 0.3 μg/ml whereas compounds 3i, 3j and 3k have showed better anticancer activity towards human cancer cell lines IMR-32 (neuroblastoma), Hep-G2 (hepatoma) and MCF-7 (breast). Molecular docking studies revealed compounds 3d, 3e and 3j are potent inhibitors of α-glucosidase and also showed compliance with standard parameters of drug likeness.
