Objectives:A germline BIM deletion polymorphism has been proposed to predict a poor treatment efficacy of certain kinase inhibitors. The current study aimed to explore whether the BIM deletion polymorphism predicts the treatment efficacy of sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:All patients who were enrolled in clinical trials to receive sorafenib-containing regimens as first-line therapy for advanced HCC and consented to providing peripheral blood samples were included. Polymerase chain reaction followed by gel electrophoresis was used to detect the germline BIM deletion polymorphism.Results:A total of 89 patients were enrolled; 69 (77%) patients had chronic hepatitis B infection, and 18 (20%) had chronic hepatitis C infection. The heterozygous BIM deletion polymorphism was identified in 9 (10%) patients. Patients with and without the BIM deletion polymorphism had similar response rates (11 vs. 6%) and disease control rates (56 vs. 61%). The time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival were similar between patients with and without the BIM deletion polymorphism. After adjusting for basic clinicopathologic variables and treatment regimens, the BIM polymorphism still could not predict treatment outcomes.Conclusions:The BIM deletion polymorphism was not associated with the treatment efficacy of sorafenib for advanced HCC.
