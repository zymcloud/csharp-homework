Background:BRM (Brahma homologue) is well known for its critical role in tumor suppression and cancer development. Genetic variations in the promoter region of BRM have been suggested to be associated with loss of BRM expression and lung cancer risk. To the authors' knowledge, no study on the role of BRM genetic polymorphisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk has been performed.Methodology/principal findings:In two independent case-control studies containing 796 HCC cases and 806 cancer-free individuals, we genotyped two putative functional insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms [BRM-1321 (rs3832613) and BRM-741 (rs34480940)] within promoter region of BRM in Chinese populations using a PCR-based method. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was used to explore the genotype-phenotype correlation between these polymorphisms and BRM expression in both tissue samples and HCC cell lines. Logistic regression analysis showed that compared to BRM-1321del/del genotype, the ins/del and ins/ins variant genotypes had an increased HCC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.82; adjusted OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.75-3.72, respectively]. No significant association between BRM-741 and HCC incidence was observed. However, stratification analysis revealed a significant association between ins/ins genotype of BRM-741 and increased HCC susceptibility in smokers (adjusted OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.33-3.22). Quantitative PCR analyses demonstrated that the genotypes of BRM-1321 and the corresponding haplotypes were significantly correlated with BRM expression in vivo. Compared with ins/ins genotype, subjects carrying ins/del and del/del genotype had 2.30 and 4.99 fold higher BRM expression in HCC tissue samples, respectively. Similar trends were observed in western blot analysis at protein level.Conclusions/significance:Our findings suggest that BRM promoter polymorphism (BRM-1321) could regulate BRM expression and may serve as a potential marker for genetic susceptibility to HCC.
