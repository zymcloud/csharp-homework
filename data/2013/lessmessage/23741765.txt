Transferrin (TF) is part of a family of proteins that includes serum TF, ovotransferrin, and lactoferrin (1). Serum TF is a monomeric glycoprotein (molecular mass, 76.5 kDa) that binds two Fe3+ ions for delivery to cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. TF is mainly produced in the liver, but other tissues and organs also produce it. The TF receptor (TFRC) mediates the internalization of iron-loaded TF into cells (1, 2). Iron usage is required for various biological processes associated with cell proliferation. The TFRC (CD71 or p90) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein and is found primarily as a homodimer (molecular mass, 180 kDa). It also contains other growth regulatory functions in certain normal and malignant cells. Overexpression of TFRC in cancer cells can be linked to upregulation of transcription factors, such as MYC (an oncogene protein) (3) and HIF-1Î± (a hypoxia factor) (4). The elevated levels of TFRC in some malignancies (e.g., 74% breast carcinomas, 76% lung adenocarcinomas, and 93% lung squamous cell carcinomas) and the extracellular accessibility of this molecule make TFRC a potential molecular target for cancer imaging or therapy (1, 2). Activated leukocytes also have elevated expression of TFRC. Holland et al. (5) prepared 89Zr-N-succinyldesferrioxamine B-transferrin (89Zr-DFO-transferrin, 89Zr-TF) for imaging TFRC expression in inflamed tissue in mice, in MYC prostate cancer (MycCap) cells in transgenic mice, and in MycCap xenografts in mice. Evans et al. (6) evaluated 89Zr-TF for use in imaging tumor burden in the brain.
