Objective:A comparative analysis of the degree of vascularization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNG) of the liver at carrying out multislice computed tomography (MCT) and morphological studies.Patients and methods:34 patients operated on for HCC (19 patients) and FNG of liver (15 patients) were survey. Preoperative we were analyzed four phases of CT-research: native, arterial, venous, delayed. Degree of vascularization of tissue were evaluated for immunohistochemical preparations on the relative share of the area of blood vessels.Results:In native phase of the MCT-study HCC was detected as hypodense or izodensnoe education. Growth of the blood CT density depend on the type and extent of tumor histological differentiation of cancer. The highest values are set in the fabric of FNG and moderately differentiated HCC. The highest levels of venous growth observed in well differentiated HCC. Indicators of vascularization by CT have maximum values in the unaffected liver parenchyma, and the minimum--in the group of poorly differentiated HCC variant.Conclusions:Use of computed tomography with bolus contrast enhancement allows to study the characteristics of blood supply of the liver and focal formations. Frequently only the use of this method helps to evaluate specific morphological structure of tumors--hepatocellular carcinoma or focal nodular hyperplasia. As an additional differential diagnostic feature is recommended to increase the density determination of tissue formation in the arterial phase computed tomography study. The maximum of vascularization by computed tomography and immunohistochemistry (with antibodies CD34) are installed in a tissue of highly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
