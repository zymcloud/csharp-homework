Objective:To assess the level of an inpatient population's awareness about hepatitis and primary liver cancer (PLC), the most common type of which is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and then to initiate education of this group.Methods:A survey was conducted with 1300 participants within the inpatient unit in representative tertiary hospitals in the Chaoshan area of China. Structured questionnaires contained demographic data and statements about different aspects of liver cancer and hepatitis. The questionnaires were completed by trained medical practitioners after they had conducted the interviews.Results:One way ANOVA showed that the sample population lacked adequate knowledge about HCC and hepatitis. Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the participant's level of education had the greatest impact on their total knowledge score when other variables remained constant.Conclusions:The study demonstrated: a general lack of awareness amongst the participants about the preventative strategies, and the management options available for people with primary liver cancer and hepatitis; education level was an important factor affecting knowledge levels. The demonstrated deficiencies in people's knowledge about hepatitis and HCC, and their lack of subsequent protective behaviours are likely to play an important role in HCC and hepatitis transmission or prevention.
