Antrodia cinnamomea is a natural component of some herbal medicines used for treatment of abdominal pain, hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan and other countries. Subchronic oral toxicity studies of A. cinnamomea extracts in male and female BALB/c mice were performed to evaluate its safety. Three different concentrations of A. cinnamomea (16.67, 833.3 and 1666.67 mg/kg/day) were given orally to groups of mice (10 mice/dose) for 90 consecutive days. All animals survived to the end of the study, and there were no significant differences in body weight among the control and treatment groups. No significant differences were found in hematological and serum biochemical parameters among the control and treatment groups. No abnormalities of internal organs were observed in the treated groups.
