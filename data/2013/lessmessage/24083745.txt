Purpose:To investigate the efficacy and safety of Javanica oil emulsion injection (Yadanzi®) combined with pemetrexed and platinum (PP) for treating patients with advanced lung cancer.Patients and methods:From June 2011 to June 2013, we recruited 58 patients with advanced lung cancer, and divided them into two groups. Twenty eight patients received Yadanzi® (from ZheJiang Jiuxu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) together with PP chemotherapy (combined group), while the others were given only PP chemotherapy (control group). After two cycles of treatment, efficacy and safety of treatment were evaluated.Results:The overall response rate [(CR+PR+SD)/(CR+PR+SD+PD)] of the combined group was higher than that of control group (89.7% vs. 86.2%, p>0.05). Regarding rate of life improvement, it was 82.8% in combined group, and 51.7% in the control group (p<0.05). In terms of side effects, leukopenia in combined group was less frequent than that in control group (p<0.05). More patients in the control group were found to suffer liver toxicity.Conclusions:Javanica oil emulsion injection combined with chemotherapy could be considered as a safe and effective regimen in treating patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. It can improve the quality of life and reduce the possibility of leukopenia. Further clinical trials with a large sample size should be conducted to confirm whether addition of Yadanzi® to chemotherapy could increase the response rate, reduce toxicity, enhance tolerability and improve quality of life for patients with advanced lung cancer.
