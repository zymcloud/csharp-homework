Introduction:Ectopic hepatic tissue is due to an uncommon failure of embryological liver development that is rarely described in the world medical literature. The incidence of ectopic liver (EL) has been reported to be anywhere from 0.24% to 0.47% as diagnosed at laparotomy or laparoscopy. We describe a case of EL adherent to the gallbladder, removed at laparoscopic cholecystectomy.Presentation of case:A 37-year-old female was admitted for elective cholecystectomy having had an episode of acute cholecystitis provoked by gallstones. During the procedure, a 30mm×10mm×5mm section of EL tissue attached to the anterior wall of the gallbladder was identified and removed by en-bloc excision during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Histological examination confirmed the absence of malignant degeneration of the hepatic tissue. The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged the day after the operation. She was well when seen six months later.Discussion:EL has been reported in several sites, such as the gallbladder, gastrohepatic ligament, adrenal glands, esophagus, and thoracic cavity. EL is often clinically silent and discovered incidentally during abdominal surgical procedures or autopsies. Because patients with ectopic liver may suffer complications such as torsion, peritoneal bleeding, fatty change, and evolution to cirrhosis or malignant degeneration to hepatocellular carcinoma, any ectopic liver tissue needs to be correctly identified and removed.Conclusion:Despite the rare occurrence of EL, it should be recognized and removed by the surgeon to prevent a higher risk of complications and malignant transformation.
