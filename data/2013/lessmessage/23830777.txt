Management of patients with a benign hepatocellular tumor relies largely on imaging data; the diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) must be made with certainty using MRI, because no other clinical or laboratory data can help diagnosis. It is also essential to identify adenomas to manage them appropriately. The radiological report in these situations is therefore of major importance. However, there are diagnostic traps. The aim of this paper is to present the keys to the diagnosis of benign lesions and to warn of the main diagnostic pitfalls.
