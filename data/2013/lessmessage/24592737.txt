The influence of tumor development on the blood plasma antioxidant system in the area of tumor growth has been studied. Zajdela ascite hepatoma transplanted to the abdominal cavity of Vistar rats was used as a model of tumor growth. It hase been found that tumor development produced and imbalance between pro- and antioxidant systems in the organism of tumor bearer. Besides, a sharp decrease in tocopherol and uric acid concentrations (twice), as well as in the concentration of protein SH-groups (seven times) was noted. In the tumor growth area, along with the tocopherol level decrease, a 5-7 fold increase in the concentrations of uric acid and protein SH-groups was observed. As the concentration of low-molecular antioxidants decreases, the major part is played by protein components which bind or oxidize ions of variable valence. Thus, the level of transferrin (Tf, which is responsible for the transport of iron ions, is reduced in 2.5 to 3 times (from 5.0 to 1.6 mg/ml) in the blood plasma, whereas the Tf level in the ascitic fluid increased from 1.5 to 2.7 mg/ml. The concentration dynamics of the other protein functioning together with Tf, ceruloplasmin (Cp), had opposite (inverse) tendencies. Thus, the Cp concentration in the blood plasma increased 1.5-2 times (from 0.55 to 1.1 mg/ml) whereas it decreased from 0.55 mg/ml to 0.35 mg/ml in the ascites.
