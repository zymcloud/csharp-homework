Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies, with a very poor prognosis. Despite significant improvements in diagnosis and treatment in recent years, the long-term therapeutic efficacy is poor, partially due to tumor metastasis, recurrence, and resistance to chemo- or radio-therapy. Recently, it was found that a major feature of tumors is a combination of unrestrained cell proliferation and impaired apoptosis. There are now 8 recognized members of the IAP-family: NAIP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, Survivin, Bruce, Livin and ILP-2. These proteins all contribute to inhibition of apoptosis, and provide new potential avenues of cancer treatment. As a powerful tool to suppress gene expression in mammalian cells, RNAi species for inhibiting IAP genes can be directed against cancers. This review will provide a brief introduction to recent developments of the application IAP-siRNA in tumor studies, with the aim of inspiring future treatment of HCC.
