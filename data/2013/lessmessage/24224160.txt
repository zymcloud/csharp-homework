Background:Aquaporin (AQP) 3 and AQP 5 are involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of several tumor types.Aim:To investigate expression patterns and clinical significance of AQP3 and AQP5 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of AQP3 and AQP5 in HCC tissues.Results:Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the increased expression of AQP3 and AQP5 protein levels in HCC tissues compared with their adjacent nonneoplastic tissues (both P Conclusion:Our data suggest for the first time that the aberrant expression of AQP3 and AQP5 proteins may be strongly related to tumor progression and prognosis in patients with HCC. The overexpression of AQP3 in combination with upregulation of AQP5 may be an unfavorable prognostic factor for HCC.
