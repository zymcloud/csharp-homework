Aim:Various factors are underlying for the onset of non-B, non-C hepatitis virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC). We aimed to investigate the independent risk factors and profiles associated with NBNC-HCC using a data-mining technique.Methods:We conducted a case-control study and enrolled 223 NBNC-HCC patients and 669 controls from a health checkup database (n = 176 886). Multivariate analysis, random forest analysis and a decision-tree algorithm were employed to examine the independent risk factors, factors distinguishing between the case and control groups, and to identify profiles for the incidence of NBNC-HCC, respectively.Results:In multivariate analysis, besides Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels and the Brinkman index, albumin level was an independent negative risk factor for the incidence of NBNC-HCC (odds ratio = 0.67; 95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.70; P Conclusion:Data-mining analysis revealed that serum albumin level is an independent risk factor and the most distinguishable factor associated with the incidence of NBNC-HCC. Furthermore, we created an NBNC-HCC profile consisting of albumin and GGT levels, the APRI and the Brinkman index. This profile could be used in the screening strategy for NBNC-HCC.
