Background:Effective and tolerable chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin for advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) has been established recently. However, overall prognosis is still poor, and additional therapeutic approaches are needed for patients with locally advanced, irresectable and/or pretreated tumors. Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of chemotherapy represents a safe and well-established treatment modality, but data on its use in patients with BTC are still sparse.Methods:Patients with irresectable BTC predominant to the liver were included in a prospective, open phase II study investigating HAI provided through interventionally implanted port catheters. Intraarterial chemotherapy consisted of biweekly oxaliplatin (O) 85 mg/m(2) and folinic acid (F) 170 mg/m(2) with 5-FU (F) 600 mg/m(2).Results:Between 2004 and 2010, 37 patients were enrolled. A total of 432 cycles of HAI were applied with a median of 9 (range 1-46) cycles. Objective response rate was 16 %, and tumor control was achieved in 24 of 37 (65 %) patients. Median progression-free survival was 6.5 months (range 0.5-26.0; 95 % CI 4.3-8.7), median overall survival was 13.5 (range 0.9-50.7; 95 % CI 11.1-15.9) months. The most frequent adverse event was sensory neuropathy grade 1/2 in 10/14 patients.Conclusions:Using a minimal invasive technique, repetitive HAI with OFF is feasible and results in clinically relevant tumor control with low toxicity in patients with liver predominant advanced BTC.
