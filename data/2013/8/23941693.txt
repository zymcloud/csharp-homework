Background:Although conventional adenocarcinoma accounts for the majority of prostatic carcinomas, it is important to recognize rare variants, like basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which has distinctive histopathological and biological features.Case report:We analyzed three cases of prostatic BCC and all of them complained of acute urinary retention and digital rectal examination disclosed a stony hard prostate. However, all of them presented with low prostate-specific antigen. The diagnosis relied on transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsies or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The microscopic findings suggested basaloid cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm, showing peripheral palisading and forming solid nests, and immunohistochemical markers like 34Î²E12, p63 and Ki67 staining, were positive. After active treatment, two of the patients are alive with tumor and one died five months after discharge from our hospital.
