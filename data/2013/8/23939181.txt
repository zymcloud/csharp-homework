Objective:To modify the success rate of establishing VX2 transplanted tumor model with different methods in rabbits, and access new typed modification and improved technique in catheterization.Methods:In the study, 30 rabbits were randomly divided into 2 groups. In prophase, tumor cell suspension was implanted in group I, while tumor tissue particles were implanted into liver under direct vision, to establish VX2 transplanted tumor model. The rabbits were catheterized from femoral artery to selective hepatic artery under DSA, by using conventional modification with Seldinger technique in group I and by using new typed modification with improved technique in group II. The imaging and histological features of VX2 tumor were evaluated by combining pathology and DSA, then the success rate, operation time and postoperative complications were compared and evaluated.Results:The success rates of the liver tumor model were 60.0% and 93.3%; the disposable success rates of catheterization were 66.7% and 92.8%; the operation time of catheterization were (35.6±5.8) min and (27.4±5.3) min; the incidence rates of adverse reaction were 22.5% and 18.0%; the differences between the two groups in the experimental rabbits were significant (PConclusion:The efficiency of tumor tissue particles implanted is better than that of tumor cell suspension implanted in establishing VX2 transplanted tumor model under direct vision. The cathetenzation quality and outcomes of new typed modification by improved technique, from femoral artery to selective hepatic artery, is superior to those of conventional modification with Seldinger technique.
