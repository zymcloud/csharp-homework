Herein, we report the preparation of genetically engineered protein cages (HspG41C-SP94), taken up selectively by human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. An engineered protein cage-doxorubicin (DOX) conjugate was as cytotoxic as free DOX against HCC cells but much less cytotoxic against normal hepatocytes.
