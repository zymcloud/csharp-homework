Purpose:Selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) with the beta emitter yttrium-90 (Y90) is a rapidly developing therapy option for unresectable liver malignancies. Nontarget irradiation of the gallbladder is a complication of SIRT. Thus, we aimed to assess different strategies to avoid infusion of Y90 into the cystic artery (CA).Methods:After hepatic digital subtraction angiography and administration of technetium-99m-labeled human serum albumin ((99)mTc-HSA), 295 patients with primary or secondary liver tumors underwent single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Different measures were taken before repeated Y90 mapping and SIRT to avoid unintended influx into the CA where necessary. Clinical symptoms, including pain, fever, or a positive Murphy sign, were assessed during patient follow-up.Results:A significant (99)mTc-HSA accumulation in the gallbladder wall (higher (99)mTc-HSA uptake than in normal liver tissue) was seen in 20 patients. The following measures were taken to avoid unintended influx into the CA: temporary/permanent occlusion of the CA with gelfoam (n = 5)/microcoil (n = 1), induction of vasospasm with a microwire (n = 4), or altering catheter position (n = 10). Clinical signs of cholecystitis were observed in only one patient after temporary CA occlusion with gelfoam and were successfully treated by antibiotics. Cholecystectomy was not required for any patient.Conclusion:It is important to identify possible nontarget irradiation of the gallbladder. The risk for radiation-induced cholecystitis can be easily minimized by temporary or permanent CA embolization, vasospasm induction, or altering the catheter position.
