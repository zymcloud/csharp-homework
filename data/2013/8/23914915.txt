Sorafenib is a molecular-targeted therapy used in palliative treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Child-Pugh A patients. We describe the case of a patient who presented with a large HCC in the left liver associated with portal vein thrombosis (PVT). After 9 months of sorafenib treatment, reassessment showed that the tumors had decreased in size with recanalization of the portal vein. A lateral left hepatectomy was performed and pathology showed complete necrosis of the tumor. Sorafenib can downstage HCC in patients with cirrhosis allowing further surgical resection.
