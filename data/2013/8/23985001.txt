Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited iron overload disorder caused by inappropriately low hepcidin secretion leading to increased duodenal absorption of dietary iron, most commonly in C282Y homozygous individuals. This can result in elevated serum ferritin, iron deposition in various organs and ultimately end-organ damage, although there is incomplete biochemical and clinical penetrance and variable phenotypic expression of the HFE mutation in hereditary hemochromatosis. An elevated SF >1000 mg/l [corrected] is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and mortality in C282Y homozygotes.Conversely, a SF
