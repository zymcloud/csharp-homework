Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human malignant tumors worldwide; it is also hard to prevent its metastasis and recurrence by traditional treatments. Up to now, how to prevent and treat HCC is still a challenging problem in clinic. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are cells within malignant tumor that possess the capacity to self-renew and differentiate to lead to the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor, and are the root to cause metastasis, recurrence and bad prognosis of the cancer. Targeting CSCs is a novel therapeutic strategy for management and treatment of the cancer. In recent years, targeting intervention on liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) gradually became a novel strategy for HCC treatment, and some exciting research results in the treatment of HCC were also achieved. In this review, we introduce the biological characteristics of LCSCs and highlight the therapeutic strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting intervention on LCSCs.
