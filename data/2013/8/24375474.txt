Annexin A3 (ANXA3) has been found to play important roles in cancer progression, metastasis, and drug resistance; however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression level, clinical significance and biologic function of ANXA3 in HCC. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining were used to examine ANXA3 expression levels in HCC tumor tissue, and its correlation with the clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC patients was analyzed. The biological functions of ANXA3 in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to chemotherapy were also investigated. ANXA3 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissues as compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Elevated ANXA3 expression was associated with tumor size, number of lesions, tumor stage, and poor prognosis. In hepatoma cell lines, exogenous ANXA3 transduction promoted the tumorigenic activity and metastatic potential of tumor cells. Small interfering RNA silencing of ANXA3 inhibited these processes. In addition, in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that ANXA3 overexpression enhanced resistance to chemotherapy. Taken together, our findings reveal that ANXA3 might play an important role in HCC progression and chemoresistance, and could serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for HCC.
