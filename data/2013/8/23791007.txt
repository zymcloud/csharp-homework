Microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES1), an inducible enzyme similar to cyclooxygenase-2, functions downstream of cyclooxygenase-2 in the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. It contributes to carcinogenesis in a variety of tumors. Here, mPGES1 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays containing a total of 100 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples, 100 peritumoral liver tissue samples, and 13 normal liver tissue samples. The expression of mPGES1 was significantly increased in the HCC tissue samples (P
