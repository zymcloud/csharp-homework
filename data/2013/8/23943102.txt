The management algorithm for patents with liver lesions, most often hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or colorectal cancer metastasis, are complex, ever-changing, and involve multiple treatment modalities including chemotherapy, external-beam radiation, surgery, and locoregional therapies (LRTs). This complexity necessitates a multidisciplinary approach including hepatologists, oncologists, hepatobiliary surgeons, radiation oncologists, and interventional radiologists to coordinate and deliver the complex care that these patients need in a timely manner. The interventional radiologist and hepatobiliary surgeon work closely together in both the pre- and postoperative setting. Preoperative roles include delivering LRTs to patients with HCC and interventions aimed at hepatic optimization prior to resection or transplantation. LRT in this setting is performed either to bridge the patient to transplant or to downstage the initially nontransplant candidate so appropriate transplant criteria are met. Postoperative roles include the management of biliary and vascular complications that may occur after resection or transplantation.
