Purpose:To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of thoracoscopic local ablation therapy with diaphragmatic incision method.Background:Liver tumor in the hepatic dome limits the approach method of ablation. These lesions are accessible through a transdiaphragm, and incision of diaphragm by thoracoscopic surgery might be a valuable option.Patients and methods:Between July 1995 and December 2011, 59 patients with a tumor in the hepatic dome were indicated for thoracoscopic local ablation therapy. The diaphragm above tumor was incised and tumors were ablated thoracoscopically.Results:The mean operating time and blood loss was 222 minutes and 33.8 g, respectively. There was no postoperative mortality, and 7 patients with complications recovered successfully. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for hepatocellular carcinoma was 51.0%. Local recurrence was suspected in 2 cases.Conclusions:Thoracoscopic ablation by incision of the diaphragm represents a feasible approach for the tumor in the hepatic dome with acceptable long-term outcomes.
