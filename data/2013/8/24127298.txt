Gastrointestinal (GI) events have been described with sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib in cancer patients. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis to determine the incidence and relative risk (RR) in patients with cancer treated with these agents. PubMed databases were searched for articles published till May 2013. Eligible studies were selected according to PRISMA statement. Summary incidence, RR, and 95% CIs were calculated using random-effects or fixed-effects models based on the heterogeneity of selected studies. A total of 6,447 patients were available for the meta-analysis; 2,260 had renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 4,187, 1,691 non-small cell lung cancers, 599 hepatocellular cancers, 1,066 breast cancers, 165 neuroendocrine tumors, 304 gastrointestinal stromal tumors and 362 soft tissue sarcomas. Diarrhea was the most common GI event. When stratified by tumor type (RCC vs. non-RCC), the difference among the incidences of GI events was significant for diarrhea (p
