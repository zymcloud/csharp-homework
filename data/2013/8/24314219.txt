Objective:To assess the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (BEV) plus chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).Methods:Seventy-seven mCRC patients received BEV plus 5-Fu type, oxaliplatin or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The clinical efficacy and bevacizumab-related adverse reactions were observed. The efficacy assessment was conducted after at least 2 cycles of BEV therapy. The adverse reactions were recorded in each therapy cycle. Among the 77 cases, 64 patients had finished the efficacy assessment. The adverse reactions in all patients were assessed.Results:The overall response rate (ORR) of BEV plus chemotherapy regimen was 18.75% (12/64), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 75.0% (48/64). In 27 patients who received the regimen as first-line treatment, the ORR reached 37.0% (10/27), while the DCR was 85.2%. Four patients with potentially resectable lesions became resectable after the regimen and received R0 resection of the liver metastases successfully. Twenty-five patients who received the regimen as second line therapy had poor result with ORR 8.0% and DCR 76.0%. Hypertension was observed in 12 cases, with 8 cases of grade 1, 3 cases of grade 2, 1 case of grade 3. Various bleedings occurred in 24/77 cases (31.2%), all were of grade 1-2, including 17 cases of epistaxis, grade 1 hemorrhoid bleeding in one case, hematuria in 3 case (2 of grade 1, 1 of grade 2), GI bleeding in 2 cases, hemoptysis in 1 case (grade 2), and proteinuria in 4 cases (grade 1). Intestinal perforation occurred in 1 case (0.3%). In two patients who had incomplete intestinal obstruction history appeared exacerbated intestinal obstruction symptoms after the application of BEV plus CPT11 regimen.Conclusions:BEV plus chemotherapy regimen as first-line treatment can improve the ORR and DCR of mCRC patients. When it was used as second- or later-line therapy, it may display satisfied DCR, although with a poor efficacy. The bevacizumab-related toxicity is mild and can be well tolerated.
