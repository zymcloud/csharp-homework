Objective:To observe the dynamic levels of serum Golgi protein 73(GP73) in patients prior to and after the onset of liver cancer, and to explore the related factors.Methods:From 2007 to 2012, a periodical screening program was carried out in a group of high risk population with positive Hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg) , twice a year. Their serum specimens from every screening time point were kept in Qidong Biobank until liver cancer was diagnosed. Thirty-nine patients with liver cancer were recruited for the study, each of them at least had three times of specimens collected as well as B ultrasound scan (BUS) exam results at onset of disease and within 30 months before diagnosed, amongst 6 time points. In total, there were 162 specimens collected to test GP73 by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analyses of time series and differences among groups were performed by stata software 10.Results:The average value of 39 patient's GP73 at the time point of liver cancer onset was (126.77 ± 73.73) µg/L, while the values at the other five time points prior to the onset were (128.32 ± 81.18) , (129.97 ± 83.62) , (127.38 ± 80.10) , (135.52 ± 97.88) and (138.24 ± 93.58) µg/L, respectively, with no significant difference (F = 0.07, P = 0.997). No obvious changing trends of GP73 were observed among the 39 liver cancer cases at the 6 time points. All 162 samples were divided into two groups: without hepatic cirrhosis (63 samples) and with cirrhosis (99 samples) according to findings of B-ultrasonic wave; whose average GP73 values were separately (97.16 ± 51.39) and (151.20 ± 91.68) µg/L. The difference showed statistical significance (F = 18.22, P Conclusion:No significant changes of the dynamic levels of GP73 could be found among the liver cancer patients within 30 months prior to the onset of disease. GP73 values of the patients with liver cancer may depend on their background of hepatic diseases; and hepatic cirrhosis might be one of the main influencing factors or confounding factors.
