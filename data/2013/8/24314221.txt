Objective:To evaluate the incidence of extrahepatic collateral arteries involved in the blood supply to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to assess the technical success rates and complications of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) through the collaterals.Methods:1356 TACE procedures were performed in 874 consecutive patients through extrahepatic collateral pathways to HCC between August 2006 and August 2010 in our department. The extrahepatic collateral pathways to HCC revealed on angiography were retrospectively evaluated. TACE through extrahepatic collaterals using iodized oil and gelatin sponge particles was performed when a catheter was advanced into the feeding branch to avoid nontarget embolization.Results:Incidences of collateral source to HCC were 76.3% from the right inferior phrenic artery (RIPA), 2.4% from the left inferior phrenic artery (LIPA), 6.9% from the right and 0.4% from the left internal mammary arteries (RIMA, LIMA), 2.9% from the right intercostal artery (RICA), 2.0% from the omental artery, 0.8% from the right or middle colic artery, 2.3% from the cystic artery, 1.3% from the left and 1.1% from the right gastric arteries (LGA, RGA), 3.5% from the right renal capsular artery (RRCA), right middle adrenal artery (RMAA) and right inferior adrenal artery (IAA). Technical success rates of TACE were 95.9% in the RIPA, 93.8% in the LIPA, 100.0% in the RIMA and LIMA, 55.0% in the RICA, 77.8% in the omental artery, 63.6% in the colic artery, 67.7% in the cystic artery, 76.5% in the LGA, 73.3% in the RGA and 95.8% in the RRCA, RMAA, and RIAA. Complications included skin erythema and necrosis after TACE through the RIMA, skin erythema after TACE through the RICA, cholecystitis after TACE through the cystic artery (n = 1), and pleural effusion, basal atelectasis and hiccup after TACE through the IPA.Conclusion:TACE through extrahepatic collaterals is safe and feasible, and with a high success rate in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
