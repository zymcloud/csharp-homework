The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma requires a multidisciplinary approach; liver transplant is suitable only in the minority of strictly selected patients. The CSTC Brno applies the so called Milan criteria. As of 31 December 2012 the CSTC Brno performed liver transplants in 16 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis, with a five year survival rate of 40% and a 10 year survival after transplant of 20%. It is a paradox that the longest living (30 years) patient of CSTC Brno underwent the transplant for a large fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, which emphasises the prognostic significance of the tumour histology - criterion taken into account for practical reasons only in some indication schemes. Liver transplant for cholangiocarcinoma is no longer being carried out in CSTC. Five patients underwent this operation in the past and the longest living one survived for four years after the transplant. Benign liver tumours (adenomatosis, cystadenoma, hemangioma with compression symptoms) are rather rare indications and transplant results are positive. Four patients were transplanted for liver carcinoid, with one patient experiencing recurrence. The most frequent compact indication for liver transplant in CSTC Brno concerns alcoholic cirrhosis (24%, 108 patients); the survival rate of these patients after transplant is very good (81% 5 year survival and 68% 10 year survival). Likewise, efforts are made to select patients with a low risk of alcohol abuse after the transplant, which is, however, not very successful. The recurrence of some kind of alcohol abuse occurred in 26% transplanted patients, while seven died of alcoholic cirrhosis of the graft.
