Objectives:The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing. We sought to compare tumor characteristics and outcomes after a liver transplant according to the cause of liver disease and ethnicity.Materials and methods:We retrospectively evaluated patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (292, 23%) out of all the liver transplant recipients (N=1266) at the University of Miami between 2000 and 2010. Liver disease was caused by hepatitis C virus in 221 patients (76%), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in 19 patients (6.5%), hepatitis B virus in 20 patients (7%), alcohol in 44 patients (15%), and other in 18 patients (6%). The median age was 57 years (range, 17 to 77 y), 218 were men (75%), 270 were white (92%), and 92 were Hispanic (31.5%).Results:Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were more likely to be older (64 vs 57; P = .0006), Hispanic (58% vs 30%; P = .018); nonsmokers (89% vs 65%; P = .041), diabetic (84% vs 26% P Conclusions:Patients transplanted for hepatocellular carcinoma and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were older, and were more frequently Hispanic than were persons with hepatocellular carcinoma and without [corrected] nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Hispanic ethnicity may be a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma.
