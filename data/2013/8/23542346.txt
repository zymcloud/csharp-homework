Background & aims:This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of a triple therapy in older Japanese patients; telaprevir (TVR) was added to pegylated interferon α2b and ribavirin.Methods:This prospective study enrolled 120 genotype 1b patients with chronic hepatitis C who received 12 weeks of triple therapy followed by a 12-week dual therapy that included pegylated interferon α2b and ribavirin. Patients were categorized according to age: group A, 64 patients aged >60 and group B, 56 patients aged ⩽60. Serum HCV RNA levels were monitored by COBAS TaqMan HCV test.Results:The rates of undetectable HCV RNA at week 4 (rapid virological response, RVR) were 73.4% in group A and 73.2% in group B. No significant difference in sustained virological response (SVR) was found between groups A (76.6%) and B (83.9%) (p=0.314). The SVR rates for patients with interleukin 28B (IL28B) (rs8099917) TT allele (89.4% and 91.9% for groups A and B) were significantly higher than for those with the IL28B TG/GG allele (41.2% and 68.4%, respectively) (both pConclusions:TVR-based triple therapy can be successfully used to treat older patients with genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C.
