Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHCC) is an uncommon form of primary liver cancer. A 57-year-old man was readmitted to our hospital for treatment of recurrent CHCC, 12 months after central bisegmentectomy and 4 months after limited hepatic resection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple hepatic nodules. Laboratory data showed increased serum levels of Î±-fetoprotein (AFP), calcium, and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP), to 5,571 ng/mL, 17.0 mg/dL, and 16.1 pmol/L, respectively. Palliative mass reduction surgery was indicated by the fact that the hypercalcemia was difficult to manage medically. Thus, we performed lateral segmentectomy with partial resection of segment 7 and the caudate lobe, and microwave coagulation therapy for multiple recurrent CHCC. Thereafter, the serum PTH-rP and AFP levels decreased remarkably and the hypercalcemia was controlled for the next 3 months. He died of disease progression 9 months after the last hepatic surgery. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of CHCC producing PTH-rP in the English-language literature.
