Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were used to investigate mRNA expression in the liver following 7-day and 21-day exposures to 0, 10, 50, or 500 ppb sodium arsenite. Arsenic exposure has been linked to several human disorders including cancers and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Quantitative PCR was employed to determine the mRNA expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation [cyclin E1 (ccne1), WEE1 A kinase (wee1)], DNA damage repair [breast cancer 2 (brca2)] and lipid transport and metabolism [carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (crot), fatty acid binding protein-3 (fabp3) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (hmgcs1)]. Results from the 7-day exposure showed sex- and dose-specific changes in expression of wee1, brca2, crot and hmgcs1. No significant differences from controls were observed in fish exposed for 21 days. Expression of all genes, except ccne1, was significantly different between the 7- and 21-day exposures. The results presented here correlate with prior findings from our lab and others, and offer further insight into potential mechanisms of low-dose arsenic exposure.
