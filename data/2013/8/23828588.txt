This study aimed to retrospectively investigate the expression of the phosphate and tension homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein and its prognostic role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with family aggregation resulting from hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis, which have not been established. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the PTEN protein expression in HCC and paired para-cancerous tissues from 79 patients with HCC caused by hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. Of these cases, 34 represented HCC with family aggregation (HCCF group), and 45 represented HCC with no family aggregation (HCCN group). Follow-up data were collected for 3 months to 10 years and analysed for HCC recurrence, survival time and prognostic risk factors. The expression of the PTEN protein in the HCC tissue was dramatically lower in the HCCF group than in the HCCN group. The six-month, one-year and two-year overall recurrence (OR) rates of the HCCF group were significantly higher than those of the HCCN group. The one-year, two-year and five-year overall survival (OS) rates of the HCCF group were lower than those of the HCCN group. Impaired PTEN protein expression was an independent prognostic risk factor that was significantly correlated with OR and OS in HCC patients. Dramatically impaired PTEN protein expression in HCC patients with family aggregation resulting from hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis was correlated with OR and OS, and impaired PTEN expression was an independent risk factor for prognosis after radical surgery.
