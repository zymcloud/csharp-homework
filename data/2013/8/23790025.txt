Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common solid malignant tumor occurring worldwide that leads to the third largest cause of death compared to other cancers. Genetic and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of HCC. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can stimulate the proliferation of epidermal and epithelial cells. The EGF signal pathway has a relationship with the growth of the embryo, tissue repairing, and tumorigenesis.Methods:In this study, 416 patients with hepatitis B virus infection (HBV)-related HCC and 645 individuals who had never been infected with HBV of the Chinese Han population were enrolled. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), whose minor allele frequency >20% in the EGF and EGFR genes, were genotyped to examine their associations with hepatocarcinogenesis. Genotyping experiments were carried out using TaqMan.Results:There were significant differences in genotype distributions (p=0.005) and allele frequencies (p=0.001, odds ratio [OR]=1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-1.79) of rs11569017 in the EGF gene between the HCC and control groups. After binary logistic regression to determine independent factors for susceptibility to HCC under an additive model, rs11569017 was still independently associated with the susceptibility to HCC (p=0.021, OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.06-2.07), but no significant differences in other SNPs were found. Additionally, the haplotype T-G constructed by rs11569017 and rs4444903 of the EGF gene might increase the risk of HBV-related HCC (p=0.002, OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.15-1.82).Conclusion:The rs11569017 T allele was associated with susceptibility to HBV-related HCC.
