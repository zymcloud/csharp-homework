This paper presents the results of analyses of the incidence of malignant neoplasms in lung, liver, and bone and associated connective tissues among Mayak nuclear workers exposed to both internally incorporated plutonium and to external gamma radiation. The study cohort included 22,373 individuals employed at the reactors and radiochemical and plutonium production facilities of the Mayak nuclear complex during 1948-1982 and followed up to the end of 2004. All analyses were carried out by Poisson regression, and the doses used were derived using a recently available update of organ doses, Mayak doses-2008. There was clear evidence for the linear association between internal plutonium dose and the risk of lung cancer. For males, there was evidence of a significant internal plutonium dose response for all histological types of lung cancer evaluated (adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell, and other epithelial); the estimated excess relative risk (ERR)/Gy for adenocarcinoma was the largest (ERR/Gy = 32.5; 95% CI: 16.3; 71.9), about 11-fold higher than that for squamous-cell lung cancer (ERR/Gy = 3.1; 95% CI: 0.3; 9.1). The relationship between liver cancer risk and plutonium exposure was best described by a linear-quadratic (LQ) function, but the LQ effect was diminished after restricting internal doses <2 Gy. Hepatocellular cancer was the most frequently observed type of liver cancer associated with internal plutonium exposure, and hemangiosarcomas were exclusively observed only at high internal plutonium doses (>4 Gy). For malignant neoplasms of bone and associated connective tissues, the trend was not statistically significant in relation to internal plutonium dose, but a statistically significantly higher risk (RR=13.7; 95% CI= 3.0; 58.5) was found among unmonitored female plutonium workers who were employed in the most hazardous plutonium production facility commissioned prior to 1950.
