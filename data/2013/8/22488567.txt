FOXJ1 is a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. Recent studies suggested that FOXJ1 may function as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. To investigate the potential roles of FOXJ1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), expression of FOXJ1 was first examined in eight paired frozen HCC and adjacent noncancerous liver tissues by Western blot, and we found that FOXJ1 was upregulated in HCC specimens. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm our results in 108 HCC samples. Moreover, we also evaluated its relation with clinicopathological variables and the prognostic significance. The data showed that high expression of FOXJ1 was associated with histological grade (P
