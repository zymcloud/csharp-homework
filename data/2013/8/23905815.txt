Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, affecting approximately 350 to 400 million people worldwide, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Chronic hepatitis B remains a public health issue despite marked progress in public intervention programs. Individuals with chronic HBV infection have an increased risk for cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The availability of safe and effective vaccines has reduced the burden of diseases. The choice of appropriate pharmacotherapy is critical in altering the course of the infection and reducing the costs associated with the management of chronic hepatitis B.
