Background/aim:Data on the clinicopathological features and prognostic impact of c-N-Methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine HOS Transforming gene (c-MET) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are inconsistent. We assessed c-MET and HGF expression in 49 patients with early-stage HCC and correlated the results with disease characteristics and survival.Materials and methods:Expression of c-MET and HGF mRNA in tumor (T) and non-tumor (NT) tissues was assessed. Results were correlated with patient characteristics and overall and recurrence-free survival.Results:Median relative tumor c-MET and HGF expressions were 3.23 (T/NT ratio 6.46) and 9.07 (T/NT ratio 0.77), respectively. c-MET and HGF were overexpressed in early-stage disease with favorable characteristics although there was no association with survival.Conclusion:Contrary to other studies, in our series increased tumor c-MET and HGF expressions were associated with favorable disease attributes but not with survival. The prognostic and therapeutic applications of this knowledge to HCC are under active investigation.
