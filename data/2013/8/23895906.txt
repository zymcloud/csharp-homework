Transarterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation are currently the most widely used modalities in the minimally invasive treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. This article briefly summarizes the minimally invasive therapeutic options in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma focusing on transarterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation and describes normal post-treatment imaging appearances. Imaging features of post-treatment local tumor recurrence as well as procedure-related complications following these interventions have also been described.
