Zinc-fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) and zinc-finger and BTB domain containing 20 (ZBTB20) repress the postnatal expression of α-fetoprotein (AFP) by interacting with the AFP gene promoter regions. ZHX2 inhibits the expression of AFP and cyclins A and E. ZBTB20 is negatively regulated by CUX1, which promotes cell-cycle progression, suggesting that AFP reactivation is closely linked to hepatocyte proliferation. A slight elevation in the serum AFP level often occurs in patients with chronic hepatitis C in the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is an independent risk factor for HCC development to complement the fibrosis stage. In addition, the sustained elevation of AFP after interferon therapy is a risk factor of HCC development. AFP levels are clinically useful in predicting the outcomes of liver transplantation and sorafenib therapy for HCC patients. A low preoperative AFP level is a predictor of long-term survival and is associated with a low recurrence rate of HCC after liver transplantation. AFP response (≥20% decrease in AFP during 6-8 weeks of treatment) rather than radiological outcomes is a significant prognostic factor for survival in sorafenib-treated HCC patients. Highly sensitive Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3) is 5-10 times more sensitive than conventional AFP-L3, and useful for early detection of HCC in patients with total AFP below 20 ng/mL.
