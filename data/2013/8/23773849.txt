Previous studies on both human and mice livers showed MDB formation in both drug hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the drug hepatitis mouse model of MDB formation, numerous markers for progenitor cells were found in the cells forming MDBs. In current study, using the drug hepatitis mouse model, we found that the MDB forming cells expressed two additional progenitor cell markers. These markers were CD49f and TLR4.
Integrin alpha 6 (CD49f); Malloryâ€“Denk bodies (MDBs); Progenitor cells; Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4); Tumor-initiating stem-like cells (TISC).
