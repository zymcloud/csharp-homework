This study aims t explore the effect and application of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on hepatocellular carcinoma in microcirculation by observing the angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma in transplanted area. BMSCs were isolated and cultured primarily using the method of whole bone marrow culture and identifying surface antigens of third-generation bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells using flow cytometry. Hepatoma cells cultured with BMSCs-conditioned medium (BMSCs-CM) were assayed using the cell proliferation rate of the MTT method. Nude mice were divided into control group (group A), BMSCs cell transplantation group (group B), HepG-2 cell group (group C), and combined BMSCs and HepG-2 cell cotransplanted group (group D). The result showed that the microvascular density was not significantly different in groups A and B. However, the microvascular density at 14 days was higher than 0 day in group C (P 0.05). But the microvascular density of group C was higher than groups A and B at 14 days (P
