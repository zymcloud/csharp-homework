Objective:To observe expression of SIRT3 in normal liver tissue, cirrhotic tissue and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and to explore the significance of SIRT3 in primary HCC.Methods:SIRT3 expression was detected in 10 normal cases, 30 cases with, 30 HCC cases by immunohistochemical and Western-blotting method.Results:Immunohistochemical assay showed that the SIRT3 positive expression rates were 100.0% (10/10), 96.7% (29/30) and 60.0% (18/30), respectively in normal group, paracancer group and HCC group. And the SIRT3 expression in HCC group was significantly lower than in normal group and paracancer group (PConclusions:Abnormal expression of SIRT3 is closely related to the biological behavior of primary HCC.
