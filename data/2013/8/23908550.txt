Objective:This systematic review was conducted to summarize the use of circulating tumour cell (CTC) detection as a prognostic indicator in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Databases (MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched to identify studies that reported the detection of CTCs in patients with gastric cancer or HCC.Results:Fifteen studies in patients with gastric cancer and 10 studies in patients with HCC, with a total of 793 and 577 patients, respectively, met the specific inclusion criteria for further analysis. Heterogeneity and potential bias among the studies prevented any statistical analysis.Conclusion:Several methodological techniques have allowed the detection of CTCs in patients with gastric cancer or HCC, but the studies identified in this report generally reported on small cohorts and there was heterogeneity and potential bias in the studies. This highlights the need for large systematic multicentre clinical trials to confirm the potential prognostic benefit of detecting CTCs in patients with cancer.
