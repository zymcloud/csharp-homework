The authors report on new trends in the multidisciplinary treatment of liver tumors from the 3rd Interdisciplinary Treatment of Liver Tumors Congress in Essen, Germany. Novel aspects of molecular target-oriented therapies of hepatocarcinoma were reported, such as the current position of radiofrequency and microwave ablation of tumors compared with the new electroporation technique. State-of-the-art and new surgical trends in cholangiocarcinoma treatment were also discussed. The correlation of the biological behavior involved in the differentiation of melanomas with the treatment of liver metastasis was better defined. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and combined strategies for colorectal liver metastasis were focused on intra-arterial therapeutic options. New data on neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases were also shared, leading to a better orientation for patient selection for surgical treatment.
