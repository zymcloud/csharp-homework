Annonaceous acetogenins (ACGs) are one of the most interesting classes of natural products appearing in the past two decades. Here, we studied the antitumor activity and toxicity relationship of ACGs including annosquamin B (1), bullatacin (2) and annosquatin B (3) in vivo. A single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 μg/kg of annosquamin B, bullatacin and annosquatin B did not cause side effects in normal mice. Bullatacin treatment with five doses of 25 and 50 μg/kg in H22 hepatoma cells bearing mice resulted in about 61% reduction in tumor growth with hematologic parameters increased significantly in normal mice. Annosquamin B and annosquatin B treatments with 10 doses of 25, 50 and 100 μg/kg in the H22 hepatoma cells transplantation tumor model mice resulted in maximum 53.7% and 58.7% reduction in tumor growth, respectively, and did not cause severe side effects in normal mice. This study provided the evidence that adjacent bis-THF ACGs showed higher antitumor activity and toxicity than mono-THF and nonadjacent bis-THF ACGs in vivo. Furthermore, it was found that bullatacin led to liver and kidney toxicity via increasing calcium concentration, ROS production, and Bax expression and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in rats with repeated treatment with bullatacin for 3 weeks.
