Background and purpose:Our previous study demonstrated that 6-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-(3-methoxyphenyl)quinazolin-4-one (HMJ38) was a potent anti-tubulin agent. Here, HMJ38 was used as a lead compound to develop more potent anti-cancer agents and to examine the anti-cancer mechanisms.Experimental approach:Using computer-aided drug design, 2-aryl-6-substituted quinazolinones (MJ compounds) were designed and synthesized by introducing substituents at C-2 and C-6 positions of HMJ38. The cytotoxicity of MJ compounds towards human cancer cells was examined by Trypan blue exclusion assay. Microtubule distribution was visualized using TubulinTracker(TM) Green reagent. Protein expression of cell cycle regulators and JNK was assessed by Western blot analysis.Key results:Compounds MJ65-70 exhibited strong anti-proliferative effects towards melanoma M21, lung squamous carcinoma CH27, lung non-small carcinoma H460, hepatoma Hep3B and oral cancer HSC-3 cells, with one compund MJ66 (6-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-(naphthalen-1-yl)quinazolin-4-one) highly active against M21 cells (IC50 about 0.033 Î¼M). Treatment of CH27 or HSC-3 cells with MJ65-70 resulted in significant mitotic arrest accompanied by increasing multiple asters of microtubules. JNK protein expression was involved in the MJ65-70-induced CH27 and M21 cell death. Consistent with the cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, marked increases in cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 phosphorylation were also observed, after treatment with MJ65-70.Conclusions and implication:MJ65-70 are dual-targeted, tubulin- and JNK-binding, anti-cancer agents and induce cancer cell death through up-regulation of JNK and interfering in the dynamics of tubulin. Our work provides a new strategy and mechanism for developing dual-targeted anti-cancer drugs, contributing to clinical anti-cancer drug discovery and application.
