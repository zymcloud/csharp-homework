Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-circulating homotetrameric protein. More than 100 point mutations have been identified in the TTR gene and several are related with amyloid diseases. Here we focused our attention in the TTR L12P variant associated with severe peripheral neuropathy and leptomeningeal amyloidosis. By using different cell lines derived from tissues specialized on TTR synthesis, such as the hepatocyte and the choroid plexus expressing WT, V30M, or L12P TTR variants we analyzed secretion, intracellular aggregation and degradation patterns. Also, we used liver-specific AAV gene transfer to assess expression of the L12P variant in vivo. We found the following: (i) decreased secretion with intracellular aggregation of TTR L12P in hepatoma cells relative to WT and V30M variant; this differential property of TTR L12P variant was also observed in mice injected with L12P AAV vector; (ii) differential N-glycosylation pattern of L12P variant in hepatoma cell lysates, conditioned media and mouse sera, which might represent an escape mechanism from ERAD degradation; (iii) intracellular L12P TTR aggregates mainly localized to lysosomes in cultured cells and liver; and (iv) none of the above findings were present in choroid plexus derived cells, suggesting particular secretion/quality control mechanisms that might contribute to leptomeningeal amyloidosis associated with the L12P variant. These observations open new avenues for the treatment of TTR associated leptomeningeal amyloidosis.
