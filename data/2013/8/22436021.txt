Myrtenal is a novel class of compound belongs to monoterpenes found predominantly in mint, pepper, etc., and it was shown to have excellent pharmacological activities against many diseases among which cancer is imperative. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary malignancy of the hepatocytes, which rapidly leads to death in short periods. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible therapeutic efficiency of myrtenal against diethylnitrosamine-induced experimental hepatocarcinogenesis by analyzing the key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, lysosomal and mitochondrial TCA cycle enzymes, and also the possible role of tumor suppressor protein p53, and scanning electron microscopic studies. The results revealed that myrtenal significantly ameliorated the altered enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, lysosomal and mitochondrial enzymes, and interestingly the tumor suppressor protein p53 was found to be significantly accumulated in myrtenal-treated animals, which inevitably confirms that myrtenal has a prominent role in preventing the liver cancer during treatment. Furthermore, the antineoplastic property was well evidenced by the mRNA expression of p53 protein by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis. The observed anticancer property of myrtenal may be due to the involvement and expression of p53 and influence in the mitochondrial and lysosomal membrane integrity and also interference in the gluconeogenesis process of cancer cells. Our results suggest that myrtenal is very efficient and useful compound in the treatment of liver cancer in future.
