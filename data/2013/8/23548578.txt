Background:The aim of this study was to compare postoperative survival between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with and without viral infection.Methods:From among 398 HCC patients in our collected database, 377 who underwent surgery were enrolled. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1, those who had no hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection, and group 2, those who had hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection. Univariate analysis was performed to compare clinical factors, including viral infection, with overall survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the overall and disease-free survival curves for the 2 groups.Results:Univariate analysis showed that viral infection showed no such association. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test revealed no significant intergroup differences in either overall or disease-free survival.Conclusions:The presence or absence of viral infection shows no significant association with the postoperative survival of patients undergoing surgery for HCC.
