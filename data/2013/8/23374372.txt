Background:The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of exercise therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent hepatectomy.Methods:Fifty-one patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were randomized to diet therapy alone (n = 25) or to exercise in addition to diet therapy (n = 26). Exercise at the anaerobic threshold of each patient was started 1 month preoperatively, resumed from 1 week postoperatively, and continued for 6 months.Results:Whole body mass and fat mass in the exercise group compared with the diet group were significantly decreased at 6 months postoperatively. Fasting serum insulin and the homeostasis model assessment score were also significantly decreased. At 6 months, anaerobic threshold and peak oxygen consumption were significantly increased, while serum insulin and insulin resistance were significantly improved in a high-frequency exercise subgroup compared with a low-frequency group.Conclusions:Perioperative exercise therapy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with liver dysfunction may improve insulin resistance associated with hepatic impairment and suggests a benefit to the early resumption of daily exercise after hepatectomy.
