Background:The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) are known to be closely associated with tumor growth and metastasis in several kinds of human tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of DLC1 and PAI-1 in ovarian carcinoma, and evaluate their relations with the prognosis of ovarian carcinoma.Methods:Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot were used to examine the expressions of DLC1 and PAI-1 protein in 25 specimens normal ovarian tissues, 52 specimens of serous cystadenocarcinoma tissues and 23 specimens of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma tissues. Chi-square test, Logistic regression and Partial Correlate analysis were performed to evaluate the association between DLC1 and PAI-1 with clinicopathological characteristics. Overall survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox analysis. The relationships between DLC1 and PAI-1 protein expression were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient.Results:The expression of DLC1 protein in ovarian carcinoma tissues was significantly lower than that in normal ovarian tissues, but it was converse for PAI-1. In ovarian carcinoma, the expression of DLC1 was significantly associated with advanced FIGO stage, ascites and positive lymph node metastasis, whereas PAI-1 protein was closely related with advanced FIGO stage, poor histological differentiation and lymph node metastasis. The expression of DLC1 was negatively correlated with PAI-1 in ovarian carcinoma. Ovarian cancer patients with negative expression of DLC1 and positive expression of PAI-1 had the worst overall survival time compared to other patients.Conclusions:The expression of DLC1 and PAI-1 were closely related with the metastasis and invasion of ovarian carcinoma, only the combination of DLC1 and PAI-1 could serve as an independent prognostic factor of ovarian carcinoma.
