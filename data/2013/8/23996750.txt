Objective:To investigate the expression of microRNA-218 (miR-218) and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Forty-six pairs of fresh surgical specimens of HCC and adjacent tissues were examined for miR-218 expression using qRT-PCR. A miR-218 mimic was transfected into HepG2 cells, and the cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed by MTT assay and flow cytometry, and the potential targets of miR-218 were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting.Results:The expressions of miR-218 in HCC tissues were significantly down-regulated compared to those in the adjacent tissues (P5 cm) and an advanced TNM stage (III+IV) (PConclusion:The low-expression of miR-218 is correlated with malignant clinicopathological characteristics of HCC, and miR-218 may inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell apoptosis by down-regulating Bmi-1 and CDK6 in HCC.
