Background:Contralateral hypertrophy after (90)Y radioembolization has been described in case reports, but the incidence and quantitative extent of liver volume modifications after this therapy are unknown.Methods:This retrospective study examined patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and underlying cirrhosis treated by (90)Y radioembolization. The main inclusion criteria were unilateral treatment, no prior liver surgery, and computed tomographic scans allowing for volumetric assessments. Treated, tumor, and contralateral liver volumes were measured. Whole liver volume and the ratio of contralateral to total functional liver volume after a virtual hepatectomy were calculated.Results:Data of 34 patients were analyzed. Response rates were 26 % according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and 63 % according to modified RECIST. Median overall survival was 13.5 months. Median treated volume decreased from 938 mL (interquartile range [IQR] = 719) to 702 mL (IQR = 656) (p Conclusions:(90)Y radioembolization induced frequent and similar increases in functional liver remnant volume compared with portal vein embolization. This technique should be tested in a prospective study phase 2 study before liver resection.
