Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic state of interactions between HBV, the hepatocytes, and the patient's immune system. HBV replication is the key driving force for the HBV-related immune clearance events that determine the outcomes. The extended immune clearance phase is associated with liver disease progression, including development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, the primary aim of therapy is to eliminate or permanently suppress HBV to reduce hepatitis activity and thereby reduce the risk or slow the progression of liver disease.
