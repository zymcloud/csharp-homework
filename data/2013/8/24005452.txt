Introduction:Helicobacter (H.) hepaticus infection causes chronic active hepatitis and induces hepatocellular tumours in A/JCr mice, but evidence of this in humans is scarce. This study aimed to demonstrate the correlation between H. hepaticus and human primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The sera of 50 patients with primary HCC were tested for the presence of anti-H. pylori and anti-H. hepaticus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The liver tissues of patients who tested positive for serum antibody were analysed for H. hepaticus-specific 16S rRNA, H. hepaticus cdtB, H. pylori cagA, H. pylori vacA and H. pylori ureC genes using polymerase chain reaction.Results:After the anti-H. pylori antibodies in the serum samples were absorbed by H. pylori antigen, the anti-H. hepaticus IgG serum antibody detection rate was 50.0% in patients with primary HCC. This was significantly higher (p Conclusion:The present study identified the presence of H. hepaticus infection in patients with primary HCC using serological and molecular biological detection, suggesting that H. hepaticus infection may be involved in the progression of HCC.
