Objective:To construct a high metastatic potential human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) orthotopic transplantation model with palliative liver resection in nude mice.Methods:A human HCC orthotopic nude mice model was established by administering a single inoculation of the highly metastatic MHCC97H tumor tissue (size 2 mm * 2 mm * 2 mm) into the left liver lobe. At day 14 post-inoculation, a random group of the mice received palliative liver resection; the unresected mice served as controls. Changes in expression levels of 113 genes with metastasis-related functions were evaluated in the residual HCC tissues. At day 35 post-resection, a random group of the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and a comprehensive metastases examination was performed. The remaining mice were used to observe life span. All statistical analyses were performed by the SPSS v17.0 software, and significance was defined as P less than 0.05.Results:The nude mouse model of highly metastatic HCC with palliative liver resection was successfully established. Incidences of intrahepatic and abdominal metastases were higher in the palliative resected group (vs. unresected group: 11.7+/-4.7 vs. 6.3+/-2.8, t = -2.412, P less than 0.05 and 9.8+/-3.4 vs. 5.2+/-2.6, t = -2.641, P less than 0.05 respectively). In addition, the palliative resected group showed significantly enhanced pulmonary metastasis (vs. unresected group: 14.3+/-4.7 vs. 8.7+/-4.7, t = -2.348, P less than 0.05). Differential gene expression levels were found for MTSS1, TGFbl, SMAD2, IL-1b, and MMP7, and were situated in the central position of gene function net of residual HCC. The life-span of the palliative resected group was significantly longer than that of the unresected group (60.8+/-2.7 vs. 51.3+/-1.4 days, x2 = 12.850, P less than 0.01).Conclusion:The highly metastatic human HCC nude mouse model with palliative liver resection that was successfully constructed in this study represents a useful investigational tool to assess the biological characteristics of residual cancer and to screen therapeutic strategies.
