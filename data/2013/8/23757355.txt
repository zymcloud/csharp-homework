Purpose:Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) reflects hepatic synthetic function and plays an important role in the development and progression of various cancers. In this study, we investigated whether pretreatment serum IGF-I levels predict time-to-recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma after curative treatment.Experimental design:Consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who had undergone surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, or percutaneous ethanol injection as curative treatments of early hepatocellular carcinoma were included from two prospective cohorts and the training set (n = 101) and the validation set (n = 91) were established. Serum samples were collected before treatment and the levels of IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were analyzed with regard to their associations with recurrence and survival.Results:In the training set, patients with low IGF-I levels showed significantly shorter TTR [median, 14.6 months; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.8-27.5] than patients with high IGF-I levels (median, 50.8 months; 95% CI, 36.9-64.7; P Conclusions:Low-baseline IGF-I levels independently correlated with shorter TTR and poorer survival in patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma after curative treatment.
