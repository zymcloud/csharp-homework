Study design:A retrospective study of 36 patients with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of the mobile spine was performed by survival analysis.Objective:To discuss the factors that may affect outcomes of patients with HCC spinal metastases.Summary of background data:HCC is a rare tumor in Western countries. However, HCC is common in Far East (Taiwan, Korea, mainland China), where the hepatitis B virus is epidemic. As the mean survival time of patients with HCC has largely increased in recent years, it is now more common to encounter a patient with epidural spinal cord compression caused by HCC spinal metastases in clinic.Methods:The univariate and multivariate analyses of various clinical factors were performed to identify independent variables that could predict prognosis. The survival rate was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were analyzed by the log-rank test. Factors with P values of 0.1 or less were subjected to multivariate analysis for survival rate by multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis.Results:A total of 36 patients with metastatic HCC of the mobile spine were included in the study. Age (â‰¤45 yr/>45 yr), duration of preoperative symptoms (Conclusion:Tomita score no more than 7 is a favorable prognostic factor for HCC metastases in the mobile spine.Level of evidence:4.
