Pulmonary concerns in liver transplant candidates have intraoperative and outcome implications. Evolving MELD exception policies address transplant priority for problems such as hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, and hemorrhagic hereditary telangiectasia. Other pulmonary issues such as refractory hepatic hydrothorax, advanced chronic obstructive lung disease (including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) and indeterminate pulmonary nodules may affect liver transplant consideration. Herein, we discuss current pulmonary-related contraindications, indications and MELD exception policies for liver transplantation, suggesting future considerations.
