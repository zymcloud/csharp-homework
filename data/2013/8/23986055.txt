We report a case of multiple lung metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)successfully treated by oral administration of tegafur/uracil(UFT). A 70-year-old man underwent left hepatic lobectomy for HCC. Intrahepatic recurrence appeared 3 months after the operation and multiple lung metastases appeared at 6 months. Transarterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation were applied for intrahepatic recurrences, and oral administration of UFT(300 mg/day)was initiated for lung metastases. Four months after the initiation of UFT therapy, CT scan showed complete remission(CR)of liver and lung lesions, and elevated AFP and PIVKA-II levels returned to normal. Although the patient underwent a partial hepatectomy for solitary intrahepatic recurrence 2 years later, CR of lung metastases was maintained. The present case suggests the clinical usefulness of UFT for HCC with extrahepatic recurrences, given that effective systemic treatments for HCC are currently limited.
