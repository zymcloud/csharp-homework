Background & aims:The development of ascites in patients with cirrhosis is associated with a high rate of health care utilization. New models of specialized caregiving support are necessary to optimize its management. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and financial sustainability of the "Care management check-up" as a new model of specialized caregiving support based on a series of diagnostic facilities performed in real time and on the integrated activity of consultant hepatologists at the hospital unit for outpatients, dedicated nurses, physicians in training and primary physicians, compared to standard care in outpatients with cirrhosis and ascites.Methods:100 cirrhotic patients admitted to our hospital were allocated, after discharge, to the "Care management check-up" group (group 1), or to the "Standard outpatient care" group (group 2), and followed prospectively as outpatients up to death or for at least 12 months. Patients of the two groups could also access to a "Day hospital" when an invasive procedure was required. In group 1, the "Care management check-up" and the "Day hospital" taken together defined the "Care management program".Results:Twelve-month mortality was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (45.7% vs. 23.1%, pConclusions:The study suggests that this new model of specialized caregiving reduces 12-month mortality in patients with cirrhosis and ascites as well as the global health care costs for their management.
