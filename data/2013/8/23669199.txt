Background:The preoperative predictors of microvascular invasion (MVI) in multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are currently unclear.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 266 patients who underwent potentially curative resection of multinodular HCC. MVI was diagnosed on pathological examination in 64 patients. Preoperative risk factors for MVI were identified and survival curves were analyzed.Results:Patients with MVI had significantly lower overall and recurrence-free survival rates than those without MVI (overall survival, 1 year: 86% vs. 71%, 3 years: 58% vs. 16%; recurrence-free survival, 1 year: 69% vs. 12%; 3 years: 48% vs. 12%; both P 400 μg/L (odds ratio [OR] = 3.732, P = 0.016), serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level >130 U/L (OR = 19.779, P 8 cm (OR = 5.545, P = 0.010), and tumor number >3 (OR = 11.566, P = 0.007) were independent predictors of MVI. A scoring system was constructed, and the MVI rate was significantly higher in patients with a score of ≥3 than those with a score of Conclusions:Serum AFP level >400 μg/L, serum GGT level >130 U/L, total tumor diameter >8 cm, and tumor number >3 were preoperative predictors of MVI in patients with multinodular HCC. In patients with a high risk of MVI and well-preserved liver function, anatomic resection may be worth considering.
