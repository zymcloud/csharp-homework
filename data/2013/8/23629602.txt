Objectives:The combination of computed tomography with hepatic arteriography and arterial portography (CTHA/CTAP) can detect additional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) nodules undetected by conventional dynamic CT.Methods:In this single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 280 patients who were diagnosed as having HCC by conventional dynamic CT, and eligible for radiofrequency ablation (RFA), to undergo CTHA/CTAP before treatment, or to the control group. Newly detected HCC nodules by CTHA/CTAP were intended to be ablated completely. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival and the key secondary end point was overall survival. The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Those with nonablated nodules were treated as for recurrence.Results:A total of 75 nodules were newly diagnosed as HCC by CTHA/CTAP in 45 patients. Three patients (one in the CTHA/CTAP group and two in the control group) who refused treatment were excluded from all analyses. The cumulative recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 60.1, 29.0, and 18.9% in the CTHA/CTAP group and 52.2, 29.7, and 23.1% in the control group, respectively (P=0.66 by log-rank test; hazard ratio, 0.94 for CTHA/CTAP vs. control; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-1.22). The cumulative overall survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 79.7 and 56.4% in the CTHA/CTAP group and 86.8 and 60.1% in the control group, respectively (P=0.50; hazard ratio, 1.15, 95% CI, 0.77-1.71).Conclusions:CTHA/CTAP may detect recurrent lesions earlier. However, CTHA/CTAP before RFA did not improve cumulative recurrence-free survival or overall survival.
