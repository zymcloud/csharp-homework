Background and aim:Serum des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) levels using a newly developed electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA, novel DCP [NX-DCP]) were measured, and the utility of NX-DCP and DCP/NX-DCP ratio for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated. Antigenic differences in DCP between HCC and non-HCC patients were elucidated.Methods:The subjects included 170 patients with HCC, 61 with benign liver disease, 12 with obstructive jaundice, and 10 warfarin users. NX-DCP was quantitated by sandwich ECLIA employing novel anti-DCP monoclonal antibodies, P11 and P16. Conventional DCP was quantitated by standard ECLIA. DCP extracted from serum by affinity-chromatography was analyzed by Western blotting.Results:Conventional serum DCP levels were high in patients with HCC and obstructive jaundice, and in warfarin users, consistent with previous reports. Serum NX-DCP levels were high only in warfarin users and obstructive jaundice patients (vitamin K-deficient patients) but not in HCC patients. The DCP/NX-DCP ratio was significantly higher in the HCC group than in the benign liver disease, obstructive jaundice, and warfarin groups (P Conclusions:The DCP/NX-DCP ratio is very useful for diagnosing HCC. DCP in HCC patients is distinct from that in vitamin K-deficient patients.
