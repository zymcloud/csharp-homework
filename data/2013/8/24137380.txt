Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using balloon catheters for Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have become increasingly accepted as alternative therapeutic modalities. However, few studies have investigated the clinical efficacy of combining percutaneous microwave ablation with angioplasty for patients with BCS complicated by HCC. In the present study, a safe and effective method for treating BCS associated with HCC is presented. Color Doppler ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), inferior venacavography, hepatic arteriogram and cytological examinations were used for the diagnosis. A KY2000 microwave system with an emission of 915 MHz was also employed for the treatment. Two patients with BCS associated with HCC that were administered different adjuvant drug treatments underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and percutaneous microwave ablation successfully, with no treatment-related complications. Combining angioplasty with percutaneous microwave ablation may represent an alternative method for the treatment of BCS associated with HCC.
