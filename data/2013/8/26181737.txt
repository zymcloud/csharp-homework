We report on two cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with metastasis to the cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus. Both cases presented with diplopia and retro-orbital headache and both underwent surgery for a primary pituitary gland tumor. After surgery, both cases were diagnosed with metastases from HCC. Case 1 was a 67-year-old male with a history of HCC who was referred to our hospital for pituitary tumor surgery. The tumor appeared to be in the sella turcica and to invade the sphenoid sinus and right cavernous sinus. Transnasal transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) was performed. The tumor was postoperatively diagnosed by histology to be a metastatic pituitary tumor from HCC. Radiotherapy was administered to the metastatic site. Case 2 was a 58-year-old male with a history of TSS for a pituitary tumor 16 years previously. He was referred to our hospital for TSS for a recurrent pituitary adenoma. TSS was performed twice in 3 months. During a preoperative general examination, HCC and chronic hepatitis B were revealed. TSS was performed initially, followed by arterial infusion chemotherapy. After TSS, the pituitary tumor was diagnosed by histology to be a metastasis from HCC. As with Case 1, radiotherapy was administered to the metastasis. Most tumors in the sella turcica are pituitary adenomas, although some cases of metastatic pituitary tumors and skull base metastases have been reported. Distant metastases generally have a poor prognosis; however, surgery to the metastatic site can effectively control symptoms caused by the metastatic tumor.
