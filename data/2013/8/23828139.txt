Background:Recent studies have shown that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the significance of TLR4 signaling in cancer development and progression remains unclear.Aim:The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of TLR4 in cancer cell survival and proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Fifty-three HCC and ten normal liver specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and three cell lines (HL-7702, PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2) were used for in vitro studies. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a specific ligand of TLR4, was used to activate TLR4 signaling. The effects of LPS-TLR4 signaling on cell survival, proliferation and invasion were examined. Specific inhibitors of NF-κB and MAPK (JNK, ERK and p38) signaling pathways were used to explore the role of each pathway in LPS-TLR4 signaling.Results:TLR4 was overexpressed in HCC cell lines and in human HCC tissues, where it correlated with Ki-67 expression. LPS-induced activation of TLR4 signaling promoted cancer cell survival and proliferation. LPS-TLR4 signaling was associated with regulation on the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. LPS-TLR4-induced activation of ERK and JNK signaling promotes cell proliferation through regulating Bax translocation to mitochondria. Activation of NF-κB and p38 mediates cytotoxicity of LPS, and inhibition on these two pathways promotes cell proliferation in HCC cells.Conclusion:Our results indicate that TLR4 signaling in cancer cells promotes cell survival and proliferation in HCC.
