Aim:Surgical resection usually represents the treatment of choice for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients, with well preserved liver function; local ablative strategies are the best treatment option for patients with small tumors who are not candidates for surgical resection or liver transplantation. Several studies showed that percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has similar efficacy to surgical nodulectomy in the treatment of early-stage HCC, and is associated with lower complication rates and costs than resection. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of these treatments, in terms of morbidity, overall survival, tumor recurrence and causes of death.Methods:Between January 2006 and January 2012 we observed 176 patients affected by HCC, 84 underwent curative treatment. The 40 patients presenting single HCC nodes smaller than 3 cm in diameter have been treated with radiofrequency-assisted surgical nodulectomy (N.=20) or with percutaneous radiofrequency (N.=20).Results:No perioperative mortality occurred in the two groups. Perioperative morbidity was 5% in group A (1 case of peritoneal bleeding) and 5% in group B (1 case of hepatic abscess). Disease-free survival was slightly higher in surgically treated patients, but not statistically significative differences have been demonstrated (PConclusion:RF and surgical nodulectomy can be either used in treatment of early stage hepatocellular carcinoma; no differences in terms of morbidity, overall and disease free survival were observed; nodulectomy seems to prevent from tumor local recurrence.
