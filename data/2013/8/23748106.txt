Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be envisioned as a prolonged multi-stage process accumulating genetic and epigenetic changes. In the past years, DNA alterations lent us important clues to the comprehension of molecular pathways involved in HCC. However, as an increasing number of RNAs were identified to be subject to A-to-I modifications, it has become apparent that RNA editing might be the causal basis of various human diseases. Recent evidence has strengthened this notion by correlating hyper-edited AZIN1 (antizyme inhibitor 1) protein with HCC onset and the mechanisms that regulate cell transformation. As we continue to demystify it, RNA editing astonishes us with its diverse substrates, esoteric functions, elaborate machinery and complex interaction with HBV/HCV viral infection. In this review, we examine the contribution of A-to-I RNA editing to caner onset/progression and explore its potential implications for cancer treatment advances.
