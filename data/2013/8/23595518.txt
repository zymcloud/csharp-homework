Background:The fucosylated fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) has been used as a diagnostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, a highly sensitive immunoassay using an on-chip electrokinetic reaction and separation by affinity electrophoresis (micro-total analysis system; μTAS) has been developed.Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between changes in the serum AFP-L3 level measured by μTAS assay and recurrence of HCC after curative treatment.Methods:A total of 414 HCC patients who met the Milan criteria and underwent hepatectomy or radiofrequency ablation were investigated prospectively for the relationship between HCC recurrence and values of tumor markers.Results:There were significant differences in recurrence-free survival between groups with and without AFP-L3 elevation measured before and after treatment (p = 0.024 and p = 0.001 for before and after treatment, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that AFP-L3 status (p = 0.002) measured 1 month after treatment was a significant independent predictor of HCC recurrence after curative treatment.Conclusions:Elevation of the serum AFP-L3 level before treatment is a predictor of HCC recurrence, and sustained elevation of the AFP-L3 level after treatment is an indicator of HCC recurrence. Repeated measurement of μTAS AFP-L3 should be performed for surveillance of HCC recurrence after curative treatment.
