Objective:We aimed to evaluate local tumor control after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma using miriplatin and low-dose epirubicin combination therapy.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who underwent TACE using miriplatin plus low-dose epirubicin (30 patients, 61 nodules, August 2011-March 2012) and control patients who underwent TACE using miriplatin alone (36 patients, 70 nodules, June 2010-July 2011). The local control rate was compared between the two groups using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the log-rank test. Factors affecting local tumor recurrence were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Treatment-related toxicity was evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.Results:The local control rates at 6 months and 1 year were 87% and 65% for the miriplatin plus low-dose epirubicin group, and 61% and 43% for the miriplatin group, respectively. Local tumor control rates were significantly better in the miriplatin plus low-dose epirubicin group than in the miriplatin group (P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that the addition of epirubicin was an independent factor associated with better local tumor control (hazard ratio 0.2, P = 0.001). Overall incidence rates for adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups.Conclusion:Additional usage of low-dose epirubicin for TACE using miriplatin improved local tumor control of hepatocellular carcinoma with adverse effects comparable to those observed with TACE using miriplatin alone.
