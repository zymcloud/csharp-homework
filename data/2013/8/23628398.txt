The viral load of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in chronic hepatitis C patients affects clinical outcomes and response to interferon treatment. Various factors may be involved in determining the viral load, including host genetic factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between HCV viral load and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II alleles. One hundred and six HCV RNA positive subjects were enrolled, and viral load was measured. HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ loci were determined by sequence-based genotyping. Univariate analysis indicated that HLA-B(*)40 and HLA-C(*)07 alleles had significantly higher HCV RNA levels (P
