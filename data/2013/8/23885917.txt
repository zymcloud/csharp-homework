Ablation of exophytic and border-deforming liver tumors may increase risks of tumor seeding or hemorrhage. The present report describes a no-touch wedge ablation technique intended to potentially reduce tumor disruption while achieving technically adequate ablation. The technique involves the use of multiple probe positions tangential to the tumor, and was used to treat eight tumors. Complete ablation was demonstrated in all cases on early posttreatment imaging at an average of 16 days after the procedure. At an average imaging follow-up of 244 days, there was one case of local tumor recurrence. The technique may be useful for the ablation of exophytic, border-deforming liver tumors.
