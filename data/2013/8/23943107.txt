Liver resection is the treatment of choice and standard of care in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The ultimate goal of liver resection in HCC patients is to resect primary tumor with an adequate margin while preserving as much functional liver parenchyma as possible. Tremendous improvements in perioperative outcomes after liver resection have been achieved in the past three decades. The overall and disease-free survival rates have also improved. Liver resection is feasible and safe even in cirrhotic patients. This is a result of more accurate preoperative evaluation of liver function, the ability to manipulate future liver remnant volume, the use of anatomical resection and an anterior approach, meticulous surgical techniques to achieve bloodless liver resection, and better perioperative care. The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of different resection strategies for HCC that in turn have contributed to the safety and improvement in long-term outcomes after liver resection.
