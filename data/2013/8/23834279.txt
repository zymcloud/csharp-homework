Aim:Microvascular invasion (MVI) is an important risk factor for early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but preoperative prediction of MVI is difficult.Methods:A retrospective review was undertaken on 167 patients with primary solitary HCC who underwent initial hepatectomy. Independent predictors of MVI were identified, and factors affecting disease-free survival in patients with MVI were clarified.Results:Of the 167 patients, 20 patients (12%) had MVI. Recurrence rates of HCC after hepatectomy in MVI patients were significantly worse than in patients without MVI (P Conclusions:Patients with PIVKA-II â‰¥ 150 mAU/mL and positive L3-AFP on preoperative examination are at high risk for MVI.
