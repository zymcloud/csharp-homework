Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignant tumor of the liver. We evaluated the association of alleles and genotypes of polymorphisms of IL-18 (-607C/A and -137G/C), IFN-γ (+874T/A) and TNF-α (-238G/A and -308G/A) with the risk and severity of HCC. One-hundred-and-twelve patients with HCC and 202 healthy controls were studied. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were amplified by PCR with specific primers and the products were submitted to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with silver. We evaluated tumor presentation, tumor size and presence of metastasis. Significant higher risk of HCC was associated with: alleles IL-18 -607(*)A (P=0.0235; OR=1.48; 95%CI=1.06-2.08); TNF-α -238(*)A (P=0.0025; OR=2.12; 95%CI=1.32-3.40) and TNF-α -308(*)A (P=0.0351; OR=1.82; 95%CI=1.07-3.08); and genotypes IL-18-607AA (P=0.0048; OR=3.03; 95%CI=1.40-6.55); TNF-α -238GA (P=0.0011; OR=2.44; 95%CI=1.45-4.12); and TNF-α -308GA (P=0.0031; OR=2.51; 95%CI=1.39-4.51). Significant association was found between multinodular HCC and IL-18 -607(*)C allele (P=0.029; OR=2.40, 95%CI: 1.09-5.28), and IL-18 -607CC genotype (P=0.028; OR=3.5, 95%CI: 1.24-9.86). Diffuse HCC was significantly associated with IFN-γ +874TA genotype (P=0.044; OR=3.6, 95%CI: 1.03-12.47). The IL-18 -137(∗)C allele showed a significant association with the presence of metastasis. Thus, IL-18 -607(*)A and TNF-α (-238(*)A and -308(*)A) alleles may confer susceptibility to HCC, while IL-18 -607(*)C and -137(*)C alleles more severe disease.
