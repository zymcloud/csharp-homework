Increasing the expression of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (cyclin-CDK) using small molecule inhibitors is a therapeutic strategy used to suppress cancer cell growth. Decorin (DCN), a functional component of the extracellular matrix, has been implicated in the suppression of cell proliferation by upregulating p21, a cyclin-CDK inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of recombinant decorin on the reactivation of p57KIP2, whose expression is silenced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cell viability assay, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay and quantitative real time-PCR experiments were performed in three groups of HepG2 human cells: Uninfected HepG2 cells (control group), pcDNA3.1 vector-infected HepG2 cells (pcDNA3.1 group) and pcDNA3.1-DCN-infected HepG2 cells (pcDNA3.1â€‘DCN group). Our results revealed that recombinant human decorin inhibited cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 phase arrest and induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of caspase-3 in the pcDNA3.1-DCN group. The expression of p57KIP2 mRNA in the pcDNA3.1-DCN group was higher than in the pcDNA3.1 and control groups (P0.05). In conclusion, recombinant human decorin reactivated p57KIP2 expression in HepG2 cells. As the expression level of p57KIP2 is downregulated in HCC, our finding may serve as a basis for the therapy and prognosis of HCC, although further studies are required.
