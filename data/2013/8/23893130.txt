Background:Aurora B is a serine-threonine kinase and chromosomal passenger protein involved in the control of chromosome assembly and segregation during mitosis. Aberrant expression of Aurora B has been reported in some tumors, including lung and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the role of Aurora B expression in both HCC and matched adjacent non-tumor tissue.Methods:Sixty-three patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection were enrolled in this study. Aurora B expression in tumor and non-tumor tissue was examined by use of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The patients were divided into high and low gene expression groups by median value, and clinicopathological data were compared between the two groups.Results:Aurora B expression was significantly higher in tumor tissue than in non-cancerous tissue (P Conclusion:Aurora B expression in non-cancerous tissues may be a prognostic factor for HCC.
