Purpose:The outcomes of patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) negative for all virus-related markers have not yet been characterized. This study investigated the outcomes of such patients in comparison to those who had virus-related resectable HCC.Methods:A total of 398 patients with HCC were divided into 2 groups, comprising patients in which all virus-related markers (HBs-Ag, HBs-Ab, HBe-Ag, HBe-Ab, HBc-Ab, HCV-Ab) were negative (all-negative group, n = 63) and those with at least 1 positive virus-related marker (virus-related group, n = 335). The clinical characteristics, surgical data, and survival rates were compared between the groups.Results:The serum AST (30 vs. 45 IU/l, P Conclusions:The postoperative outcomes of patients with HCC are independent of the presence or absence of hepatitis viral infection.
