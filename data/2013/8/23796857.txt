Purpose:Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) has been shown to be an efficient imaging modality in guiding radiofrequency (RF) ablation of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). The purpose of the present study was to assess the usefulness of contrast-enhanced US in guiding RF ablation in patients with early-stage HCC that was not clearly visible on grayscale US or noncontrast computed tomography (CT).Materials and methods:During a 17-month period, contrast-enhanced US-guided RF ablation was performed in 14 patients with 19 early-stage lesions that were poorly defined on grayscale US and noncontrast CT. Contrast-enhanced US was repeated after 30 minutes, and complete ablation was defined as absence of any arterial-phase enhancement within the ablated lesion. Patients were followed periodically with clinical evaluation, liver function tests, Î±-fetoprotein measurement, and multiphasic CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for a minimum of 1 year after ablation to look for local recurrence or disease progression. Survival probability was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method.Results:Complete tumor ablation was achieved in all 19 lesions, with no evidence of residual or recurrent tumor in the ablated areas after a mean follow-up of 16 months. No major complications were observed in any patient. However, new lesions developed in other parts of the liver on follow-up scans in three patients, and were accordingly treated with RF ablation. Two patients died of disease progression or liver failure within the 1-year follow-up.Conclusions:For early-stage HCCs not well visualized on unenhanced US or CT, contrast-enhanced US provides an additional tool to guide RF ablation.
