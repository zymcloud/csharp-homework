Photophysical photochemical properties, in vitro photodynamic anticancer activity and interaction with albumin of a new axially modified silicon phthalocyanine, i. e. di (2-amino-6-trifluoromethyl-4-pyrimidinyloxy) silicon phthalocyanine (SiPcF), were studied in the present paper. The Q band maximum absorption of SiPcF located at 686 nm with the molar absorption coefficient of 2.3 x 10(5) mol(-1) * L * cm(-1). The fluorescence emission of SiPcF peaked at 694 nm with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.46. Its singlet oxygen quantum yield produced by photosensitization is 0.38, suggesting that SiPcF is an effective 1O2 photosensitizer. There is strong interaction between SiPcF and bovine serum albumin (BSA). The binding constant is 4.33 x 10(5) mol X L(-1) and the number of binding sites is 1. In vitro experiments show that SiPcF had a high photodynamic anticancer activity against human hepatoma cells HepG2 with an IC50 value down to 5 x 10(-7) mol X L(-1).
