Background:This study evaluated the addition of sorafenib to gemcitabine and cisplatin in biliary adenocarcinoma first-line therapy.Methods:Patients with advanced biliary adenocarcinomas received gemcitabine 1000 mg m(-2) and cisplatin 25 mg m(-2) on a 2 weeks on/1 week off cycle and sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. After the initial 16 patients were enrolled, the chemotherapy doses were amended in view of grade 3 and 4 hand-foot skin reaction and haematologic toxicity. Subsequently, 21 patients received gemcitabine 800 mg m(-2), cisplatin 20 mg m(-2) and sorafenib 400 mg. The primary end point was an improvement in 6-month progression-free survival (PFS6) from historical 57-77% (90% power, type I error of 10%). Pretreatment pERK, evaluated by immunostaining, was correlated with clinical outcome.Results:A total of 39 patients were accrued. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities noted in >10% of patients were fatigue, elevated liver function tests and haematologic toxicities including thromboemboli, hyponatraemia and hypophosphataemia. Six-month progression-free survival was 51% (95% confidence interval (CI) 34-66%). Median PFS and overall survival were 6.5 (95% CI: 3.5-8.3) and 14.4 months (95% CI: 11.6-19.2 months), respectively. No correlation was observed between pERK and outcomes.Conclusion:The addition of sorafenib to gemcitabine and cisplatin in biliary adenocarcinomas did not improve efficacy over historical data, and toxicity was increased.
