Objectives:To assess the value of hepatic arterial-phase (HAP) imaging with a low tube voltage (80 kVp), using non-helical, volumetric acquisition with a 320-detector-rows area-detector CT (ADCT) scanner for evaluating hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with routine 120-kVp HAP imaging.Methods:This study enrolled 128 patients with 148 HCCs. Seventy-six patients with 79 HCCs underwent HAP imaging with 80 kVp obtained using a 320-detector-rows ADCT scanner. The remaining 52 patients with 69 HCCs underwent routine HAP imaging with 120 kVp obtained by 64-slice helical acquisition. Image noise and tumor to liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the two sets of images were compared. Three radiologists evaluated both sets of images using receiver operating characteristic analyses.Results:Although there was a two-fold increase in the mean image noise with 80 kVp over that with 120 kVp (p Conclusions:HAP imaging with 80 kVp obtained by an ADCT scanner significantly improves the diagnostic performance for evaluating hypervascular HCC.
