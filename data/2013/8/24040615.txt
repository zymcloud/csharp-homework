The advent of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the angiography suite has been revolutionary in interventional radiology. CBCT offers 3 dimensions (3D) diagnostic imaging in the interventional suite and can enhance minimally-invasive therapy beyond the limitations of 2D angiography alone. The role of CBCT has been recognized in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment of liver cancer especially with the recent introduction of dual-phase CBCT (DP-CBCT) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. Loffroy and colleagues proposed the use of intraprocedural C-arm DP-CBCT immediately after TACE with doxorubicin-eluting beads to predict HCC tumor response at 1-month magnetic resonance (MR) imaging follow-up. They reported a significant relationship between tumor enhancement seen at DP-CBCT after TACE and objective MR imaging response at 1-month follow-up, suggesting that DP-CBCT can be used to predict tumor response after TACE. If confirmed in larger studies, this imaging modality may play a key role in the improvement of treatment planning, especially with regard to the need for repeat treatment. More important, a potential clinical implication of using intraprocedural DP-CBCT in these patients might be elimination of 1-month follow-up MR imaging.
