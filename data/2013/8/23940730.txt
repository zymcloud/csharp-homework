Immunosuppression therapy following liver transplantation often includes steroids. However, extended corticosteroid therapy is associated with numerous complications. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of using basiliximab in place of a corticosteroid for immunosuppression following liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Chinese patients. The records of 178 patients with HCC who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation from January 2003 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received immunosuppression therapy that contained either basiliximab (n = 78) or steroids (n = 100) in addition to tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Assessments included complications related to liver transplantation, occurrence of steroid side effects, recurrence of HCC, and patient and graft survival. A smaller proportion of patients receiving basiliximab compared with steroids experienced de novo diabetes (38.7% vs. 91.0%, respectively) or long-term de novo diabetes mellitus (7.7% vs. 38.0%, respectively) (both, P0.730). However, in patients who met the Milan criteria basiliximab was associated with greater 5-year overall survival rate as compared with steroid therapy (88.9% vs. 57.4%, respectively, P = 0.022). These findings provide further evidence of the negative impact of steroids as a part of immunosuppression therapy following liver transplantation for HCC.
