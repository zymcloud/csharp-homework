Hepatitis B is endemic in many regions of Asia, including China, Korea and India. This results in a heavy burden of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because hepatitis B virus is a major risk factor in the development of the disease. In addition, the incidence of hepatitis-C-related HCC is on the rise in the United States. HCC patients with poor liver function reserve are not suitable candidates for resection, and liver transplantation (LT) has emerged as the treatment of choice for small unresectable HCCs. To treat more HCC patients with LT, the standard patient selection criteria have been expanded at a number of centers. Careful and well-considered selection of patients is the key to success in LT for HCC. Although tumor size and tumor number are used to predict whether transplantation is likely to be successful, the weighting that should be attached these two parameters has not been determined. In addition to the size and number of lesions, the morphology of HCC is also predictive of its behavior. Well-circumscribed lesions, in general, are less aggressive than those with poorly defined borders. On the waiting list for LT, HCC patients compete with liver failure patients. It is essential that the criteria used for selecting HCC patients for LT should be easily applicable and fair to other transplant candidates. In the face of the scarcity of deceased-donor livers and the inevitable risks for living liver donors, a predictably low rate of recurrence of HCC after LT is mandatory.
