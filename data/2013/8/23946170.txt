Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer among men. This case report describes a 43-year-old man with rapidly progressing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that responded initially to docetaxel and did not tolerate cabazitaxel. He subsequently received a third line of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and prednisone, and experienced a dramatic clinical and radiographic response in his liver metastases. This therapeutic intervention led to a significant clinical benefit and confirms the potential use of cyclophosphamide in patients with CRPC, particularly those with liver metastases.
