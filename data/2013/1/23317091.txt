Background:Diabetes mellitus (DM) is identified as a negative prognostic indicator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), though the basis for this is unknown.Methods:This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of 191 HCC patients treated at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) with orthotopic liver transplantation between 1998-2008. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and without DM prior to liver transplantation and logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the effect of DM on clinical outcomes including vascular invasion.Results:Eighty-four of 191 (44%) transplanted patients had DM at time of transplantation. An association of DM with invasive disease was found among transplanted HCC patients where histologically confirmed macrovascular invasion was found in 20.2% (17/84) of diabetics compared to 9.3% of non-diabetics (10/107) (p=0.032). This difference also remained significant when adjusting for tumor size, number of nodules, age, obesity and etiologic risk factors in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR=3.2, p=0.025).Conclusions:DM is associated with macrovascular invasion among a cohort of transplanted HCC patients.
