Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity is an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and HBsAg-transgenic mice have been reported to spontaneously develop HCC. The major histocompatibility complex class I-related molecules A and B (MICA and MICB) are NKG2D ligands that play important roles in tumor immune surveillance. In the present study, we found that HBsAg overexpression in HepG2 cells led to upregulation of 133 and downregulation of 9 microRNAs (miRNAs). Interestingly, several HBsAg-induced miRNAs repressed the expression of MICA and MICB via targeting their 3'-untranslated regions. In addition, the expression of MICA and MICB was significantly reduced upon HBsAg overexpression, which was partially restored by inhibiting the activities of HBsAg-induced miRNAs. Moreover, HBsAg-overexpressing HCC cells exhibited reduced sensitivity to natural killer cell-mediated cytolysis. Taken together, our data suggest that HBsAg supresses the expression of MICA and MICB via induction of cellular miRNAs, thereby preventing NKG2D-mediated elimination of HCC cells.
