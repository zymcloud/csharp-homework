With the widespread availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and increased life expectancy among HIV-infected individuals, liver-related mortality has emerged as the leading cause of non-AIDS-related death. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a sequela of chronic liver disease, is rising among HIV-infected individuals. While women are increasingly and disproportionately affected by HIV, little is known about HCC in HIV-infected women given HCC's predilection for men. In 2007, 2 out of 398 HIV-infected women seen at a Rhode Island HIV clinic were diagnosed with HCC. Of 351 HIV-infected individuals with HCC described in the published literature, 12 (3.4%) were women. These 2 cases add to the existing literature on this topic.
