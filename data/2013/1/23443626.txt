This report is an analysis of 231 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from a tertiary care hospital in India. Most of the HCCs were diagnosed in cirrhotics and at an advanced stage which limited the therapeutic options. Physician awareness of this complication of cirrhosis and regular ultrasound screening of cirrhotic patients will help in detection of early stage cancers and, thus, enhance the survival rates.
