Glycyrrhetinic acid-graft-hyaluronic acid (HGA) conjugate was synthesized as a carrier for intravenous administration of paclitaxel (PTX), which combined hyaluronic acid (HA) and glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) as the active targeting ligands to liver tumor. In the present study, physicochemical characteristics, cellular uptake efficiency, and in vivo fates of HGA conjugates were investigated. HGA nanoparticles could readily load PTX with high efficiency up to 31.16 wt.% and entrapment efficiency to 92.02%. Moreover, PTX-loaded HGA nanoparticles exhibited more significant cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells than B16F10 cells due to simultaneously over-expressing HA and GA receptors. Meanwhile, the cellular uptake of nanoparticles was clearly enhanced in HepG2 and B16F10 cells compared to a normal fibroblast cell (HELF cells). In particular, more HGA nanoparticles were taken up by HepG2 cells than by B16F10 cells, which might be attributed to the affinity of multiple ligands of HA and GA to HepG2 cells. Furthermore, liver and tumor targeting activity of HGA nanoparticles was also confirmed by in vivo imaging analysis. The fluorescence signals of DiR-labeled HGA nanoparticles in tumor and liver were 2.88 and 1.83 folds stronger than that of the control, respectively. These results indicate HGA nanoparticles can be a potential drug carrier with "double target sites" for liver cancer therapy.
