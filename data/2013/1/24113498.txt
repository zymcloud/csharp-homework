Purpose:To evaluate tumor perfusion by means of dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (DCEUS) and aggregated time intensity curves (TICs) after transarterial chemoembolization with degradable starch microspheres (DSM-TACE).Material and methods:18 patients underwent 36 DCEUS examinations conducted via contrast agent application before and after DSM-TACE. Based on time intensity curves (TICs), we analyzed the microcirculation of the embolized HCC lesions with a dedicated perfusion software.Results:Signal intensity was significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.001) after DSM-TACE at all time points measured. The mean signal intensity after 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 s was 375.18 ± 16.41, 455.66 ± 17.92, 294.47 ± 19.91, 246.51 ± 20.99 and 173.45 ± 25.80 before TACE and 49.47 ± 2.43, 49.51 ± 2.40, 37.40 ± 2.45, 27.48 ± 2.65 and 27.96 ± 3.01 after TACE.Conclusion:In this study, tumor perfusion could be accurately evaluated by means of DCEUS and aggregated TICs after DSM-TACE.
