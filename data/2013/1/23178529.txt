Omentin-1, a new adipokine released from adipose tissue, is associated with several key aspects of metabolic syndrome such as insulin sensitivity. However, it is not known whether omentin-1 affects cancer cell growth. In this study, we studied the influence of omentin-1 on two types of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells: HepG2 and HuH-7 cells. Cell viability assay showed that omentin-1 (1 and 2 Î¼g/ml) significantly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and HuH-7 cells. Both annexin+PI staining and TUNEL assay showed that omentin-1 induced apoptosis in these cells. Moreover, omentin-1 treatment upregulated protein levels of p53 and p21, a main transcriptional target of p53. Interestingly, omentin-1 did not affect p53 mRNA level. Further mechanism study showed that omentin-1 upregulated p53 protein level through decreasing p53 deacetylation and thereby increasing the stability of p53 protein. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown, we found that Sirt1 deacetylase, but not histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), was required for the effect of omentin-1 on p53 deacetylation and cancer cell proliferation. In omentin-1 treated HepG2 cells, the bax/bcl-2 protein ratio was increased, while the caspase-3 signaling pathway was also activated. Omentin-1 triggered JNK signaling but not p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Collectively, our data suggests that the novel adipokine omentin-1 may contribute to the therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.
