The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on survival after surgical resection (SR) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two hundred and thirty-five HCC patients who underwent SR with curative intent were analyzed. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and complication rates were compared between the TACE (n=110) and control groups (n=125). Moreover, TACE subjects were classified into TACE responders (n=85) and TACE non-responders (n=25), according to the therapeutic efficacy of pretreatment TACE, and the factors contributing to OS and RFS after SR were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. The 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates were 87.4, 76.0 and 62.5%, respectively, in the TACE group and 94.9, 79.0 and 57.8%, respectively, in the control group (P=0.674). The corresponding RFS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 73.3, 48.9 and 33.2%, respectively, in the TACE group and 73.3, 29.4 and 16.3%, respectively, in the control group (P=0.062). No TACE-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of surgery-related SAEs (P=0.714), operation time (P=0.881), blood loss during surgery (P=0.334) and hospitalization period (P=0.447). Multivariate analyses identified TACE responder, TACE non-responder, total bilirubin ≥1 mg/dl, serum albumin ≥4 g/dl, pretreatment α-fetoprotein (AFP) level ≥100 ng/ml and microscopic vascular invasion as significant prognostic factors linked to OS. TACE non-responder, tumor number (multiple) and pretreatment AFP level ≥100 ng/ml were significant adverse prognostic factors linked to RFS. In conclusion, TACE is a safe procedure in patients with HCC, and the efficacy of TACE prior to surgery may be associated with clinical outcomes after SR.
