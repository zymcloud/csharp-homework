We report a case of micropapillary variant of urothelial carcinoma in the ureter. A 62-year-old man was referred to our hospital under the diagnosis of left ureteral cancer. We performed retroperitoneoscopic nephroureterectomy. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed a micropapillary variant of urothelial carcinoma of the ureter. In this case, micropapillary carcinoma was found in 10% of the tumor histologically. Two months after the operation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed liver and paraaortic lymph node metastases. After 3 cycles of gemcitabine-cisplatin therapy, these metastases disappeared on computed tomography (CT).
