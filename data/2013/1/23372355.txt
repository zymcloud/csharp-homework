Aim:To evaluate diagnostic value of α-fetoprotein (AFP)-L3 and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:One hundred and sixty-eight patients during routine HCC surveillance were included in this study. Of the 168 patients, 90 (53.6%) had HCC including newly developed HCC (n = 82) or recurrent HCC after treatment (n = 8). Sera were obtained during their first evaluation for HCC development and at the time of HCC diagnosis before commencing HCC treatment. HCC was diagnosed by histological examination, appropriate imaging characteristics-computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Control sera were collected from 78 patients with benign liver disease (BLD), which were obtained during routine surveillance with a suspicion of HCC. AFP, AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II were measured in the same serum by microchip capillary electrophoresis and liquid-phase binding assay on a micro-total analysis system Wako i30 auto analyzer. The performance characteristics of three tests and combined tests for the diagnosis of HCC were obtained using receiver operating characteristic curves in all populations and subgroups with AFP Results:Of 90 HCC patients, 38 (42.2%) patients had AFP 200 ng/mL. Of the 78 BLD patients, 74 (94.9%) patients had AFP 5%) and PIVKA-II (cut-off > 40 AU/L), the sensitivity were 94.4% and specificity were 75.6% in all patients. In 112 patients with low AFP levels (Conclusion:Combined determination of AFP-L3 and PIVKA-II could improve the diagnostic value for HCC detection in patients with or without increased AFP levels.
