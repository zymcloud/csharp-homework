Population-based evidence on the relative risk of de novo cancer in liver and cardiothoracic transplant recipients is limited. A cohort study was conducted in Australia using population-based liver (n = 1926) and cardiothoracic (n = 2718) registries (1984-2006). Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed by cancer type, transplanted organ and recipient age. Cox regression models were used to compare cancer incidence by transplanted organ. During a median 5-year follow-up, the risk of any cancer in liver and cardiothoracic recipients was significantly elevated compared to the general population (n = 499; SIR = 2.62, 95%CI 2.40-2.86). An excess risk was observed for 16 cancer types, predominantly cancers with a viral etiology. The pattern of risk by cancer type was broadly similar for heart, lung and liver recipients, except for Merkel cell carcinoma (cardiothoracic only). Seventeen cancers (10 non-Hodgkin lymphomas), were observed in 415 pediatric recipients (SIR = 23.8, 95%CI 13.8-38.0). The adjusted hazard ratio for any cancer in all recipients was higher in heart compared to liver (1.29, 95%CI 1.03-1.63) and lung compared to liver (1.65, 95%CI 1.26-2.16). Understanding the factors responsible for the higher cancer incidence in cardiothoracic compared to liver recipients has the potential to lead to targeted cancer prevention strategies in this high-risk population.
