Hypothesis:Naturopathic treatment will benefit patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Study design:Retrospective analysis of case series of HCC patients treated with naturopathic agents.Methods:HCC was diagnosed by dynamic computed tomography (CT) imaging and α-fetoprotein (AFP) or PIVKA II, or by histology. Tumor staging was determined by CT. A modified Childs-Pugh scoring was used to assess liver disease. Patients were treated with orally administered combinations of 12 naturopathic agents. Patients were monitored clinically and by CT tumor imaging, serial tumor markers, and liver function tests.Patient characteristics:101 patients with HCC (67 men and 34 women, age 67.2 ± 8.8 years) were treated for a median of 13.4 months (range 0.8-100.8). Of these 84% had cirrhosis, 63% had hepatitis C virus, 18% had hepatitis B virus, 1% had both, and 9% had metastatic disease. Median modified Childs-Pugh score was 6 (range 3-13). Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer tumor stages of 0, A, B, C, and D were found in 36%, 25%, 20%, 14%, and 6%, respectively. Median AFP was 40 (range 0-311,000). Median PIVKA II was 59 (0-378,000). Previous treatment was included none (27%), resection with relapse (20%), transarterial chemoembolization (50%), radiofrequency ablation (28%), percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (15%), chemotherapy (14%).Outcomes:Initial treatment was with 2.6 ± 0.8 agents (range 2-4). Overall, patients were treated with 3.7 ± 1.2 agents (range 2-7). There was a significant correlation between number of agents administered and survival (P Conclusion:Treatment of HCC with a regimen of ≥4 agents prepared from natural products was associated with prolonged survival in a substantial portion of patients. The data provide level II evidence for the efficacy of naturopathic therapy in HCC.
