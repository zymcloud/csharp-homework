Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are at an increased risk for a severe and a potentially fatal viral reactivation following anti-cancer therapy. The molecular mechanism for this induction of HBV expression is still unclear. Here, we show that treating hepatoma cell line expressing HBV with various anti-cancer cytotoxic agents results in a significant up-regulation of HBV expression. This HBV induction is at the transcriptional level and is time dependent. Interestingly, treating hepatoma cells with anti-cancer cytotoxic agents results in a robust induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a metabolic and energy regulator that is normally induced in the liver under starvation conditions and that has been previously shown to strongly coactivate HBV transcription. Most importantly, HBV up-regulation following anti-cancer therapy depends on PGC-1α induction, because PGC-1α knock-down abolishes HBV induction. Finally, pretreatment of HBV-expressing cells with the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine attenuates the induction of both PGC-1α and HBV in response to anti-cancer treatment, suggesting that chemotherapy-associated PGC-1α induction is mediated by cellular oxidative stress that ultimately leads to HBV up-regulation. We conclude that cytotoxic anti-cancer chemotherapy has a direct and an immune system-independent effect on HBV gene expression, which is mediated by PGC-1α. Our results attribute to this metabolic regulator an unexpected role in linking anti-cancer treatment to HBV reactivation and make PGC-1α a potential target for future anti-HBV therapy, especially under conditions in which it is robustly induced, such as following anti-cancer treatment.
