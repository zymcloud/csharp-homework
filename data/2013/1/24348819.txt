Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide. No effective treatment has been established for unresectable advanced HCC, and the prognosis is poor. Sorafenib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor for unresectable advanced HCC that significantly improves progression-free and overall survival. However, in the two large phase III clinical trials (the SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials), no cases of complete response (CR) were reported. The present study reports the case of a 68-year-old male with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis and multiple recurrent HCCs, with a tumor thrombus of the third portal vein following resection. The patient received 400 mg once daily (half the standard dose) of sorafenib for two years and achieved a CR. At the most recent follow-up examination at one year after the cessation of treatment, the patient was observed to be in remission without clinical or imaging evidence of disease recurrence.
