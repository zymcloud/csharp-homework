Background:Hepatic pedicle clamping is often used during liver resection. While its use reduces blood loss and transfusion requirements, the long-term effect on survival and recurrence has been debated. This study evaluates the effect of hepatic pedicle clamping [i.e., Pringle maneuver (PM)] on survival and recurrence following hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM).Methods:Patients who underwent R0 resection for CRLM from 1991 to 2004 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Operative, perioperative, and clinicopathological variables were analyzed. The primary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS) and liver recurrence (LR). Disease extent was categorized using a well-defined clinical risk score (CRS). Subgroup analysis was performed for patients given preoperative systemic chemotherapy and postoperative pump chemotherapy.Results:This study included 928 consecutive patients with median follow-up of 8.9 years. PM was utilized in 874 (94%) patients, with median time of 35 min (range 1-181 min). On univariate analysis, only resection type (p<0.001) and tumor number (p=0.002) were associated with use of PM. Younger age (p=0.006), longer operative time (p<0.001), and multiple tumors (p=0.006) were associated with prolonged PM (>60 min). There was no association between DFS, overall survival (OS) or LR and Pringle time. Neither the CRS nor use of neoadjuvant therapy stratified disease-related outcome with respect to use of PM.Conclusions:PM was used in most patients undergoing resection for CRLM and did not adversely influence intrahepatic recurrence, DFS, or OS.
