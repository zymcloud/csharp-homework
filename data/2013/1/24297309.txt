Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) is a member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes and implicated in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression and diagnostic and prognostic significance of Prdx1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Prdx1 expression was examined in 76 HCC patients and 20 healthy volunteers. The relationships between Prdx1 expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of serum Prdx1, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and their combination. The prognostic impact of Prdx1 on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of HCC patients was investigated. Prdx1-positive rate was significantly (p
