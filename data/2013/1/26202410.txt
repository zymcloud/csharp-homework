Aim:Tamibarotene is a synthetic retinoid expected to inhibit tumor-cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis by selective interaction with retinoic acid receptor α/β. We conducted an open-label phase I/II study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety profiles for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Patients with histologically confirmed, measurable, unresectable HCC of Child-Pugh classification A or B and with no effective systemic or local therapies were eligible. In phase I, patients were assigned based on the 3 + 3 dose escalation criteria to receive tamibarotene at 8, 12, and 16 mg/day. The RD determined in phase I was employed for phase II. The planned sample size in phase II was 25, including the RD-treated patients in phase I.Results:Thirty-six patients were enrolled. No patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at 8 mg/day. However, two out of six patients experienced the DLTs at 12 mg/day: one experienced thrombosis in a limb vein and pulmonary artery, and the other experienced an increase of γ-GTP. The MTD and RD were determined as 12 and 8 mg/day, respectively. In phase II, one patient achieved partial response, and seven achieved stable disease. The disease control rate was 32 % (95 % CI: 15.0-53.5). The following drug-related serious adverse events were reported: thrombosis in a limb vein, pulmonary artery, and portal vein; interstitial lung disease; and vomiting.Conclusions:Tamibarotene demonstrated the inhibition of tumor cell growth in advanced HCC with acceptable tolerance.
