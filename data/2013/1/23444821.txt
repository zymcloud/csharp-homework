Mr G, sixty-seven years old, was admitted to our hospital for a liver transplant. He suffered from a cirrhosis due to an HBV infection, complicated by an hepatocellular carcinoma. During the perioperative care, a left otorrhea was discovered. According to the clinical history, this otorrhea had been present for six weeks and followed the completion of a myringotomy. The myringotomy had been performed with a view to place a transtympanic ventilation tube for the treatment of a serous otitis media inducing a conductive hearingloss. Clinical, biological, and radiological explorations revealed a CSF leak caused by the fact that the myringotomy had been done in a temporal meningo-encephalocele. A conservative treatment allowed to stop the otorrhea. We present a short discussion about temporal meningoencephalocele and, more generally, about CSF otorrhea.
