Zuojinwan (ZJW), a famous Chinese medicinal formula, contains two medicinal herbs Coptis chinese Frach and Evodia rutaecarpa (Juss.) Benth in the ratio of 6: 1. The inhibitory effects of ZJW on eight kinds of human cancer cell lines including SMMC-7721, BEL-7402, BEL-7404, HepG2, A549, NCI-H446, NCI-H460 and HCT- 116 cells were evaluated, and the possible mechanism was investigated. The growths of the eight kinds of cancer cells were inhibited by ZJW assessed through MTT assay. Flow cytometry assay revealed a sub-G1 peak with reduced DNA content was formed. The cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 phase in ZJW-treated SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells, and in the S phase for NCI-H460 cells. Significant DNA damage was produced by ZJW assessed with single-cell gel electrophoresis assay. Morphological changes were also observed. Caspase-3 and -9 activities were increased following ZJW treatment. Western blot analysis showed that Bax and Bak protein levels were increased after ZJW treatment, while Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein levels were decreased. Our results suggest that ZJW has significant anti-cancer activities due to induction of mitochondria- dependent apoptosis pathway. Therefore, ZJW has the potential to be a novel chemotherapy drug to treat hepatoma, lung cancer and colon cancer by suppressing tumor growth.
