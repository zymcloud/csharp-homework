Purpose:Imaging-based differentiation of hepatic lesions (≤ 30 mm) between well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (w-HCC) and regenerative nodules (RN) presents difficulties. The aim was to compare the diagnostic abilities to differentiate w-HCC from RN using contrast-enhanced ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) both with liver-specific contrast agents.Materials and methods:This prospective study included 67 pathologically proven hepatic lesions (17.5 ± 5.4mm, 54 w-HCCs, 13 RNs) in 56 patients with chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis (male 40, female 16; 29-79y). Hepatic-arterial/liver-specific phase enhancements were assessed quantitatively by ultrasound with perflubutane microbubble agent and MRI with gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine with respect to the histological findings.Results:Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of hepatic-arterial phase hyper-enhancement for w-HCC were 59.3%, 100% and 67.2% by ultrasound and 46.3%, 100% and 56.7% by MRI without significant difference. Meanwhile, those of liver-specific-phase hypo-enhancement for w-HCC were 44.4%, 100% and 55.2% by ultrasound and 87.0% (pConclusions:Hypervascularity is a significant feature which distinguishes w-HCC from RN, and ultrasound exerts a beneficial impact better than MRI for such characterization. However, both imaging have comparable abilities in the characterization of non-hypervascular lesions, compensating mutually for the poor sensitivity of ultrasound and the poor specificity of MRI in the liver-specific phase.
