Background:Our previous studies showed that glioma-associated oncogene (Gli)2 plays an important role in the proliferation and apoptosis resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical significance of Gli2 expression in HCC.Methods:Expression of Gli2 protein was detected in samples from 68 paired HCC samples, the corresponding paraneoplastic liver tissues, and 20 normal liver tissues using immunohistochemistry. Correlation of the immunohistochemistry results with clinicopathologic parameters, prognosis, and the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin were analyzed.Results:Immunohistochemical staining showed high levels of Gli2 protein expression in HCC, compared with paraneoplastic and normal liver tissues (P Conclusions:Expression of Gli2 is high in HCC tissue, and is associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC after hepatectomy.
