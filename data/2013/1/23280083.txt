Background:Hepatitis C virus infection is associated with a variety of extrahepatic disorders such as membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, which is generally due to cryoglobulinemia.Setting:We describe the case of one liver transplant recipient who received antiviral therapy (subcutaneous administration of peg-IFN-alpha-2a 180 mcg weekly and oral ribavirin 200 mg thrice a day) for HCV-related membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis. He presented normal kidney function, non-nephrotic proteinuria (2 g/24 h) and mild hematuria.Results:Urinary abnormalities disappeared within a few weeks after the initiation of antiviral therapy; however, combination antiviral therapy was not able to obtain viral clearance. After 11 months, IFN-therapy was interrupted and the patient continued low-dose ribavirin monotherapy (200 mg once per day) for one additional year- remission of proteinuria (Conclusions:Antiviral therapy may be effective in patients with HCV-induced glomerulonephritis. Further evidence is needed to evaluate efficacy and safety of ribavirin monotherapy for HCV-related glomerulonephritis.
