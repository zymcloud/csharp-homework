Purpose:Although sorafenib has been approved for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its high cost, frequent adverse events, and unsatisfactory efficacy remain unresolved. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment of localized concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) for locally advanced HCC with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for intrahepatic metastasis.Methods:Between January 2006 and June 2011, 30 patients with HCC with portal vein invasion and intrahepatic metastasis were enrolled. After TACE for intrahepatic metastasis, localized CCRT (45 Gy over 5 weeks with conventional fractionation and hepatic artery infusional chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil as a radiosensitizer, administered during the first and fifth weeks of radiotherapy) was used to treat main HCC with PVT. The modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) were used to evaluate tumor response.Results:The median age of the patients (26 men, 4 women) was 51 years. Objective response rates were 30.0% (9/30) and 32.1% (9/28) in the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.5 and 9.8 months, respectively. Baseline Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) correlated significantly with PFS (P = 0.008), whereas baseline AFP, completion of the protocol, and overall radiological response influenced OS significantly (all P Conclusions:Combination treatment of localized CCRT and TACE was effective and tolerable in patients with locally advanced HCC with PVT and intrahepatic metastasis. This protocol may be an alternative option when sorafenib cannot be prescribed.
