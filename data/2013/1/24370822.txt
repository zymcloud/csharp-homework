Growing evidence has demonstrated that the aberrant expression of miRNA is a hallmark of malignancies, indicating the important roles of miRNA in the development and progression of cancer. MiR-7 is considered as a tumor suppressor miRNA in multiple types of cancer. However, the role of miR-7 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its underlying mechanism remain elusive. In this study, we found that overexpression of miR-7 arrested cell cycle at G1 to S transition in HCC. By combinational use of bioinformatic prediction, reporter assay, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, we confirmed that CCNE1, an important mediator in G1/S transition is one of new direct target genes of miR-7. Further studies revealed that silencing of CCNE1 recapitulated the effects of miR-7 overexpression, whereas enforced expression of CCNE1 reversed the suppressive effects of miR-7 in cell cycle regulation. Finally, analysis of qRT-PCR showed a reciprocal relationship between miR-7 and CCNE1 in clinical cancer tissues and multiple types of tumor cell lines. These findings indicate that miR-7 exerts tumor-suppressive effects in hepatocarcinogenesis through the suppression of oncogene CCNE1 expression and suggest a therapeutic application of miR-7 in HCC.
