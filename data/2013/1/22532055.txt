Cirrhosis is a leading cause of death among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We sought to determine risk factors for and time trends in the prevalence of cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients diagnosed with HIV who received care in the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system nationally between 1996 and 2009 (n = 24,040 in 2009). Among patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), there was a dramatic increase in the prevalence of cirrhosis (3.5%-13.2%), decompensated cirrhosis (1.9%-5.8%), and HCC (0.07%-1.6%). Little increase was observed among patients without HCV coinfection in the prevalence of cirrhosis (1.7%-2.2%), decompensated cirrhosis (1.1%-1.2%), and HCC (0.03%-0.13%). In 2009, HCV infection was present in the majority of patients with HIV who had cirrhosis (66%), decompensated cirrhosis (62%), and HCC (80%). Independent risk factors for cirrhosis included HCV infection (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0-6.7), hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (AOR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.0-2.9), age (AOR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), Hispanic ethnicity (AOR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.4-2.2), diabetes (AOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.6-2.1), and alcohol abuse (AOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.5-2.1), whereas black race (AOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.48-0.64) and successful eradication of HCV (AOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9) were protective. Independent risk factors for HCC included HCV infection (AOR, 10.0; 95% CI, 6.1-16.4), HBV infection (AOR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.7-4.7), age (AOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08), and low CD4+ cell count (AOR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2). Among 5999 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, 994 (18%) had ever received HCV antiviral treatment, of whom 165 (17%) achieved sustained virologic response.Conclusion:The prevalence of cirrhosis and HCC has increased dramatically among HIV-infected patients driven primarily by the HCV epidemic. Potentially modifiable risk factors include HCV infection, HBV infection, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and low CD4+ cell count.
