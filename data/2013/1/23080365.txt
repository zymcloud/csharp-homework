Vitamin K is frequently administered in cirrhotic patients to correct their coagulopathy, but evidence for such practice is lacking. We aimed to assess whether vitamin K administration increases the levels of the vitamin K-dependent factor VII (FVII), protein C, and protein S in patients with different stages of liver dysfunction. Eighty-nine patients were recruited into four groups: group 1 [hepatitis B virus (HBV) inactive carriers, n = 23]; group 2 [chronic HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) hepatitis, n = 21]; group 3 (cirrhosis, n = 24); group 4 (hepatocellular carcinoma, n = 21); and a healthy control group (n = 39). A single dose of 10 mg of vitamin K1 was administered subcutaneously to all patients. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen, FVII, protein C, total and free protein S, and proteins induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA)-II (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) were measured at baseline and 72 h after vitamin K administration. There was progressive increment in baseline PIVKA-II, and decrements in fibrinogen, FVII, protein C, and protein S across study groups (P
