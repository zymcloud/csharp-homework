HPLC-PDA-MS and TLC analysis were used to look for minor cytotoxic chlorinated valepotriates from whole plants of Valeriana jatamansi (syn. Valeriana wallichii DC.). This resulted in isolation of 15 chlorinated valepotriates, designated as chlorovaltrates A-O, together with six known analogues, (1S,3R,5R,7S,8S,9S)-3,8-epoxy-1,5-dihydroxyvalechlorine, volvaltrate B, chlorovaltrate, rupesin B, (1S,3R,5R,7S,8S,9S)-3,8-epoxy-1-O-ethyl-5-hydroxyvalechlorine, and (1R,3R,5R,7S,8S,9S)-3,8-epoxy-1-O-ethyl-5-hydroxyvalechlorine. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including homo- and heteronuclear two-dimensional NMR experiments. Chlorovaltrates K-N, chlorovaltrate and rupesin B showed moderate cytotoxicity against lung adenocarcinoma (A 549), metastatic prostate cancer (PC-3M), colon cancer (HCT-8) and hepatoma (Bel 7402) cell lines with IC₅₀ values of 0.89-9.76 μM.
