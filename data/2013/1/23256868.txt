Chromosome 8, a medium-length euchromatic unit in humans that has an extraordinarily high mutation rate, can be detected not only in evolution but also in multiple mutant diseases, such as tumorigenesis, and further invasion/metastasis. The Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project of China systematically profiles the proteomes of three digestive organs (i.e., stomach, colon, and liver) and their corresponding carcinoma tissues/cell lines according to a chromosome organizational roadmap. By rigorous standards, we have identified 271 (38.7%), 330 (47.1%), and 325 (46.4%) of 701 chromosome 8-coded proteins from stomach, colon, and liver samples, respectively, in Swiss-Prot and observed a total coverage rate of up to 58.9% by 413 identified proteins. Using large-scale label-free proteome quantitation, we also found some 8p deficiencies, such as the presence of 8p21-p23 in tumorigenesis of the above-described digestive organs, which is in good agreement with previous reports. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to have verified these 8p deficiencies at the proteome level, complementing genome and transcriptome data.
