Objective:To develop a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assay for direct detection of unamplified HURP RNA in urine.Design and methods:HURP RNA was extracted from urine samples (50 bladder carcinoma patients, 25 benign bladder lesions, and 25 controls) and further purified using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), functionalized with HURP RNA-specific oligonucleotides, and then detected by RT-PCR or gold nanoparticles.Results:The developed HURP RNA AuNP assay has a sensitivity and a specificity of 88.5% and 94%, respectively, and a detection limit of 2.4 nmol/L. The concordance between the HURP AuNP assay with RT-PCR after RNA purification using functionalized MNPs was 97%.Conclusions:The developed colorimetric HURP RNA AuNP assay is sensitive, simple, and can aid noninvasive diagnosis of bladder cancer.
