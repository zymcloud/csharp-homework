Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) plays a major role in the regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory responses. The objectives of the study were to systematically investigate the effects of TNF-α and its regulatory pathway on PPARα expression in HepG2 cells using Real-Time RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Here, TNF-α suppressed PPARα mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner at the level of gene transcription. Pre-treatment of cells with 10μM of Wedelolactone for 2h was sufficient to restore PPARα expression to basal levels and also affected the expression of PPARα-regulated genes. This study also demonstrated that TNF-α represses PPARα expression by augmenting the activity of canonical NF-κB signalling pathway. This was shown by the abrogation of TNF-α-mediated PPARα down-regulation, after both p65 and p50 were knocked down via siRNA. The IKK contributes to IκBα degradation and mediates inducible phosphorylation of p105 at Ser933. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468 and Ser536 were severely abrogated with Wedelolactone inhibition, suggesting that Ser468 and Ser536, but not Ser276, may mediate the TNF-α inhibitory action on PPARα gene expression. These results suggest that TNF-α might, at least in part, suppress PPARα expression through activation of IKK/p50/p105/p65 pathway. Furthermore, phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468 and Ser536 may play a crucial role in the mechanism that limits PPARα production in the human HepG2 cells.
