Purpose:To compare the rates of hepatotoxicity after transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with and without a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) who were stratified into comparable risk groups.Materials and methods:A retrospective review of patients with HCC who were treated with transarterial chemoembolization between January 2005 and December 2009 was performed. Of 158 patients with comparable model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores, 10 had a patent TIPS. Hepatobiliary severe adverse events (SAEs) occurring after transarterial chemoembolization were documented. In addition, 1-year survival and liver transplantation rate after transarterial chemoembolization were calculated in each group.Results:The incidence of hepatobiliary SAEs after transarterial chemoembolization was nearly two times higher in patients with a TIPS (70%) than in patients without a TIPS (36%; P=.046). The liver transplantation rate 1 year after transarterial chemoembolization was 2.5 times higher in patients with a TIPS (80%) than in patients without a TIPS (32%; P=.004). There was no significant difference in 1-year survival between the two groups after transarterial chemoembolization.Conclusions:Patients with HCC and a patent TIPS are more likely to develop significant hepatotoxicity after transarterial chemoembolization than comparable patients without a TIPS in place.
