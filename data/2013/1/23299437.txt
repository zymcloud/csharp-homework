Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers with a high frequency of post-surgical recurrence. It is very critical to diagnose HCC recurrence at an early stage for a better therapeutic treatment. In this study, we examined the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling in tumor tissues obtained from early and late recurrent HCC patients post-resection, using a microarray assay. A total of 32 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed during the progression of recurrence. Among these, 16 miRNAs were upregulated and 16 were downregulated. In addition, this miRNA expression signature was further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Moreover, functional annotation of predicted target genes of these recurrent HCC-related miRNAs indicates that multiple biological pathways (i.e., focal adhesion pathway, cancer-related pathways and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling) that are all critical for cancer development and progression, may participate in the recurrence of HCC. Our data suggest potential molecular mechanisms underpinning miRNA-controlled HCC recurrence, and support the notion that miRNA expression signature and miRNA-based therapy can be useful tools for a better diagnosis and treatment stratification of this disease.
