Purpose:To evaluate the effect on diffusion-weighted image-derived parameters in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) models from choice of either free-breathing or navigator-controlled acquisition.Materials and methods:Imaging was performed with consent from healthy volunteers (n = 10) on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto scanner. Parameter-matched free-breathing and navigator-controlled diffusion-weighted images were acquired, without averaging in the console, for a total scan time of ∼10 minutes. Regions of interest were drawn for renal cortex, renal pyramid, whole kidney, liver, spleen, and paraspinal muscle. An ADC diffusion model for these regions was fitted for b-values ≥ 250 s/mm(2) , using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and an IVIM model was fitted for all images using a Bayesian method.Results:ADC and IVIM parameters from the two acquisition regimes show no significant differences for the cohort; individual cases show occasional discrepancies, with outliers in parameter estimates arising more commonly from navigator-controlled scans. The navigator-controlled acquisitions showed, on average, a smaller range of movement for the kidneys (6.0 ± 1.4 vs. 10.0 ± 1.7 mm, P = 0.03), but also a smaller number of averages collected (3.9 ± 0.1 vs. 5.5 ± 0.2, P < 0.01) in the allocated time.Conclusion:Navigator triggering offers no advantage in fitted diffusion parameters, whereas free-breathing appears to offer greater confidence in fitted diffusion parameters, with fewer outliers, for matched acquisition periods.
