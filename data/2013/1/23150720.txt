Background:The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy and safety of: 1) transarterial chemolipiodolization with gelatin sponge embolization vs chemolipiodolization without embolization, and 2) chemolipiodolization with triple chemotherapeutic agents vs epirubicin alone.Methods:A single-blind, three parallel arm, randomized trial was conducted at three clinical centers with patients with biopsy-confirmed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Arm 1 received triple-drug chemolipiodolization and sponge embolization, whereas Arm 2 received triple-drug chemolipiodolization only. Patients in arm 3 were treated with single-drug chemolipiodolization and sponge embolization. We compared overall survival and time to progression. Event-time distributions were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results:From July 2007 to November 2009, 365 patients (Arm 1: n = 122; Arm 2: n = 121; Arm 3: n = 122) were recruited. The median tumor size was 10.9cm (range = 7-22cm), and 34.5% had macrovascular invasion. The median survivals and time to progression in Arm 1, Arm 2, and Arm 3 were 10.5 and 3.6 months, 10.1 and 3.1 months, and 5.9 and 3.1 months, respectively. Survival was statistically significantly better in Arm 1 than in Arm 3 (P Conclusions:Chemolipiodolization played an important role in transarterial chemoembolization, and the choice of chemotherapy regimen may largely affect survival outcomes. However, the removal of embolization from chemoembolization might not statistically significantly decrease survival.
