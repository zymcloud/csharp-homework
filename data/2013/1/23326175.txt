Ring calcification in untreated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is extremely rare, with only 3 previously reported cases in the English-language literature. A case of HCC with ring calcification was reported in this paper. Additionally, 3 previously reported cases of HCC with ring calcification were reviewed. In 3 of these 4 cases (including our case), surgery was performed. Although the size of the ring-calcified lesion ranged from 3.0-3.7 cm in previously reported cases, the size was only 1 cm in ours. The differentiation of the tumor was moderate in the 2 previously reported cases in the histological findings and poor in ours. In spite of their poor differentiation for their sizes, these tumors showed no early enhancement in dynamic computed tomography. All calcified tumors showed a thick fibrous capsule and extensive necrosis histologically. Ring calcification was considered to result from a circulatory disturbance caused by the imbalance between the less abundant arterial blood flow and high inner pressure induced by either the thick fibrous capsule or vigorous proliferation due to the poor differentiation. Ring calcification in untreated HCC may suggest a lower differentiation of the tumor. Even if its size is small, hepatic resection should be performed for any tumor with ring calcification because poor differentiation is considered to be one of the risk factors for recurrence after local ablation therapy, including radio frequency ablation.
