Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are predisposed to upper gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage with bleeding gastro-oesophageal varices and peptic ulcers being the common aetiologies. On rare occasions, HCC with direct invasion into the upper GI tract can lead to haemorrhage. Recognizing the possibility of invasive HCC causing upper GI haemorrhage is of paramount importance as acute management differs from the usual aetiologies. We describe a 76-year-old lady with long-standing liver cirrhosis who presented with upper GI haemorrhage due to an HCC invading into the greater curvature of the stomach. Trans-arterial embolization was performed which led to successful cessation of bleeding. Direct invasion of the GI tract by HCC causing haemorrhage is an extremely rare condition. Compared with endoscopic therapy, trans-arterial embolization offers the best chance of successful haemostasis and should be considered first-line therapy in these patients.
