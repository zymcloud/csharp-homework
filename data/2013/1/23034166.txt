Background and aim:Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) is a rare liver malignancy. In this study, we compared patient characteristics and outcomes for primary CHC, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Medical records of patients with tissue-proven CHC (65 cases) treated at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between 1991 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. These records were compared to records of patients diagnosed with tissue-proven HCC (1985 cases) and ICC (127 cases) during the same period.Results:Hepatitis B and C are major causes of CHC. CHC patients exhibited greater similarity to HCC than to ICC patients with respect to cirrhotic changes, age, and positive serology for hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C antibody. Survival was related to tumor characteristics and intervention therapies, but not to etiologies.Conclusions:The clinical characteristics of CHC are similar to those of HCC, but overall survival is more similar to that of ICC; survival may be related to tumor biology rather than the cause. Multimodal treatment with an initial aggressive therapeutic approach can improve survival.
