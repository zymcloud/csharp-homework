Yessotoxin (YTX) and its analogs are a type of marine toxins found in marine environments in numerous coastal countries. These toxins tend to accumulate in filter-feeding molluscs and may threaten the shellfish industry and public health. Several previous studies indicated that YTX may induce apoptosis in different types of cell lines, although the exact underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to mainly focus on the effect of YTX on cytosolic Ca2+ levels in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In order to investigate the exact mechanism of YTX-evoked Ca2+ increase, laser scanning confocal microscopy was used, with the addition of the chelator ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, to the reaction system. The results demonstrated that YTX caused cytosolic Ca2+ level increase in Bel7402 cells and the YTX-evoked Ca2+ increase was successfully blocked by EGTA and nifedipine. Therefore, our results indicated that YTX may cause apoptosis via inducing Ca2+ entry in Bel7402 cells.
