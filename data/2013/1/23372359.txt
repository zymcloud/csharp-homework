Aim:To clarify the role of surgical resection for multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) compared to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and liver transplantation (LT).Methods:Among the HCC patients who were managed at Yonsei University Health System between January 2003 and December 2008, 160 patients who met the following criteria were retrospectively enrolled: (1) two or three radiologically diagnosed HCCs; (2) no radiologic vascular invasion; (3) Child-Pugh class A; (4) main tumor smaller than 5 cm in diameter; and (5) platelet count greater than 50 000/mm(3). Long-term outcomes were compared among the following three treatment modalities: surgical resection or combined radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (n = 36), TACE (n = 107), and LT (n = 17). The survival curves were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with a log-rank test. To identify the patients who gained a survival benefit from surgical resection, we also investigated prognostic factors for survival following surgical resection. Multivariate analyses of the prognostic factors for survival were performed using the Cox proportional hazard model.Results:The overall survival (OS) rate was significantly higher in the surgical resection group than in the TACE group (48.1% vs 28.9% at 5 years, P Conclusion:Among patients with two or three HCCs, no radiologic vascular invasion, and tumor diameters â‰¤ 5 cm, surgical resection is recommended only in those without cirrhosis.
