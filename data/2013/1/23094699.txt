Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Several hepatitis B viral factors predictive of clinical outcomes in HBV carriers have been identified. The Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-HBV (REVEAL-HBV) study from Taiwan illustrated the strong association between HBV-DNA level at study entry and risk of HCC over time. In this community-based cohort study, male gender, older age, high serum alanine aminotransferase level, positive hepatitis B e antigen, higher HBV-DNA level, HBV genotype C infection, and core promoter mutation are independently associated with a higher risk of HCC. Another large hospital-based Elucidation of Risk Factors for Disease Control or Advancement in Taiwanese Hepatitis B Carriers cohort of Taiwanese patients further validated the findings of REVEAL-HBV. The risk of HCC started to increase when HBV-DNA level was higher than 2000 IU/mL. Both HBV-DNA and HBsAg levels were shown to be associated with HCC development. While HBV-DNA level had better predictive accuracy than HBsAg level, when investigating the overall cohort in patients with HBV-DNA level
