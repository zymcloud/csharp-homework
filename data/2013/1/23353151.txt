Objective:To investigate the effect of Biejiajian Pills on Wnt signal pathway and its inhibitory gene (DKK-1 and FrpHe) expressions and explore the mechanism underlying the action of Biejiajian Pills to suppress the invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomized equally into 3 groups for gavage of normal saline and Biejiajian Pills at 20- and 10-fold clinical doses for 3 days. Blood samples were then collected from the rats, and the serum was separated and added in HepG2 cell cultures. After 48 h of culture, the cells were collected to determine the cellular content of β-catenin protein using flow cytometry and detect DKK-1 and FrpHe mRNA expressions using qRT-PCR.Results:HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of sera from rats fed with Biejiajian Pills showed significantly lowered β-catenin protein expression and obvious down-regulation of DKK-1 mRNA expression, and the effect was correlated with the doses of the drug administered. The expression of FrpHe mRNA showed no significant differences between the 3 groups.Conclusions:Biejiajian Pills can effectively inhibit the invasiveness and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which is closely related to decreased expressions of β-catenin and DKK-1 to cause block of the Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway.
