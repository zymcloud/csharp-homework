Seventeen new derivatives of betulinic acid (BA) with potential anti-tumor activity have been synthesized. In order to improve the bioactivity of BA, we connected BA and nitric oxide donors together via different linkers. The results of the biological activity of these derivatives showed that four compounds exhibited obvious cytotoxicity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.
