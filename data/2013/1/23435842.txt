Background:There have been no reports on the incidence, characteristics, treatment outcomes, and prognosis of inoperably advanced or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEGJ) in Japan.Methods:We investigated the clinicopathological characteristics, treatment outcomes, and prognosis for 816 patients with esophagogastric junctional and gastric adenocarcinoma who received first-line chemotherapy between 2004 and 2009.Results:Of 816 patients, 82 (10 %) had AEGJ. The patients with AEGJ had significantly more lung and lymph node metastasis, but less peritoneal metastasis, than those with gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). The objective response rate to first-line chemotherapy was 23.3 % for patients with AEGJ and 22.6 % in patients with GAC (p = 0.90). The median survival was 13.0 months in AEGJ and 11.8 months in GAC (p = 0.445). In no patient was tumor site a significant prognostic factor (p = 0.472). In patients with AEGJ, ECOG PS â‰¥ 2, presence of liver metastasis, and absence of lung metastasis were significantly associated with poor prognosis.Conclusions:No significant differences were observed in treatment outcomes between advanced AEGJ and GAC. Therefore, the same chemotherapy regimen can be given as a treatment arm in future Japanese clinical trials to both patients with inoperably advanced or recurrent AEGJ and those with GAC.
