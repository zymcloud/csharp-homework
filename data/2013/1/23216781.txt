Background:Irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads represent a novel drug delivery method that allows for the locoregional delivery of irinotecan to colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). The method has shown impressive response rates. However, the pathological response to this treatment has not previously been demonstrated.Methods:Patients with easily resectable CRLM were treated with drug-eluting beads delivering irinotecan (DEBIRI) 4 weeks prior to resection. Pathological tumour response was graded using a validated system. The intraoperative detection of previously unidentified disease allowed for the assessment of pathological responses directly attributable to bead treatment.Results:In Patient 1, segmental embolization of the target lesion in segment VIII resulted in 100% necrosis (0% viability). An untreated lesion in segment IV was found to be 30% viable. In Patient 2, subsegmental embolization of the target lesion in segment VI resulted in 60% necrosis and 40% fibrosis (0% viability). An untreated lesion in segment VI remained 60% viable. In Patient 3, lobar embolization of the target lesion in segment II resulted in 0% viability. Two further lesions within the treated hemiliver, both with 0% viability, and one lesion in the untreated hemiliver with 45% viability were discovered at laparotomy.Conclusions:This series demonstrates the effectiveness of DEBIRI in the treatment of CRLM. High rates of tumour destruction are possible, even with the proximal lobar administration of DEBIRI. Lobar administration appears to be an appropriate method of delivery for integration into future therapeutic regimens.
