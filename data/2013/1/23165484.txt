Background:Recent developments in perioperative pathophysiology and care have documented evidence-based, multimodal rehabilitation (fast-track) to hasten recovery and to decrease morbidity and hospital stay for several major surgical procedures. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of introducing fast-track principles for perioperative care in unselected patients undergoing open or laparoscopic liver resection.Methods:This was a prospective study involving the first 100 consecutive patients who followed fast-track principles for liver resection. Catheters and drains were systematically removed early, and patients were mobilized and started eating and drinking from the day of surgery. An opioid-sparing multimodal pain treatment was given for the first week. Discharge criteria were: pain sufficiently controlled by oral analgesics alone, patient comfortable with discharge and no untreated complications.Results:Median length of stay (LOS) for all patients was 5 days, with 2 days after laparoscopic versus 5 days following open resection (P Conclusion:Fast-track principles for perioperative care were introduced successfully and are safe after liver resection. Routine discharge 2 days after laparoscopic resection and 4-5 days after open liver resection may be feasible.
