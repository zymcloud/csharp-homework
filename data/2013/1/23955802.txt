Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are ex vivo generated heterogeneous NK-like T lymphocytes. It is not very clear whether the phenotype of CIK cells is associated with their therapeutic efficacy to cancer patients. Thus, in this study, the association of phenotype of CIK cells and the overall survival of 121 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 74 patients with lung cancer and 42 patients with colorectal cancer, all of whom underwent surgical resection and received autogenous CIK cell therapy, was analyzed. We found that high ratio of the CD3+CD4+ subset was associated with poorer overall survival in colorectal cancer, but not HCC or lung cancer. A high ratio of the CD3+CD8+ subset was associated with improved overall survival in all three types of cancer. A high ratio of the CD3+CD56+ NK-like subset was associated with improved overall survival in lung and colorectal cancer, but not HCC. A high ratio of the CD3-CD56+ NK subset was associated with poorer overall survival in lung and colorectal cancer, but not HCC. In conclusion, the CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD56+ subsets, especially the CD3+CD8+ subset, may be the major phenotypes responsible for anti-tumor immunity in vivo after autogenous CIK cell therapy.
