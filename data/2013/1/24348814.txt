To analyze the significance of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in the development of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver cancer in rats, critical regulatory factors in ERS signaling pathways were investigated in the present study. The results showed that the expression of ERS-related proteins gradually increased in the early and mid-term stages of carcinogenesis, while in the later stages, the expression of these proteins did not change significantly after reaching a peak. ERS is involved in DEN-induced rat liver injury, the proliferation of liver cells and the occurrence and development of liver cirrhosis. However, ERS did not affect hepatoma cell growth following the formation of rat liver cancer in the current study.
