Intra-operative tumor rupture is a serious complication during resection of large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) leading to more blood loss. We report our experience in applying continuous Pringle maneuver with in situ hypothermic perfusion via inferior mesenteric vein catheterization to the portal vein of the remnant liver for resection during an extended left lobectomy of a large HCC which ruptured intraoperatively. Using this method, we successfully managed the patient without any further morbidity. This technique provides easier accessibility of in situ perfusion, decreases operative blood loss and prevents warm ischemic injury to the remnant liver during parenchymal transection. This method could be effective for the resection of large ruptured HCC.
