A 35-year-old woman underwent hemicolectomy and RFA for ascending colon cancer with multiple liver metastases in February, 2005. She received postoperative hepaticarterial infusion chemotherapy with 5-FU, and systemic hemotherapy with UFT for 10 months after the operation. A local recurrence of the anastomosis was detected in March, 2006, and she underwent a resection for it. This was followed by 6 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6. Because multiple liver metastases and lymph node metastases were detected in March, 2007, she received RFA and 6 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 again. Liver metastases disappeared but lymph node metastases still remained. Therefore, she received 4 courses of bevacizumab plus modified FOLFOX6. The metastatic lesions disappeared and were judged to be CR. Therefore, she was followed-up with the oral administration of UFT. Metastases of liver and lymph nodes of the mediastinum were detected in May, 2008, for which she received 4 courses of bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI2. Because the effects of the chemotherapy were judged to be CR, she continued with 4 courses of the same regimen. The regimen was discontinued due to diarrhea, and she therefore began to receive 4 courses of bevacizumab plus LV/5-FU regimens. CR has been maintained at present, over 7 years after the initial surgery.
