Introduction:Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly vascularized tumor. ASA404 is a tumor vascular disrupting agent. This is the first trial to report the effects of combining chemotherapy with ASA404 in SCLC.Methods:Patients with untreated metastatic SCLC were treated with carboplatin (area under curve, 6) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2)) plus ASA404 (1800 mg/m(2)) on day 1 every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 weeks.Results:Median age was 61 years; 53% were women, 41% had weight loss; and 96% had a performance status of 0-1. Twelve patients completed all 6 cycles, and most adverse events were related to chemotherapy. Median PFS and time to progression were 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.4 months) and 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.7-9.4 months), respectively. The progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 24 weeks was 41% (95% CI, 18%-65%). The overall response rate was 94%. The median overall survival time was 14.2 months (95% CI, 8.2-16.0 months) and 1-year survival was 57%. The median follow-up time was 17.7 months. Due to negative results with ASA404 in non-small-cell lung cancer trials, the trial was stopped prematurely after 17 of 56 planned patients were being accrued.Conclusions:This is the first report of a clinical trial with a vascular disrupting agent in SCLC. No unexpected toxicity was observed. PFS was not prolonged with carboplatin and paclitaxel plus ASA404.
