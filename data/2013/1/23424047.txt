Background/aims:To determine if hepatocellular carcinoma refractory to conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) responds to TACE with DC beads.Methods:Between July 2008 to June 2010, 435 patients underwent TACE. Of these, 10 patients who had tumors refractory to conventional TACE and who thus were treated with TACE with DC beads were enrolled in this study. The treatment response after TACE with DC beads was evaluated according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Cancer of the Liver (RECICL).Results:Ten tumors were treated in 10 patients. Using the mRECIST and the RECICL, a complete response was observed in four (40%) of the tumors, and six tumors (60%) showed a partial response. Eight (80%) out of 10 HCCs showed delayed enhancement patterns upon angiography, and better responses were observed in these cases following DC bead treatment. The adverse effects of treatment with DC beads became tolerable.Conclusions:TACE with DC beads was effective for HCCs refractory to conventional TACE, and this treatment elicited a better response, especially when the tumors were small and showed a delayed enhancement pattern upon angiography.
