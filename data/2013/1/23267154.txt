Aim:We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and quality of life of elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with bi-weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy, and determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this treatment.Patients and methods:Eligible patients had histologically- or cytologically-proven inoperable NSCLC, age of 70 years or older, no prior treatment, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2. Paclitaxel was administered in combination with carboplatin under a bi-weekly schedule. We determined the plasma concentrations of both drugs during therapy.Results:The median patient age was 80 years. Using carboplatin at AUC 3, the MTD of paclitaxel was 100 mg/m(2). Both hematological and non-hematological toxicities were mostly mild and manageable. Although paclitaxel is predominantly metabolized in the liver, clearance was decreased in patients with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.Conclusion:Bi-weekly treatment, as described here, is feasible for elderly patients as a conventional regimen, particularly in the outpatient setting, due to its lower toxicity.
