In 2010, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution calling for interventions for the prevention and control of chronic viral hepatitis. These infectious diseases mostly affect resource-limited countries accounting for 80% of the world's population and facing numerous obstacles to contain the epidemic. At a time when morbidity and mortality of chronic liver disease have been considerably improved in wealthy countries by new innovative strategies and new potent antiviral drugs, it is now urgent to recall for concrete actions from stakeholders of global health policy to reduce the burden in resource-limited countries.
