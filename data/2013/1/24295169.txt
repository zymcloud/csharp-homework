A pair of new enantiomeric stilbene dimers, (+)- and (-)-cajanusine [(+)-1 and (-)-1], with a unique coupling pattern were isolated from the leaves of Cajanus cajan . Their structures including absolute configurations were elucidated on the basis of comprehensive spectroscopic and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, as well as CD calculations. The plausible biogenetic pathway of 1 was also proposed. Additionally, (Â±)-1, (+)-1, and (-)-1 exhibited inhibitory activities on the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
