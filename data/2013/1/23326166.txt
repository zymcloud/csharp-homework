Aim:To identify factors associated with prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after initial therapy.Methods:A total of 377 HCC patients who were newly treated at Katsushika Medical Center, Japan from January 2000 to December 2009 and followed up for > 2 years, or died during follow-up, were enrolled. The factors related to survival were first analyzed in 377 patients with HCC tumor stage T1-T4 using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. A similar analysis was performed in 282 patients with tumor stage T1-T3. Additionally, factors associated with the period between initial and subsequent therapy were examined in 144 patients who did not show local recurrence. Finally, 214 HCC stage T1-T3 patients who died during the observation period were classified into four groups according to their alcohol consumption and postprandial glucose levels, and differences in their causes of death were examined.Results:On multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the following were significantly associated with survival: underlying liver disease stage [non-cirrhosis/Child-Pugh A vs B/C, hazard ratio (HR): 0.603, 95% CI: 0.417-0.874, P = 0.0079], HCC stage (T1/T2 vs T3/T4, HR: 0.447, 95% CI: 0.347-0.576, P 200 mg/dL group" (log-rank test, P 20 g daily). Of 214 T1-T3 patients who died during the observation period, death caused by other than HCC progression was significantly more frequent in "group AL" (patients in the continuation and postprandial glucose within 200 mg/dL groups) than "group N" (patients in the non-alcohol and postprandial glucose within 200 mg/dL groups) (P = 0.0016).Conclusion:This study found that abstinence from habitual alcohol consumption and intensive care for diabetes mellitus were related to improved prognosis in HCC patients.
