Background:The efficacy and safety of linifanib (ABT-869), a selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, were assessed in this phase 2, single-arm, open-label, multicenter trial.Methods:Eligible patients had unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma and had received â‰¤ 1 prior systemic therapy. Patients received oral linifanib at a fasting dose of 0.25 mg/kg,. The primary endpoint was the progression-free rate at 16 weeks. Tumor response was assessed every 8 weeks. Secondary endpoints included the time to disease progression, overall survival, and objective response rate. Safety was also assessed.Results:Of the 44 patients enrolled, the majority were Asian (89%), had received no prior systemic therapy (82%), had Child-Pugh class A hepatic function (86%), and had hepatitis B virus infection (61%). The estimated progression-free rate at 16 weeks was 31.8% (34.2% for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function), the estimated objective response rate was 9.1% (10.5% for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function), the median time to disease progression was 3.7 months (3.7 months for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function), and the median overall survival was 9.7 months (10.4 months for patients with Child-Pugh class A hepatic function). The most common linifanib-related adverse events were diarrhea (55%) and fatigue (52%). The most common linifanib-related grade 3/4 adverse events were hypertension (25%) and fatigue (14%). Serum levels of biomarkers cancer antigen (CA) 125, cytokeratin fragment (CYFRA)21.1, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA) demonstrated potential as prognostic indicators of patient response or outcome.Conclusions:Single-agent linifanib was found to be clinically active in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, with an acceptable safety profile.
