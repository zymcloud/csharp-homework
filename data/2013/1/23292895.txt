The p53 signaling pathway works as a potent barrier to tumor progression. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene loci of p53 pathway, p53 codon 72 Arg72Pro and MDM2 SNP309 (T > G), have been shown to cause perturbation of p53 function, but the effect of the two SNPs on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains inconsistent. This study investigated the influence of combined p53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 SNP309 on the risk of developing HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and evaluated the significance of the two combined SNPs on patient prognosis. In total, 350 HCC patients, 230 non-HCC patients, and 96 healthy controls were genotyped for the p53 Arg72Pro and MDM2 SNP309. The combined p53 Pro/Pro and MDM2 G/G genotype was significantly associated with HCC risk (P = 0.047). Multivariate analysis indicated that combined p53 Pro/Pro and MDM2 G/G genotype was an independent factor affecting recurrence and survival (P
