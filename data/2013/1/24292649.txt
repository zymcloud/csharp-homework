The aim of the study was to evaluate the biological activities with toxic properties of the methanol, hexane, and chloroform extracts of Cystoseira compressa (Esper) Gerloff & Nizamuddin from the Coast of Urla in the Aegean Sea. The extracts of C. compressa were tested for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities in this study. Cytotoxic and mutagenic potentials of the extracts were also evaluated using cell culture and mutagenicity assays. Hexane extract was found to have higher total flavonoid and phenolic contents than the other extracts and exerted higher antioxidant activity than other extracts. All extracts exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against tested microorganisms (minimum inhibitory concentration ranges are 32-256 μg/mL). The results indicated that the extracts had no significant cytotoxic activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep 3B cell line in all treated concentrations (5-50 μg/mL) and did not show mutagenicity in the Ames test. Lethality was not observed among mice treated with oral doses of the extracts. In conclusion, results of investigations indicate that brown alga C. compressa is a natural source of antioxidant. It has moderate antimicrobial activities with no toxicity.
