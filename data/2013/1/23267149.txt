Aim:To evaluate the feasibility of the McA-RH7777 tumor model in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, for study of hepatoma and transarterial chemoembolization.Materials and methods:McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells (1Ã—10(7)) were inoculated into the left hepatic lobe of SD rats (n=38). Chemoembolization with left common carotid artery access was performed using an emulsion of iodized oil and doxorubicin, and polyvinyl alcohol particles. Tumor induction rate and response to chemoembolization were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and histology.Results:Tumor induction rate of McA-RH7777 in SD rat livers was 73.3% (11/15). Hematoxylin-and-eosin staining revealed hypercellular tumor with a trabecular pattern that mimics human hepatocellular carcinoma. Chemoembolization was successfully conducted in all rats. There was a significant difference in tumor growth rates between the chemoembolization-treated and control groups (pConclusion:A rat tumor model of McA-RH7777 cells in SD rats is feasible and has the potential to be a good model for hepatoma and chemoembolization studies.
