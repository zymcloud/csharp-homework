A series of twenty five 2-methylsulfanyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline derivatives 1-25 was previously synthesized. We have now investigated their cytotoxic effects against hepatocellular Hep-G2 and colon HCT-116 carcinoma cells and effect on the macrophage growth, in addition to their influence of the inflammatory mediators [nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) and in bacterial lipopolysachharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages]. The findings revealed that compounds 13 and 17 showed the highest cytotoxicity and that 3, 6-8 and 25 are promising multi-potent anti-inflammatory agents.
