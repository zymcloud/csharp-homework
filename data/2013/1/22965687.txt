In this study,we investigated the ADAM8 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its correlation with clinicopathologic features,including the survival of patients with HCC. Furthermore,we examined the biological processes regulated by ADAM8 during the development of using HepG2 cell line as a model system. We used immunohistochemistry to compare ADAM8 protein expression in HCC and normal liver tissues and further analyze the ADAM8 protein expression in clinicopathologically characterized 105 HCC cases.We stably knocked down the endogenous expression level of ADAM8 in HepG2 cells with specific shRNA-expressing lentiviral vector. Following the successful establishment of stable cells,we examined in vitro cell growth by MTT assay,anchorage-independent growth by soft-agar colony formation assay and cell migration/invasion by transwell and boyden chamber assay. And in addition,we also investigated the in vivo tumor growth by xenograft transplantation of HepG2 cells into nude mice. Protein expression level of ADAM8 was markedly higher in HCC tissues than that in the normal liver tissues (P = 0.0058).In addition,high expression of ADAM8 protein was positively correlated with serum AFP elevation,tumor size,histological differentiation,tumor recurrence,tumor metastasis,and tumor stage. Patients with higher ADAM8 expression showed a significantly shorter overall survival time than patients with low ADAM8 expression. Multivariate analysis suggested that ADAM8 expression might be an independent prognostic indicator (p = 0.016) for the survival of patients with HCC. ADAM8-specific shRNA (shADAM8) successfully knocked down its endogenous expression in HepG2 cells. Compared to the parental and control shRNA-transfected (shCtrl) HepG2 cells,the shADAM8 cells exhibited significantly reduced in vitro cell growth,anchorage-independent growth,cell migration and invasion (p
