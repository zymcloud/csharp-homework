Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and is most commonly found in the setting of liver cirrhosis. Treatment of HCC must consider both the tumors present, as well as the remaining dysfunctional liver that both hinders treatment and can produce additional HCC over time. Ablation is an evolving part of the multimodality treatment approach to HCC that can effectively destroy tumors while preserving surrounding liver parenchyma. New technologies have made ablation an indispensable tool in the treatment of all stages of HCC. This review presents the history, present technologies and future potential of ablation in the treatment of HCC.
