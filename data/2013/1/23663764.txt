Objective:To prepare a specific high molecular weight polymer contrast agent capable of specifically targeting hepatocarcinoma cells (HCC) and to investigate its affinity in vitro using HepG2 cells.Methods:The high molecular weight polymer polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLAG)-COOH was prepared by the double emulsion technique. PLAG-COOH microbubbles were combined with glypican-3 (GPC3) antibody to generate HCC targeting high molecular polymer ultrasound contrast agents by the carbodiimide method. The affinity for HCC cells was confirmed by measuring attachment to cultured HepG2 cells by flow cytometry and comparing the results with the properties observed for non-targeted high molecular weight polymer ultrasound contrast agents.Results:The average diameter of the targeted high molecular weight polymer ultrasound contrast agents was (800+/-10) nm. In vitro targeting of HepG2 cells showed that many of the targeted high molecular weight polymer ultrasound contrast agents attached tightly to the cell surface and that the GPC3-PLGA has a particularly strong targeting ability.Conclusion:A HCC-specific high molecular contrast agent, GPC3-PLGA, was synthesized and evidenced a strong targeting ability towards HepG2 cells in vitro. This new agent may be exploited to improve diagnosis of liver cancer at the molecular level.
