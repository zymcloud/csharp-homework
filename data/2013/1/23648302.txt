Objective:To investigate the prognostic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the surgical outcomes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 832 patients who underwent hepatic resection between February 2002 and June 2010 in the Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Post-resection prognostic factors were assessed using a univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.Results:The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 92.0%, 70.2% and 53.6%, respectively. The disease free survival rates (DFS) were 90.2%, 61.5% and 40.5%, respectively. The univariate analysis showed that a better prognosis for overall survival (OS) was associated with asymptomatic presentation, small tumor, single lesion, high-grade histological differentiation, no vascular tumor embolus, negative serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), negative serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Child-Pugh class A, no ascites, no/mild cirrhosis, new surgical techniques, no blood transfusion, no regional lymph node metastasis, no major vascular invasion, and no extra-hepatic invasion. The multivariate analysis showed that asymptomatic presentation, small tumor, single lesion, no tumor embolus, negative serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), no regional lymph node metastasis, no major vascular invasion, no extra-hepatic invasion, no/mild cirrhosis, and surgical techniques are independent factors for a longer overall survival.Conclusions:The prognosis of HCC after resection is influenced by a number of factors. Therefore, regularly screening and early diagnosis, applying surgical techniques to minimize the liver injury, and preventing the aggravation of cirrhosis are important measures to improve the overall survival of HCC patients. For those patients with high risk factors of recurrence, routine follow-up is one of the best methods to be recommended.
