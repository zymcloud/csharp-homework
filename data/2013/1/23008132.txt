The discovery of interleukin-28B (IL-28B) single-nucleotide polymorphisms has opened an important new area of research in liver transplantation (LT) for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both recipient- and donor-derived IL-28B genotypes affect the post-LT treatment response, with sustained virological response (SVR) rates oscillating from >50% in homozygotes for the favorable allele (up to 90% when this is present in both the recipient and the donor) to
