Patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia may have bleeding resulting from low platelet counts. Eltrombopag increases and maintains hemostatic platelet counts; however, to date, outcome has been reported only for treatment lasting ≤ 6 months. This interim analysis of the ongoing open-label EXTEND (Eltrombopag eXTENded Dosing) study evaluates the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in 299 patients treated up to 3 years. Splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients achieved platelets ≥ 50 000/μL at least once (80% and 88%, respectively). Platelets ≥ 50 000/μL and 2 × baseline were maintained for a median of 73 of 104 and 109 of 156 cumulative study weeks, respectively. Bleeding symptoms (World Health Organization Grades 1-4) decreased from 56% of patients at baseline to 20% at 2 years and 11% at 3 years. One hundred (33%) patients were receiving concomitant treatments at study entry, 69 of whom attempted to reduce them; 65% (45 of 69) had a sustained reduction or permanently stopped ≥ 1 concomitant treatment. Thirty-eight patients (13%) experienced ≥ 1 adverse events leading to study withdrawal, including patients meeting protocol-defined withdrawal criteria (11 [4%] thromboembolic events, 5 [2%] exceeding liver enzyme thresholds). No new or increased incidence of safety issues was identified. Long-term treatment with eltrombopag was generally safe, well tolerated, and effective in maintaining platelet counts in the desired range.
