Objective:To validate the efficacy of an innovative multimodality therapy with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) plus octreotide and celecoxib in reducing neoangiogenesis and prolonging the survival of rabbits with hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:Rabbits with hepatic VX2 allografts were divided into four groups: control group, TAE group, octreotide + celecoxib (O + C) group and the multimodality therapy (TAE + O + C) group. Survival of the rabbits was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the expression of CD31 in tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry.Results:Rabbits in the TAE + O + C group lived nearly 20 days longer than those in the control group. The survival rate of the TAE + O + C group was 50% at day 80 and was the highest among the four groups (P 0.05). The CD31 expression induced by TAE was reduced significantly in TAE + O + C group (P Conclusion:TAE followed by the long-term administration of octreotide and celecoxib can synergistically prolong the survival of rabbits with hepatic VX2 allografts by inhibiting potential neoangiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis.
