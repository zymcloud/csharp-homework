Malaria remains a major public health problem due to the emergence and spread of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance. There is an urgent need to investigate new sources of antimalarial drugs which are more effective against Plasmodium falciparum. One of the potential sources of antimalarial drugs is traditional medicinal plants. In this work, we studied the in vitro antiplasmodial activity of chloromethylenic, methanolic, and MeOH/H2O (1/1) crude extracts and decoction obtained from eight medicinal plants collected in Burkina Faso and of total alkaloids for five plants. Extracts were evaluated in vitro for efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum strain K1, which is resistant to chloroquine, pyrimethamine and proguanil using the fluorescence-based SYBR Green I assay. The antiproliferative activity on human-derived hepatoma cell line HepG2 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was evaluated using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthyazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test in order to determine the selectivity index. Among the plant extracts tested for in vitro antiplasmodial activity, 16 were considered to be inactive (with IC50 > 10 μg/ml), six showed a moderate activity (5 < IC50 ≤ 10 μg/ml), and six were found to have a good in vitro activity with IC50 value ≤ 5 μg/ml. The highest antiplasmodial activity was found for extracts from: the alkaloid leaf extract and the chloromethylenic extracts of Combretum fragrans (IC50 = 3 μg/ml, IC50 = 5 μg/ml), the total alkaloids and the chloromethylenic leaf extracts of Combretum collinum (IC50 = 4 μg/ml), the MeOH/H2O leaf extract of Terminalia avicennioides (IC50 = 3.5 μg/ml), and the alkaloid leaf extract of Pavetta crassipes (IC50 = 5 μg/ml). Three other extracts showed moderate antiplasmodial activity (5 < IC50 ≤ 10 μg/ml): Terminalia avicennioides and Combretum fragrans methanolic extracts and Acacia kirkii alkaloid leaf extract (IC50 = 6.5, 9 and 10 μg/ml respectively). The Terminalia avicennioides crude MeOH/H2O (80:20 v/v) extract of the leaves was submitted to a successive liquid/liquid extraction with ethylacetate and n-butanol respectively. The extracts were investigated for in vitro antiplasmodial activity and antioxidant properties using DPPH(·), ABTS(+) and FRAP methods. The ethylacetate extract showed the best antiplasmodial activity (7 μg/ml) and the active constituent was isolated as ellagic acid by bioguided fractionation with an IC50 = 0.2 μM on Plasmodium falciparum and SI = 152. Besides, Terminalia avicennioides leaf extract and ellagic acid showed a good antioxidant activity. Our finding confirms the importance of investigating the antimalarial activity of plant species used in traditional medicine. Overall, two plants belonging to the Combretaceae family, Combretum fragrans and Combretum collinum appeared to be the best candidates and will be further investigated for their antiplasmodial properties, in order to isolate the molecules responsible for the antiplasmodial activity.
