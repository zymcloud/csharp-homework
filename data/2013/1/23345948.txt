Aim:To evaluate whether metabolic factors are related to distant recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and survival after curative treatment.Methods:This retrospective study included 344 patients whose HCC was treated curatively by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. The mean age was 67.6 years and the mean observation period was 4.04 years. The etiological background of liver disease was hepatitis B virus infection in 30, hepatitis C virus infection in 278, excessive alcohol drinking in 9, and other in 27 patients. The Child-Pugh classification grade was A (n = 307) or B (n = 37). The number of HCC nodules was one in 260, two in 61, and three in 23 patients. For surveillance of HCC recurrence after curative therapy with RFA, patients were radiologically evaluated every 3 mo. Factors associated with distant recurrence of HCC or survival were studied.Results:Inadequate maintenance of blood glucose in diabetic patients was associated with higher incidence of distant recurrence. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year recurrence rates were significantly higher in diabetic patients with inadequate maintenance of blood glucose compared with the others: 50.6% vs 26.8%, 83.5% vs 54.4%, and 93.8% vs 73.0%, respectively (P = 0.0001). Inadequate maintenance of blood glucose was an independent predictor of distant recurrence [adjusted relative risk 1.97 (95%CI, 1.33-2.91), (P = 0.0007)] after adjustment for other risk factors, such as number of HCC nodules [2.03 (95%CI, 1.51-2.73), P Conclusion:Inadequate maintenance of blood glucose in diabetic patients is a significant risk factor for recurrence of HCC and for poor survival after curative RFA therapy.
