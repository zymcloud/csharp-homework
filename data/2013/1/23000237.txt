Background & aims:Yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization is a microembolic procedure. Hence, it is commonly used in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with portal venous thrombosis (PVT). We analyzed liver function, imaging findings, and treatment options (local/systemic) at disease progression following (90)Y treatment in HCC patients with PVT.Methods:We treated 291 HCC patients with (90)Y radioembolization. From this cohort, we included patients with liver-only disease, PVT and Child-Pugh (CP) score â‰¤ 7; this identified 63 patients with HCC and PVT (CP-A:35, CP-B7:27). Liver function, CP status, and imaging findings at progression were determined in order to assess potential candidacy for systemic treatment/clinical trials. Survival, time-to-progression (TTP), and time-to-hepatic decompensation analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier methodology.Results:Of 35 CP-A and 28 CP-B7 patients, 29 and 15 progressed, respectively. Median survival and TTP were 13.8 and 5.6 months in CP-A and 6.5 and 4.9 months in CP-B7 patients, respectively. Of the 29 CP-A patients who progressed, 45% maintained their CP status at progression (55% decompensated to CP-B). Of the 15 CP-B7 patients who progressed, 20% improved to CP-A, 20% maintained their CP score and 60% decompensated.Conclusions:Knowledge of liver function and CP score of HCC with PVT progressing after (90)Y is critically relevant information, as these patients may be considered for systemic therapy/clinical trials. If a strict CP-A status is mandated, our study demonstrated that 64% of cases exhibited inadequate liver function and were ineligible for systemic therapy/clinical trials. An adjuvant approach using local therapy and systemic agents prior to progression should be investigated.
