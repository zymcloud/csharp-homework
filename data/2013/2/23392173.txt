We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of sorafenib and SC-59, a novel sorafenib derivative, on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib activated autophagy in a dose- and time-dependent manner in the HCC cell lines PLC5, Sk-Hep1, HepG2 and Hep3B. Sorafenib downregulated phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT3) and subsequently reduced the expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Inhibition of Mcl-1 by sorafenib resulted in disruption of the Beclin 1-Mcl-1 complex; however, sorafenib did not affect the amount of Beclin 1, suggesting that sorafenib treatment released Beclin 1 from binding with Mcl-1. Silencing of SHP-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) reduced the effect of sorafenib on P-STAT3 and autophagy. Ectopic expression of Mcl-1 abolished the effect of sorafenib on autophagy. Knockdown of Beclin 1 by siRNA protected the cells from sorafenib-induced autophagy. Moreover, SC-59, a sorafenib derivative, had a more potent effect on cancer cell viability than sorafenib. SC-59 downregulated P-STAT3 and induced autophagy in all tested HCC cell lines. Furthermore, our in vivo data showed that both sorafenib and SC-59 inhibited tumor growth, downregulated P-STAT3, enhanced the activity of SHP-1 and induced autophagy in PLC5 tumors, suggesting that sorafenib and SC-59 activate autophagy in HCC. In conclusion, sorafenib and SC-59 induce autophagy in HCC through a SHP-1-STAT3-Mcl-1-Beclin 1 pathway.
