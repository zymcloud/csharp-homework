A novel flavonyl-thiazolidinedione based organoselenocyanate compound was synthesized and established as nontoxic at the doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg b.w. in mice. Oral administration of the compound in combination with cyclophosphamide (CP) resulted in an improved therapeutic efficacy which was mostly evidenced in terms of tumor burden and protection of normal cells. The adjuvant therapy was proved to be immensely significant in increasing the mean survivability of the tumor bearing hosts. Reduction in the tumor volume was manifested through the induction of apoptosis and generation of ROS in transformed cells. Moreover, the organoselenium compound could efficiently suppress CP-induced DNA damage, chromosomal aberration, hepatic damage and enhanced the activities of various antioxidant enzymes in normal cells.
