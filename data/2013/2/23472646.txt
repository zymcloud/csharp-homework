Background:The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a new tool (the hepatic section vascular blocker, HSVB) with hepatic pedicle clamping and hemihepatic vascular exclusion to control bleeding during liver resection for cancer.Methods:Clinical data on 117 patients who underwent liver resection from 2004 to 2009 were analysed retrospectively. Forty-two patients had liver resection using the HSVB (group A), in 35 patients hemihepatic vascular exclusion was used (group B), and in 40 patients hepatic pedicle clamping with a Pringle manoeuvre was used (group C). Blood loss, operative time, postoperative hepatic function and complications were compared.Results:Mean blood loss and operative time in group A were significantly less than in groups B (p=0.026 and pConclusions:Using the HSVB during liver resection effectively controlled bleeding, saved operative time and preserved hepatic function. It proved to be a safe and feasible technique.
