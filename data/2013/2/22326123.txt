We report an extremely rare case of combined small cell carcinoma (combined SmCC) of the hypopharynx. A 73-year-old male presented with multiple left neck swellings for 1 month. A tumorous lesion was found in the left pyriform sinus, and biopsy revealed that the lesion was squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). Surgery was performed and pathological examination led to a diagnosis as combined SmCC, composed of SqCC and small cell carcinoma (SmCC). One month after surgery, a contrast-CT indicated metastases to the cervical lymph node (LN), mediastinum and liver. We performed 5 courses of chemotherapy with the use of cisplatin (CDDP) and irinotecan (CPT-11). The patient temporarily showed a favorable response to the chemotherapy; however, eventually he died of regrowth of the tumor. Combined SmCC is a disease with a poor prognosis. Although biopsy sometimes fails to detect the SmCC component, intensive diagnosis and treatment are necessary.
