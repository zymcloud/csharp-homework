Aim:This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether interferon (IFN) therapy could improve clinical effects of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection-related primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery.Methods:An electronic search from January 1998 to December 2012 was conducted to identify comparative studies evaluating IFN therapy on recurrence and survival after surgical treatment of HCC.Results:The estimated odds ratios (OR) for the 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates of HBV-related HCC were 3.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-6.27), 2.36 (95% CI, 1.45-3.83), 1.81 (95% CI, 1.21-2.72) and 1.93 (95% CI, 1.35-2.75), respectively; and the OR for the 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year recurrence rates were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.44-0.91), 0.84 (95% CI, 0.60-1.18), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.63-1.22) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.56-1.07), respectively. The overall survival rates of HCV-related HCC were significantly higher in IFN groups than in control groups at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 0.96-4.55; OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.01-2.89; OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.09-2.83; and OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.97-4.65, respectively); and the recurrence rates of IFN groups were lower than control groups at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.92; OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.81; OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41-0.80; and OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36-0.75, respectively).Conclusion:In conclusion, IFN therapy in this meta-analysis shows a significant clinical effect in postoperative patients of HCC, particularly in HCV-related HCC.
