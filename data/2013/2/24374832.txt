Purpose:To establish a prognostic prediction system for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exceeding Milan criteria after liver transplantation (LT).Methods:A total of 130 patients undergoing LT for HCC exceeding Milan criteria were enrolled into the study. Independent predictors for relapse-free survival (RFS) were adopted to establish a grading system to predict the risk of post-LT tumor recurrence.Results:Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that tumor size >10 cm [vs. ≤ 5 cm: relative risk (RR) = 4.214, P 400 ng/ml (vs. ≤ 400 ng/ml: RR = 1.657, P 6. RFS rates of patients with grade I-IV (n = 35, 46, 30 and 19) were 87.5, 57.8, 34.7 and 0 % in 1 year; and 74.4, 41.7, 14.4 and 0 % in 5 years. Both of overall survival (OS) and RFS correlated well with the risk index grade. Patients with grade I achieved comparable prognostic outcomes with the Milan group patients (n = 119) (5-year OS = 73.7 vs. 74.7 %, P = 0.748; 5-year RFS = 74.4 vs. 85.7 %, P = 0.148).Conclusions:The new grading system was proved to be a promising system in predicting the patient prognosis after LT for HCC exceeding Milan criteria.
