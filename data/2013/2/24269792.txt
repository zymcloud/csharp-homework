Purpose:To assess a new method for generating patient-specific volumetric dose calculations and analyze the relationship between tumor dose and positron emission tomography (PET) response after radioembolization of hepatic melanoma metastases.Methods and materials:Yttrium-90 ((90)Y) bremsstrahlung single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) acquired after (90)Y radioembolization was convolved with published (90)Y Monte Carlo estimated dose deposition kernels to create a three-dimensional dose distribution. Dose-volume histograms were calculated for tumor volumes manually defined from magnetic resonance imaging or PET/CT imaging. Tumor response was assessed by absolute reduction in maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG).Results:Seven patients with 30 tumors treated with (90)Y for hepatic metastatic melanoma with available (90)Y SPECT/CT and PET/CT before and after treatment were identified for analysis. The median (range) for minimum, mean, and maximum dose per tumor volume was 16.9 Gy (5.7-43.5 Gy), 28.6 Gy (13.8-65.6 Gy) and 36.6 Gy (20-124 Gy), respectively. Response was assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT at a median time after treatment of 2.8 months (range, 1.2-7.9 months). Mean tumor dose (P = .03) and the percentage of tumor volume receiving â‰¥ 50 Gy (P Conclusions:Volumetric dose calculations showed a statistically significant association with metabolic tumor response. The significant dose-response relationship points to the clinical utility of patient-specific absorbed dose calculations for radionuclide therapy.
