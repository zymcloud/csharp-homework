Purpose:Large epidemiologic studies about the relationship between benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been limited. B[a]P diol epoxide (BPDE) is a highly reactive metabolite of B[a]P that binds covalently to form DNA adducts. We evaluated the interaction between B[a]P exposure with other risk factors in HCC, in a case-control study of 345 HCC and 961 healthy controls.Methods:Concentration of BPDE-DNA adducts in blood was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The interaction between BPDE-DNA adducts and other risk factors on HCC were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results:Mean concentration of BPDE-DNA adducts in blood of cases was significantly higher than that of the controls. The risk of HCC increased with elevated concentration of BPDE-DNA adducts (x(2) = 203.57, Ptrend Conclusions:The high level of BPDE-DNA adducts in blood is associated with HCC and that environmental exposure to B[a]P may increase the risk of HCC, especially among drinkers and populations with hepatitis B virus infection.
