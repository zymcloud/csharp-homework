Purpose:This prospective study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of TACE using irinotecan loaded superabsorbent polymer (SAP) microspheres for treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases (CCLM) in a salvage setting of patients.Methods:A total of 71 TACE procedures were performed in 29 patients with liver only or liver-dominant CCLM. In all patients, systemic chemotherapy before TACE had failed. Two hundred milligrams of irinotecan were loaded into 50-100 mg of SAP microspheres (HepaSphereâ„¢ Microspheres) considering tumor size and vascularization. TACE was performed selectively with respect to tumor distribution. Response was evaluated following RECIST and EASL criteria, respectively. Median follow-up after last TACE was 8 (range 1-54) months. All patients had died at time of analysis.Results:All TACE procedures were performed successfully; 35-400 mg (mean 168.3 mg) of irinotecan loaded in 13-100 mg (mean 48.3 mg) SAP microspheres were injected during individual sessions. No major complications occurred. Three, 6, and 12 months after first TACE complete and partial response was present in 72, 32 %, 0 of patients by EASL criteria and stable disease was seen in 86, 48, and 8 % with no complete and no partial response by RECIST criteria. Median overall survival after first TACE was 8 months, and median time to progression was 5 months. Median overall survival was longer in patients with limited (<25 %) compared with extensive (>50 %) intrahepatic disease (21 vs. 5 months, p < 0.005).Conclusions:TACE using irinotecan loaded SAP microspheres is safe and effective in terms of tumor necrosis. Survival benefit in a salvage setting seems to be limited in patients with advanced intrahepatic tumor load.
