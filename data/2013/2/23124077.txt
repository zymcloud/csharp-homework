The hepatitis B virus x (HBx) protein has been implicated in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis. However, whether HBx regulates miRNA expression that plays important roles in gene regulation during hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. The expression of microRNA-101 (miR-101) in HBV-related HCC tissues and HCC cells was evaluated by real-time PCR. The direct target of miR-101, DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), was identified in silico and validated using a 3'-UTR reporter assay. miR-101 was functionally characterized in cells with transiently altered miR-101 expression. HBx expression was found to have a significant inverse correlation with miR-101 expression in HBx-expressing HepG2 compared to control HepG2 cells. miR-101 expression was frequently down-regulated in HBV-related HCC tissues compared to adjacent noncancerous hepatic tissues and had a significant inverse correlation with DNMT3A expression in HBV-related HCCs. Further characterization of miR-101 revealed that it negatively regulated DNA methylation partly through targeting DNMT3A. HBx-mediated miR-101 down-regulation and DNMT3A up-regulation supported the enhanced DNA methylation of several tumor-suppressor genes in HBx-expressing cells. Our studies demonstrating the deregulation of miR-101 expression by HBx may provide novel mechanistic insights into HBV-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis and identify a potential miRNA-based targeted approach for treating HBV-related HCC.
