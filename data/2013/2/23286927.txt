The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is expected to rise along with the global obesity epidemic. As NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, it has become a major health concern. It affects all ethnicities, with the highest prevalence among the Hispanic population. Individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more serious form of NAFLD, are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since NAFLD is intricately associated with the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality become a real concern. It has recently been shown that current nutrition trends, such as increased consumption of high-fructose corn syrup and certain types of fats, may have an important role in the increased NAFLD prevalence. As there are no ideal treatment options available for NAFLD, a multifaceted treatment approach should be tailored to each individual patient.
