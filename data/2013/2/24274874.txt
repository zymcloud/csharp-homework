Obesity is an established risk factor for many types of cancers, particularly for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), owing to its carcinogenic potential and the association with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). HCC may develop in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic livers with NAFLD, particularly in the presence of multiple metabolic risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. This issue is alarming because the population potentially at higher risk is greatly increasing. This review summarizes current evidence linking obesity and liver cancer, and discusses recent advances on the mechanisms underlying this relationship.
