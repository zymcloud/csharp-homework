Objectives:To investigate the volumetric iodine-uptake (VIU) changes by dual-energy CT (DECT) in assessing the response to sorafenib treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, compared with AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) and Choi criteria.Materials and methods:Fifteen patients with HCC receiving sorafenib, monitored with contrast-enhanced DECT scans at baseline and a minimum of one follow-up (8-12 weeks) were retrospectively evaluated. 30 target lesions in total were analyzed for tumor response according to VIU and adapted Choi criteria and compared with the standard AASLD.Results:According to AASLD criteria, 67% target lesions showed disease control: partial response (PR) in 3% and stable disease (SD) in 63%. 33% lesions progressed (PD). Disease control rate presented by VIU (60%) was similar to AASLD (67%) and Choi (63%) (P>0.05). For disease control group, change in mean VIU was from 149.5 ± 338.3mg to 108.5 ± 284.1mg (decreased 19.1 ± 42.9%); and for progressive disease group, change in mean VIU was from 163.7 ± 346.7 mg to 263.9 ± 537.2 mg (increased 230.5 ± 253.1%). Compared to AASLD (PR, 3%), VIU and Choi presented more PR (33% and 30%, respectively) in disease control group (PConclusion:VIU measurements by DECT can evaluate the disease control consistent with the current standard AASLD. Measurements are semi-automatic and therefore easy and robust to apply. As VIU reflects vital tumor burden in HCC, it is likely to be an optimal tumor response biomarker in HCC.
