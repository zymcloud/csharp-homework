Scope:Metabolic genotypes of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and folate status on oxidative DNA lesions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been elucidated. The aims of the study were to investigate the folate-polymorphic interactions on genetic oxidative damage in association with advanced HCC malignancy and prognosis.Methods and results:The study included 232 HCC patients with folate nutrition, MTHFR C677T polymorphic, p53 genetic and tumour pathological data collected and analyzed for their survivals after a 7.8-years following up. By adjustment for oxidative risk factors of HCC, the compound CT and TT genotypes in relative to the CC wild-type were associated with 83% reduced lymphocytic p53 oxidative lesions of HCC patients with RBC folate lower than 688 ng/mL (OR: 0.17, 95%CI: 0.07-0.43). Such genetic protective effects by the CT/TT genotypes were 2-fold enhanced among those with high RBC folate (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.03-0.21, P for interaction Conclusion:Our data demonstrated that reduced MTHFR activities associated with the MTHFR T allele may interact with RBC folate as the risk modifiers of lymphocytic p53 oxidative lesions of HCC patients. The CT/TT genotypes correlated with lower risks of late-stage HCC and a favorable survival of HCC patients, depending on p53 oxidative lesions or RBC folate status.
