The expression and implication of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in residual hepatic tumor cells after lipiodol embolization were investigated. Two weeks after transplantation of VX2 tumor cells into the livers of rabbits, a xenograft model of the human hepatic neoplasm was successfully established. Forty rabbits were randomly divided into control group (n=20) and lipiodol group (n=20). For the control group, 1 mL normal saline was injected through the gastroduodenal artery, whereas 0.3 mL/kg lipiodol was applied for the lipiodol group. One week after embolization, the expression level of VEGF in the plasma was measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A three-step immunohistochemical technique (ABC) was employed to detect the protein levels of VEGF and MMP-9 and the quantitative PCR for their mRNA levels was performed in the residual tumor cells. The VEGF in the plasma was significantly higher in the lipiodol group (1.42±0.29 ng/mL) than in the control group (1.12±0.21 ng/mL) (P
