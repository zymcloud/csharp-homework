Numerous studies have documented that in cancer therapy flavonoids extracted from traditional Chinese medicine have anti-tumor activity or can enhance efficiency of chemotherapy in combination with chemotherapeutics. Thus, an awareness of flavonoids is needed by physicians and medical researchers. This review provides evidence about anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity of flavonoids. First, as a common employed in vitro model, profile of HepG2 is shown. Second, the intracellular signaling pathways induced by flavonoids which inhibit the HepG2 cell line are summarized. Third, study situation of anti-HBV/HCV activity of flavonoids is shown. Our review is aimed at providing an understanding of anti-HBV/HCV activity and anti-HCC mechanisms of flavonoids, and an outlook on flavonoids application on cancer therapy.
