Introduction:We report our experience with laparoscopic major liver resection in Korea based on a multicenter retrospective study.Materials and methods:Data from 1,009 laparoscopic liver resections conducted from 2001 to 2011 were retrospectively collected. Twelve tertiary medical centers with specialized hepatic surgeons participated in this study.Results:Among 1,009 laparoscopic liver resections, major liver resections were performed in 265 patients as treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic tumor, intrahepatic duct stone, and other conditions. The most frequently performed procedure was left hemihepatectomy (165 patients), followed by right hemihepatectomy (53 patients). Pure laparoscopic procedure was performed in 190 patients including 19 robotic liver resections. Hand-assisted laparoscopic liver resection was performed in three patients and laparoscopy-assisted liver resection in 55 patients. Open conversion was performed in 17 patients (6.4 %). Mean operative time and estimated blood loss in laparoscopic major liver resection was 399.3 ± 169.8 min and 836.0 ± 1223.7 ml, respectively. Intraoperative transfusion was required in 65 patients (24.5 %). Mean postoperative length of stay was 12.3 ± 7.9 days. Postoperative complications were detected in 53 patients (20.0 %), and in-hospital mortality occurred in two patients (0.75 %). Mean number and mean maximal size of resected tumors was 1.22 ± 1.54 and 40.0 ± 27.8 mm, respectively. R0 resection was achieved in 120 patients with hepatic tumor, but R1 resection was performed in eight patients. Mean distance of safe resection margin was 14.6 ± 15.8 mm.Conclusions:Laparoscopic major liver resection has become a reliable option for treatment of liver disease in Korea.
