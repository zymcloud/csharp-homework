Background:The purpose of the present study was to analyze long-term survival and disease-free survival after liver resection for giant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) â‰¥ 10 cm compared to HCC Methods:This retrospective analysis was a monocentric study conducted in a tertiary university center. It included 101 patients from 114 consecutive liver resections for HCC, separated into two groups: those with tumors less than 10 cm in diameter (small HCC; n = 79) and those with tumors larger than 10 cm (giant HCC; n = 22). The main outcome measures were overall five-year survival, five-year disease-free survival, recurrence rate, perioperative mortality at 30 days, surgical complication rate, and re-intervention rate.Results:The two groups were homogeneously distributed, apart from cirrhosis, which was found more frequently in the group with small HCC (77 vs. 41 %; p = 0.0013). Both median survival (24 vs. 27 months; p = 0.0085) and overall 5-year survival (21 vs. 45; p = 0.04) were significantly poorer in the small HCC group compared to the giant HCC group. There were no differences en terms of recurrence rate, pattern, and timing.Conclusions:Liver resection for HCC larger than 10 cm is a valuable option in selected patients, one that provides overall survival and disease-free survival comparable to smaller lesions. Functional reserves of the liver, more than the size of the lesion, may be important in patient selection for surgical resection.
