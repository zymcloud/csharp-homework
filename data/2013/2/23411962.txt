A 65-year-old man with dysphagia and hoarseness was admitted to our hospital. The upper gastrointestinal examinations revealed a tumor in the lower esophagus while the biopsy specimens revealed squamous cell carcinoma. The clinical diagnosis was esophageal cancer(Lt, type 2, cT3N4M0, cStage IVa). The patient underwent neoadjuvant-chemotherapy(5-fluorouracil/cisplatin). After one course, computed tomography(CT)showed rapid growth of the tumor and lymph nodes, resulting in a progressive disease. It was considered unresectable because of the direct invasion of the No. 1 lymph node to the liver. Then, three courses of docetaxel were administered as second-line chemotherapy, and CT revealed the markedly reduced size of the tumor and lymph nodes, resulting in a partial response. The tumor was now thought to be resectable. Subtotal esophagectomy could be performed and the postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological findings showed no evidence of malignancy at the primary tumor(grade 3), although there were residual atypical keratinocytes in some lymph nodes. The patient is doing well without any signs of recurrence 21 months after the surgery.
