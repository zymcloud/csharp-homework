Portal vein embolization (PVE) is an established therapy used to redirect portal blood flow away from the tumor-bearing liver to the anticipated future liver remnant (FLR) and usually results in FLR hypertrophy. PVE is indicated when the FLR is considered too small before surgery to support essential function after surgery. When appropriately applied, PVE reduces postoperative morbidity and increases the number of patients eligible for curative hepatic resection. PVE also has been combined with other therapies to improve patient outcomes. This article assesses more recent outcomes data regarding PVE, reviews the existing controversies, and reports on novel strategies currently being investigated.
