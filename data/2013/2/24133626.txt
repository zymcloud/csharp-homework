We previously reported that human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines refractory to cis-diaminedichloro-platinum II (cisplatin [CDDP]) had significant upregulation of the phosphodiesterase 3B gene (PDE3B), suggesting that inhibiting PDE3B suppresses CDDP resistance. shRNA-mediated PDE3B depletion in CDDP-resistant cells derived from SCC cells and Hela cells and induced CDDP sensitivity and inhibited tumor growth with elevated cyclic GMP induction resulting in upregulation of the multidrug-resistant molecule, but this did not occur in the 5-fluorouracil-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, the antitumor growth effect of the combination of a PDE3B inhibitor (cilostazol) and CDDP in vivo was also greater than with either cilostazol or CDDP alone, with a significant increase in the number of apoptotic and cell growth-suppressive cancer cells in CDDP-resistance cell lines. Our results provided novel information on which to base further mechanistic studies of CDDP sensitization by inhibiting PDE3B in human cancer cells and for developing strategies to improve outcomes with concurrent chemotherapy.
