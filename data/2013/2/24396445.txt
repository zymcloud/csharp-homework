Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique used to treat liver tumors. The current study presents the case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma who suffered from post-operative pericardial effusion following RFA treatment. We hypothesize that RFA thermal conduction may damage the diaphragm and pericardium, leading to local edema in the pericardium. RFA is a minimally invasive technique, however, adequate preparatory work must be performed prior to surgery, including a comprehensive assessment of the patient. During surgery, the location and extent of the region to receive RFA must be determined precisely in order to reduce the range of damage and to avoid post-operative complications. This study describes a case of pericardial effusion caused by RFA of liver cancer. We analyzed the causes and preventive measures for pericardial effusion in order to contribute to the prevention pericardial effusion that is complicated by RFA of liver cancer.
