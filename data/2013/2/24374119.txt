This report describes the morphological and immunohistochemical features of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies found in a 13-year-old Yorkshire dog with a hepatocellular carcinoma and referred for anorexia, lethargy and mild polydipsia. Fine-needle aspirates of the large abdominal mass revealed high number of pleomorphic neoplastic hepatocytes, containing round to polygonal, well-demarcated, hyaline bodies. Same findings were histologically confirmed on multiple biopsies. Immunohistochemically, the inclusion bodies were negative for alpha-1-antitrypsin, carcinoembryonary antigen, fibrinogen, IgG, IgM, cytokeratins 7, 8, 18, 19, 20. By transmission electron microscopy, the cytoplasmic inclusions were composed of granular homogeneous or reticulated electrondense matrix, enclosed within dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum or remnants of its membranes, consistent with proteinaceous material accumulated within neoplastic hepatocytes due to aberrant protein secretion or transport. This is the first detailed characterization of hyaline cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in canine hepatocellular carcinoma.
