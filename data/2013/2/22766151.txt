Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the first malignant hepatic tumor in frequency, with an incidence of 10 new cases per 100,000 people a year, in France. HCC metastasis disseminate hematogenously. The most frequent metastatic sites are lungs, bones, and liver.Patients and methods:We detail the approach to diagnosis and the treatment of a patient with an unusual late recurrence of HCC, which was discovered fortuitously. The metastasis was located in the subcutaneous tissue of the right gluteal fold.Conclusion:This case poses a problem of detection in the clinical practice. Indeed, the recurrence occurred 9 years after the HCC. Molecular analysis of our case could make us progress in our knowledge of this disease, and to associate it to a patient's group with similar HCC evolutive profile.
