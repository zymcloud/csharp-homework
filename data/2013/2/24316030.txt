Interleukin (IL)28-B polymorphism has been related to interferon response in the treatment of hepatitis C, but its role in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) therapy is still poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the effect of IL28-B polymorphisms in the treatment with pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) of patients with CHB. We retrospectively analyzed 190 patients with chronic hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative, genotype A (22%), B (12%), C (10%), D (33%), E (20%), treated with PEG-IFN alfa-2a for 48weeks; genotype analysis was performed for IL28-B polymorphisms rs12979860, rs8099917 and rs12980275 according to virological, serological and biochemical response. During 2years of follow-up 12 patients (6.3%) cleared hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with seroconversion, 40 (21%) obtained a negative viral load and 104 (54.7%) gained a biochemical response. We found a difference of distribution of rs12979860 CC genotype among different ethnicity (p=0.013). Rs12979860 CC genotype was significantly associated with serological and virological response (p
