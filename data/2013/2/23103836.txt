Aberrant cell-surface glycosylation patterns are present on tumors and have been linked to tumor progression. This study aimed to identify the alterations of glycogene and N-glycan involved in tumor invasion, tumorigenicity and drug resistance in MHCC97-H and MHCC97-L human hepatocarcinoma cell lines, which have high, low metastatic potential, respectively. Using real-time PCR for quantification of glycogene and FITC-lectin binding for glycan profiling, we found that the expression of glycogenes and glycan profiling were different in MHCC97-H cells, as compared to those in MHCC97-L cells. We silenced the expression levels of glycogenes MGAT3 and MGAT5, which were over-expressed in MHCC97-L and MHCC97-H cells. Knockdown of MGAT3 expression promoted MHCC97-L cells invasion and increased resistance to 5-fluorouracil in vitro. The silencing of MGAT5 in MHCC97-H cells inhibited invasion and increased sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil in vitro. Further analysis of the N-glycan regulation by tunicamycin application or PNGase F treatment in MHCC97-H and MHCC97-L cells showed partial inhibition of N-glycan glycosylation, decreased invasion, tumorigenicity and increased sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that alterations of glycogene and N-glycan in human hepatocarcinoma cells correlate with tumor invasion, tumorigenicity and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug, and have significant implications for the development of treatment strategies.
