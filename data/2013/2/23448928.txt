Recently, a 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism (+14 bp/-14 bp) in exon 8 of the human leucocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) gene has been widely recognized to associate with recurrent miscarriage, autoimmune diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma and other diseases. Our previous studies have shown the distribution characteristics of linguistic family for HLA-G 14 bp insertion/deletion in different ethnic groups. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of HLA-G 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism and their subsequent associations with HLA-A alleles in Tu, Yugu, Lisu and Nu ethnic populations based upon the HLA-A genotyping data. Our results showed that the frequencies of the 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism were diverse in these four populations while that in the same linguistic subfamily was similar. The significant difference in different linguistic subfamily except for Han and Mongolian language subfamily was identified. In addition, the 14 bp insertion was found to associate with HLA-A alleles in different ethnic populations.
