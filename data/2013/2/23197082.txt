Few data are available on the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in HIV-infected patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HIV-u-HCC) and concomitant highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Between July 2007 and October 2010, 27 consecutive HIV-u-HCC patients were treated with sorafenib and concomitant HAART within the Gruppo Italiano Cooperativo AIDS e Tumori (GICAT). Three patients achieved a partial response, 12 achieved a stable disease, and 12 showed progression. The median time to progression and overall survival was 5.1 (range 0.5-13.3) and 12.8 (range 1.1-23.5) months, respectively. Grades 3-4 toxicities included diarrhea (four patients, 14.8%), hypertension (three patients, 11%), and hand-and-foot skin reaction (four patients, 14.9%). Most drug-related side effects were low grade and manageable. This retrospective study shows favorable survival data among HIV-u-HCC patients treated with sorafenib together with a reasonable safety profile.
