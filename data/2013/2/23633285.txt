Purpose:To determine whether the presence of a hypovascular nodule in the liver showing hypointensity on hepatocyte-phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) is a risk factor for hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease.Materials and methods:Forty-one patients with pathologically confirmed hypervascular HCC and 41 age- and gender-matched controls were retrospectively selected. These patients had undergone EOB-MRI at least twice: the latest EOB-MRI and EOB-MRI performed more than 6 months earlier. History of hypervascular HCC, presence of a hypointense hypovascular nodule in previous hepatocyte-phase MR images, percent prothrombin time, platelet count, serum levels of albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, Î±-fetoprotein, and protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA-II) were variables evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results:Multivariate analysis revealed that serum albumin level (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.19 [0.06-0.57]; P = 0.0024), history of hypervascular HCC (8.62 [2.71-32.8]; P = 0.0001), and presence of a hypointense hypovascular nodule (4.18 [1.18-17.2]; P = 0.0256) were significant risk factors for hypervascular HCC.Conclusion:Patients with chronic liver disease showing a hypointense hypovascular nodule in the liver on hepatocyte-phase EOB-MRI have a high risk of HCC development.
