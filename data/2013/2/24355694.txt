Background and aims:Trans-hepatic arterial chemo-embolization is the most commonly used treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognostic impact of tumor biomarkers has not therefore been evaluated in this treatment. Imbalance between matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-2 is considered to play an important role in extracellular matrix remodeling and degradation. Higher serum levels of MMP-2 have been shown to predict a poor prognosis and shorter overall survival in HCC after TACE. The objective of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in HCC patients before and after TACE to evaluate their clinical significance and usefulness as prognostic biomarkers.Methods:MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels were measured by ELISA in 75 HCC patients and 30 healthy controls. Sera MMP-2 and TIMP-2 were correlated with clinico-pathological features.Results:The mean serum MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels of HCC patients before TACE were 1700±71ng/mL and 89±45ng/mL respectively, significantly higher than that of the control group: 771±60ng/mL (p1500ng/mL (median value) had worse overall and recurrence-free survival compared with those with serum MMP-2 levels Conclusion:Higher serum MMP-2 levels and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio could predict poor prognosis after TACE, suggesting prognostic role of these biomarkers in HCC.
