DENND2D was identified as being down-regulated in lung cancer using a lung cancer low-expression suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) library. In this study, DENND2D down-regulation has been observed not only in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tissues, but also in immortalized human bronchial epithelial (IHBE) cell lines and precancerous lesions, indicating that the down-regulation of DENND2D may be an early event in lung cancer. The relative DNA copy number and mRNA and protein expression levels of DENND2D were determined in vitro, and they revealed a complicated regulatory network at the genomic, transcriptional and translational levels. Over-expression of DENND2D significantly suppressed the proliferation of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis. These results indicate that DENND2D might function as a tumor suppressor-like gene to prevent the survival and expansion of cells with genetic damage through apoptosis mechanism, and absence of DENND2D might play a permissive role, as an early event, in tumorigenesis.
