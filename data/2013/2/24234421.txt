Vitamin A status regulates obesity development, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic lipogenic gene expression in Zucker fatty (ZF) rats. The development of hyperlipidemia in acne patients treated with retinoic acid (RA) has been attributed to the induction of apolipoprotein C-III expression. To understand the role of retinoids in the development of hyperlipidemia in ZF rats, the expression levels of several selected RA-responsive genes in the liver and isolated hepatocytes from Zucker lean (ZL) and ZF rats were compared using real-time PCR. The Rarb and Srebp-1c mRNA levels are higher in the liver and isolated hepatocytes from ZF than ZL rats. The Apoc3 mRNA level is only higher in the isolated hepatocytes from ZF than ZL rats. To determine whether dynamic RA production acutely regulates Apoc3 expression, its mRNA levels in response to retinoid treatments or adenovirus-mediated overexpression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) and chicken ovalbumin upstream-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) were analyzed. Retinoid treatments for 2-6 h did not induce the expression of Apoc3 mRNA. The overexpression of HNF4α or COUP-TFII induced or inhibited Apoc3 expression, respectively. We conclude that short-term retinoid treatments could not induce Apoc3 mRNA expression, which is regulated by HNF4α and COUP-TFII in hepatocytes.
