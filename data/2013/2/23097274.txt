Lin-41 is a stem cell-specific E3 ligase and a known target of the tumour suppressor microRNA (miRNA) let-7. Lin-41 was recently reported to mediate ubiquitylation and degradation of the miRNA pathway protein Ago2. We demonstrate that Lin-41 is over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Lin-41 over-expression correlates with high Î±-fetoprotein level, high tumour grade and high tumour stage and predicts early tumour recurrence. Lin-41 is a strong predictor of poor long-term survival for patients with HCC. Lin-41 knock-down by RNA interference in HCC cell lines Huh7 and Hep3B suppressed proliferation in vitro and reduced in vivo tumour growth in NOD/SCID mice. On the other hand, over-expression of Lin-41 in the HCC cell line SK-Hep1 enhanced tumourigenicity. Over-expression and knock-down of Lin-41 led to inverse changes in the levels of Ago1 and Ago2 proteins. Over-expression of Ago1 and Ago2 reduced in vivo tumour growth. Lin-41 over-expression suppressed let-7 activity in HCC cell lines and expression of Lin-41 enhanced the expression of let-7-regulated oncogenes c-Myc, Lin-28B, HMGA2 and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R). Expression of Lin-28B and c-Myc enhanced the expression of Lin-41. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays revealed direct association of c-Myc with the Lin-41 promoter, resulting in transcriptional transactivation. Our results indicate that Lin-41 plays an important role in the growth of HCC by regulating RISC complex proteins Ago1 and Ago2 to inhibit miRNA-mediated gene silencing and promote the expression of oncogenic proteins. Lin-41 is also a strong prognostic factor for patients with HCC.
