Objectives:Benign liver tumours (BLTs) are common and their management remains controversial. This study assesses the safety of a selective management approach.Methods:Patients with BLT were identified from an institutional database. Patients with simple cysts or an incidental BLT in the setting of metastasis or concomitant malignancy were excluded.Results:A total of 285 patients presenting during the period from January 1992 to December 2009 with haemangioma (53.0%), focal nodular hyperplasia (23.9%), adenoma (10.2%) or indeterminate/other lesions (13.0%) were evaluated. Of these, 117 patients (41.1%) underwent immediate resection and 168 patients (58.9%) were followed with serial imaging (median follow-up: 30 months). During observation, eight patients (4.8%) underwent resection for tumour growth, inability to exclude malignancy or symptoms; no patients demonstrated malignant transformation or tumour-related complications. During the study period, the number of BLTs evaluated and the proportion of patients observed increased from 129 BLTs of which 36.4% were observed in 1992-2002 to 156 BLTs of which 71.2% were observed in 2003-2009 (P < 0.001). Diagnostic uncertainty led to resection in 29.5% of patients during the earlier period, but in only 13.4% during the more recent 7 years (P < 0.05).Conclusions:Asymptomatic BLTs without concern for malignancy or adenoma can be safely observed with minimal risk for misdiagnosis. Patients selected for observation rarely require resection or develop tumour-related complications.
