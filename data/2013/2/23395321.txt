The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the UK is increasing. The role of interventional radiology in the treatment of HCC is well established. We discuss the minimally invasive treatment options that are available. It is important that procedures are undertaken in and postprocedure imaging is reviewed by centers with accredited hepatobiliary units. This is when the best outcomes are achieved. Advances in tumor biology and in technology will continue to expand the role of interventional radiology in the treatment of HCC in the future.
