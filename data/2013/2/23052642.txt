Objective:To determine the measurement reproducibility of perfusion fraction f, pseudodiffusion coefficient D and diffusion coefficient D in colorectal liver metastases and normal liver.Methods:Fourteen patients with known colorectal liver metastases were examined twice using respiratory-triggered echo-planar DW-MRI with eight b values (0 to 900 s/mm(2)) 1 h apart. Regions of interests were drawn around target metastasis and normal liver in each patient to derive ADC (all b values), ADC(high) (b values â‰¥ 100 s/mm(2)) and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters f, D and D by least squares data fitting. Short-term measurement reproducibility of median ADC, ADC(high), f, D and D values were derived from Bland-Altman analysis.Results:The measurement reproducibility for ADC, ADC(high) and D was worst in colorectal liver metastases (-21 % to +25 %) compared with liver parenchyma (-6 % to +8 %). Poor measurement reproducibility was observed for the perfusion-sensitive parameters of f (-75 % to +241 %) and D (-89 % to +2,120 %) in metastases, and to a lesser extent the f (-24 % to +25 %) and D (-31 % to +59 %) of liver.Conclusions:Estimates of f and D derived from the widely used least squares IVIM fitting showed poor measurement reproducibility. Efforts should be made to improve the measurement reproducibility of perfusion-sensitive IVIM parameters.
