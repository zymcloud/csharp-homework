Purpose:To assess factors associated with better overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) following chemoembolization with doxorubicin-eluting microspheres for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 130 patients (104 men; median age, 62 y) with inoperable HCC who underwent successful DEB chemoembolization with 100-300 -μm LC Bead particles loaded with 50 mg doxorubicin per vial were reviewed following human research committee approval. Effects of various clinical, imaging, and response factors on OS and PFS were assessed by univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Multiple Cox regression with backward elimination was performed for terms found significant (P ≤ .05) on univariate analysis.Results:The number of DEB chemoembolization procedures per patient ranged from one to four (mean, 2 ± 1). The median PFS and OS were 5.7 months (95% confidence interval, 4.6-7.6 mo) and 14.7 months (95% confidence interval, 12.3-19.7 mo), respectively. On multivariate Cox regression, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score of 1 or lower, necrosis of more than 50%, and response or stable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors after DEB chemoembolization were associated with better PFS. CLIP score of 1 or lower, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 1 or lower, absence of portal vein (PV) thrombosis, and necrosis greater than 50% following DEB chemoembolization were associated with better OS.Conclusions:CLIP score of 1 or lower and necrosis of more than 50% are independent variables affecting PFS and OS after DEB chemoembolization, whereas absence of PV thrombosis and ECOG PS of 1 or lower affected OS but not PFS.
