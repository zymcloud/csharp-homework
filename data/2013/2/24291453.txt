Significant cytotoxic effects of procynadins from chestnut (Castanea mollissima Bl.) shell (CSPC) on human hepatoma G2 (HepG2) cells were found in vitro. CSPC could inbibit HepG2 proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (100-400 μg/mL), arrest cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, induce apoptosis and trigger necrosis of HepG2. Proapoptotic effect of CSPC was evidenced by nuclear condensation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Treatment of HepG2 cells with CSPC caused a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and stimulated reactive oxidative species (ROS) generation. These results suggested CSPC could trigger apoptosis and necrotic cell death in HepG2 cell, which might be associated with ROS generation through the mitochondria-dependent signaling way.
