Purpose:Increasing lines of evidence have suggested that adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, plays an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the relationship between genetic variants of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and HCC has not been previously explored. Therefore, we performed a case-control study to examine the association of haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ with HCC risk.Methods:Five haplotype-tagging SNPs of ADIPOQ (rs266729, rs822395, rs822396, rs2241766 and rs1501299) were genotyped in 200 HCC patients and 200 non-HCC controls by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of HCC associated with each individual SNP and we adjusted for multiple testing by the Bonferroni correction.Results:Of the five tested SNPs, rs1501299 showed a strong and significant association with HCC risk even after the Bonferroni correction. After adjusting for the serological status of the hepatitis virus B core antibody and for other SNPs, the odds ratios were 4.33 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.07-9.05; corrected P Conclusions:This is the first report, demonstrating an association of ADIPOQ polymorphisms with HCC risk. Our results implicate the ADIPOQ SNP rs1501299 as a susceptibility locus for HCC.
