The roles of intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (IKCa1) in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were investigated. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of IKCa1 protein in 50 HCC and 20 para-carcinoma tissue samples. Real-time PCR was used to detect the transcription level of IKCa1 mRNA in 13 HCC and 11 para-carcinoma tissue samples. The MTT assay was used to measure the function of IKCa1 in human HCC cell line HepG2 in vitro. TRAM-34, a specific blocker of IKCa1, was used to intervene with the function of IKCa1. As compared with para-carcinoma tissue, an over-expression of IKCa1 protein was detected in HCC tissue samples (P
