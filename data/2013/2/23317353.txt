Few studies have investigated liver gluconeogenesis in cancer and there is no agreement as to whether the activity of this pathway is increased or decreased in this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate gluconeogenesis from alanine, pyruvate and glycerol, and related metabolic parameters in perfused liver from Walker-256 tumour-bearing rats on days 5 (WK5 group), 8 (WK8 group) and 12 (WK12 group) of tumour development. There was reduction (P < 0.05) of liver glucose production from alanine and pyruvate in WK5, WK8 and WK12 groups, which was accompanied by a decrease (P < 0.05) in oxygen consumption. Moreover, there was higher (P < 0.05) pyruvate and lactate production from alanine in the WK5 group and a marked reduction (P < 0.05) of pyruvate and urea production from alanine in the WK12 group. In addition, liver glucose production and oxygen consumption from glycerol were not reduced in WK5, WK8 and WK12 groups. Thus the, the results show inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis from alanine and pyruvate, but not from glycerol, on days 5, 8 and 12 of Walker-256 tumour development, which can be attributed to the metabolic step in which the substrate enters the gluconeogenic pathway.
