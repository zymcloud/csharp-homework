Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignant disease worldwide, and curative treatment remains difficult because the majority of cases are diagnosed in the advanced stage. Sorafenib is the only known effective systemic treatment, but patients rarely achieve complete remission (CR). A 66-year-old man with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis with a diagnosis of advanced HCC, was initially treated with transarterial chemoembolization on four occasions. However, the disease progressed with portal vein thrombosis. Therefore, sorafenib was started, and 4 mo later, the patient achieved CR. The treatment was continued for 12 mo, and CR was maintained up to 4 mo after sorafenib discontinuation.
Complete remission; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Portal vein thrombosis; Sorafenib.
