Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small and enveloped DNA virus, of which chronic infection is the main risk factor of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a multifunctional protein encoded by HBV genome, which have significant effects on HBV replication and pathogenesis. Through directly interacting with cellular proteins, HBx is capable to promote HBV replication, regulate transcription of host genes, disrupt protein degradation, modulate signaling pathway, manipulate cell death and deregulate cell cycle. In this review, we briefly discuss the diversified effects of HBx-interactome and their potential clinical significances.
