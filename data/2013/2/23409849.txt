Aim:Current guidelines recommended adequate nutritional support for patients with liver cirrhosis to improve clinical outcome and quality of life (QOL). However, these evidences were obtained more than 10 years ago when malnutrition prevailed. In recent years, the impact of obesity on liver damage and carcinogenesis has grown. We attempted to elucidate the nutritional state and QOL in present cirrhotics.Methods:A research group supported by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan recruited 294 cirrhotics between 2007 and 2011. Subjects comprised 171 males and 123 females, 158 of whom had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh grades A : B : C were 154:91:49. Anthropometry, blood biochemistry and indirect calorimetry were conducted, and QOL was measured using Short Form-8.Results:The mean body mass index (BMI) of all patients was 23.1 ± 3.4 kg/m(2) , and 31% showed obesity (BMI ≥ 25.0). In subjects without ascites, edema or HCC, mean BMI was 23.6 ± 3.6, and 34% had obesity. Protein malnutrition defined as serum albumin of less than 3.5 g/dL and energy malnutrition as respiratory quotient of less than 0.85 appeared in 61% and 43%, respectively, and protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in 27% of all subjects. Among subjects without HCC, each proportion was 67%, 48% and 30%, respectively. QOL was significantly lower on all subscales than Japanese national standard values, but was similar regardless the presence or absence of HCC.Conclusion:While PEM is still present in liver cirrhosis, an equal proportion has obesity in recent patients. Thus, in addition to guidelines for PEM, establishment of nutrition and exercise guidelines seems essential for obese patients with liver cirrhosis.
