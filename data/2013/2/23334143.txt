Hepatoblastoma is a rare carcinoma mostly seen in children. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection and adjuvant chemotherapy is the optimal treatment. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, and fatigue. MRI showed 3 hepatic lesions with high signal intensity on arterial phase T1-weighted images and slight washout on the late phase, suggestive for hepatocellular carcinoma. Laboratory examinations revealed plasma α-feto-protein of 114,245 μg/L. Subsequent baseline and posttreatment F-fluoromethyl choline PET/CT were performed to possibly evaluate extent of the disease and assess disease response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
