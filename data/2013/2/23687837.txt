Objective:To discuss the relationship between advanced schistosomiasis and HBV infection.Methods:A total of 250 advanced schistosomiasis patients were examined with ultrasound, and their serum samples were detected for liver function, HBsAg, etc. The correlations between HBV infection and advanced types, abnormal liver function, liver cancer and mortality were analyzed, respectively.Results:The positive rate of HBsAg was 58.4% (146/250). The rates of abnormal liver function (46.6%), jaundice (23.3%), cancer (17.8%) and mortality (23.3%) were significantly higher in the advanced schistosomiasis patients with HBsAg than in the advanced schistosomiasis patients without HBsAg (P values < 0.05 or 0.01).Conclusion:Advanced schistosomiasis combined with HBV infection aggravates the liver damage.
