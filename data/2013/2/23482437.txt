The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising worldwide being currently the fifth most common cancer and third cause of cancer-related mortality. Early detection of HCC through surveillance programs have enabled the identification of small nodules with higher frequency, and nowadays account for 10%-15% of patients diagnosed in the West and almost 30% in Japan. Patients with small HCC can be candidates for potential curative treatments: liver transplantation, surgical resection and percutaneous ablation, depending on the presence of portal hypertension and co-morbidities. This review will analyze recent advancements in the clinical management of these individuals, focusing on issues related to the role of portal hypertension, the debate between resection and ablative therapies and the future impact of molecular technologies.
