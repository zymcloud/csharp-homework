Background and purpose:Previously, we have shown that sorafenib sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to apoptosis induced by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TNFSF10; TRAIL). Here, we report that sorafenib and SC-49 sensitize HCC cells to CS-1008, a novel anti-human death receptor 5 (TNFRSF10B) antibody.Experimental approach:HCC cell lines (PLC5, Huh-7, and Hep3B) were treated with CS-1008 and/or sorafenib and analysed in terms of apoptosis and signal transductions.Key results:SC-49 is a sorafenib derivative, which is devoid of kinase inhibitory activity. Both sorafenib and SC-49 down-regulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr(705) and subsequently reduced the levels of STAT3-regulated proteins, Mcl-1, survivin and cylcin D1, in CS-1008-treated HCC cells. Knockdown of STAT3 by RNA interference overcame apoptotic resistance to CS-1008 in HCC cells, and ectopic expression of STAT3 in HCC cells abolished the sensitizing effects of sorafenib and SC-49 on CS-1008-induced apoptosis, indicating that inhibition of STAT3 mediates the enhancing effects of these compounds when combined with CS-1008. Importantly, inhibition of SHP-1 by adding a specific SHP-1 inhibitor reduced the effects of SC-49 and CS-1008 on p-STAT3 and apoptosis, whereas co-treatment of CS-1008 with SC-49 increased the activity of SHP-1. These data indicate that the combined effects of CS-1008 and SC-49 on HCC are mediated by SHP-1. Moreover, the combination of CS-1008 and SC-49 inhibited HCC xenograft tumour growth in vivo.Conclusions and implications:Sorafenib and its derivative SC-49 sensitize HCC cells to the antitumour effects of CS-1008 through SHP-1-dependent inactivation of STAT3.
