Survival is poor in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and therapeutic options are limited. CMC-544 (inotuzumab ozogamicin) has shown significant activity in adult patients with relapsed and refractory ALL. We evaluated CMC-544 in pediatric patients with multiply relapsed ALL. Five children 4-15 years old with relapsed, CD 22 positive B-cell ALL were enrolled on a phase II non-randomized trial of CMC-544. CMC-544 was initially administered at 1.3 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. The dose then increased to 1.8 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks. Subsequently, a weekly schedule of CMC-544 given as 0.8 mg/m(2) on day 1 followed by 0.5 mg/m(2) on days 8 and 15 was administered. All five patients had refractory relapsed B-cell ALL. Lymphoblasts for all patients highly expressed CD22. Four patients had two or more relapses before starting the study drug. One patient achieved a complete remission in the bone marrow and normal peripheral counts, and two patients achieved bone marrow morphologic remission with absolute neutrophils >1,000/µl but platelets <100,000/µl. Two patients had no response to the drug. Toxicities consisted of fever, sepsis, and liver enzyme elevation. Single agent CMC-544 given at the single dose of 1.8 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks or given as a split, weekly dose was generally well tolerated considering the inherent risks in this population of patients and showed promising activity in pediatric patients with relapsed and refractory ALL.
