Background:The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which mediates pleiotropic effects, including the regulation of senescence and proliferation and plays an important role in carcinogenesis. This study attempts to clarify the genetic predisposition to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on the hTERT gene rs2736098 polymorphism.Method:Four hundred patients with HCC and 400 non-cancer controls were genotyped to elucidate the potential association between hTERT rs2736098 polymorphism and HCC risks.Results:Compared with the controls, the patients with HCC had a lower frequency of G/G genotype (33.3% vs 44.3%, P=0.001) and a higher frequency of G/A (51.5% vs 39.5%, P=0.001). Allele genotypic frequencies in the patients differed from those of the controls (P=0.040). The data of this study rs2736098[A] allele contributed significantly to HCC risk in female patients (OR=1.78, 95% CI, 1.17-2.72, P=0.007), patients with HCV infection (OR=2.89, 95% CI, 1.08-7.70, P=0.031), non-drinker patients (OR=1.32, 95% CI, 1.06-1.65, P=0.015), and patients not affected by HBV (OR=1.77, 95% CI, 1.30-2.40, PConclusions:rs2736098[A] may be an independent hereditary parameter in HCC, but some risk factors would cover up the association by more powerful hepatocarcinogenesis. These results are important guidance for further studies in detecting HCC-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms.
