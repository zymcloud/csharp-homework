Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary tumour of the liver, responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the Western world, it primarily affects patients with cirrhosis, secondary to hepatitis C virus and alcoholism. In the rest of the world, HCC is closely associated with hepatitis B virus infections. Radiologists play a key role in accurately staging HCC, which has important implications for treatment planning. This pictorial review aims to describe the routes of HCC spread and the most frequent sites of metastases, to recognize extrahepatic HCC findings on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and to understand the implications of HCC staging on treatment planning.
