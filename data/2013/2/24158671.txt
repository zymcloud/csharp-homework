Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), belonging to the glyoxalase system, participates in the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG), a byproduct of glycolysis. Glo1 is associated with the progression of many human malignancies. However, the role of Glo1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. We have discovered that the expression of Glo1 is up-regulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumorous tissues, and knockdown of Glo1 expression by RNA interference significantly inhibited the proliferation of human HCC cell lines. Glo1 knockdown resulted in the accumulation of its cytotoxic substrate, MG. Overall, thus Glo1 might be essential for HCC progression and can be designated as a potential therapeutic target for HCC in the future.
