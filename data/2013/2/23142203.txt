Background & aims:More information is needed on use of Primovist-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during initial staging analysis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are candidates for treatment with liver dynamic computed tomography (CT).Methods:We studied 104 patients who were initially diagnosed as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 or A, without any other suspicious intrahepatic lesions, by liver dynamic CT from December 2009 to May 2012 at Inha University Hospital in Korea. We evaluated whether an addition of Primovist-enhanced MRI examination affected determination of BCLC stage, compared with liver dynamic CT.Results:On the basis of CT analysis, the median tumor size was 2.3 cm, and 98 patients had HCCs that met the Milan criteria (94.2%). All 104 patients (100%) had nodular type HCC. Abnormal intrahepatic findings were detected by Primovist-enhanced MRI in 41 patients (39.4%). Eighteen patients (17.3%) had new HCCs, but 6 patients who were initially of BCLC stage A remained at this stage, despite increases in tumor numbers. Of the 104 patients, 31 (29.8%) and 73 (70.2%) had BCLC stage 0 and A HCC before Primovist-enhanced MRI, respectively, and 26 (25.0%), 71 (68.3%), and 7 (6.7%) patients had BCLC stages 0, A, and B HCC after Primovist-enhanced MRI, respectively. In 12 of the 104 patients (11.5%), BCLC stage changed from 0 to A (5/31, 16.1%) or from A to B (7/73, 9.6%).Conclusions:Primovist-enhanced MRI can provide additional information that can lead to the detection of new intrahepatic HCC lesions during initial staging analyses of patients with BCLC stage 0 or A HCC by liver dynamic CT, despite the absence of other suspicious liver lesions.
