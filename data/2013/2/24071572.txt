β-Catenin signaling is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although its role in inflammation, fibrosis, and proliferation is unclear. Commercially available HCC tissue microarray (TMA) of 89 cases was assessed for β-catenin, one of its transcriptional targets glutamine synthetase (GS), proliferation (PCNA), inflammation (CD45), and fibrosis (Sirius Red). HCC cells transfected with wild-type (WT) or mutant-β-catenin were evaluated for β-catenin-T cell factor transactivation by TOPFlash reporter activity and expression of certain targets. Hepatocyte-specific-serine-45-mutated β-catenin transgenic mice (TG) and controls (Con) were used to study thioacetamide (TAA)-induced hepatic fibrosis and tumorigenesis. Sustained β-catenin activation was only observed in mutant-, not WT-β-catenin transfected HCC cells. Aberrant intratumoral β-catenin stabilization was evident in 33% cases with 9% showing predominant nuclear with some cytoplasmic (N/C) localization and 24% displaying predominant cytoplasmic with occasional nuclear (C/N) localization. N/C β-catenin was associated with reduced fibrosis (p=0.017) and tumor-wide GS staining (p
