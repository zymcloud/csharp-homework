Background and aim:The clinical aspects of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing maintenance dialysis are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the long-term survival and prognostic determinants of dialysis patients with HCC.Methods:A total of 2502 HCC patients, including 30 dialysis patients and 90 age, sex, and treatment-matched controls were retrospectively analyzed.Results:Dialysis patients more often had dual viral hepatitis B and C, lower serum Î±-fetoprotein level, worse performance status, higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score than non-dialysis patients and matched controls (P all Conclusions:Patients with HCC undergoing maintenance dialysis do not have a worse long-term survival. A longer duration of dialysis and absence of ascites formation are associated with a better outcome in dialysis patients. The CTP classification is a more feasible prognostic marker to indicate the severity of cirrhosis, and the JIS system may be a better staging model for outcome prediction.
