Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells are auxotrophic for arginine, depletion of which leads to tumour regression. The current study evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics (PD) parameters, and potential anti-tumor activity of pegylated recombinant human arginase 1 (peg-rhArg1) in advanced HCC patients.Methods:Eligibility criteria included advanced HCC with measurable lesions, Child-Pugh A or B, and adequate organ function. Initial single IV bolus was followed by weekly doses of peg-rhArgI escalated from 500 U/kg to 2500 U/kg in a 3 + 3 design.Results:Fifteen patients were enrolled at weekly doses of 500 U/kg (n = 3), 1000 U/kg (n = 3), 1600 U/kg (n = 3) and 2500 U/kg (n = 6). The median age was 57 years (33-74); 87% were hepatitis B carriers and 47% had prior systemic treatment. The most commonly reported drug-related non-haematological adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (13.3%), abdominal discomfort (6.7%) and nausea (6.7%). No drug-related haematological AEs were seen. Only 1 of the six patients that received 2500U/kg peg-rhArg1 experienced DLT (grade 4 bilirubin elevation) and thus the maximum tolerated dose was 2500 U/kg. PK and PD analysis indicated that peg-rhArg1 was efficacious in inducing arginine depletion in a dose-dependent manner. Adequate arginine depletion dose was achieved in the 1,600-2,500 U/kg range and therefore the optimal biological dose was at 1600 U/kg, which was chosen as the recommended dose. The best response was stable disease for >8 weeks in 26.7% of the enrolled patients.Conclusion:Peg-rhArg1 has manageable safety profile and preliminary evidence of activity in advanced HCC patients.
