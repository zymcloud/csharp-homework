Background & aims:Early treatment has been recommended for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to its high cure rate. However, the reported survival benefits of treating early HCC may be affected by lead time.Methods:Early HCC was defined as a well-differentiated cancer containing Glisson's triad (carcinoma in situ). We applied the concept of lead time to chronic liver disease, which is originally the length of time between screen-detected and symptom-detected disease. To evaluate prolongation of survival with treatment of early HCC, survivals of patients with early and overt HCCs smaller than 2.0 cm treated with liver resection were compared. To calculate lead time and survival benefit of liver resection, survivals of untreated early and overt HCC patients were compared.Results:After liver resection, median overall survival of 46 patients with early HCC (8.8 years; 95% CI, 7.2-11.2) was significantly longer than that of the 202 with overt HCC (6.8 years; 95% CI, 6.2-8.3, p = 0.0257). The prolongation in survival time with liver resection for early HCC was 34.7 (95% CI, 22.1-46.5) months. On the other hand, comparing liver resection and natural history, the survival benefits of surgery for 12 patients with early and 16 with overt HCC were 74.7 (95% CI, 51.9-97.4) and 73.4 (95% CI, 57.9-88.9) months, respectively. Consequently, the lead time and survival benefit with resection for early HCC were estimated as 33.4 (95% CI, 18.9-47.8) and 1.3 (95% CI, -22.1-24.7) months, respectively.Conclusions:Survival benefit of resection for early HCC is marginal because of a long lead time, and early HCC is therefore not a target lesion for surgery.
