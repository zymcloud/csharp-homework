Objective:We assessed health-related quality of life in cancer survivors treated in designated cancer centers when compared with the general population in Korea.Methods:A multicenter survey was conducted from July through August 2008 using the quota-sampling approach. A general population sample was drawn from the Fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, second year. We compared the multivariate-adjusted least square means of cancer patients with those of the general population to examine relationships between EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire components and cancer sites, cancer stage and time since diagnosis. The independent variables of responses to the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire were evaluated using logistic regression analysis.Results:Cancer patients scored significantly poorer on measures of self-care (means: stomach 1.25; lung 1.40; liver 1.27; colon 1.26; breast 1.27; cervical 1.29 vs. general 1.18), engagement in usual activities (means: stomach 1.47; lung 1.63; liver 1.45; colon 1.44; breast 1.46; cervical 1.47 vs. general 1.33) and anxiety/depression (means: stomach 1.41; lung 1.50; liver 1.41; colon 1.42; breast 1.50; cervical 1.47 vs. general 1.28). Those in the local stage scored significantly better on mobility (mean = 1.35) than the general population (mean = 1.40). Cancer patients, especially those with lung cancer, in the advanced stage and more than 5 years since diagnosis had poorer health-related quality of life than the general population. Some factors such as medical insurance and healthcare services were related to health-related quality of life among cancer patients.Conclusions:Health-related quality of life of cancer survivors with lung cancer at advanced stages, <1 year earlier and more than 5 years since diagnosis was poorer than that for the non-cancer control group, and these differences were statistically significant. Cancer survivors should be continuously observed and offered support.
