Hyponatremia is prevalent before liver transplantation and generally corrected immediately after transplantation. However, the clinical significance of correction rate of hyponatremia is not well investigated. The prognostic impact of pre-transplant serum sodium concentrations and post-transplant correction rate of hyponatremia were assessed. A total of 512 patients who received orthotopic liver transplants were enrolled. The correction rate of hyponatremia (delta sodium, Î”Na) was calculated based on the data collected during the first 48 hours following liver transplantation. Outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, delirium, neurological complications, acute kidney injury, and infections, were compared according to the serum sodium levels (sNa
