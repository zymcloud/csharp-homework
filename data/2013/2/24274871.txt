Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a major cause of chronic liver diseases and liver failure. Population-based prospective studies and patient cohort studies have demonstrated that obesity and the metabolic syndrome exacerbate progression of ALD and increase hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence and mortality. Emerging evidence also suggests a synergism between alcohol and obesity in mortality and HCC incidence. Recognition of these increased risks and detection of early-stage liver disease may offer the opportunity to address these modifiable risk factors and prevent disease progression in these patients.
