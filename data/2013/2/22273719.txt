Background:Surgical site infections (SSIs), particularly organ/space SSIs, remain a common cause of major morbidity after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Risk factors for SSIs were analyzed in 359 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC between 2001 and 2010. The causative bacteria, management, outcome, and characteristics of organ/space SSIs were investigated.Results:Anatomic hepatectomy was performed for 296 patients (82.5%), and repeat hepatectomy was carried out for 59 patients (16.4%). SSIs developed in 52 patients (14.5%; incisional, 24 cases; organ/space, 31 cases [3 patients showed both incisional and organ/space SSIs]). No in-hospital mortality related to incisional or organ/space SSIs was encountered. Independent risk factors for SSIs were repeat hepatectomy and operative time â‰¥ 280 min. Independent risk factors for organ/space SSIs were repeat hepatectomy and bile leakage. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was detected more frequently in organ/space SSIs after repeat hepatectomy than after initial hepatectomy.Conclusions:Repeat hepatectomy and bile leakage represent independent risk factors for organ/space SSIs after hepatectomy for HCC. Establishing treatment strategies is important for preventing postoperative bile leakage and reducing the high rate of organ/space SSIs after repeat hepatectomy.
