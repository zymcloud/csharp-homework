Few studies have evaluated the risk factors for chronic GVHD and organ involvement associated with different graft types, including unrelated cord blood (U-CB). We retrospectively studied 4818 adult patients who received their first allogeneic transplantation and survived for at least 100 days. The incidence of chronic GVHD at 2 years was 37%. The following factors were associated with the development of chronic GVHD: female donor/male recipient, CMV-Ab seropositivity, matched related peripheral blood grafts vs matched related BM grafts, no in vivo T-cell depletion and the occurrence of grade II-IV acute GVHD. Among these factors, the association with acute GVHD occurrence was consistently significant across donor subtypes. The use of U-CB was not associated with chronic GVHD, but was associated with a low incidence of extensive chronic GVHD. Chronic GVHD patients who had received U-CB transplants showed less frequent involvement of the oral cavity (28% vs 55%), eye (12% vs 26%), liver (20% vs 44%), lung (11% vs 25%) and joint (0% vs 6%) than those with matched related BM grafts. In conclusion, we found that U-CB transplants were associated with a low incidence of extensive chronic GVHD and less frequent involvement of the oral cavity, eye, liver, lung and joints.
