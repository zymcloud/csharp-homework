A simple and sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of plasma concentrations of five polyamines in normal and Hepatoma-22 mice, and mice treated with Mylabris and Acanthopanax senticosus was developed by HPLC-ESI-MS. Male Kunming mice were divided into nine groups, a control group (inoculation without treatment), a positive group (Cyclophosphamide), treatment groups [Mylabris (4, 8, 16 mg/kg), Acanthopanax senticosus (6, 12, 24 g/kg)] and a normal group (without inoculation). Twenty-four hours after the last administration, plasma samples were collected. The derived polyamines were separated on a C(18) column by a gradient elution using methanol-water with excellent linearity within the range from 2.5 to 1000 ng/mL. Polyamines were confirmed as useful biochemical markers of hepatoma. The differences in anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy between Mylabris and Acanthopanax senticosus might contribute to the variability of polyamine levels in vivo. This HPLC-ESI-MS method was successfully applied to investigate the relationship between polyamines and cancer in mice and might be a useful method to test the activity of potential anti-tumor drugs.
