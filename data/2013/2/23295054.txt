Background/aims:Impaired regulation of apoptosis has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC). In this study, we analysed a signalling pathway that comprises the transcription factor FoxO3a and its downstream target Bim, a Bcl-2 interacting mediator of apoptosis.Materials & methods:The tissues examined included livers explanted from patients with cirrhotic PBC, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and liver biopsies from patients with non-cirrhotic PBC. Large margin resections of hepatocellular carcinoma were used as controls.Results:Expression of FoxO3a and Bim mRNA was significantly enhanced in both non-cirrhotic and end-stage PBC (2.2-fold and 4.3-fold increases, respectively), but not in the other disorders. Similarly, FOXO3a protein level was increased in end-stage PBC (P Conclusions:Our results imply that the FoxO3/Bim signalling pathway can be of importance in the livers of patients with PBC.
