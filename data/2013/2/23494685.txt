Hemothorax due to rupture of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a very rare complication with high mortality because of uncontrollable hemorrhage. A 71-year-old man treated by transcatheter arterial embolization for HCC with massive bleeding from chest wall metastasis is reported. Enhanced computed tomography and selective intercostal angiogram showed a hypervascular mass in the right chest wall and extravasation of contrast agent. After successful transcatheter arterial embolization with gelatin sponge particles and metallic coils, the patient recovered from shock without major complication. To our knowledge, a successfully treated case of hemothorax due to rupture of metastatic HCC has not previously been described.
