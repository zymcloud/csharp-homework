Objective:To compare the effect of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with radiofrequency ablation alone for the treatment of 3 - 5 cm hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:From January 2006 to March 2010, sixty-two HCC patients were randomly treated with RFA combined with TACE (n = 32) or RFA alone (n = 30). This group included the patients who had Child-Pugh class A or B with three or fewer tumors, in which just one tumor size was 3 - 5 cm in diameter, and no evidence of extrahepatic tumor metastasis or macrovascular invasion. The follow up ranged from 9 to 39 months. Survival probabilities were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between survival curves were evaluated with the Log rank test.Results:At the end of the study, the 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates in the combined treatment group were 90.6%, 72%, and 53.1%, respectively, and in the radiofrequency ablation alone group were 83.3%, 56.75%, and 23.3%, respectively. The differences between the survival curves of the two groups were not statistically significant (P = 0.176). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year progress-free survival rates in the combined treatment group were 75.0%, 50.0%, and 34.3%, respectively, and in the radiofrequency ablation alone group were 63.3%, 33.3%, and 16.7%, respectively. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant (P = 0.027). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year local tumor progression rates in the combined treatment group were 12.5%, 18.75%, and 18.75% vs. 16.7%, 30%, and 36.6% in the radiofrequency ablation alone group, with a significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.047).Conclusion:Radiofrequency ablation plus TACE is better than radiofrequency ablation alone for the treatment of 3 - 5 cm hepatocellular carcinoma.
