Objective:This study aimed to define the correlation between microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression and hepatectomy-induced liver injury in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Plasma miR-122 expression in patients with HCC and healthy age-matched controls was determined, and correlated with plasma alanine transaminase activity (ALT) and bilirubin levels preoperatively and on days 1 and 7 postoperation. Correlations between plasma miR-122 and clinicopathological characteristics at 1 day postoperation were also determined.Results:This study included 80 patients with HCC and 80 controls. Baseline expression of miR-122 mRNA and ALT in patients with HCC was significantly higher than in controls. MiR-122 expression correlated with ALT and bilirubin levels preoperatively and on days 1 and 7 postoperatively. In patients with HCC who received a block of the first hepatic portal during surgery and those with excised tumour size >5 cm, plasma miR-122 expression was significantly increased on day 1 postoperatively, compared with expression levels in those who did not receive a block and those with smaller tumours.Conclusions:Plasma miR-122 expression is correlated with hepatectomy-induced liver injury in patients with HCC. Increase in miR-122 expression could be used as an index of such injury before and after hepatectomy in these patients.
