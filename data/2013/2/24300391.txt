Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant cancers in the world. Molecular probes that can recognize biomarkers specific for HCC are urgently needed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of early diagnosis. A recent study has applied the method of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment and produced several aptamers that can bind specifically to mouse liver cancer cells and tissues. However, the binding affinity to human liver cancer has not been fully identified. Using human-derived hepatoma cell line HepG2 as positive target cell line and normal hepatocyte cell line HL-7702 as negative one, we obtained an aptamer HA09 that could specifically bind to human liver cancer cells with Kd in the nanomolar range and recognize paraffin-embedded human HCC tissues. This aptamer may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers and serve as an ideal molecular probe for intracellular delivery with both diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
