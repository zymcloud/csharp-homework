Background and aim:The average age of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients has been rising in Japan. We evaluate characteristics of HCV-positive patients who develop HCC in older age to determine an optimal surveillance strategy.Methods:A total of 323 patients with three or more years of follow-up before HCC diagnosis and 323 propensity-matched controls without HCC were studied. HCC patients were classified into four groups according to age at the time of HCC diagnosis: group A (≤ 60 years, n = 36), group B (61-70 years, n = 115), group C (71-80 years, n = 143), and group D (> 80 years, n = 29). Clinical and laboratory data were compared.Results:Platelet counts were significantly higher in the older groups at HCC diagnosis (P Conclusion:Elderly HCV-positive patients (≥ 65 years old) with low ALT values developed HCC regardless of their platelet counts. These findings should be taken into account when designing the most suitable HCC surveillance protocol for this population.
