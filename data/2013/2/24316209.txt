Cucurbitacin B, a member of the cucurbitaceae family, can act as a STAT3 signaling inhibitor to regulate the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. STAT3 signaling has been shown to inhibit adipocyte differentiation through C/EBPα and PPARγ. Based on these studies, we hypothesized that cucurbitacin B would prevent PPARγ mediated adipocyte differentiation through STAT3 signaling. To test this hypothesis, mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells were treated with a sub-cytotoxic concentration of cucurbitacin B. Cucurbitacin B treatment inhibits lipid accumulation and expression of adipocyte markers including PPARγ and its target genes in a dose-dependent manner. Cucurbitacin B treatment impairs STAT3 signaling as manifested by reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 and suppression of STAT3 target gene expression in preadipocytes. The anti-adipogenic effects of cucurbitacin B are significantly blunted in cells with STAT3 silenced by introducing small interfering RNA. Finally, our data show that cucurbitacin I, another cucurbitacin family member, also inhibits adipocyte differentiation by suppressing STAT3 signaling. Together, our data suggest the possibility of utilizing cucurbitacins as a new strategy to treat metabolic diseases and implicate STAT3 as a new target for the development of functional foods and drugs.
