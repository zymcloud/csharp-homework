Nyctanthes arbortristis Linn (Oleaceae) is widely distributed in sub-Himalayan regions and southwards to Godavari, India commonly known as Harsingar and Night Jasmine. In continuation of our drug discovery programme on Indian medicinal plants, we isolated arbortristoside-A (1) and 7-O-trans-cinnamoyl 6β-hydroxyloganin (2) from the seeds of N. Arbortristis, which exhibited moderate in vitro anticancer activity. Chemical transformation of 2 led to significant improvement in the activity in derivative 8 and 15 against HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines. The compounds 8 and 15 were also capable of cell cycle arrest and caspase dependent apoptosis in HepG2 cell lines. These iridoid derivatives hold promise for developing safer alternatives to the marketed drugs.
