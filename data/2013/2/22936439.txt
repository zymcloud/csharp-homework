Purpose:This study was designed to evaluate the surgical parameters and treatment outcomes of tumor hemodynamics-based pure laparoscopic (PURE) and laparoscopy-assisted (HYBRID) hepatectomy for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with those of open hepatectomy.Methods:Using a prospectively collected database from 1997 to 2011, we analyzed the data of 56 consecutive cases of laparoscopic hepatectomy for HCC (PURE, n = 24; HYBRID, n = 29; HALS, n = 3) from among 102 cases undergoing laparoscopic hepatectomy. We employed 27 cases treated by open hepatectomy during the same period as controls.Results:PURE was associated with lesser blood loss, lower weight of the resected liver, and a shorter skin incision than HYBRID and open hepatectomy [median blood loss (mL): PURE 7, HYBRID 380, Open 450; P Conclusions:Neither the surgical parameters nor the treatment outcomes of hemodynamics-based laparoscopic hepatectomy were inferior to those of open hepatectomy.
