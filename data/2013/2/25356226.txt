Sorafenib is the standard treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, fibrolamellar HCC was not included in sorafenib trials. The case is a 26-year-old man with fibrolamellar HCC, who had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) while being treated with sorafenib. This illustrates a probable relationship between use of sorafenib and CVA in low cardiovascular risk patients.
