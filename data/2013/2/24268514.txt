Aim:To compare the accuracy of computer software analysis using three different target-definition protocols to detect tumour feeder vessels for transarterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma.Materials and methods:C-arm computed tomography (CT) data were analysed for 81 tumours from 57 patients who had undergone chemoembolization using software-assisted detection of tumour feeders. Small, medium, and large-sized targets were manually defined for each tumour. The tumour feeder was verified when the target tumour was enhanced on selective C-arm CT of the investigated vessel during chemoembolization. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the three protocols were evaluated and compared.Results:One hundred and eight feeder vessels supplying 81 lesions were detected. The sensitivity of the small, medium, and large target protocols was 79.8%, 91.7%, and 96.3%, respectively; specificity was 95%, 88%, and 50%, respectively; and accuracy was 87.5%, 89.9%, and 74%, respectively. The sensitivity was significantly higher for the medium (p = 0.003) and large (p Conclusion:The overall accuracy of software-assisted automated feeder analysis in transarterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma is affected by the target definition size. A large target definition increases sensitivity and decreases specificity in detecting tumour feeders. A target size equivalent to the tumour size most accurately predicts tumour feeders.
