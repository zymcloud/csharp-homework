Hepatic adenoma is a rare, benign tumor (with potential for malignant degeneration) and its diagnosis is difficult because its presentation is highly variable in medical imaging, particularly with MRI. In such cases, the use of a hepatic biopsy is usually recommended. (18)FDG-PET/CT provides a very significant predictive value for malignant hepatic lesions. In addition, the occurrence of an (18)FDG-avid benign tumor is a rare event. We hereby present the case of a patient with advanced breast cancer for whom an (18)FDG-PET/CT showed a focal hepatic uptake. A subsequent biopsy provided a diagnosis of a hepatic adenoma.
