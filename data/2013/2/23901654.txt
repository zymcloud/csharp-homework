Objective:To investigate the inhibitory effects of flavonoids of Polygoni Orientails Fructus on cell cycle and apoptosis of human hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721.Methods:MTT method was used to study the inhibitory rate and time-dose relationship of flavonoids on SMMC-7721. Flow cytometry PI staining and Annexin V-EGFP/PI double staining were used to measure the DNA concentration and apoptosis rate in SMMC-7721.Results:Flavonoids of Polygoni Orientails Fructus had obvious inhibitory effect and with good linear relationship between time and dose. Flavonoids of Polygoni Orientails Fructus could regulate the G1/S transition in hepatoma cell, which could make the cell in S phase arrest, result in the accumulation of cells in S phase, blocked DNA synthesis and replication of cells, blocked tumor cells into the G2/M phase, so as to restrain the proliferation of tumor cells and induce the apoptosis of SMMC-7721 cells. And this inductive effect showed obvious time-dose-effect relationship.Conclusion:The flavonoids of Polygoni Orientails Fructus could inhibit the hepatoma cell line SMMC-7721 in vitro by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis of the cell in a time-dose dependence maner.
