Primary rodent hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines are commonly used as model systems to elucidate and study potential drug targets for metabolic diseases such as obesity and atherosclerosis. However, if therapies are to be developed, it is essential that our knowledge gained from these systems is translatable to that of human. Here, we have characterized lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in primary human hepatocytes for comparison to rodent primary hepatocytes and human hepatoma cell lines. Primary human hepatocytes were maintained in collagen coated dishes in confluent monolayers for up to 3 days. We found primary human hepatocytes were viable, underwent lipid synthesis, and were able to secret lipoproteins up to 3 days in culture. Furthermore, the lipoprotein profile secreted by primary human hepatocytes was comparable to that found in human plasma; this contrasts with primary rodent hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells. We also investigated the pharmacological effects of nicotinic acid (niacin, NA), a potent dyslipidemic drug, on hepatic lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion. We found NA increased the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in primary human hepatocytes, which may potentially explain how NA increases plasma high-density lipoproteins in humans. In conclusion, primary human hepatocytes are a more relevant model to study lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion than hepatoma cells or rodent primary hepatocyte models. Further research needs to be done to maintain liver specific functions of primary human hepatocytes in prolonged cultures for these cells to be a viable model.
