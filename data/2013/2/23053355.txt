Background:Pure laparoscopic liver resection is technically difficult for tumors located in the dorsal anterior and posterior sectors. We have developed a maneuver to perform pure laparoscopic hepatectomy in the semiprone position which was developed for resecting tumors located in these areas.Methods:The medical records have been reviewed retrospectively in 30 patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resection in the semiprone position for carcinoma in the dorsal anterior or posterior sectors of the right liver between 2008 and 2011.Results:Seventeen liver tumors were primary liver tumors and 13 were colorectal metastases. Of the 30 patients, 11 (36.6 %) underwent major hepatectomy [right hemihepatectomy in 7 (23.3 %) and posterior sectionectomy in 4 (13.3 %)]. Anatomical minor resection, such as S6 or S7 segmentectomy, was performed in five patients (16.6 %). Five patients with liver metastasis underwent a simultaneous laparoscopic resection. There was no mortality, reoperation, or conversion to open procedures. There were no hepatectomy-related complications such as postoperative bleeding, bile leakage, or liver failure.Conclusions:Pure laparoscopic hepatectomy in the semiprone position for tumors present in the dorsal anterior and posterior sectors is feasible and safe. This method expands the indications for laparoscopic liver resection for tumors.
