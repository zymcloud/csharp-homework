Chronic hepatitis B patients with high viral loads are at increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In patients with low viral loads, higher hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels have been shown to predict HCC development. However, little is known about the difference in risk for other hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related adverse outcomes with varying HBsAg levels. A total of 1,068 Taiwanese hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative HBV carriers with serum HBV DNA level Conclusion:In HBeAg-negative patients with low viral loads and genotype B or C virus infection, a higher HBsAg level can predict disease progression.
