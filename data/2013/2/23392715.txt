In China, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is called HBV-related HCC (HBV-HCC), but the pathogenesis has not been clearly elucidated. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been paid increasing attention to, as an important regulatory molecule involved in many biological processes, as well as a variety of diseases. This study examined lncRNA that might play an important role in HBV-HCC pathogenesis by conducting lncRNA and mRNA profile comparison between HBV-HCC and normal liver tissues. The differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA profiles between HBV-HCC and normal liver tissues were analyzed by microarrays. The potential protein-encoding gene regulated by lncRNA, and the biological function (gene ontology, pathway analysis) of the target gene were investigated. The results showed that the expression levels of lncRNA and mRNA in HBV-HCC tissues were different from those in normal liver tissues. As compared with normal liver tissue, 837 (4.30%) lncRNAs exhibited more than two-fold change (P
