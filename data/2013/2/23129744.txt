Purpose:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been recognized as a potent risk factor for the postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little is known about the impact of HCV viral load on surgical outcomes. The study objective was to investigate clinical significance of HCV viral load on long-term outcomes of HCC.Patients and methods:Three hundred seventy patients who were classified as Child-Pugh class A and underwent curative liver resections for HCV-related HCC were divided into low and high viral load groups (â‰¤ or > 5.3 log(10)IU/mL) based on the results of a minimum P value approach to predict moderate to severe activity of hepatitis; the clinical outcomes were then compared.Results:The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 36.1% in the low viral load group and 12.4% in the high viral load group (P Conclusion:Low HCV viral load predicts better long-term surgical outcomes in patients with HCC regardless of the serologic eradication of HCV.
