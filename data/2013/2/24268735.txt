Background and aims:Treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin is the backbone of standard therapy of HCV by mechanisms that are not completely understood. Besides a direct antiviral effect, different immunomodulatory and apoptotic effects have been discussed. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing-ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family with immunomodulatory as well as pro- and antiapoptotic effects and is putatively involved in control of HCV infection. Thus, we analyzed the expression of the TRAIL/TRAIL-receptor system, caspase-8 and cFLIP and examined their prognostic and predictive value for HCV infection and antiviral therapy, respectively.Methods:We immunohistochemically analyzed liver biopsies of 116 therapy-naive HCV patients before treatment with PEG-IFNα and ribavirin in comparison to healthy liver tissue. Expression levels of TRAIL, TRAIL-R1 to TRAIL-R4, caspase-8 and cFLIP were correlated with sustained virologic response (SVR), genotype and staging of chronic hepatitis.Results:Caspase-8, cFLIP, TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R4 were strongly upregulated in HCV patients, whereas TRAIL-R3 was downregulated. SVR correlated with high expression of TRAIL and pro-apoptotic TRAIL-R2 on HCV infected hepatocytes.Conclusions:Our results suggest a pathophysiological role of TRAIL in both, HCV infection and therapy. Further studies need to elaborate possible TRAIL-related targets for clinical applications.
