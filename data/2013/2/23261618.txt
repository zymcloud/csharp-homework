Square planar Pd (II) and octahedral Pt (IV) complexes with novel spherical aramides nanoparticles containing flexible linkages ligands have been synthesized and characterized using analytical and spectral techniques. The synthesized complexes have been tested for their antimicrobial activity using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The antitumor activity has been performed using liver carcinoma (HEPG2), breast carcinoma (MCF7) and colon carcinoma (HCT 116) cell lines. Palladium complexes of polyamides containing sulfones showed the highest potency as antibacterial and antifungal agents. Platinum complexes containing sulfone and ether flexible linkages and chloro groups exhibited high potency as antitumor and antimicrobial agents. The uniform sizes of these nanomaterials could find biological uses such as immune assay and other medical purposes.
