Background:In the Western world, hepatocellular carcinoma seldom develops in patients without cirrhosis, and reports describing the characteristics of non-cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are rather infrequent.Methods:We evaluated the main clinical characteristics, treatment options, and survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma developed in non-cirrhotic liver among the 3027 consecutive cases of hepatocellular carcinoma accrued in the Italian Liver Cancer database during the last 20 years.Results:We identified 52 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic livers (1.7% of all hepatocellular carcinomas), 42 with (80.8%) and 10 without (19.2%) chronic liver disease. In patients without chronic liver disease, median tumour diameter was greater compared to patients with chronic liver disease (7.8 versus 4.0 cm, P=0.046). Curative treatment was feasible in 20 patients (38.5%). Median overall survival was 26 months and 5-year survival rate was 23.7%. Detection of hepatocellular carcinoma outside surveillance (P=0.036), advanced hepatocellular carcinoma stage (PConclusions:In Italy, less than 2% of hepatocellular carcinomas develop in a non-cirrhotic liver, and almost never in a normal liver. These patients frequently present with advanced tumours, have low eligibility rates for curative treatment, and have a dismal prognosis despite their preserved liver function.
