Purpose:Transarterial chemoembolization regimens for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) vary, without a gold-standard method. The present study was performed to evaluate outcomes in patients with HCC treated with doxorubicin/ethiodized oil (DE), cisplatin/doxorubicin/mitomycin-c/ethiodized oil (CDM), or doxorubicin drug-eluting beads (DEBs).Materials and methods:Patients received the same regimen at all visits, without crossover. Groups were compared based on Child-Pugh disease status, tumor/node/metastasis stage, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. Imaging outcomes were assessed based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors to calculate tumor response (ie, sum of complete and partial response), progressive disease (PD), and time to progression (TTP).Results:A total of 228 infusions were performed in 122 patients: 59 with DE, 30 with CDM, and 33 with DEBs. The groups had similar Child-Pugh status (P = .45), tumor/node/metastasis stages (P = .5), and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer scores (P = .22). Follow-up duration was similar among groups (P = .24). Patients treated with DE underwent significantly more treatments (2.3 ± 1.4) than those treated with CDM (1.6 ± 0.7; P = .004) or DEBs (1.4 ± 0.6; PConclusions:During a similar follow-up period, patients treated with CDM or DEB chemoembolization showed a significantly higher response rate and a lower incidence of tumor progression, with fewer required treatment sessions, than those treated with DE chemoembolization.
