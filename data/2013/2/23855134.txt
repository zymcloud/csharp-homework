Objective:To explore the clinical value of Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein detected by microspincolum method for judgment of treatment response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.Methods:Twenty eight patients with HCC undergoing TACE follow-up in hospital were recruited. AFP and AFP-L3 were measured in all the patients before and after TACE, and correlations were analyzed between AFP-L3% and response to treatment.Results:Among the twenty eight patients with HCC undergoing TACE, 8 out 11 case in AFP-L3% descent group had well treatment response, 5 out 17 case in AFP-L3% elevated group had well treatment response(Chi2 = 4. 858, P Conclusions:The detection of AFP-L3 by microspincolum method is useful to judgment of treatment response in patients with HCC undergoing TACE.
