Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) is a rare tumor of the liver, which carries a poor prognosis. It has been reported mostly in the form of case studies. Recently, we experienced a case of primary ASC of the liver that has been preoperatively considered as cholangiocelluar carcinoma of the liver. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, as well as transitional area, including the transformation of adenocarcinoma to squamous cell carcinoma. The patient remained well with no evidence of post-resection complication or recurrence for 15 month.
