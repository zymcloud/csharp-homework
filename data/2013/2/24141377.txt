Background:Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Despite successful control of the primary tumor, metastatic disease will ultimately develop in approximately 35% of the patients, with the liver being the most common site for metastases. These metastases are generally refractory to systemic chemotherapy, and the median survival for patients with liver metastases is about 6 months. This phase II trial reports the experience of isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) as a treatment option.Method:A total of 34 patients with isolated liver metastasis from ocular melanoma underwent IHP. An overall survival comparison was made using data retrieved from the National Patient Register managed by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare.Results:An overall radiological response was seen in 68% of the patients, with 12% having a complete response. Time to local progression was 7 months; 68% of the patients developed extrahepatic metastases after a median of 13 months, and the median overall survival was 24 months. There was a significant survival advantage of 14 months (p = 0.029) when comparing these patients with a control group consisting of the longest surviving patients in Sweden with uveal melanoma liver metastases not treated with IHP.Conclusions:IHP is a treatment option with a high response rate and a potential survival benefit of more than 1 year. IHP should be considered an option in the treatment of uveal melanoma metastases. A randomized trial comparing IHP and best alternative care will start during 2013 (the SCANDIUM trial, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01785316).
