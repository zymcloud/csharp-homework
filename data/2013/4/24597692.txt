Exportin 4 (XPO4) is a novel identified candidate tumour-suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study was aimed to determine the clinical features of XPO4 mRNA expression and promoter methylation status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. PBMCs were isolated from 44 HCC, 38 liver cirrhosis (LC), 34 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 17 healthy controls (HCs). The mRNA level and promoter methylation status of XPO4 were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. XPO4 mRNA level of HCC patients was significantly lower compared with LC and CHB patients as well as HCs (all P
