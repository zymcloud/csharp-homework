Objective:To observe the inhibition effects of polypeptide extract from scorpion venom (PESV) combined 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) on vasculogenic mimicry (VM) of H2 hepatoma carcinoma cells in mice and its possible mechanisms.Methods:The H22 carcinoma cell suspension was subcutaneously inoculated into 60 Kunming mice. Then tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into three groups, i.e., the control group, the 5-Fu group, and the combination group (PESV +5-Fu), 20 in each group. The tumor volume was measured once every other day after 14 successive days of intervention. Then the tumor volume growth curve was drawn, and the tumor inhibitory rate was calculated. The morphological changes of the tumor tissue were observed by HE staining. The VM density of each tumor tissue were detected by immunohistochemical assay and periodic acid-schiff stain (PAS). The protein expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor-la (HIF-la) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) were detected using immunohistochemical assay. The gray value was semi-quantitatively analyzed using LeicaQwinV3 Image Analysis Software.Results:The growth of H22 hepatoma transplantation tumor was inhibited more obviously in the combination group and the 5-Fu group than in the control group (P Conclusions:PESV combined 5-Fu could inhibit the generation of VM of H22 hepatoma transplantation tumor in mice. Its mechanisms might be associated with inhibiting the expressions of HIF-lalpha and MMP-2 in the microenvironment of tumors.
