Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high predilection for portal vein invasion, and the prognosis of HCC with malignant portal vein invasion is extremely poor. The objective of this study was to investigate the outcomes and the prognostic factor of recurrence in HCC patients with malignant portal vein invasion.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic data and outcomes of 83 HCC patients with malignant portal vein invasion and 1,056 patients without portal vein invasion who underwent liver resection.Results:Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, increased maximum tumor size, and intrahepatic metastasis were predisposing factors for malignant portal vein invasion by multivariate analysis. The median disease-free survival and overall survival of HCC patients with malignant portal vein invasion was 4.5 months and 25 months, respectively. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year disease-free survival rates were 30.6%, 26.1%, and 21.2%, respectively, and the overall survival rates for HCC patients with malignant portal vein invasion were 68.6%, 54.2%, and 41.6%, respectively. The initial detection site was the lung in HCC patients with portal vein invasion and the liver in HCC patients without portal vein invasion. C-reactive protein (CRP) was a significant independent predictor of tumor recurrence in HCC with malignant portal vein invasion after surgery.Conclusions:Increased ALP levels, increased maximum tumor size, and intrahepatic metastasis were independent predictors of malignant portal vein invasion in HCC. CRP level was closely associated with the predisposing factor of tumor recurrence in HCC patients with malignant portal vein invasion after a surgical resection, and lung metastasis was common.
