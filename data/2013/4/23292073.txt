Purpose:This meta-analysis was designed to compare the effectiveness of the combination of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) with that of TACE and PRFA monotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Randomized controlled trials were searched using various databases, and six studies were revealed on comparing TACE plus PRFA with TACE and/or PRFA alone for the treatment for HCC. Overall survival rate and recurrence-free survival rate were analyzed and compared. All statistic analyses were conducted using Review Manager (version 4.2.2.) from the Cochrane collaboration.Results:Meta-analysis data revealed that TACE plus PRFA had significantly better effectiveness on 1- and 3-year overall survival rate(odds ratio [OR] 1-year = 4.61, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 2.26-9.42, P Conclusions:The data of our study indicate that the combination of TACE and PRFA has better effectiveness than that of TACE and PRFA monotherapy in the treatment for patients with HCC.
