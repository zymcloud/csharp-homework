To study the role of heat shock protein A1L (HSPA1L) and A1B (HSPA1B) polymorphisms and subsequent risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in India. Subjects enrolled included 185 cases of HCC, 182 cases of chronic hepatitis (CH) and 200 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was typed for HSPA1L2437 and HSPA1B1267 SNP using polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Other risk factors were also analysed. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, older age >35 years and high aflatoxin level in urine increased the risk of HCC. The frequencies of HSPA1L BB genotype and B allele in HCC were more than in CH [odds ratio (OR): 9.83; P = 0.000], but also in HBV-related HCC than Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) [OR: 3.44; P = 0.004] and HCV-related HCC compared to CHC [OR: 6.32; P = 0.010]. The frequency of HSPA1B genotype in the homozygous state was more in CH [OR: 6.01; P = 0.001] and is a good marker to predict the risk of HCV-related CH (CHC) compared to controls. HCV-related HCC has a higher frequency of the B allele of HSPA1B than healthy controls [OR: 3.95; P = 0.000] and CHC [OR: 2.35; P = 0.000], respectively. The frequencies increased further significantly in CHC compared to healthy controls [OR: 9.26; P = 0.000]. The risk for the development of CH and HCC compared to healthy controls irrespective of the aetiology was significant in terms of the HSPA1B marker than HSPA1L in the Indian population.
