Objective:To assess the role of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in predicting and assessing response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).Methods:Thirty-six patients with cirrhosis and untreated HCC who underwent TACE and MRI within 3 months before and after TACE were assessed. MRI included DWI and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. Two observers measured ADC of HCCs and liver parenchyma on pre- and post-TACE MRIs and measured degree of tumor necrosis on subtracted post-contrast images on post-TACE MRI. Pre-, post-TACE tumor ADC, and changes in tumor ADC (Î”ADC) were compared between lesions stratified by degree of tumor necrosis (measured on post-TACE MRI).Results:Forty seven HCCs were evaluated (mean size 4.4cm, range 1.0-14.1cm). HCCs with poor and incomplete response to TACE (Conclusion:This preliminary data suggests that pre-TACE tumor ADC can be used to predict HCC response to TACE.
