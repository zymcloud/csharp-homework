Background:Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was initially started by radiologists as a percutaneous treatment, but surgeons started to use RFA by surgical approach for patients with tumors at locations difficult for the percutaneous procedure. The aim was to evaluate the results of intraoperative RFA for small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (Methods:Two hundred forty-seven patients with small solitary HCC (Results:The location and depth of the tumor from the liver capsule was the only significant factors in the choice of the surgeon between resection and RFA. RFA was successful in all tumors (complete ablation rate of 100 %). In the surgery group, all patients achieved R0 resection. Complication rate was comparable (p = 1.0). After a median follow-up of 37 months (range, 10-45 months), no tumors showed neither local progression nor local recurrence and no significant difference was observed between two groups as regards early recurrence and number of de novo lesions (p = 0.49). One-year and 3-year survival rates were 93 % and 81 %, respectively, in the resection group comparable to the corresponding rates of 92 % and 74 % in the RFA group (p = 0.9).Conclusion:For small HCC in locations difficult for a percutaneous approach, intraoperative RFA can be an alternative option for deep-seated tumors necessitating more than one segmentectomy achieving similar tumor control, and overall and disease-free survival.
