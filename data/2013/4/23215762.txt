Background and aims:Serum des-Î³-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is an established tumor marker in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which can be identified by using MU-3 antibody. The MU-3 antibody mainly reacts with the 9-10 glutamic acid residues of DCP (conventional DCP). Since other variants of DCP with fewer glutamic acid residues can be detected using P-11 and P-16 antibodies (code name: NX-PVKA), we examined the clinical characteristics associated with NX-PVKA, and whether NX-PVKA is a useful measure in HCC patients.Methods:Participants comprised 197 HCC patients admitted to our hospital between 2001 and 2010. NX-PVKA, conventional DCP, alpha-fetoprotein, and L3 fraction of alpha-fetoprotein were measured prior to initiation of HCC treatment.Results:Of the tumor markers assessed, NX-PVKA was the only significant predictor of prognosis (hazard ratio, 81.32; P Conclusions:NX-PVKA offers the best marker of tumor prognosis among HCC patients, and is strongly associated with tumor factors and hepatic functional reserve. NX-PVKA could be useful for clinical evaluation of tumor severity, as well as the estimated duration of survival among patients with HCC.
