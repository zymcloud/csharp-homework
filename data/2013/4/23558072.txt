Background:The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poor and its early diagnosis is of the utmost importance. This study aimed to investigate the values of glypican-3 (GPC-3) expression in the liver and sera and its gene transcription for diagnosis and monitoring of metastasis of HCC.Methods:Liver GPC-3 was analyzed in HCC tissues from 36 patients by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. GPC-3 mRNA from circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 123 HCC patients or 246 patients with other diseases or 36 HCC tissues was amplified by RT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Circulating GPC-3 level was detected by ELISA.Results:The increasing expression of GPC-3 was observed from non-cancerous to cancerous tissues, with brown granule-like staining localized in tumor parts of atypical hyperplasia and HCC formation. The positive rate of GPC-3 was 80.6% in HCC, 41.7% in their paracancerous tissues, and none in distal cancerous tissues (PConclusion:Both GPC-3 overexpression and GPC-3 mRNA abnormality could be used as markers for the diagnosis of HCC and monitoring its metastasis.
