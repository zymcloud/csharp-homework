Aim:To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the reversal effect of emodin on platinum resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:After the addition of 10 μmol/L emodin to HepG2/oxaliplatin (OXA) cells, the inhibition rate (IR), 50% inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) and reversal index (IC₅₀ in experimental group/IC₅₀ in control group) were calculated. For HepG2, HepG2/OXA, HepG2/OXA/T, each cell line was divided into a control group, OXA group, OXA + fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) group and OXA + emodin group, and the final concentrations of FGF7, emodin and OXA in each group were 5 ng/mL, 10 μg/mL and 10 μmol/L, respectively. Single-cell gel electrophoresis was conducted to detect DNA damage, and the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 (ERCC1) protein expression levels in each group were examined by Western blotting.Results:Compared with the IC₅₀ of 120.78 μmol/L in HepG2/OXA cells, the IC₅₀ decreased to 39.65 μmol/L after treatment with 10 μmol/L emodin; thus, the reversal index was 3.05. Compared with the control group, the tail length and Olive tail length in the OXA group, OXA + FGF7 group and OXA + emodin group were significantly increased, and the differences were statistically significant (P Conclusion:Emodin markedly reversed OXA resistance by enhancing OXA DNA damage in HepG2/OXA cells, and the molecular mechanism was related to the inhibitory effect on ERCC1 expression being mediated by the FGFR2/ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
