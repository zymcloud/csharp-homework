The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of salvage liver transplantation (SLT), repeated hepatic resection (RR), and repeated radiofrequency ablation (rRFA) for patients with postoperative tumor recurrence. The optimal treatment strategy for patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. From January 1993 to September 2009, 532 patients underwent either hepatic resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for HCC within the Milan criteria. In all, 219 patients experienced intrahepatic recurrence, and 87 were selected for SLT (n=19), RR (n=24), or rRFA (n=44). Their clinicopathological data were reviewed, and their survival outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier methods. Seventy-four of 220 patients (33.6%) developed recurrent HCC within the Milan criteria. The median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores for SLT, RR, and rRFA were 10.7, 7.2, and 8.3, respectively (P
