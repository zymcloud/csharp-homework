The location of the sigmoid colon varies within the abdominal cavity, but its mesocolon is fixed to the left side. Right side fixation of the sigmoid colon is a very rare congenital positional anomaly. In addition, it has been reported that hepatocolic fistula is also a very rare disease that may present lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Here, the authors describe a case of a 71-year-old man who underwent surgery for hepato-sigmoidocolic fistula complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma and the right side fixation of the sigmoid colon.
