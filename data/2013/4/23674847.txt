Aim:To investigate outcomes of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Methods:Four hundred and forty patients referred between 2000 and 2002 for management of HCCs were categorized according to their CKD stage, i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 90 (stage 1), 60-90 (stage 2), 30-60 (stage 3), 15-30 (stage 4), and Results:Most HCC patients with CKD were elderly, with mean age of diagnosis of 60.6 ± 11.9 years, and mostly male (74.8%). Hepatitis B, C and B and C co-infection virus were positive in 61.6%, 45.7% and 14.1% of the patients, respectively. It was found that patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD were not only older (P = 0.001), but also had higher hepatitis C virus carrier rate (P = 0.001), lower serum albumin level (P = 0.001), lower platelet count (P = 0.037), longer prothrombin time (P = 0.001) as well as higher proportions of advanced cirrhosis (P = 0.002) and HCCs (P = 0.001) than patients with stages 1 and 2 CKD. At the end of analysis, 162 (36.9%) patients had died. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD suffered lower cumulative survival than stages 1 and 2 CKD (log-rank test, χ² = 11.764, P = 0.003). In a multivariate Cox-regression model, it was confirmed that CKD stage [odds ratio (OR) = 1.988, 95%CI: 1.012-3.906, P = 0.046)], liver cirrhosis stage (OR = 3.571, 95%CI: 1.590-8.000, P = 0.002) and serum albumin level (OR = 0.657, 95%CI: 0.491-0.878, P = 0.005) were significant predictors for mortality in this population.Conclusion:HCC patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD had inferior survival than stages 1 and 2 CKD. This warrants further studies.
