Purpose:To assess whether gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced MR imaging could predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis in small arterial enhancing-only nodules detected by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in patients with liver cirrhosis.Materials and methods:We prospectively recruited 125 cirrhotic patients (67 males, and 58 females; age: 68 Â± 12.36 years) with 151 small (Results:Final diagnoses included 115 benign nodules and 36 HCCs. Nodule T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, PVP-EP hypointensity, and HP hypointensity were the best predictors of HCC on univariate analysis. Nodule T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, and HP hypointensity, were independent predictors of HCC on multivariate analysis.Conclusion:Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MR imaging provides imaging findings which may predict a diagnosis of HCC in small arterial enhancing-only nodules in cirrhotic patients.
