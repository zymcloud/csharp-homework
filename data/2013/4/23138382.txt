Objectives:To determine the importance of arterial enhancement in diagnosing small (Methods:Eighty-six patients with 135 pathologically confirmed small (Results:Arterial enhancement demonstrated high positive predictive value (PPV) (96.5-98.9 %) and specificity (90.3-96.8 %), but low negative predictive value (NPV) (54.6-62.5 %) and intermediate sensitivity (76-79.8 %) for diagnosing small HCCs. Diagnostic performance was highest for subtraction imaging. There were significant differences among the three methods in sensitivity (P = 0.04), accuracy (P = 0.044), PPV (P Conclusion:The accurate detection of arterial enhancement in small hepatic nodules is important for diagnosing HCC and may be enhanced by subtraction imaging.
