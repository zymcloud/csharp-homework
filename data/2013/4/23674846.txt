Aim:To evaluate a new immunohistological marker, annexin A1 (ANXA1), in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Expression of ANXA1 protein was investigated in liver tissues from patients with CCA and HCC by immunohistochemistry. Its expression on differences stages of tumor development was investigated in hamster CCA tissues induced by Opisthorchis viverrini and N-nitrosodimethylamine. Moreover, mRNA expression of ANXA1 was assessed in CCA cell lines by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and silencing of ANXA1 gene expression using small interfering RNA.Results:In human CCA tissue arrays, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the positive expression of ANXA1 was 94.1% (64/68 cases) consisting of a high expression (66.2%, 45/68 cases) and a low expression (33.8%, 23/68 cases). However, expression of ANXA1 protein was negative in all histologic patterns for HCC (46/46 cases) and healthy individuals (6/6 cases). In hamster with opisthorchiasis-associated CCA, the expression of ANXA1 was observed in the cytoplasm of inflammatory cells, bile duct epithelia and tumor cells. Grading scores of ANXA1 expression were significantly increased with tumor progression. In addition, mRNA expression of ANXA1 significantly increased in all of the various CCA cell lines tested compared to an immortalized human cholangiocyte cell line (MMNK1). Suppressing the ANXA1 gene significantly reduced the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP9, and transforming growth factor-β genes, but increased nuclear factor-κB gene expression.Conclusion:ANXA1 is highly expressed in CCA, but low in HCC, suggesting it may serve as a new immunohistochemical marker of CCA. ANXA1 may play a role in opisthorchiasis-associated cholangiocarcinogenesis.
