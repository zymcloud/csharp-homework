Objectives:This study aimed to describe a single-center experience with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) features as well as the diagnostic role and clinical impact of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and Trucut biopsy (EUS-TCB) in patients with pancreatic metastases.Methods:Demographic, clinical, EUS, pathological, clinical outcome, and follow-up data of patients who underwent EUS at our institution between October 1998 and March 2010 for a known or suspected pancreatic metastasis were abstracted.Results:Forty-nine patients (23 males; median age, 63 years; range 30-83 years) with 72 pancreatic masses were identified. Primary tumor sites included kidney (21), lung (8), skin (6), colon (4), breast (3), small bowel (2), stomach (2), liver (1), ovary (1), and bladder (1). Of the 72 pancreatic lesions, EUS-FNA of 49 was performed (median, 4.1 passes; range, 2-9 passes) without complications. An EUS-TCB after EUS-FNA was performed in 2 patients and confirmed renal cell carcinoma in one and was nondiagnostic in one. The EUS-FNA provided the first diagnosis of "recurrent malignancy" in all the 44 patients at a median time of 65 months (range, 1-348 months) after diagnosis of the primary tumor.Conclusions:Endoscopic ultrasound-FNA and EUS-TCB may assist with the cytological diagnosis of pancreatic metastases and may have a major clinical impact.
