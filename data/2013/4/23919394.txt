Primary liver cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers, and the main current treatments have a poor prognosis. This study aims to examine the efficiency of baculovirus vectors for transducing target gene into liver cancer cells and to evaluate the feasibility of using baculovirus vectors to deliver the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) gene as a reporter gene through co-vector administration approach to monitor the expression of the target therapeutic gene in liver cancer gene therapy. We constructed (green fluorescent protein) GFP- and NIS-expressing baculovirus vectors (Bac-GFP and Bac-NIS), and measured the baculovirus transduction efficiency in HepG2 cells and other tumor cells (A549, SW1116 and 8505C), and it showed that the transduction efficiency and target gene expression level rose with increasing viral multiplicity of infection (MOI) in HepG2 cells, and HepG2 cells had a significantly higher transduction efficiency (60.8% at MOI = 200) than other tumor cells. Moreover, the baculovirus transduction was not cytotoxic to HepG2 cells at a higher MOI (MOI 5 400). We also performed dynamic iodide uptake trials, and found that Bac-NIS-transduced HepG2 cells exhibited efficient iodide uptake which could be inhibited by sodium perchlorate (NaClOâ‚„). And we measured the correlation of fluorescent intensities and 125I uptake amount in HepG2 cells after co-vector administration with Bac-NIS and Bac-GFP at different MOIs, and found a high correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.8447), which provides a good basis for successfully evaluating the feasibility of baculovirus-mediated NIS reporter gene monitoring target gene expression in liver cancer therapy. Therefore, this study indicates that baculovirus vector is a potential vehicle for delivering therapeutic genes in studying liver cancer cells. And it is feasible to use a baculovirus vector to deliver NIS gene as a reporter gene to monitor the expression of target genes. It therefore provides an effective approach and a good basis for future baculovirus-mediated therapeutic gene delivering or therapeutic gene expression monitoring in liver cancer cells studies.
