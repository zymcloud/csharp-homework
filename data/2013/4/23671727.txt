Aim:To investigate the effect of MEK/ERK1/2 pathway on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARγ) agonist-induced alterations in Δ6-desaturase (Δ6D) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2.Methods:HepG2 cells cultured in RPMI-1640 were exposed to the commonly used ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor PD98059 and PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone. Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed from treated cells. Changes in gene expression and metabolites ratio, as activity index for Δ6D and SCD1, were then determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and gas liquid chromatography, respectively.Results:The expression of both Δ6D (P = 0.03) and SCD1 (P = 0.01) increased following PD98059 treatment, with a higher impact on SCD1 (24.5% vs 62.5%). Although pioglitazone increased the mRNA level (1.47 ± 0.10 vs 0.88 ± 0.02, P = 0.006) and activity index (1.40 ± 0.07 vs 0.79 ± 0.11, P Conclusion:PPARγ and ERK1/2 signaling pathway affect differentially and may have inhibitory crosstalk effects on the genes expression of ∆6D and SCD1, and subsequently on their enzymatic activities.
