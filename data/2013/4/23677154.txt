Introduction:The development of malignancies is a problem associated with HIV infection. The incidence and spectrum of malignancies has been modified with the addition of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).Aim:To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and prognosis of HIV patients who have developed a malignancy.Methods:Retrospective observational study was conducted in HIV + patients who developed a malignancy between 1993-2010 in a referral hospital. AIDS-defining malignancies (ADN) and non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADN) were compared.Results:125 patients were identified with at least one malignancy. The most frequent malignancies were: non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n; 39; 30.2%), Kaposi's sarcoma (n: 20; 15.5%), Hodgkin's disease (n: 11; 8.8%), lung cancer (n: 20; 15.5%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (n: 9; 6.9 %). The mean age was 42 Â± 11 years, 84% male, 55.8% were coinfected with HBV and or HCV. The risk behaviors were: 45.6% intravenous drug users, 16.8% men who have sex with men and 20% heterosexuals). There were 67 (52%) NADN and 62 (48%) ADN; NADN patients had a longer story of HIV infection and longer exposure to HAART, better level of immunodeficiency and better virological control than ADN patients. Four patients developed a second malignancy. Overall survival was 34.7%.Conclusions:We found an increased incidence of NADN, appearing in patients with better virological and immunological control than ADN group. Mortality of patients with HIV infection and malignancy is still very high.
