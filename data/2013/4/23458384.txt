Objectives:This study describes changes in the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) registered with the Scottish Cancer Registry between 1985 and 2008.Methods:Data on patients diagnosed with HCC were extracted from the Scottish Cancer Registry, along with linked data on treatment and risk factors for liver disease. One-, 3- and 5-year relative survival rates were calculated for each time period and a Cox regression model was used to assess the impact of prior admissions on survival.Results:The incidence of HCC increased between 1985 and 2008. The proportion of patients with prior alcohol-related admissions rose over the time period studied from 16.0% to 27.1%. Five-year relative survival increased in women between 1985-1989 and 2005-2007 from 0.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0-3.7] to 10.6% (95% CI 5.2-18.1). In men, 5-year relative survival increased from 0.4% (95% CI 0.2-2.2) to 4.4% (95% CI 1.5-9.9). Regression analysis showed that older age, history of alcohol-related admissions and deprivation were associated with lower survival, and hospitalization for viral hepatitis was associated with higher survival.Conclusions:Against the background of an increasing incidence of HCC in Scotland, survival times have increased substantially.
