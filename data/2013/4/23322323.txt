Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) represents the most important biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to identify the optimal staging system to predict the survival of AFP-negative and AFP-positive patients. This study analyzed the data of 431 AFP-negative HCC patients who had previously undergone surgery and 471 AFP-positive HCC candidates. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival estimates were plotted, and the P values were assessed using log-rank tests. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was calculated using the results of a Cox's regression to compare the overall assessment of the seven different staging systems. The AFP-positive group displayed characteristics of poor tumor biological behavior (tumor multiplicity [P = 0.032], low grade differentiation [P = 0.000] and carcinoma cell embolus [P = 0.031]), poor liver function (Child-Pugh B classification [P = 0.003], abnormal prothrombin time activity [P = 0.037] and moderate/severe cirrhosis [P = 0.000]) and increased operative difficulties (transfusion; P = 0.001). TNM7th staging showed the lowest AIC value (1,279.528) for the AFP-negative group, while the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system revealed the lowest AIC value (1,991.233) for the AFP-positive group. In conclusion, among the seven favorable staging systems, BCLC staging was superior for the AFP-positive group, while the TNM7th was a more appropriate staging model for the AFP-negative group.
