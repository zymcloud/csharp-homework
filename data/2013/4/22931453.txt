Background:Caudate resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a challenging procedure. This study aimed to assess the surgical outcomes of HCC originating from caudate lobe.Methods:Twenty-three patients with HCC in the caudate lobe who received surgical treatment were retrospectively reviewed.Results:Surgical procedures included 13 isolated caudatectomy (56.5%) and 10 combined caudatectomy (43.5%). Eight patients (34.7%) experienced post-operative complications. Mortality was nil. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates after surgery were 90.1%, 60% and 37%, respectively. Isolated caudatectomy was associated with less frequent tumours located in paracaval portion, longer operative time, longer vascular occlusion time and more blood loss than combined caudatectomy (P Conclusion:Surgical resection is feasible and beneficial for patients with HCC in the caudate lobe. If liver functional reserve is sufficient, combined caudatectomy is preferred.
