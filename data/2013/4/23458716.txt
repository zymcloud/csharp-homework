Objective:The prognosis for gastric carcinoma patients with liver metastasis is very poor. This retrospective study investigated the prognostic significance of MK-1 expression in gastric carcinoma patients with liver metastasis.Methods:Immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibody FU-MK-1 against MK-1 antigen was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues from 64 gastric carcinoma patients with liver metastasis. We attempted to determine the presence of any relationship between pathological prognostic factors and the expression of MK-1 in 64 gastric carcinoma patients with liver metastasis.Results:MK-1 expression was found in 43 (67%) of 64 tumor samples. MK-1 expression was significantly higher in the intestinal type (73%) than in the diffuse type carcinoma (33%, P = 0.049). Multivariate analysis showed that MK-1 expression and lymph node metastasis were significant factors for overall survival. The difference between overall survival rates with positive or negative MK-1 expression was statistically significant as shown by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P < 0.0001; log-rank). In addition, the difference between cumulative disease-free survival rates with positive or negative MK-1 expression in gastric carcinoma patients with metachronous liver metastasis was statistically significant as well, as shown by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P = 0.0006; log-rank).Conclusions:The prognostic significance of MK-1 expression as a biological tumor marker was demonstrated in a series of gastric carcinoma patients with liver metastasis. MK-1 positivity may be a reliable marker for predicting and taking measures to control liver metastasis after curative gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma.
