Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly chemoresistant cancer with no effective systemic therapy. Despite of surgical or locoregional therapies, prognosis remains poor because of high tumor recurrence or progression, and currently, there are no well-established effective adjuvant therapies. Glypican-3 (GPC-3) is specifically overexpressed in hepatoma and perhaps is a valuable molecular target for HCC therapy. In this present study, the effect of silencing GPC-3 gene transcription on human HepG2 cell proliferation was investigated by constructing GPC-3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid. After HepG2 cells were transfected with the most efficient shRNA, GPC-3 mRNA expression (90.4 %) was inhibited significantly and estimated by fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and the result was accordance with downregulation at the protein level. The percentage of the cell proliferation was down to 28.9 % in the shRNA group and 19.9 % in the shRNA plus sorafenib group. The cell cycles were arrested in the G1 phase (65.6 %) and the apoptosis rate was increasing (66.75 %) in the shRNA1 group with significant alteration compared with that in the negative-shRNA group. Specific shRNA might intervene effectively GPC-3 activation and inhibit tumor cell proliferation, suggesting that GPC-3 gene should be a potential molecular target for HCC therapy.
