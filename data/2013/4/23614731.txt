Carcinogenicity of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE) was examined by an inhalation exposure of F344 rats and BDF1 mice of both sexes to TCE at 0, 200, 800 or 3200 ppm for 6 h/d, 5 d/week for 104 weeks. In male rats, the incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and peritoneal mesotheliomas were significantly increased in the 800 and 3200 ppm-exposed groups, respectively. The incidence of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas in the 3200 ppm-exposed groups exceeded the range of historical control data in the Japan Bioassay Research Center. In female rats, the tumor incidences were not increased in any organs of the TCE-exposed groups. In male mice, a significant positive trend with dose was shown for incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar carcinomas, combined incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas/carcinomas and hepatocellular adenomas. The incidence of Harderian gland adenomas was significantly increased in the 3200 ppm-exposed group, and malignant lymphomas of spleen at this highest dose exceeded the range of historical control data. In female mice, the combined incidence of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas/carcinomas was significantly increased in the 3200 ppm-exposed group, and the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and combined incidences of hepatocellular adenomas/carcinomas were significantly increased in the 200, 800 and 3200 ppm-exposed groups with dose dependence except the combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas/carcinomas in the 200 ppm-exposed group. The incidences of bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas in the 3200 ppm-exposed group and combined incidences of hepatocellular adenomas/carcinomas in the 200 ppm-exposed groups exceeded the ranges of historical control data. Thus, this study provided clear evidence of inhalation carcinogenicity for TCE in both rats and mice.
