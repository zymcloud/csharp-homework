Background/aims:Serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) and total tumor volume (TTV) are important factors linked with post-operative tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. We investigated the role of a new prognostic marker, AFP-to-TTV ratio, in predicting HCC recurrence.Methods:A total of 655 HCC patients undergoing resection were analyzed.Results:In the multivariate logistic model, serum AFP level [odds ratio (OR) 32.459, p = 0.012] and TTV (OR 0.006, p = 0.01) were independently associated with a higher AFT/TTV ratio. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year tumor recurrence rates were 29 %, 55 %, and 68 %, respectively. In the Cox proportional hazards model, alcoholism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.354, p = 0.028), international normalized ratio of prothrombin time ≥1.01 (HR, 1.349, p Conclusion:The AFP/TTV ratio, a newly proposed marker for predicting post-operative tumor recurrence in HCC, is a feasible surrogate and may be useful in selecting super-high-risk patients for tumor recurrence.
