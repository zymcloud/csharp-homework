Objective:To establish an intrahepatic xenograft tumor model in nude mice and dynamically monitor the tumor growth by in vivo fluorescence imaging system.Methods:We first transfected the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-Luc to constructe the PLC/PRF/5 cell line which stably expressed luciferase, and then injected the cell line into the liver of nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored dynamically using in vivo fluorescence imaging system. The fluorescence-positive mouse was dissected to observe the tumor. Immunofluoresence histochemistry was used to detect the expression of HBsAg in Xenografe.Results:In the nude mouse model bearing intrahepatic xenograft tumor, robust fluorescence was detected where the PLC/PRF/5 cells were injected. Xenograft was observed in the liver by dissecting the fluorescence-positive mouse. The expression of HBsAg in xenograft tissues was confirmed.Conclusion:Intrahepatic xenograft tumor model in nude mice has been established successfully, which offers a tool for therapeutic development and evaluation of anti-hepatocelluar carcinoma drugs.
