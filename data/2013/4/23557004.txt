Background:Mesohepatectomy with total resection of the caudate lobe and extrahepatic bile duct is sometimes performed for hilar cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma; however, only a few reports on mesohepatectomy with total caudate lobectomy of the liver for hepatocellular carcinoma are available.Methods:A 71-year-old woman was preoperatively diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in the central bisections (Couinaud's segments 4, 5, and 8) and the paracaval portion of the caudate lobe. Mesohepatectomy with total caudate lobectomy of the liver permitted the removal of tumors to provide a cancer-free raw surface of the liver. Mobilization of the caudate lobe is an important procedure in this surgery. Before the liver parenchyma was dissected, all short hepatic veins were ligated and divided from the left to the right side as the left lateral section was retracted to the right, and the caudate lobe branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery were ligated and divided. After the liver parenchymal dissection, both between the left lateral and medial sections and between the right anterior and posterior sections, the Glissonean branches of the caudate lobe were ligated and divided as the central bisections were anteriorly retracted. Finally, liver parenchymal dissection was performed between the caudate lobe and the right posterior section, which was along the right side of the inferior vena cava.Results:The surgery time was 538 minutes and blood loss was 1,207 mL. No blood transfusions were required during or after surgery. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. The patient is still alive 25 months after hepatectomy.Conclusion:Although mesohepatectomy with total caudate lobectomy of the liver is technically more difficult than mesohepatectomy of the liver because the caudate lobe must be completely detached from the inferior vena cava and the hilar plate, it is a safe and effective treatment method in selected patients with hepatocellular carcinoma located at both the central bisections and the paracaval portion of the caudate lobe.
