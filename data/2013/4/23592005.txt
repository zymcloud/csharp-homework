Purposes:This substudy aimed to examine the changes in biomarkers for cardiac injury in patients who received neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide with concurrent celecoxib (FEC-C).Methods:Thirty-four female patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced breast cancer preoperatively received 3 cycles of FEC-C (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) with concurrent celecoxib (400 mg bid). Blood samples were drawn from patients on day (D) 0, D3, D21, D42, and D63 (end of therapy), and the serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and plasma levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal prohormone brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured with commercially available test kits.Results:All patients tolerated this regimen well. Neither life-threatening toxicity nor clinical symptoms of cardiac damage were observed. Serum LDH increased significantly from baseline after 3 cycles of FEC-C (p<0.0001), but the change was possibly brought about by chemotherapy-induced liver derangement. However, NT-proBNP decreased significantly (p=0.009), while cTnI increased nonsignificantly (p=0.078) after 3 cycles of FEC-C compared to baseline, although this increase was still regarded as normal.Conclusions:Short-term use of the FEC-C regimen has proven to be effective in locally advanced breast cancer, with an acceptable cardiac safety profile.
