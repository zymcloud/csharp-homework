In this study, a polysaccharide (ACP-a1), with a molecular weight of 3.2×10(5)Da, was successfully purified and identified from the roots of Aconitum coreanum (Lèvl.) Rapaics. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis indicated that ACP-a1 was mainly composed of β-d-mannose and β-d-glucose in a molar ratio of 1.2:3.5. The effects of ACP-a1 on the tumor growth and immune function were assessed in hepatoma H22 bearing mice. Results showed that ACP-a1 significantly inhibited the growth of hepatoma H22 transplanted in mice and prolonged the survival time of H22 tumor-bearing mice. Besides, the body weight, peripheral white blood cells (WBC), thymus index and spleen index of H22 tumor-bearing were also improved after ACP-a1 treatment. Furthermore, ACP-a1 could promote the secretion of serum cytokines in H22 tumor-bearing mice, such as IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ. Taken together, our results indicate that ACP-a1 inhibits tumor growth in vivo at least partly via improving immune responses of host organism, and seems to be safe and effective as a novel agent with immunomodulatory activity for the use of anti-tumor therapy.
