The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increases with the advancement of chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis C or B. The recurrence rate is very high and causes disease progression to an advanced stage. Recent development of molecularly targeted agents for the treatment of advanced HCC has dramatically changed the chemotherapies used for this disease. We summarize the current findings on several drugs that are commonly used for the treatment of advanced HCC including sorafenib and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapies.
