Balloon-occluded transarterial chemoembolization (B-TACE) is able to achieve denser accumulation of Lipiodol emulsion (LE) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than conventional TACE. However, to maximize the therapeutic effect of B-TACE, it is imperative to understand the hemodynamic changes that occur during arterial occlusion. We here present two patients with HCC in whom the hemodynamic changes during arterial occlusion were depicted and evaluated by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Arterial flow beyond the catheter tip was observed by CEUS even after balloon occlusion. In one patient, a reduction in arterial blood flow in the HCC was observed by CEUS during balloon occlusion of the target area for embolization. After B-TACE, dense LE accumulation in the HCC nodule was confirmed by flat-panel detector CT, indicating an excellent therapeutic effect. In the other patient, no changes in arterial blood flow in the HCC nodule were observed by CEUS during balloon occlusion of the target area for embolization. After B-TACE, intermediate LE accumulation in the HCC nodule was confirmed by flat-panel detector CT, indicating an incomplete therapeutic effect. The findings obtained in the two patients presented here suggest that B-TACE can be performed more effectively and reliably by monitoring blood flow using CEUS.
