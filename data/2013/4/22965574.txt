Background:Compensated cirrhotic patients with single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤5 cm may benefit from both liver resection (LR) and liver transplantation (LT); however, the better 10-year actuarial survival of the two treatments remains unclear. We aimed to assess the long-term outcome of cirrhotic patients with single HCC ≤5 cm treated either with LR or LT on an intention-to-treat basis.Methods:A total of 217 cirrhotic patients with single HCC ≤5 cm were evaluated at our department: 95 were treated with LR (LR group), and 122 were included on the waiting list for LT (LT group). Patients in the LR group were divided into very early HCC (tumor size ≤2 cm) and early HCC (tumor size >2 cm). Median follow-up was 5.3 (range 0.1-18) years.Results:Tumor recurrence was 72 % in the LR group versus 16 % in the LT group (p Conclusions:LR should be the treatment of choice for cirrhotic patients with very early HCC.
