We explore the possible cellular cytotoxic activity of an amphiphilic silicon(IV) phthalocyanine with axially ligated rhodamine B under ambient light experimental environment as well as its in vivo antitumour potential using Hep3B hepatoma cell model. After loading into the Hep3B hepatoma cells, induction of cellular cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest were detected. Strong growth inhibition of tumour xenograft together with significant tumour necrosis and limited toxicological effects exerted on the nude mice could be identified.
