Objective:To observe wether pSIREN-survivin/shRNA can induce the apoptosis and inhibit it's growth of nude mice xenograft tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell.Method:Subcutaneous tumors in athymic mice were induced by inoculation of NPC and divided into the blank group A, the negative group B,the experimental group C randomly. PBS,the negative and positive pSIREN-survivin/shRNA were injected into the subcutaneous tumors poly site. The inhibition ratio was measured by the tumor size calculation after inoculation. The expression of survivin in the xenograft tumor was observed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The cell apoptosis in tumor tissues was detected by TEM. The liver and kidney function was tested by blood routine test.Result:The inhibition ratio of group C and group B was (52. 11 +/- 1. 03)%, (2. 15 0. 11)% respectively, the inhibition rate in expression level of survivin mRNA was (77. 5+/-2. 03) %, (1. 39+/-0. 14) % respectively. The dyeing of survivin was more shallow in group C, the intensity is also less than group B. Nuclear chromatin was deepened, split into pieces, flake, and nuclear membrane was surrounded to edge. Cytoplasmic color and density were deepened, and organelles such as mitochondria was disappeared, the microscopic changes of cellular apoptosis at the earlier stage were watched, the difference of the function in liver and kidney was not statistically in statistical.Conclusion:The expression of survivin in xenograft tumor was significantly inhibited by pshRNA-survivin/shRNA,the apoptosis of tumor cells was accelerated and the growth speed of NPC cells in xenograft tumor was retarded. The high expression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma's gene could significantly be silenced by using technology of RNAi, the growth of tumors could be inhibited also. Its a novel treatment that have a good prospect.
