Introduction:Liver transplantation modifies the natural history of end-stage liver diseases and stabilizes the course of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. An evaluation of its long-term results allows insight and awareness of factors that impact survival.Patients and methods:We included 150 consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation between October 1992 and January 1998. The impact of disease, cold ischemic time, ABO compatibility, acute and chronic rejection episodes, and vascular, biliary and infectious complications on survival were compared.Results:We included 65 patients (43.3%) with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, 41 (27.3%) with cirrhosis, 12 (8%) with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 11 (7.3%) with acute hepatic failure. The mean age was 39 years. The mean cold ischemic time was 493 Â± 161 minutes. There were 115 (77.2%) ABO-identical transplants; 25 (16.8%) were ABO compatible, and 9 (6%) were ABO incompatible. Acute cellular rejection occurred in 88 recipients (58.7%); chronic rejection was diagnosed in 9 (6%). Complications included vascular (16.7% patients; n = 25) and biliary (38.7%; n = 58). Infections were bacterial in 92 (61.3%), fungal in 35 (23.3%), and cytomegalovirus in 9 (6%). The survival rates were 78% at 1 year, 68.7% at 5 years, and 58% at 10 years. Of the 150 patients, 82 survived until November 2011. Follow-up ranged from 13 to 19 years. In this study, only bacterial infections had a negative influence on patients' survival (P = .014).Conclusion:The high frequency of biliary and vascular complications was associated with increased morbidity but not mortality. Bacterial infections were related to an ominous outcome, being responsible for short- and long-term mortality.
