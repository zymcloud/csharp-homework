Objective:Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, this large population-based study was conducted to explore the incidences and risk factors of post-transplant malignancy in Asian renal transplant recipients.Patients and methods:A total of 642 patients who firstly underwent renal transplant between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008 were identified from a 2 million cohort. The primary endpoint was a subsequent hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of malignancy (ICD-9-CM code: 140.xx-239.xx) after renal transplantation. All patients were followed until the occurrence of endpoints or the end of the study (December 31, 2010), whichever came first. Adjusted risks of post-transplant cancer were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression model. All models were adjusted for baseline characteristics, comorbid diseases, transplant year, and exposure to immunosuppressive agents.Results:Among 642 renal transplant patients, 54 cancers (8.4 %) were identified. The median time between transplant and cancer diagnosis was 46.2 (range 8.5-107.4) months. Cancers of kidney and other unspecified urinary organs was the most common cancer sites, accounted for 18.5 % of the malignancies diagnosed. The next most common cancer sites were trachea, bronchus, and lung (14.8 %), bladder (13.0 %), liver and intrahepatic bile ducts (11.1 %), colon (5.6 %), and prostate (5.6 %). Age at transplantation was a statistically significant risk factor of post-transplant cancer in our study. Increased risks of post-transplant cancer were observed in patients who received immunosuppression agents (cyclosporine (HR 1.26, 95 % CI 0.58-2.77, p = 0.5603), tacrolimus (HR 1.99, 95 % CI 0.66-6.00, p = 0.2197), and mycophenolate (HR 1.00, 95 % CI 0.40-2.45, p = 0.9874)) although the estimates were not statistically significant.Conclusions:Our population-based cohort study offers additional insight into post-transplant cancers in Asian population. Further studies are warranted to assess the association between specific immunosuppression agents and post-transplant cancers.
