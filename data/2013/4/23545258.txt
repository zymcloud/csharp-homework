The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a challenge and the future of cancer therapy will incorporate rational combinations directed to molecular targets that cooperate to drive critical pro-survival signaling. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) has been shown to regulate various processes important for cancer progression. Given the up-regulated expression of SphK1 in response to the silence of N-ras and other interactions between Ras/ERK and SphK1, it was speculated that combined inhibition of Ras/ERK and SphK1 would create enhanced antitumor effects. Experimental results showed that dual blockage of N-ras/ERK and SphK1 resulted in enhanced growth inhibitions in human hepatoma cells. Similarly, MEK1/2 Inhibitor U0126 potentiated SKI II-induced apoptosis in hepatoma HepG2 cells, consistently with the further attenuation of Akt/ERK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. It was also shown that the combination of SKI II and U0126 further attenuated the migration of hepatoma HepG2 cells via FAK/MLC-2 signaling pathway. Taken together, the dual inhibition of SphK1 and Ras/ERK pathway resulted in enhanced effects, which might be an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC.
