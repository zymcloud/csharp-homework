Aberrant expression of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) has been reported to be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of various classes of malignancies. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been completely clarified. In the current study, we have investigated the clinical significance and the in vitro contribution of miR-34a on biological functions of human HCCs. miR-34a expression in eighty-three cases of HCC formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues decreased significantly compared to that in the adjacent liver tissues (P
