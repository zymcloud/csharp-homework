Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by high resistance to conventional systemic therapies, rapid progression, easy metastasis and frequent recurrence. There is therefore an urgent requirement to develop novel systemic agents which specifically target hepatoma-associated antigen in the tumors of HCC patients. CD147, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is highly expressed by HCC cells and is strongly associated with HCC progression and prognosis. CD147 in HCC cells modulates HCC growth, promotes invasion and metastasis by stimulating adjacent fibroblasts and HCC cells to produce elevated levels of several extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the HCC microenvironment. It is also involved in HCC angiogenesis and multidrug resistance (MDR). Clinical progress has been made in HCC treatment using CD147-directed monoclonal antibodies. Here, we give an overview of the literature regarding the molecular features and expression of CD147 in human HCC tissues. We specifically focus on the role of CD147 in HCC invasion and metastasis, as well as in angiogenesis and multidrug resistance. In addition, advances in therapeutic strategies targeting HCC CD147 are summarized.
