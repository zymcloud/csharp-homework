Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib in patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:79 patients with large HCC(larger than 10 cm in diameter)were enrolled from July 2008 to June 2012 for this retrospective study. 24 patients undertaken TACE combined with sorafenib as T + S group. 35 patients undertaken TACE alone as T group, and other 20 patients treated with sorafenib alone as S group.Results:The median survival time was 15 months in T + S group, 10 months in T group, and 5 months in S group, respectively (P = 0.000). The median time of tumor progress was 6 months, 3 months and 2.5 months, respectively (P = 0.000). The most common adverse events related to sorafenib in group T + S group and S group alone were hand foot skin reaction, diarrhea and alopecia. The incidence rate of adverse events related to sorafenib was no significant difference between two groups. There was no 4 or more grade adverse event occurred in each group. The most common complications related to interventional treatment in group T + S group and T group alone were mild jaundice, ascites, inguinal region hematoma. The incidence rate of complications related to interventional treatment was no significant difference between two groups.Conclusion:The combination of TACE and sorafenib in patients with large HCC is well tolerated and safe, which is available to delay tumor progression and prolong survival.
