Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is epidemiologically associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its role in HCC remains poorly understood due to technological limitations. In this study, we systematically characterize HBV in HCC patients.

In the tumors, preferential integration of HBV into promoters of genes (P
