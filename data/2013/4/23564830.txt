We describe the case of an 80-year-old man with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who developed tracheal obstruction due to peritracheal lymph node metastasis. A metastatic tumor that protruded into the airway was ablated using a neodymium yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser and then a self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) was deployed in the trachea. Stenting resolved symptoms of severe dyspnea upon mild exertion and in the supine position. Three months later, the patient is alive and has resumed normal activities as an outpatient, despite having metastatic HCC. Peritracheal lymph node metastasis arising from HCC is very rare and a polypoid tumor growing from a metastatic lymph node into the trachea is also extremely unusual. Tracheal obstruction in this patient was successfully treated by airway stenting.
