Biomarkers that enable an accurate diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced liver diseases are necessary to prevent subsequent patient morbidity and suffering from the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In particular, the identification of novel biomarkers for liver cirrhosis (LC) will be an important new diagnostic tool since more than 70% of HCV-induced LCs are destined to develop into HCC. In our current study, we performed a search for new serological protein biomarkers of HCV-induced chronic hepatitis (CH), LC and HCC, using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). The disease-affected spots were subsequently identified as isoforms of protein components of haptoglobin, transthyretin, the haptoglobin Î±-chain and apolipoprotein A-IV (apo A-IV), and in specific instances were significantly reduced in LC (p
