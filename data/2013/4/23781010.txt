Objective:Prognostic markers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could help in the clinical management and understanding of its poor prognosis. S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4) is directly involved in tumour metastasis. This study evaluated S100A4 gene expression in human HCC, to identify its role in tumour progression.Methods:In this retrospective study, S100A4 protein levels in HCC samples from Chinese patients were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and compared with paired normal tumour-adjacent tissue samples (controls). All patients were evaluated for HCC recurrence.Results:S100A4 levels were significantly increased in HCC samples compared with controls (n = 72, each sample type). Moderately or poorly differentiated tumours had significantly higher levels of S100A4 protein than well-differentiated tumours, and those with tumour vascular invasion showed significantly higher S100A4 levels than those without invasion. Risk of recurrence increased in patients positive for S100A4, and S100A4 positivity correlated with a shorter overall survival time.Conclusion:This pilot study suggests S100A4 as a likely tumour marker for HCC that correlates with tumour differentiation, invasion, recurrence and overall survival. S100A4 could be a useful marker of tumour aggressiveness and prognosis.
