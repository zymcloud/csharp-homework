Aims:To evaluate the role of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as an ablative technique in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Settings and design:A tertiary care center, prospective study.Materials and methods:The subjects comprised 31 patients (30 males, one female; age range 32-75 years) with HCC (41 lesions) who were treated with image-guided RFA. The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 6 years, and included a multiphasic computed tomography (CT) at 1, 3 and 6 months post-RFA, and every 6 months thereafter. Patient outcome was evaluated and the tumor recurrence, survival and complications were assessed.Statistical analysis used:Discrete categorical data were presented as n (%) and continuous data as mean Â± SD. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between the different variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Log-rank test were used to test the significance of difference between the survival time of the different groups.Results:The ablation success rate was 80.5% (33/41 HCC lesions). 12.2% (5/41) of the lesions were managed with repeat RFA due to tumor residue. 4.9% (2/41) of the lesions were managed with repeated RFA and transarterial chemoembolization. Eight patients had tumor recurrence (five patients (16.1%) had local recurrence and three patients (9.6%) had distant recurrence). Eleven patients died within 3.5-20 months post-RFA. The survival rate at 1 year in patients who completed at least 1 year of follow-up was 63.3%. There was one major complication (1/31, 3.2%) in a patient with a subcapsular lesion and ascites. This patient developed hemoperitoneum in the immediate postprocedure period and was managed with endovascular treatment. She, however, had hepatic decompensation and died 48 h post-RFA.Conclusion:RFA is an effective and safe treatment for small unresectable HCC.
