Background:Sudan is classified among countries with a high hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) endemicity of more than 8%. Cross-sectional studies have showed a marked increase in the prevalence of occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) in patients with cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. In terms of OBI infectivity by transfusion, it is largely unknown whether residual risk estimates translate into true rates of infection.Aim:The current study aimed to determine the frequency of OBI among blood donors in Sudan.Materials and methods:This study was carried out during the period between 2011 and 2012. It included 100 HBsAg-negative blood donors who attended the Central Blood Bank in Sudan. Sera collected from all donors were tested for HBsAg, antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), antibodies against hepatitis Be antigen (anti-HBe), and antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Anti-HBc-positive patients were tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA.Results:The anti-HBc was detected in 42% of the blood donors, among whom 90.5% were positive for HBV-DNA. Two main profiles have been detected, namely, the presence of the three genes (S, C, and X genes) together in 35.7% of the blood donors or the presence of the X gene in addition to the core gene.Conclusion and recommendations:With the use of HBsAg as the sole detection marker for HBV, there is a danger of HBV transmission through blood transfusion. Anti-HBc testing should be added to the routine blood donor screening test if occult hepatitis B is to be diagnosed.
