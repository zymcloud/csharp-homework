Several different acquired resistance mechanisms of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy have been described, most recently transformation to small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). We describe the case of a 46-year-old female with relapsed EGFR exon 19 deletion lung adenocarcinoma treated with erlotinib, and on resistance, cisplatin-pemetrexed. Liver rebiopsy identified an afatinib-resistant combined SCLC and non-small cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine morphology, retaining the EGFR exon 19 deletion. This case highlights acquired EGFR-TKI resistance through transformation to the high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma spectrum and that that such transformation may not be evident at time of progression on TKI therapy.
