Aim:To assess the safety and efficacy of trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE) in very elderly patients.Methods:A prospective cohort study, from 2001 to 2010, compared clinical outcomes following TACE between patients â‰¥ 75 years old and younger patients (aged between 65 and 75 years and younger than 65 years) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), diagnosed according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria. The decision that patients were not candidates for curative therapy was made by a multidisciplinary HCC team. Data collected included demographics, co-morbidities, liver disease etiology, liver disease severity and the number of procedures. The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes included post-embolization syndrome (nausea, fever, abdominal right upper quadrant pain, increase in liver enzymes with no evidence of sepsis and with a clinical course limited to 3-4 d post procedure) and 30-d complications. Additionally, changes in liver enzyme measurements were assessed [alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase] in the week following TACE. Analysis employed both univariate and multivariate methods (Cox regression models).Results:Of 102 patients who underwent TACE as sole treatment, 10 patients (9.8%) were > 80 years old at diagnosis; 13 (12.7%) were between 75 and 80 years, 45 (44.1%) were between 65 and 75 years and 34 (33.3%) were younger than 65 years. Survival analysis demonstrated similar survival patterns between the elderly patients and younger patients. Age was also not associated with the adverse event rate. Survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years from diagnosis were 74%, 37% and 31% among patients Conclusion:TACE is safe and effective in very elderly patients with HCC, and is not associated with decreased survival or increased complication rates.
