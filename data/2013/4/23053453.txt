Purpose:To analyze Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) findings of nodules (low-grade dysplastic nodules-LGDNs; high-grade dysplastic nodules-HGDN, and hepatocellular carcinoma-HCC), histologically identified on cirrhotic, explanted livers.Methods:IRB approval was obtained for this study. Thirty-four patients underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR examinations (1.5T system), that included 20-min delayed hepatobiliary (HB) phase imaging, before undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT; mean time MR-OLT: 2.7 months). A total of 102 hepatic nodules were identified and analyzed at histopathological examination, and classified as LGDN, HGDN, and HCC. Two radiologists by consensus performed a quantitative (enhancement ratios, ERs) and a qualitative analyses of signal intensities of identified nodules on vascular dynamic phases (30-35 s after injection-arterial phase; 180-190 s after injection late phase) and on HB phases. Correlation between nodules MR patterns and histological classification was analyzed by means of dedicated statistical software.Results:No differences were appreciable among ERs of HGDN and HCCs on HB phase (P > 0.001). Lesions' enhancement on vascular dynamic and on HB phases significantly correlated to histological classification of nodules (P Conclusions:Hyperenhancement on arterial phase and hypointensity on late phase are the most specific clues for the diagnosis of HCC. Hypointensity on HB phase shows a PPV of 100% in suggesting nodular premalignancy/malignancy, independently from nodular dynamic vascular enhancement.
