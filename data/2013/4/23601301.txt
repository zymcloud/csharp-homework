Background:Targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) had become a research hotspot. Both of gefitinib and erlotinib had already been recommended as first line treatment in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant advanced NSCLC patients. The study aimed to compare the effectiveness and prognosis of advanced NSCLC with gefitinib or erlotinib, as well as the cost-effectiveness ratio of the two drugs.Methods:Data of 66 EGFR mutant NSCLC patients who were included in Guangzhou medical insurance were analyzed. The efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated. All the patients were followed-up regularly and the cost of the treatment was recorded.Results:The median progression free survival (PFS) of all patients was 15.0 months. 49 patients received gefintib and 17 patients had erlotinib. The PFS for the two groups of patients was 17.5 month and 13 months, respectively (P=0.459). 31 (62.3%) patients had rash in gefitinib group, 16 (94.1%) in erlotinib group. Cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) in gefitinib group was 3,027 RMB per month, while 6,800 RMB in erlotinib group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICEA) of erlotinib was 2.25 times of gefitinib.Conclusions:For EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC patients, equal efficacy and survival benefit were observed in patients with gefitinib and erlotinib. The adverse reaction was milder in gefitinib group than that of erlotinib group. And with Guangzhou medical insurance, gefitinib had a superior cost-effectiveness ratio.
