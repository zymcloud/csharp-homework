A 55-year-old Japanese female was admitted to our hospital to treat colon cancer. Computed tomography revealed a 2.6 Ã— 2.0 cm liver mass considered to be liver metastasis. She synchronously underwent right colectomy with D3 lymph node dissection and subsegmentectomy 8 under the diagnosis of advanced colon cancer with liver metastasis. The pathology examination revealed the liver nodule was pure squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), whereas histology of colon cancer was a well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma containing no squamous component. The patient underwent intensive checkup by imaging for a primary site of SCC. However, no lesion considered as possible primary site of SCC was found. Therefore, the liver nodule was finally diagnosed as a primary hepatic SCC. Primary SCC of the liver is a rare and high-grade malignant tumor. Recurrent multiple liver nodule was found at 13 months after surgery and the patient died of cancer 17 months after surgery.
