Background:The incidence of non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) in HIV-positive patients has increased over recent years. Most studies of the risk and spectrum of NADCs are primarily based on male populations, and only a few have provided specific information regarding females.Methods:We retrospectively analyzed all incident NADCs occurring in a cohort of HIV-positive patients followed up between 1985 and 2011. Incidence rates before and after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were examined using Poisson regression models. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to compare the cancer risk of HIV-infected subjects with that of the age- and gender-matched general population as estimated by the Milan Cancer Registry.Results:Five thousand nine hundred twenty-four patients (4382 men and 1542 women) contributed 50,990 person-years to the follow-up. Among them, 144 had new NADC diagnosis. The overall incidence increased from 1.0 case/1000 person-years in the pre-HAART period to 4.5 cases/1000 person-years in the HAART period (P < 0.01). In women, the risks were higher than expected in the case of cancer of the vulva (SIR = 69.2), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 7.5), anal cancer (SIR = 41.2), and lung cancer (SIR = 4.8). In men, the risks were higher than expected in the case of anal cancer (SIR = 91.5), Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 13.0), tonsil cancer (SIR = 10.9), lung cancer (SIR = 2.1), and liver cancer (SIR = 7.1).Conclusions:The spectrum and incidence of NADCs in our cohort increased over time. The incidence of NADCs, especially virus- and smoking-associated cancers, was significantly higher than expected in HIV-positive men and women.
