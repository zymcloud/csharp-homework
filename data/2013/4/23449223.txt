SOX9 encodes a transcription factor that presides over the specification and differentiation of numerous progenitor and differentiated cell types, and although SOX9 haploinsufficiency and overexpression cause severe diseases in humans, including campomelic dysplasia, sex reversal and cancer, the mechanisms underlying SOX9 transcription remain largely unsolved. We identify here an evolutionarily conserved enhancer located 70-kb upstream of mouse Sox9 and call it SOM because it specifically activates a Sox9 promoter reporter in most Sox9-expressing somatic tissues in transgenic mice. Moreover, SOM-null fetuses and pups reduce Sox9 expression by 18-37% in the pancreas, lung, kidney, salivary gland, gut and liver. Weanlings exhibit half-size pancreatic islets and underproduce insulin and glucagon, and adults slowly recover from acute pancreatitis due to a 2-fold impairment in Sox9 upregulation. Molecular and genetic experiments reveal that Sox9 protein dimers bind to multiple recognition sites in the SOM sequence and are thereby both necessary and sufficient for enhancer activity. These findings thus uncover that Sox9 directly enhances its functions in somatic tissue development and adult regeneration through SOM-mediated positive auto-regulation. They provide thereby novel insights on molecular mechanisms controlling developmental and disease processes and suggest new strategies to improve disease treatments.
