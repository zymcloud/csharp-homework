Background:The clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of thymic carcinoma have not been investigated in detail because of its rarity. The aim of this study was to elucidate the disease profile, outcomes, and prognostic factors for survival among patients with advanced thymic carcinoma treated with palliative-intent chemotherapy.Patients and methods:A retrospective review was conducted of the medical records of 40 patients treated with palliative-intent chemotherapy for advanced thymic carcinoma between 1991 and 2011 in our institution. Clinical demographics, histology, overall survival, and factors expected to predict survival were analyzed. Differences in survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.Results:The study included 22 males (55.0%) and 18 females (45.0%). The median age at diagnosis was 58.5 years. The most common metastatic sites at diagnosis were lung (45.0%), lymph nodes (20.0%), liver (15.0%), bone (15.0%), and brain (5.0%). The most common histological subtypes were squamous cell carcinoma (70.0%), followed by neuroendocrine carcinoma (17.5%), and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (7.5%). The response rate for first-line chemotherapy was 47.5%. The median survival time was 24.5 months (95% confidence interval 20.9-43.5 months). Overall survival rates at 1-, 2-, and 5-years were 72.5%, 52.5%, and 17.5%, respectively. In uni- and multivariate analyses, the only favorable prognostic factor for overall survival was response to first-line chemotherapy (p=0.01).Conclusion:Response to first-line chemotherapy may be implicated as a potential surrogate for survival in advanced thymic carcinoma.
