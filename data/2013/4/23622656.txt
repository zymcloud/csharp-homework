Introduction:The introduction of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) in the early 1990s dramatically reduced recurrence of hepatitis B after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and thus improved survival. Today a combination of HBIG and a nucleoside or nucleotide analogue (NUC) is recommended as prophylaxis. The optimal protocol is yet to be commonly agreed upon. The aim of this study was to review our results over 25 years.Patients and methods:All 56 patients (45 males and 11 females) who underwent OLT due to hepatitis B infection between 1985-2009 were included in the review. Median age at transplantation was 51 years (range, 18-66). Seventeen patients (30%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at transplantation.Results:The 1- and 5-year overall survival rates were 89% and 77%, respectively. The 23 patients who underwent transplantation before 2000 showed 1- and 5-year survival rates of 82% and 61%, respectively; the 33 who underwent transplantation between 2000 and 2009, the rates were 94% and 90%, respectively (P Conclusion:With a combination of HBIG and NUC, excellent OLT results can be achieved for hepatitis B. It is, however, still important to maintain sufficient anti-HBs titers to prevent recurrence.
