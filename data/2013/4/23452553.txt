Purpose:To evaluate the predictability of the short-term tumor response and the clinical usefulness of cone-beam computed tomography (CT) performed immediately after drug-eluting bead (DEB) transarterial chemoembolization in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Materials and methods:This retrospective study comprised 90 patients (male-to-female ratio = 66:24; mean age, 60.4 y) with 119 tumors (mean size, 3.2 cm). All patients underwent DEB transarterial chemoembolization and received cone-beam CT after embolization. The marginal contrast saturation was defined as a contrast stasis that was observed along the margin of the tumor on the cone-beam CT images. The degree of marginal contrast saturation was calculated as a percentage and was classified into five grades in 25% increments. The degree of marginal contrast saturation and the tumor response were correlated based on follow-up imaging.Results:There was a complete response in 63.8% (n = 76) of all tumors. Partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were identified in 21.8% (n = 26), 13.4% (n = 16), and 0.8% (n = 1) of tumors. Marginal contrast saturation by cone-beam CT was 86%± 16.3, 73.2%± 28.8, 16.9%± 27.2, and 0% for complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, which indicated a significant correlation of a higher contrast saturation with a better response (PConclusions:Marginal contrast saturation showed a high positive predictive value for short-term tumor response. This technique may improve the success rates of DEB transarterial chemoembolization procedures and may reduce technical difficulties and shorten procedural time.
