Background:Through migration, diversity of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has changed, affecting disease burden and control. We describe clinical and viral characteristics of chronic HBV in the United Kingdom.Methods:A total of 698 individuals with chronic HBV infection were recruited from referral liver centers. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected.Results:Sixty-one percent of patients were male, 80% were not born in the United Kingdom, and the largest ethnicity was East/Southeast Asian (36%). Twenty-two percent were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seropositive; 20.4% (59/289) had cirrhosis and 10 (1.7%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Genotype D was most common (31%) followed by A, C, B, and E (20%, 20%, 19%, and 9%, respectively). Genotype was significantly associated with country of birth, length of time in the United Kingdom, HBeAg status, and precore and basal core promoter mutations. One-third were on treatment, with men independently more likely to be treated. Only 18% of those on treatment were on recommended first-line therapies, and 30% were on lamivudine monotherapy. Among treated individuals, 27% had antiviral drug resistance. Testing rates for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and delta coinfections were low.Conclusions:We demonstrated diversity of chronic HBV infections in UK patients, suggesting that optimal management requires awareness of the variable patterns of chronic HBV in countries of origin. We also found less-than-optimal clinical management practices, possible gender-based treatment bias, and the need to improve testing for coinfections.
