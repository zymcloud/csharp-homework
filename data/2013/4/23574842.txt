The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was previously shown to predict perioperative mortality in patients with cirrhosis undergoing a variety of nontransplant surgical procedures. We sought to determine its usefulness in predicting postoperative mortality in patients undergoing colorectal procedures. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data were gathered for adult patients undergoing elective and emergent colorectal procedures (Current Procedural Terminology codes 44005 through 45563 excluding appendectomy) during 2005 and 2006 at participating centers. The preoperative MELD score was calculated for all patients and assessed using logistic regression modeling. A total of 10,033 patients met study inclusion criteria. Overall 30-day mortality was 6.6 per cent. In all patients undergoing colorectal surgery, MELD was an independent predictor of mortality (2.95 [2.27 to 3.84]). Other independent predictors included age, functional status, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, ascites, esophageal varices, disseminated cancer, chronic steroid use, cardiac disease, renal failure, malnutrition, sepsis, emergency, and ventilator dependence. The MELD score is an independent predictor of mortality in patients undergoing colorectal procedures. These data can be used to assign risk and assist in clinical decision-making.
