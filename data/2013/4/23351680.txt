Aim:The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and prognostic factors of postoperative liver failure in patients submitted to liver resection for colorectal metastases.Method:Patients with CLM who underwent hepatectomy from 1998 to 2009 were included in retrospective analysis. Postoperative liver failure was defined using either the 50-50 criteria or the peak of serum bilirubin level above 7 mg/dL independently.Results:Two hundred and nine (209) procedures were performed in 170 patients. 120 surgeries were preceded by chemotherapy within six months. The overall morbidity rate was 53.1% and 90-day mortality was 2.3%. Postoperative liver failure occurred in 10% of all procedures, accounting for a mortality rate of 9.5% among this group of patients. In multivariate analysis, extent of liver resection, need of blood transfusion and more than eight preoperative chemotherapy cycles were independent prognostic factors of postoperative liver insufficiency. This complication was not related with the chemotherapy regimen used.Conclusion:We conclude that postoperative liver failure has a relatively low incidence (10%) after CLM resection, but a remarkable impact on postoperative mortality rate. The amount of liver resected, the need of blood transfusion and extended preoperative chemotherapy are independent predictors of its occurrence and this knowledge can be used to prevent postoperative liver failure in a multidisciplinary approach.
