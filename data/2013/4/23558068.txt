Background:Lamivudine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) are widely used to treat patients with hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation. However, the outcomes are inconclusive. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of combined therapy on patients with hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation.Methods:Twenty-two patients with hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation from August 2000 to October 2011 were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, 16 received lamivudine plus HBIG (combination therapy group) and 6 were treated with lamivudine alone (lamivudine-treated group). The clinical features were matched in the two groups. HBV recurrence parameters, HBsAg clearance rate, patient survival rate, and survival time were compared.Results:The average time of follow-up was 47.2 months (range 13-99). Significant difference was noted in the HBsAg clearance rate in the lamivudine-treated and combination therapy groups (50% vs 93.8%, P0.05).Conclusion:Compared with lamivudine monotherapy, combination therapy significantly increased the HBsAg clearance rate in patients with HBV recurrence after liver transplantation.
