Lymph node metastasis is recognized as an important mode of liver cancer metastasis. Our previous study has built two hepatocarcinoma cell lines, Hca-F with high (75%) and Hca-P with low (25%) incidences of lymph node metastasis, and has indicated that annexin A7 is an important factor in the lymphatic metastasis of tumors. There is evidence that galectin-3 is the binding protein of annexin A7 and works in protein complexes. Our current study shows that both annexin A7 and galectin-3 express higher in Hca-F than Hca-P. Annexin A7 was successfully down-regulated in Hca-P by RNA interference, and this resulted in concomitant reduction of galactin 3 expression in annexin A7 down regulated compared to the control and N-control cells. Using CCK-8 assay, the expression level of annexin A7 and galectin-3 were found to have correlation with the proliferation ability; Transwell assay showed annexin A7 and galectin-3 are involved in cell migration and invasion regulation in mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, immunofluorescence assay indicate annexin A7 and galectin-3 were co-located annexin A7 and galectin-3 played roles in DNA damage and cell proliferation cycle checkpoint arrest pathway. Those phenomena indicated that annexin A7 influences lymphatic metastasis of tumors by interacting with galectin-3 through the regulation of tumor cell proliferation, attachment, migration and invasion.
