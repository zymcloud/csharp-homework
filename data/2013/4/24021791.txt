Objective:To explore the effect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBX) on expression of the host gene Wnt induced secreted protein-1 (WISP-1) that is related to the pathogenic process of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Tumor and paratumor tissues were collected from HCC patients, and normal liver tissues were collected from healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the in vivo presence and expression levels of HBX and WISP-1 in the three tissue types. HepG2 cells stably transfected with pc-DNA3.1(+)-HBX or with pc-DNA3.1(+) only (G0, control) were generated and used to examine in vitro the HBX-induced changes in WISP-1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively.Results:The HCC tissues showed significantly higher rates of positivity for WISP-1 expression than the non-tumor controls (76.6% vs. paratumor: 23.4% or normal tissues: 0%, x2= 35.967, P less than 0.01). HBX increased WISP-1 expression in HepG2 cells at both the mRNA (1170.33 +/- 41.26 vs. G0: 265.34 +/- 27.47, t = 31.63, P less than 0.01) and protein (240.33 +/- 11.37 vs. G0: 40.33 +/- 7.09, F = 600.57, P less than 0.01) levels.Conclusion:HBV may up-regulate expression of the host gene WISP-1 through its X protein and thus promote the development of HCC.
