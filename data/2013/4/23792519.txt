Background:Cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is a potentially curative approach for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colonic origin. So far experience concerning the use of this treatment option in transplant recipients is lacking.Case report:We herein present the case of a 31-year-old man who had previously been liver transplanted for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Approximately 10 years after transplantation colon carcinoma with co-existing peritoneal carcinomatosis was diagnosed. Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy were conducted. Operative management under tacrolimus medication did not trigger infections, wound healing disorders or graft function impairment. At one year follow-up no tumor recurrence was detected.Conclusions:Recent literature suggests that proctocolectomy for colorectal cancer is considered feasible in liver graft recipients. Virtually all patients suffering from primary sclerosing cholangitis exhibit co-existing ulcerative colitis, rendering this subset of patient at risk for developing colonic malignancies. Furthermore chronic immunosuppression may facilitate malignant growth. The most feared complication in colorectal carcinomas is the occurence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, for which cytoreduction plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy may be a curative option. This, so far unique, case report suggests that even in this patient subset this treatment is feasible and for further cases this dual-approach for the management of PC in transplant recipients should be taken into account.
