Objectives:To evaluate the association between ADAM8 tissue expression and patient prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:ADAM8 expression was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining methods on tissue samples from a consecutive series of 105 HCC patients who underwent resections between 2000 and 2006. The correlation of ADAM8 expression and patients' clinicopathological parameters was evaluated. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards model.Results:ADAM8 was highly expressed in 54.3% of the HCC patients. The ADAM8 expression level was closely associated with serum AFP elevation, tumor size, histological differentiation, tumor recurrence, tumor metastasis, and tumor stage. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that a high expression level of ADAM8 resulted in a significantly poor prognosis of HCC patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that ADAM8 expression level was an independent prognostic parameter for the overall survival rate of HCC patients.Conclusions:These findings provide evidence that a high expression level of ADAM8 serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis for HCC. Thus, we speculate that ADAM8 may be a potential target of antiangiogenic therapy for HCC.
