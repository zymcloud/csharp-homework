Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most fatal cancers. In almost all populations, males have a higher HCC rate than females. Here we sought to explore the roles and mechanisms of acetylcholine (Ach) and androgen receptor (AR) on regulating the fate determinations of HCC. Ach activated AR and promoted its expression in HCC cells. Ach enhanced HCC cell migration and invasion but inhibited their apoptosis. Ach had no obvious effects on the migration, invasion, or apoptosis in AR-negative HCC cells. Elevation of migration and invasion induced by Ach was eliminated in AR-knockdown HCC cells. In contrast, Ach stimulated the migration and invasion but suppressed apoptosis in AR over-expressed HCC cells. Additionally, AR agonist R1881 promoted the migration and invasion but reduced the apoptosis of SNU-449 cells, whereas AR antagonist casodex inhibited the migration and invasion but stimulated the apoptosis of SNU-449 cells. STAT3 and AKT phosphorylation was activated by Ach in HCC cells. Collectively, these data suggest that Ach activates STAT3 and AKT pathways and acts on AR to promote the migration and invasion but inhibit the apoptosis of HCC cells. This study thus provides novel insights into carcinogenesis of liver cancer by local interaction between neurotransmitter Ach and hormone receptor AR in HCC.
