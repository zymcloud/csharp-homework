In our previous study, a series of 6-aryl-3-amino-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives exhibited potent antiproliferative activities and an unique hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-specific anticancer activity was also observed. In further anti-inflammatory research, thienopyridine derivative 1a showed potent inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production. So a series of thienopyridine analogues of 1a were synthesized and evaluated for anti-inflammatory activities. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) revealed that the most potent analogues 1f and 1o were identified as potent inhibitors of NO production with IC50 values of 3.30 and 3.24 Î¼M, respectively. These results suggest that these 6-aryl-3-amino-thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives might potentially constitute a novel class of anti-inflammatory agents, which require further studies.
