Purpose:To analyze the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) for patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not eligible for other local modalities.Methods:Between 1998 and 2006, 61 patients with small HCC were treated with high-dose 3D-CRT. The eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) HCC Results:The median follow-up period was 16.7 months. Tumor response was 68.9% (42 of 61 lesions) with a complete response in 27 lesions (44.3%). Local control was 93.8% at 1 year and 86.9% at 3 years. Intrahepatic metastases developed in 40 patients (65.6%). Thirteen patients (22.3%) had extrahepatic metastasis. The median survival was 56 months (range, 2.8 to 68.1 mo), and the overall survival rate was 81.1% at 1 year and 58.4% at 3 years. Three patients developed radiation-induced liver disease, but there were no instances of grade 3 or higher toxicity.Conclusions:High-dose 3D-CRT for small HCC
