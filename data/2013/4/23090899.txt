Purpose:In the recent past, the potential suitability of fixed samples to 2D-DIGE studies has been demonstrated on model tissues, but not on "real-world" archival tissues. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the quality of the results delivered by 2D-DIGE on samples retrieved from hospital tissue repositories.Experimental design:Diseased and normal tissue samples (namely, human gastric adenocarcinoma and normal gastric tissue, human lung neuroendocrine tumors, canine mammary tubulo-papillary carcinoma and normal mammary tissue, sheep liver with cloudy swelling degeneration and normal liver tissue) were retrieved from human and veterinary biorepositories and subjected to full-length protein extraction, cyanine labeling, 2D-DIGE separation, image analysis, MS analysis, and protein identification.Results:Archival samples could be successfully subjected to 2D-DIGE, providing maps of satisfactory resolution, although with varying pattern complexity (possibly influenced by preanalytical variables). Moreover, differentially expressed protein identities were consistent with the disease biology.Conclusions and clinical relevance:2D-DIGE can support biomarker discovery and validation studies on large sample cohorts. In fact, although some information complexity is lost when compared to fresh-frozen tissues, their vast availability and the associated patient information can considerably boost studies suffering limited sample availability or involving long-distance exchange of samples.
