This study aims to evaluate the association between BMP7 tissue expression and patient prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of BMP7 mRNA in HCC was characterized using real-time PCR and 30 pairs of fresh frozen HCC tissues and corresponding noncancerous tissues. BMP7 protein expression in HCC was confirmed using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray chip. Finally, BMP7 expression was correlated with conventional clinicopathological features of HCC and patient outcome. The expression of BMP7 mRNA and protein in HCC cells was much higher than in normal hepatic cells. Our results showed that the high expression of BMP7 in HCC was related to tumor size (p
