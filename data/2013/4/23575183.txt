Background:Resection of lung metastasis from malignant tumor of liver, biliary duct and pancreas has various controversial problems. These problems are that many patients have a progressive disease and there are few patients who can have resectable lesion. Generally the prognosis of these diseases is poor. In addition, the effect of pulmonary resection for lung metastasis from malignant tumor of liver, biliary duct and pancreas is unclear. We set out to investigate the outcome and usefulness of surgery in this group.Patients and methods:From January 1999 to November 2012, 18 patients underwent a total of 21 surgeries. There were 11 men and 7 women with mean age of 66.6±10( range, 43 to 78). Primary diseases of these patients were hepatocellular carcinoma in 5, cholangiocellular carcinoma in 1, cholangiocarcinoma in 2 and pancreatic cancer in 10 patients.Results:Disease-free interval from 1st local therapy such as surgical treatment for primary lesion was 50.8±28.7(range, 19 to 107) months. Numbers of lung metastasis were 1 in 15, 2 in 4 patients and 3 in 1 patient. Many metastasis were in right lower lobe. Numbers of wedge resection were 13, segmentectomy were 4, lobectomy were 2 in these patients. Average of total survival time was 38±34 months. Four patients were dead. The 14 patients are alive and 7 patients had no recurrence. Adjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy was important. One-year all over survival rate after 1st pulmonary resection was 88%, 3 or 5-years was 73%. We think that it's was good result.Conclusion:There is a possibility that surgery for metastatic lung tumor from malignant tumor of liver, biliary duct and pancreas is useful by control of primary lesion and selecting of patients and adjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy.
