Because pulmonary metastasis is considered to be systemic spread of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indication of pulmonary resection as a treatment for it is not well-described. We retrospectively reviewed clinical records of the patients who underwent pulmonary resection for metastases from HCC in our hospital. Seven patients, 6 men, 1 woman, and the mean-age 65.4 year-old, underwent pulmonary resection from April in 2001 to March in 2010. During the same period, we carried out pulmonary resection for 122 patients with metastases from other malignant diseases. Therefore, pulmonary resection for HCC metastases accounted for 5.4% of the total pulmonary metastasectomy. One of the 7 patients, a 70 year-old man, survives for 69 months after right middle lobectomy for solitary HCC metastasis. Other 6 patients with multiple pulmonary metastases or with increased level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) before pulmonary resection died of systemic recurrence. The mean survival time of 7 patients was 20 months and was 11.8 months except the long-time survivor. From our results, patients with multiple pulmonary metastases from HCC or with increased serum level of AFP before surgery should be carefully selected as candidates for pulmonary metastasectomy.
