Purpose:To evaluate the per-nodule efficacy of superselective transarterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs).Materials and methods:From 2006-2009, 271 cirrhotic patients with 635 nodules underwent a first superselective transarterial chemoembolization, repeated "on demand" after local recurrences (LR) or partial responses (PR). Complete response (CR), time to nodule progression (TTnP), and local recurrence rate (LRR), according to three size classes (≤ 2 cm, 2.1-5 cm, and>5 cm) were evaluated.Results:After the first superselective transarterial chemoembolization, the CR was 64%, sustained over time in 77%, higher in small (68%) and intermediate-size (64%) nodules than in large nodules (25%; P5 cm had a CR of 25% after the first superselective transarterial chemoembolization, LR of 50% and PR of 25%, and after the second and third superselective transarterial chemoembolizations, PR of 0%.Conclusions:Effectiveness of superselective transarterial chemoembolization has a clear cutoff above and below 5-cm nodules, with better results in smaller nodules. In HCCs ≤ 5 cm, the efficacy of the first and second superselective transarterial chemoembolizations performed for LR was higher than the second superselective transarterial chemoembolization for PR and the third superselective transarterial chemoembolization. For HCCs>5 cm, retreatment of PR is of little value, and the third cycle is ineffective.
