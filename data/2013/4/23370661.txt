Purpose:Squamous cell carcinoma is the main histological subtype of esophageal cancer in the east Asia. Oxaliplatin and fluorouracil are active agents for esophageal carcinoma. The aim of this phase II study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).Methods:Patients with metastatic ESCC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0-2 who had not received prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease were enrolled. Oxaliplatin, 100 mg/m(2), was administered as a 2-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion on day 1. Leucovorin, 400 mg/m(2) i.v., was administered as a 2-h infusion followed by fluorouracil (400 mg/m(2)) i.v. bolus immediately followed by fluorouracil (2,400 mg/m(2)) as a 46-h continuous infusion on days 1 and 2. Chemotherapy was repeated every 14 days.Results:Between October 2008 and September 2011, fifty-six patients, with a median age of 59 years, were enrolled in this study. The overall response rate was 23.2 % with a disease control rate of 67.9 %. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.4 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 7.7 months. Median PFS was significantly longer in patients without liver metastasis than those with liver metastasis (5.4 vs 2.4 months, P = 0.003). Partial response was associated with longer PFS (7.2 vs 2.7 months, P = 0.023) and OS (11.3 vs 7.1 months, P = 0.028). Significant difference in OS was noted between those age >65 and â‰¤ 65 years of age (7.9 vs 3.3 months, P = 0.033). Grade 3/4 neutropenia, leucopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 35.7, 28.6, 10.7 and 10.7 % of patients, respectively. The most common non-hematologic toxicities were fatigue, mucositis, nausea/vomiting and peripheral neuropathy, all of which were moderate, reversible and did not require a dose reduction.Conclusions:Chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, leucovorin and fluorouracil showed moderate antitumor activity in metastatic ESCC and was well tolerated with acceptable myelosuppression, infrequent and reversible non-hematologic toxicities in patients with ESCC.
