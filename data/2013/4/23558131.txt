A 42-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with weight loss and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Though an 8cm mass in liver segment 5/8 was detected by abdominal imaging, we could not confirm the diagnosis because findings on physical examination, blood chemistry, and radiologic examination were nonspecific. No cancer or immunocompromising diseases were found. We performed a liver biopsy because we were suspicious of a cold abscess caused by tuberculosis. Purulent material acquired from the biopsy revealed positive TB-PCR results, which confirmed the diagnosis of solitary liver tuberculosis. She received anti-tuberculosis medications leading to hepatic tumor resolution. There are very few reports of solitary liver tuberculosis diagnosed without surgery, thus we report this case of a solitary tubercle diagnosed by TB-PCR.
