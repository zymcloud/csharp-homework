Hepatic tuberculosis as a part of disseminated tuberculosis is seen in 50-80% of cases. Isolated hepatic tuberculosis is very uncommon even in countries with high prevalence of tuberculosis. It can occur as a primary case or due to reactivation of an old tubercular focus. We report a case of a 59-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with persistent right upper quadrant pain and a hepatic lesion on an abdominal CT. She had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis 15 years ago with localised lung tuberculosis treated with lobectomy and antituberculous drugs.
