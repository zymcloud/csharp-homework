Background:In a phase III trial, older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (N=485) received decitabine or treatment choice (supportive care or cytarabine). This post hoc analysis examined whether baseline renal and hepatic function and white blood cell (WBC) counts predicted response.Methods:Baseline WBCs and renal and liver function markers were tabulated for responders/nonresponders.Results:Nonresponders had higher mean baseline creatinine (P=0.005). Creatinine data showed no significant between-group differences by treatment within responder category.Conclusions:No relationship was found between baseline WBCs or hepatic function and response. Higher baseline creatinine in nonresponders may not be clinically relevant.
