We report a case of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related postliver transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in a patient with post liver transplant which initially presented in a CT scan image mimicking recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Histopathology showed atypical plasma cell-like infiltration, and immunohistochemistry confirmed diagnosis of EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Typical imaging from dynamic phases contrast CT scan might not accurately diagnose recurrent HCC in postorthotropic liver transplantation. Liver biopsy should be performed for accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.
