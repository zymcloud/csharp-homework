Background:SHOX2 (short stature homeobox 2) is a crucial transcriptional regulator in several genetic disorders and has been demonstrated to be an excellent biomarker in the diagnosis and evaluation of lung cancer. However, its expression pattern and prognostic value for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unknown.Methods:Expression of SHOX2 gene and protein in HCC tissues and cell lines were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blot. Impact of RNAi-mediated SHOX2 silence on the proliferation and invasion ability of Huh7 cell line in vitro was determined by CCK-8 assay and matrigel invasion assay, respectively.Results:Elevated expression of SHOX2 gene was significantly associated with higher incidence of tumor recurrence (n = 60, p = 0.001), absence of tumor capsule (p = 0.015), presence of tumor thrombi (p Conclusions:Elevated SHOX2 expression was associated with HCC recurrence, probably by enhancing proliferation and invasion capability of cancer cells.
