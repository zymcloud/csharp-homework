Background:The aim of the present study was to investigate whether advanced age was associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications and identify the predictive factors for postoperative complications in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Between January 2000 and December 2010, 256 patients who underwent hepatectomy for HCC were investigated. Elderly patients were defined as those aged â‰¥75 y. The clinicopathologic data and outcomes after hepatectomy for 64 elderly and 192 younger patients were retrospectively collected and compared.Results:There were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative complications (P = 0.936) or the long-term survival after hepatectomy (P = 0.641) between the elderly and younger patients. In multivariate analysis, the estimation of physiological ability and surgical stress-preoperative risk score (PRS) was an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity in the elderly patients (P Conclusions:Hepatectomy for elderly patients with HCC is feasible as well as safe, and the preoperative assessment using the estimation of physiological ability and surgical stress scoring system, combined with the liver damage grade, can help to improve the safety of this procedure for elderly HCC patients.
