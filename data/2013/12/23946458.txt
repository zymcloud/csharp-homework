Variation of core amino acid (aa) 70 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown recently to be closely correlated with liver disease progression, suggesting that the core region might be present as a quasispecies during persistent infection and that this quasispecies nature might have an influence on the progression of disease. In our investigation, the subjects were 79 patients infected with HCV genotype 1b (25 with chronic hepatitis [CH], 29 with liver cirrhosis [LC], and 25 with hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]). Deep sequencing of the HCV core region was carried out on their sera by using a Roche 454 GS Junior pyrosequencer. Based on a plasmid containing a cloned HCV sequence (pCV-J4L6S), the background error rate associated with pyrosequencing, including the PCR procedure, was calculated as 0.092 Â± 0.005/base. Deep sequencing of the core region in the clinical samples showed a mixture of "mutant-type" Q/H and "wild-type" R at the core aa 70 position in most cases (71/79 [89.9%]), and the ratio of mutant residues to R in the mixture increased as liver disease advanced to LC and HCC. Meanwhile, phylogenetic analysis of the almost-complete core region revealed that the HCV isolates differed genetically depending on the mutation status at core aa 70. We conclude that the core aa 70 mixture ratio, determined by deep sequencing, reflected the status of liver disease, demonstrating a significant association between core aa 70 and disease progression in CH patients infected with HCV genotype 1b.
