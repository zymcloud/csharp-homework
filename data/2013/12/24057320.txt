The two main malignant hepatic tumors in children are hepatoblastomas (HBLs) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). The past two decades have brought significant improvement to the outcomes of children diagnosed with malignant hepatic tumors, especially HBL, due to improvements in diagnosis and treatment. Histological diagnosis is essential for differential diagnosis of these tumors. In surgery, liver resection has become a safe and secure technique because of progress in anatomical knowledge and surgical dissection; also liver transplantation has become widely used for unresectable tumors. Moreover, the introduction of effective chemotherapeutic regimens has significantly improved the survival of children with HBL due to an increase in the number of patients ultimately undergoing tumor resection, and a reduction in the incidence of post-surgical recurrence. These improvements are the result of multicenter cooperative trials conducted by the Japanese Study Group for Pediatric Liver Tumor, the Children's Oncology Group, and the International Childhood Liver Tumor Strategy Group, including work of the German Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology. This paper summarizes the results of these studies and calls on the current international collaboration study called the Children's Hepatic Tumors International Collaboration Project to establish global clinical research on childhood hepatic malignant tumors.
