Adjusted survival outcomes following hepatic resection and transplantation for pediatric liver tumors have not been compared. To address this question, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using the SEER registry. While SEER lacks certain specifics regarding staging, chemotherapy, comorbidities, and recurrence, important hypothesis-generating data are available and were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox proportional hazards regression. All SEER patients under the age of 20 yr undergoing surgery for HB (n = 318) or HCC (n = 80) between 1998 and 2009 were included. Of HB patients, 83.3% underwent resection and 16.7% transplantation. Advanced disease, vascular invasion, and satellite lesions were more common among transplant patients. Unadjusted five-yr survival was equivalent, as was the adjusted hazard of death for transplant relative to resection (HR = 0.58, p = 0.63). Of HCC patients, 75.0% underwent resection and 25.0% transplantation. Transplant patients had a higher prevalence of vascular invasion and satellite lesions. Five-yr survival was 53.4% after resection and 85.3% after transplant, and the adjusted hazard of death was significantly lower after transplantation (HR = 0.05, p = 0.045). While transplantation is generally reserved for unresectable tumors, the favorable survival seen in HCC patients suggests that liberalized transplant criteria might improve survival, although further prospective data are needed.
