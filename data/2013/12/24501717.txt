Although significant advances in the treatment of intrahepatic lesions, it is reported that the prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have extrahepatic metastasis remains poor. We report a patient with lung, liver, brain, bone and subcutaneous metastasis from HCC who has survived more than 7 years maintaining relatively good performance status as a result of repeated therapies. A 55-year-old male patient with HCC underwent right lobectomy of the liver and cholecystectomy in September 2006. He received wedge resection for lung metastasis twice (July 2009, January 2011) and Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastasis (April 2011). Over the last 3 years, he has developed metastasis in subcutaneous tissues, muscle, and bone with pain. He has undergone 7 courses of radiotherapies for subcutaneous tissues, muscle, and bone metastasis and been prescribed sorafenib and he is still capable of all self-care.
