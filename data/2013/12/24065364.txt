Background:Assessment of patient performance status is often subjective. Sarcopenia--measurement of muscle wasting--may be a more objective means to assess performance status and therefore mortality risk following intra-arterial therapy (IAT).Methods:Total psoas area (TPA) was measured on cross-sectional imaging in 216 patients undergoing IAT of hepatic malignancies between 2002 and 2012. Sarcopenia was defined as TPA in the lowest sex-specific quartile. Impact of sarcopenia was assessed relative to other clinicopathological factors.Results:Indications for IAT included hepatocellular carcinoma (51 %), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (13 %), colorectal liver metastasis (7 %), or other metastatic disease (30 %). Median TPA among men (568 mm(2)/m(2)) was greater than women (413 mm(2)/m(2)). IAT involved conventional chemoembolization (54 %), drug-eluting beads (40 %), or yttrium-90 (6 %). Median tumor size was 5.8 cm; most patients had multiple lesions (74 %). Ninety-day mortality was 9.3 %; 3-year survival was 39 %. Factors associated with risk of death were tumor size (HR = 1.84) and Child's score (HR = 2.15) (all P Conclusions:Sarcopenia was an independent predictor of mortality following IAT with sarcopenic patients having a twofold increased risk of death. Sarcopenia is an objective measure of frailty that can help clinical decision-making regarding IAT for hepatic malignancies.
