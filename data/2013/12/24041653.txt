As the crucial biological regulators, microRNAs that act by suppressing their target genes are involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes. It is generally accepted that microRNAs are often dysregulated in many types of neoplasm and other human diseases. In neoplasm, microRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. As constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is a common feature of neoplasm and contributes to its development, progression and metastasis in various cancers, numerous studies have revealed that microRNA-mediated gene regulation are interconnected with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, forming a Wnt/β-catenin-microRNA regulatory network, which is critical to successful targeting of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway for oncotherapy. In this review, we aim to accumulate recent advances on microRNAs that work in tandem with Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumorigenesis, with particular focus on how microRNAs affect Wnt/β-catenin activity as well as how microRNAs are regulated through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
