Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as promising biomarkers for cancer; however, the significance of circulating miRNAs in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. Based on our prior observations that miRNA-101 (miR-101) is downregulated by HBV and induces epigenetic modification, we sought to test whether circulating miR-101 may serve as a potential biomarker for HCC. The expression of miR-101 in HCCs and serum was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Tissue and serum miR-101 levels were assessed in samples from patients with HBV-related HCC and healthy controls. A potential correlation was also evaluated between miR-101 expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC patients. miR-101 was downregulated in HBV-related HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, the miR-101 levels in these tissues from HCC patients were significantly lower than those in tissues from control subjects. Notably, serum miR-101 levels were found to have an inverse correlation with tissue miR-101 expression levels. The expression of serum miR-101 in patients with HBV-related HCC was significantly higher than that in the healthy controls, and this increase correlated with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, HBV DNA levels and tumor size. These results indicate that different factors govern the levels of miR-101 in the tissue and serum of HCC patients. Given the marked and consistent increase in serum miR-101 levels in HCC patients, circulating miR-101 may serve as a promising biochemical marker for monitoring the progression of tumor development in HBV-related HCC.
