Primary liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer mortality. For patients with early resectable disease, surgical resection or transplantation is considered a potentially curative modality for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); on the other hand, for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease, treatment is essentially palliative and prior to the approval of sorafenib, there was no globally approved systemic treatment for patients presenting with unresectable or metastatic HCC. Sorafenib is the only systemic treatment to demonstrate a statistically significant but modest overall survival benefit in a large phase III trial. Thus, novel systemic approaches represent a high unmet medical need in advanced HCC. In this review article, we will try to take a journey through the history of systemic therapeutic options for HCC passing through the current standard options and exploring the potential new systemic options for this disease.
