Host immunity may have important role in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between circulating immune regulators and clinical outcome in patients with HCC. Sixty-three HCC patients were prospectively enrolled. Serum levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) were measured, as well as the prevalence of regulatory T cells (Treg), NK(+) T cells, invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT), programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)(+) CD8(+) T cells, T helper 17 cells (Th17), CD69(+) and CD45RO(+) T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Correlation between these immune regulators and clinical outcome were analyzed. A low serum IFN-γ level (5 cm: 53.8% vs.
