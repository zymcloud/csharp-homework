The long-term outcome and prognostic factors after curative in patients with single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without macrovascular invasion are still unclear. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of curative resection on survival and analyze the prognostic clinicopathologic factors, especially the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI), in these patients. Two hundred and sixty consecutive patients with single HCC without macrovascular invasion who underwent curative resection from December 2004 to December 2007 were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Survival rates were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses of 14 clinicopathologic factors were performed to determine the significant prognostic factors. No patient died within 1 month after the operation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates after curative resection were 96.54, 83.46, and 74.01%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the presence of MVI was an independent negative prognostic factor affecting overall survival. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 79.62, 62.69, and 56.01%, respectively. The presence of MVI was the only independent unfavorable prognostic factor for disease-free survival. According to our analysis, patients with single HCC without macrovascular invasion after curative resection can be expected to have considerable long-term survival. The presence of MVI was an independent negative prognostic factor for both overall survival and disease-free survival. To improve the prognosis, these patients should be followed up more carefully and might be good candidates for adjuvant therapy.
