In a previous study we had shown that treatment of male Fischer rats with exogenous chemicals for three months resulted in prominent, mode-of-action dependent effects on liver microRNA (miRNA) (Koufaris et al., 2012). Here we investigated how the effects of chemicals on liver miRNA in male Fischer rats relate to the length and dose of exposure to phenobarbital (PB), a drug with multiple established hepatic effects. Importantly, although acute PB treatment (1-7 days) had significant effects on liver mRNA and the expected effects on the liver phenotype (transient hyperplasia, hepatomegaly, cytochrome P450 induction), limited effects on liver miRNA were observed. However, at 14 days of PB treatment clear dose-dependent effects on miRNA were observed. The main effect of PB treatment from days 1 to 90 on liver miRNA was found to be the persistent, progressive, and highly correlated induction of the miR-200a/200b/429 and miR-96/182 clusters, occurring after the termination of the xenobiotic-induced transient hyperplasia. Moreover, in agreement with their reported functions in the literature we found associations between perturbations of miR-29b and miR-200a/200b by PB with global DNA methylation and zeb1/zeb2 proteins respectively. Our data suggest that miRNA are unlikely to play an important role in the acute responses of the adult rodent liver to PB treatment. However, the miRNA responses to longer PB exposures suggest a potential role for maintaining liver homeostasis in response to sub-chronic and chronic xenobiotic-induced perturbations. Similar studies for more chemicals are needed to clarify whether the temporal and dose pattern of miRNA-toxicant interaction identified here for PB are widely applicable to other xenobiotics.
