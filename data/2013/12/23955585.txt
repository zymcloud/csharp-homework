Purpose:This study was designed to evaluate neoadjuvant intensified chemotherapy in potentially resectable or unresectable liver metastases (LM) from colorectal cancer (CRC).Methods:Criteria for potentially resectable LM were complex hepatectomy and/or risky procedure, close contact with major vascular structures, and for unresectable LM, a future liver remnant predicted to be less than 25-30 % of total liver volume. Between October 2004 and August 2007, 125 patients were randomized to either standard (FOLFIRI/FOLFOX4) or intensified chemotherapy (FOLFIRI-HD/FOLFOX7/FOLFIRINOX). Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints included safety, R0 surgical resection, best ORR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).Results:A total of 122 patients were treated; 45 % of patients had less than 30 % of remaining liver tissue, 20 % had major vascular contact, and 35 % were potentially resectable. Grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (24, 19, 10, 23 %) diarrhoea (0, 6, 3, 23 %), mucositis (0, 3, 0, 7 %), vomiting (7, 9, 0, 3 %), and neurotoxicity (0, 0, 10, 3 %) in arms (FOLFIRI + FOLFOX4)/FOLFIRI-HD/FOLFOX7/FOLFIRINOX, respectively. ORR was 33, 47, 43, and 57 % after the first 4 cycles in arms (FOLFIRI + FOLFOX4)/FOLFIRI-HD/FOLFOX7/FOLFIRINOX, respectively. FOLFIRINOX offered the best conversion rate to resectability (67 %). Disease-free status after chemotherapy and surgery (R0, R1, Rx) was achieved in 54 of 64 operated patients. Median PFS was 9.2 months in control arms versus 11.9 months in experimental arms (hazards ratio [HR] = 0.76, p = 0.115), and the median OS was 17.7 versus 33.4 months (HR = 0.73, p = 0.297), respectively.Conclusions:FOLFIRINOX showed promising activity in CRC patients with LM compared with standard or intensified bi-chemotherapy regimens.
