Aim:Heparanase-2 expression has been suggested to up-regulate in several types of human cancers. However, the expression patterns of heparanase-2 in gastric cancer and its effect on prognosis of gastric cancer patients are unclear.Methods:In this study, the methods of tissue microarray, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and western blot were used to investigate heparanase-2 expression in gastric cancer and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Heparanase-2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 95 clinicopathologically characterized gastric cancer cases. In addition Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression model were used to analyze the results.Results:High expression of cytoplasmic heparanase-2 was observed in 70.5% (67/95) of gastric cancer, when compared with its normal counterpart. Overexpression of heparanase-2 was correlated with tumor size and differentiation (P<0.05). Further analysis showed that a significant correlation between high expression of heparanase-2 and favorable prognosis (P<0.05). In multivariate analysis, high expression of heparanase-2 was evaluated as an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer (P<0.05).Conclusions:Our data suggest for the first time that the high expression of heparanase-2 is associated significantly with tumor growth and differentiation. Importantly, heparanase-2 may be a potential molecular marker for predicting prognosis of gastric cancer.
