Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known for its high rate of recurrence and poor prognosis, which makes it necessary to identify new predictive markers for HCC and to explore the underlying mechanism(s). Emerging evidence suggests that the proteoglycan serglycin (SRGN) might play a crucial role in tumor metastasis. However, currently, the function of SRGN in HCC remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the expression pattern of SRGN in 127 HCC specimens and their adjacent, non-tumorous tissues using immunohistochemical assays. We observed that SRGN was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues. Elevated expression levels of SRGN were detectable in 72/127 (56.7%) of the HCC specimens and in 4/127 (3.1%) of adjacent non-tumorous tissues (p
