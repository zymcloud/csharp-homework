This paper describes comparative studies and protocols in (1) self-assembling of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (NP), circular plasmid DNA, and branched polyethylenimine (PEI) composites; (2) magnetofection; (3) gene delivery, (4) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (5) cytotoxicity of the composites toward hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells.
