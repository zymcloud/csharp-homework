Background:4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)amino) phenylarsenoxide (GSAO) is a water-soluble mitochondrial toxin that binds to adenine nucleotide translocase in the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby targeting cell proliferation. This phase 1 study investigated safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSAO as a daily 1-h infusion for 5 days a week for 2 weeks in every three. Pharmacodynamics of GSAO was evaluated by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and circulating markers of angiogenesis.Methods:Patients with advanced solid tumours received GSAO in a dose-escalation trial according to a standard '3 + 3' design that was guided by toxicity and, for the final dose escalation, by arsenic PK data.Results:A total of 34 patients were treated with GSAO across 9 dose levels (1.3-44.0 mg/m(2)). Treatment was well tolerated with few adverse events. An additional three patients were enrolled at the 12.4 mg/m(2) dose level following a DLT of derangement of liver function tests (grade 4). At the 44.0 mg/m(2) dose level, two out of three patients had DLTs (reversible encephalopathy; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation).Conclusions:The MTD of GSAO was 22.0 mg/m(2)/day. There was no biomarker evidence from DCE-MRI or circulating markers of angiogenesis of an anti-vascular effect of GSAO.
