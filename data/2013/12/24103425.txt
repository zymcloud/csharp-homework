Background:The let-7 family plays a vital role in the normal cellular activity of liver cells and the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the previous study, we have detected the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of let-7 and susceptibility to HCC. However, it is still unknown whether these polymorphisms are associated with HCC prognosis.Methods:We investigated the effect of two potentially functional SNPs in the promoter region of let-7 family, rs10877887 (T>C) and rs13293512 (T>C), on the overall survival of 331 HCC patients. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used for the survival analyses.Results:We found that HCC patients carrying the C allele of rs10877887 had a significantly increased death risk (adjusted HR=1.22, 95%CI=1.02-1.47, P=0.03 in the additive model), compared to those with T allele. In the stratified analysis, the risk effect was evident in HCC patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B (adjusted HR=1.24, 95%CI=1.02-1.51, P=0.03) and in those who received chemotherapy or intervention (adjusted HR=1.25, 95%CI=1.02-1.53, P=0.04).Conclusions:Our results suggest that rs10877887 in the promoter region of let-7 may be a prognostic biomarker for HCC patients, which need the validation from other larger studies in different populations.
