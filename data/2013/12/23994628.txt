Rhein, a compound found as a glucoside in the root of rhubarb, is currently a subject of interest for its antitumor properties. The apoptosis of tumor cell lines induced by rhein was observed, and the involvement of mitochondria was established; however, the role of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) remains unknown. Here we report that MPT plays an important role in the apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep-G2 cells induced by rhein. After adding rhein to the isolated hepatic mitochondria, swelling effects and the leakage of Ca(2+) were observed. These alterations were suppressed by cyclosporin A (CsA), an MPT inhibitor. Furthermore, in Hep-G2 cells, the decrease of ATP production, the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), the release of cytochrome c (Cyto c), and the activation of caspase 3 were also observed. These toxic effects of rhein can also be attenuated by CsA as well. Moreover, TUNEL assay confirmed that in the presence of CsA, rhein-induced apoptosis was largely inhibited. These results suggest that MPT plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Hep-G2 cell injury induced by rhein, and imply that MPT may contribute to the anti-cancer activity of rhein.
