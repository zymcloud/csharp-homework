Background:Delivery of a timely (within 24h) hepatitis B vaccine birth dose (TBD) is essential to prevent the long-term complications of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. China made substantial progress in hepatitis B immunization coverage, however, in 2004, TBD coverage was lower in Western, poorer provinces.Methods:We reviewed five demonstration projects for the promotion of TBD in rural counties in Qinghai, Gansu and Ningxia. Interventions consisted of (1) work to increase TBD coverage in hospitals, including training of health-care workers, (2) information, education and communication [IEC] with the population and (3) micro-plans to deliver TBD for home births. We evaluated outcome through measuring TBD coverage for home and hospital births.Results:These projects were implemented in the context of national efforts to promote institutional deliveries that lead to increases ranging from 10% to 17% to reach 43-97% proportion of institutional births at the end of the projects. Among institutional births, TBD coverage increased by 2% to 13% to reach post implementation coverage ranging from 98% to 100%. Among home births, TBD coverage increased by 7% to 56% to reach post implementation coverage ranging from 29% to 88%. Overall, TBD coverage increased by 4% to 36% to reach post implementation coverage ranging from 82% to 88%.Conclusions:Demonstration projects based on combined interventions increased TBD coverage. Increases in institutional births amplified the results obtained. Use of standardized indicators for such projects would facilitate evaluation and identify intervention components that are most effective.
