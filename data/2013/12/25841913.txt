Management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is challenging compared to other common malignancies because of the nature of the associated background of chronic liver dysfunction. Most of the patients with HCC have underlying cirrhosis. While progression of the tumor is a major contributor to mortality, cirrhosis and its complications often accounts for a significant portion of the morbidity and mortality seen in this group of patients. Severity of underlying liver disease and degree of decompensation predicts prognosis and dictates the tumor treatment options and responses. A multidisciplinary approach is considered the standard of care and paramount to optimal patient outcomes. This review provides information on the general management of cirrhosis, cirrhosis-related complications and commonly associated symptoms, mainly focusing when available on high-level evidence and guidelines.
