Objective:To investigate the effect of rs2279776 at the PTPRD and its interactions on hepatitis B virus (HBV)mutations as well as related risk on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:A total of 3023 individuals, including 1012 healthy controls, 990 HCC-free HBV-infected subjects, and 1021 HBV-caused hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HCC)were involved in this study. PTPRD rs2279776 was genotyped, using quantitative PCR. HBV enhancer II/basal core promoter/precore (Enh II/BCP/preC) and preS regions were amplified by nested PCR and directly sequenced. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association among rs2279776 polymorphism, HBV mutations, and their interactions on the risk of HCC.Results:The distributions of rs2279776 genotypes and allelic frequencies between HCC patients and healthy controls, HCC patients and HBsAg-positive subjects without HCC, HCC patients and HCC-free population (HBsAg-positive subjects without HCC and healthy controls) showed no statistically significant differences. However, the interactions of GC genotype on HBV mutations T1753V and preS deletion significantly increased on the risk of HCC in female HBV-infected subjects. Same result was also seen for rs2279776 C allele (GC+CC). The interaction of rs2279776 GC genotype with G1896A could reduce the risk of HCC in HBV genotype B infected subjects and the interaction of CC genotype with A1652G significantly reduced the risk of HCC in HBV genotype C infected subjects.Conclusion:PTPRD rs2279776 did not directly contribute to the genetic susceptibility on HCC risk. However, it might affect the risk of HCC via interacting with HBV mutations.
