Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignant tumor in men and the seventh in women and understanding the molecular mechanisms of HCC and establishing more effective therapies are critical and urgent issues. Our objective was to study the expression of ferroportin in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples and the relationship between ferroportin expression and HCC characteristics.Methods:Sixty HCC tissues and their corresponding para-cancer liver tissues (PCLT) were obtained from sixty HCC patients who had undergone hepatectomy in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. Ten normal liver tissue samples were also obtained as a control. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to analyze the ferroportin expression in HCC, and the relationship between ferroportin expression and HCC clinical pathological characteristics also was analyzed. For the evaluation of IHC results, the comprehensive scoring criteria were met according to the staining intensity and the number of positive staining cells. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression level of ferroportin in HCC cell lines.Results:Ferroportin expression in HCC tissue was significantly lower compared to PCLT and normal liver tissue (P Conclusions:Ferroportin expression level declines along with the progression of liver cancer, suggesting that the reduction of ferroportin may serve as an important marker for poor HCC prognosis and as a new therapeutic target.
