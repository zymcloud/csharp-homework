Pancreatic neoplasms, including ductal adenocarcinoma, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, pancreatic endocrine neoplasms, acinar cell carcinoma, and ampullary carcinoma, are associated with different genetic abnormalities. Liver neoplasms, including hepatic adenomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cholangiocarcinomas, are associated with identifiable risk factors and genetic changes. Gall bladder adenomas and adenocarcinomas arise from distinct molecular pathways. The molecular abnormalities seen in these tumors are not used routinely in the molecular diagnostic laboratory.
