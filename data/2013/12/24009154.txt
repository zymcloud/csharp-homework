Background and objectives:It remains unclear what kinds of patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) actually need autologous blood storage/transfusion.Methods:Prior to surgery, autologous blood storage was prospectively performed in 245 patients with HCC, whereas it was not performed in 40 patients. Based on the use of the deposited autologous blood and the estimated postoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level when blood was not deposited, they were divided into necessary group and unnecessary group. By comparing the two groups, a scoring system to predict the need for autologous blood was established.Results:The 245 patients from whom blood was collected and stored were categorized into necessary group (32 patients with homologous blood transfusion and 11 with estimated postoperative Hb of Conclusions:The established scoring system was found useful in identifying those HCC patients who need autologous blood storage/transfusion during hepatectomy.
