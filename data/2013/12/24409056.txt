Aim:To molecularly characterize hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Kerala and to relate them to the clinical manifestation of infection.Methods:Sera and clinical data were collected from 91 patients diagnosed with chronic HBV infection and HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV from 44 HCC, 22 cirrhotic and 25 chronic hepatitis patients were genotyped by sequencing of the complete S region or by restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. The basic core promoter/precore region was sequenced. The complete surface DNA sequences were assembled and aligned manually, and then compared with the sequences of HBV of genotypes (A-J) from GenBank. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method and the evolutionary distances computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method. Bootstrapping was performed using 1000 replicates. The TaqMan BS-1 probe was used to quantify HBV DNA at a lower detection limit of approximately 20 IU/mL. Continuous variables were compared using an independent Student's t test. The χ² test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables. The differences were considered statistically significant at P Results:Irrespective of disease status, the predominant genotype was A (72%); 95% belonging to subgenotype A1, followed by genotypes D (27%) and C (1%). HCC patients infected with subgenotype A1 were significantly younger than those infected with D. Mutation A1762T/G1764A was significantly associated with HCC in both genotypes A and D. Mutation G1862T was more frequent in subgenotype A1 (P Conclusion:Kerala is the first Indian state in which subgenotype A1 has been found to predominate in liver disease patients who developed HCC at a relatively young age.
