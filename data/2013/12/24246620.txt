Background:Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (RHCC) after curative resection is a major challenge for hepatic surgeons. A better understanding of the clonal origin of RHCC will help clinicians design personalized therapy and assess postoperative outcomes. The current study was performed to determine the clonal origin of RHCC and its clinical significance.Study design:Fifteen high-frequency of loss of heterozygosity of DNA microsatellites were determined on 100 tumor nodules in 60 matched pairs of RHCC from 40 patients who underwent liver re-resections. The relationships among the origin of clonal patterns of RHCC and the surgicopathologic features and clinical outcomes were analyzed.Results:Of 60 pairs of RHCC, there were 2 clonal patterns with 6 subclonal types. Pattern I was multicentric occurrence (MO type) in 14 pairs (23.3%) and pattern II was intrahepatic metastasis (IM type) in 46 pairs (76.7%). The clinicopathologic features, including recurrence time, tumor size, vascular invasion, histological grading, and associated chronic liver diseases in patients with the MO type of RHCC were significantly different from those with the IM type of RHCC (p Conclusions:The MO-type RHCC was closely associated with better postoperative outcomes when compared with the IM-type RHCC. Generally, we recommend liver re-resection for MO-type RHCC, and interventional therapy for IM-type RHCC. Microdissection-based microsatellite loss of heterozygosity protocol has advantages in assessing the clonal origin, modes of personalized treatment, and clinical outcomes of RHCC.
