Background:In living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is important to predict not only who may be susceptible to recurrence but also who may survive longer. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is useful to properly assess the patient without decreasing the long-term survival after LDLT. In this study, we investigated the relationship between NLR and prognosis of patients with recurrent HCC after LDLT.Methods:In total, 167 LDLTs for HCC were enrolled in this study. Clinicopathologic factors for HCC recurrence after LDLT were investigated and prognostic factors were examined with respect to survival.Results:The following factors were found to be significant in patients with HCC recurrence compared with the controls: α-fetoprotein ≧300 ng/mL, des-γ-carboxyprothrombin ≧300 mAU/mL, NLR ≧4, tumor number >3, tumor size ≧5 cm, duration of last treatment of HCC to LDLT 5 cm, poor differentiation, presence of histologic vascular invasion, adjuvant chemotherapy, and interferon therapy against patients with hepatitis C virus. Male sex, interferon therapy against patients with hepatitis C virus, α-fetoprotein ≧300 ng/mL at recurrence, NLR ≧4 at recurrence, and nonsurgical resection for recurrent HCC were significantly related to poor prognosis. The 3-year survival rate after recurrence was 0% in patients with NLR ≧4 and 43.6% in patients with NLR Conclusion:NLR at recurrence is a prognostic factor affecting survival after recurrence in LDLT for HCC.
