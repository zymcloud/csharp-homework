Purpose:We evaluated the diagnostic performance of fat-suppressed 3D T1-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for the hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic-acid-enhanced liver MRI between low and high flip angle (FA) at 3T.Materials and methods:Forty-six patients with 62 HCCs were enrolled in this retrospective study from among 267 consecutive patients who underwent 3T MRI with low and high FA (10° and 25°) sequences at the hepatobiliary phase. A radiologist measured signal intensities and standard deviations (SD) of lesion, liver, and spleen and calculated signal-to-noise ratio, liver-spleen contrast, and liver-lesion contrast. Two reviewers assessed both image sequences using a five-point rating scale focusing on detecting hypointense lesions.Results:The high FA sequence showed significantly higher liver-spleen and liver-lesion contrast compared with those of low FA (p Conclusion:Increasing FA in T1-weighted hepatobiliary-phase liver MRI may help in detecting HCC at 3T.
