The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide including Egypt. Non-B non-C HCC was reported in some countries. We aimed to investigate P53 antibodies and alpha-fetoprotein in patients with non-B non-C HCC in our region. In a case series study, included 281 patients with HCC and 20 patients with liver cirrhosis of matched age, sex and social factors were received for management at Tanta University Hospitals. Sera were tested for HCV and HBV markers by ELISA/PCR, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level and anti-p53 antibody were evaluated by ELISA. Antinuclear antibody, serum copper and iron were assessed in non-viral HCC. Liver scanning and biopsy were evaluated. Non-B non-C HCC patients were 13.87% of total. P53 antibody serum level in non-B non-C HCC patients showed insignificant difference (p>0.05) as compared to viral-associated HCC, while significant as compared to cirrhosis. They had significant decrease in serum AFP level (p
