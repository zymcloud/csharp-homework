Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. The pre-S2 mutant large HBV surface protein (Δ2 LHBS), which contains an in-frame deletion of approximately 17 amino acids in LHBS, is highly associated with risks and prognoses of HBV-induced HCC. It was previously reported that Δ2 LHBS interacts with the Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1), a zinc metalloprotease. This promotes the degradation of the cell cycle regulator p27(Kip1) and is believed to be the major mechanism for Δ2 LHBS-induced HCC. In this study, it was found that the interaction between JAB1 and Δ2 LHBS is facilitated by divalent metal Zn(2+) ions. The binding of JAB1 to Δ2 LHBS requires the JAB1/CSN5 MPN metalloenzyme (JAMM) motif and residue H138 that binds to Zn(2+) ions in JAB1. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that Δ2 LHBS binds directly to Zn(2+) ions in a two-site binding mode. Residues H71 and H116 in Δ2 LHBS, which also contact Zn(2+) ions, are also indispensable for Δ2 LHBS-mediated p27(Kip1) degradation in human HuH7 cells. These results suggest that developing drugs that interrupt interactions between Δ2 LHBS and JAB1 can be used to mitigate Δ2 LHBS-associated risks for HCC.
