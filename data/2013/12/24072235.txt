Purpose:To compare comprehensively the benefits of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) with those of surgical resection (SR) in early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:The potentially relevant studies comparing the efficacy and safety of RFA and/or PEI with those of SR were searched using the databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Chinese databases (CNKI and Wanfang data). Overall survival rate, recurrence-free survival rate and complications were compared and analyzed. Pooled odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were calculated using either the fixed-effects model or random-effects model. All statistic analyses were conducted using the Review Manager (version 5.1.) from the Cochrane Collaboration.Results:Our analysis showed that the overall survival rate in patients treated with SR was significantly higher than that of percutaneous ablation therapy (PAT) [SR vs. PAT: 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI)2-year 0.46-0.89, P = 0.009; 95 % CI3-year 0.57-0.83, P Conclusions:Although SR was associated with more complications, SR was superior to RFA and PEI for treatment of patients with early-stage HCC.
