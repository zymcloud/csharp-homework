Introduction:The optimal width of microscopic margin and the use of adjuvant therapy after a positive margin for hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis (CRCLM) has not been conclusively determined. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the influence of width of surgical margin and adjunctive therapy upon disease free and overall survival.Methods:All patients undergoing hepatectomy for CRCLM from 1997 to 2012 were identified from a prospectively maintained, IRB approved database. Patients were divided into four subgroups based on the parenchymal margin: positive, <0.1 cm, 0.1 cm-1 cm, and >1 cm.Results:A total of 373 patients were included for analysis with a median follow up of 26 months (range 9-103 months) and a median overall survival of 53 months. The resection margin was positive (26 patients median OS 24 months), <0.1 cm (48 patients median OS 36 mon), 0.1 cm-1 cm (82 patients median OS 44 months), and >1 cm (217 patients median OS 64 months). The most common adjunctive therapy was chemotherapy, hepatic arterial therapy, or local. Patients with positive margins also had the shortest disease free survival (DFS), 16 months. The DFS was similar amongst the other margin groups (<0.1 cm: 21 months, 0.1-1 cm: 22 months, >1 cm 25 months). Hepatectomy margin independently influenced survival (p = 0.017) and disease free survival (p = 0.034). Patients with negative margins has similar overall recurrence rates (p = 0.36) and survival rates (p = 0.89).Conclusions:A positive surgical margin indicates a worse overall biology of disease for patients undergoing hepatectomy for CRCLM, and appropriate multi-disciplinary therapy should be considered in this high risk patient population. Marginal width if a complete resection has been achieved does not adversely effect overall surgical in patients with CRCLM.
