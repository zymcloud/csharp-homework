Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence is fast-growing especially in countries highly prevalent with viral hepatitis. Its poor prognosis has driven the research toward the discovery of sensitive markers for early detection. We investigated the usefulness of serum Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), Glypican-3 (GPC3), and Golgi protein-73 (GP73) mRNAs as early biomarkers in HCC Egyptian patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in comparison with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and densitometry analysis, circulating TGF-β1, GPC3, and GP73 mRNAs expressions were estimated in 15 healthy adults, 15 chronic HCV (CHC) patients and 25 HCC patients. Serum GP73 expression percentage in HCC group was significantly higher than controls (100 vs. 40 %, P ≤ 0.001) and when compared to elevated serum AFP levels (100 vs. 36 %, P ≤ 0.001). TGF-β1 and GP73 expression means were also higher in HCC patients than controls and CHC patients (P
