Aim:To study the clinical outcome of antiviral therapy in hepatitis B-related decompensated cirrhotic patients.Methods:Three hundred and twelve patients with decompensated hepatitis B cirrhosis were evaluated in a prospective cohort. With two years of follow-up, 198 patients in the group receiving antiviral therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues and 39 patients in the control group without antiviral treatment were analysed.Results:Among the antiviral treatment patients, 162 had a complete virological response (CVR), and 36 were drug-resistant (DR). The two-year cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the DR patients (30.6%) was significantly higher than that in both the CVR patients (4.3%) and the control group (10.3%) (P Conclusion:This study showed that antiviral drug resistance increased the risk of HCC in decompensated hepatitis B-related cirrhotic patients, especially in those who failed rescue therapy.
