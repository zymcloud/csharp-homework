Background and aims:The clinical profile of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may differ depending on the etiology of HCC. There is no study from India comparing the clinical profile of patients of HCC due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with other etiologies.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients clinically diagnosed as HCC between Nov 2000 and Dec 2012 admitted under a single unit of Department of Gastroenterology at our hospital. We compared the clinical presentation of patients of Hepatitis B virus etiology (HBV group) with other etiologies (Non-HBV group).Results:One hundred and forty-two patients were included (median age 60 years [range 30-83], 92% males). The etiology was HBV in 56 (39%) and among the non-HBV group (n = 86, 61%) the etiological spectrum was following: alcohol 31 (22%), cryptogenic 26 (18%), HCV 27 (19%), and miscellaneous 2 (1%). The median age of presentation was significantly less for HBV group than in non-HBV (56 [30-77] vs. 62 [42-83] years, P Conclusions:HBV is a common cause of HCC in India, accounting for 39% of cases. The tumor characteristics of HCC due to HBV is similar to other etiologies, however, HBV causes HCC at an earlier age, and in less advanced or even absence of cirrhosis, thus further consolidating the directly carcinogenic potential of HBV.
