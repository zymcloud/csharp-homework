Background:To date, there is limited data on the liver-first approach in the management of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). The aim of the study was to assess the outcomes of the liver-first approach for patients with synchronous CRLM in two tertiary referral centers.Methods:Patients with stage IV colorectal cancer selected for the liver-first approach from January 2009 to December 2012 in two tertiary referral centers were included. Data collated included demographics, chemotherapy, operative findings, histo-pathological features, and survival.Results:Thirty-seven patients with synchronous CRLM were considered for the liver-first approach. Twenty-five patients had rectal cancer. All patients underwent induction chemotherapy. Thirty patients underwent hepatic resections with no post-operative deaths. Following liver resection, five patients failed to proceed to colorectal resection and one patient had complete response to chemo-radiotherapy. Of the 25 patients that completed the liver-first approach, 13 patients had recurrent disease, of which 12 patients died. The overall 1- and 3-year survival rates were 65.9% and 30.4%, respectively.Conclusion:The liver-first approach is a feasible strategy for patients with synchronous CRLM and may improve survival in selected patients. The selection of patients should be incorporated in a multidisciplinary approach to achieve the best possible outcomes.
