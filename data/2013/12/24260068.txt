Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely accepted as an alternative treatment for unresectable primary and metastatic hepatic tumors, with satisfactory rates of local response and significant improvements in rates of overall survival. Numerous large series studies have shown that RFA is safe and effective, with a low mortality rate and a low major complication rate. Major complications, including diaphragmatic perforation and hernia, have rarely been previously reported. The current case report presents a case of diaphragmatic hernia with perforation of the incarcerated colon in the thoracic cavity 12 months following hepatic RFA, and reviews nine previously reported cases of diaphragmatic hernia. Comprehensive analysis of the nine cases demonstrated possibilities leading to diaphragmatic hernia following diaphragmatic thermal injury as a consequence of hepatic RFA. Clinicians and radiologists must consider diaphragmatic thermal damage following hepatic RFA for liver tumors adjacent to the diaphragm, particularly for patients with symptoms of ileus, dyspnea, chest pain, pleural effusion and right shoulder pain.
