Purpose:Mucosal melanoma is a rare but aggressive subtype of melanoma with unique clinicopathologic features. We hypothesize that mucosal melanoma shows predilection for separate and unique metastatic pathways.Materials and methods:This was a retrospective analysis of 19 patients (5 men and 14 women; median age 60 years, range 38-76 years) with metastatic mucosal melanoma presenting to a tertiary oncology center between 2005 and 2010. We performed a review of medical records and histologic and imaging studies to evaluate the natural history, metastatic patterns and the role of imaging in the management of patients with advanced mucosal melanoma.Results:At presentation, disease was confined to the primary site (58%, n = 11) or to the regional lymph nodes (32%, n = 6) in most patients. The most common site of metastasis was the lungs (89%, n = 16), followed by the liver (67%, n = 12) and peritoneum (44%, n = 8). Sinonasal melanoma preferentially spread to the liver (100%, n = 4), vaginal melanoma to the lungs (100%, n = 7) and anal melanoma to the inguinal lymph nodes (100%, n = 4).Conclusion:Pathways of metastatic spread in mucosal melanoma may differ from other forms of melanoma and between different primary sites of mucosal origin.
