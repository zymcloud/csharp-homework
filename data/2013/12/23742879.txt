The pH and reduction dual-responsive polypeptide nanogels with self-reinforced endocytoses were prepared through ring-opening polymerization of l-glutamate N-carboxyanhydrides, deprotection of benzyl group and subsequent quaternization reaction between Î³-2-chloroethyl-l-glutamate unit in polypeptide block and 2,2'-dithiobis(N,N-dimethylethylamine). The nanogels were revealed to exhibit smart pH and reduction dual-responsiveness, and excellent biocompatibilities, which expressed great potential as antitumor drug nanocarriers. Doxorubicin (DOX) as a model antitumor drug was loaded into nanogels through dispersion. DOX-loaded nanogels displayed a stable core-cross-linked structure under normal physiological condition (pH7.4), while rapidly releasing the payloads in the mimicking endosomal (pH5.3), tumor tissular (pH6.8) or intracellular reductive microenvironments (10.0mM glutathione). Confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that DOX-loaded nanogels could deliver DOX into HepG2 cells (a human hepatoma cell line) more efficiently than the parent DOX-loaded micelle and free DOX. The enhanced cellular internalizations of DOX-loaded nanogels were more significant under tumor tissular acidic condition (pH6.8) ascribed to the quaternary ammonium groups in the cores. In addition, DOX-loaded nanogels exhibited improved in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities, and in vivo securities compared with DOX-loaded micelle and free DOX. These excellent features of the smart nanogels with quaternary ammonium groups were endowed with a bright prospect for intracellular targeting antitumor drug delivery.
