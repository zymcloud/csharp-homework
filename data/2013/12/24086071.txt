Purpose:To retrospectively compare the outcome of combined transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (hereafter, TACE-RFA) with that of surgical resection (SR) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria.Materials and methods:Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. From January 2000 to December 2010, 154 patients (mean age, 69.9 years; age range, 50-89 years; 107 men, 47 women) underwent TACE-RFA, and 176 patients (mean age, 66.9 years; age range, 29-83 years; 128 men, 48 women) underwent SR. Patients with HCC who underwent TACE-RFA or SR were enrolled if they met the following inclusion criteria: no previous HCC treatment, one HCC lesion no larger than 5 cm or up to three nodules smaller than 3 cm without vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis, and Child-Pugh class A or B disease. Cumulative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were compared after adjustment with propensity score matching.Results:After this adjustment, OS rates were comparable between the groups (P = .393), but DFS was superior in the SR group (P Conclusion:TACE-RFA may be a viable alternative treatment for early-stage HCC when SR is not feasible.
