Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third most common cancer worldwide. It is an inflammation-associated cancer. Multiple investigators have demonstrated that analysis of the tumor microenvironment may be used to predict patient outcome, indicating the importance of local immune responses in this disease. In contrast with other types of cancer, in which surgery, radiation, and systemic cytotoxic chemotherapies dominate the treatment options, in hepatocellular carcinoma locoregional treatments are widely applied. Such treatments induce rapid tumor cell death and antitumor immune responses, which may favor or impair the patients' outcome. Recent immunotherapeutic studies demonstrating promising results include trials evaluating intratumoral injection of an oncolytic virus expressing granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, glypican-3 targeting treatments, and anti-CTLA4 treatment. Although some of these novel approaches may provide benefit as single agents, there is a clear opportunity in hepatocellular carcinoma to evaluate these in combination with the standard modalities to more effectively harness the immune response.
