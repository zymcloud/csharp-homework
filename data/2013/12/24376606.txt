Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and constitutes the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that hepatocytes express signalling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 3 (SLAMF3/CD229) but not other SLAMF members. We provide evidence to show that SLAMF3 is involved in the control of hepatocyte proliferation and in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. SLAMF3 expression is significantly lower in primary human HCC samples and HCC cell lines than in human healthy primary hepatocytes. In HCC cell lines, the restoration of high levels of SLAMF3 expression inhibited cell proliferation and migration and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, SLAMF3 expression was associated with inhibition of HCC xenograft progression in the nude mouse model. The restoration of SLAMF3 expression levels also decreased the phosphorylation of MAPK ERK1/2, JNK and mTOR. In samples from resected HCC patients, SLAMF3 expression levels were significantly lower in tumorous tissues than in peritumoral tissues. Our results identify SLAMF3 as a specific marker of normal hepatocytes and provide evidence for its potential role in the control of proliferation of HCC cells.
