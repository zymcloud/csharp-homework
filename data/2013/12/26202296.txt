Introduction:The effects of insulin resistance in human diseases are of paramount importance. Since the original proposal by the WHO indicating insulin resistance as the common substrate of the metabolic syndrome, large data are now available on its significance in cardiovascular diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cancer risk.Materials and methods:We reviewed the evidence linking hyperinsulinemia to insulin resistance and ultimately to increased cancer risk. Insulin resistance, by reducing substrate flux along the PI3-K pathway, is followed by compensatory hyperinsulinemia, considered a potential stimulus for cancerogenesis along the MAP-K pathway. Adaptive mechanisms of fat storage, promoted by insulin resistance, chronically maintained in an obesiogenic environment, may lead to oxidative stress and inflammation and modify the immune responses, further increasing the carcinogenic potential. The increased cancer risk associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver may thus be fueled by hyperinsulinemia. Insulin secretagogs and insulin treatment, by raising circulating insulin levels, further increase cancer risk, whereas insulin sensitizers are associated with decreased cancer risk (all sites) and specifically decrease hepatocellular carcinoma. Likewise, drugs related to the incretin system, which are weight neutral or even reduce whole-body and hepatic fat, improve insulin sensitivity and potentially reduce the cancer risk.Conclusion:New diabetes treatments might thus help decrease the future burden of diabetes-associated cancer and particularly of hepatocellular carcinoma.
