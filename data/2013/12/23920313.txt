NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a phase II enzyme that participates in the detoxification of dopamine-derived quinone molecules and reactive oxygen species. Our prior work using a proteomic approach found that NQO1 protein levels were significantly decreased in stable hepatitis B virus (HBV)-producing hepatoma cells relative to the empty-vector-transfected controls. However, the mechanism and biological significance of the NQO1 suppression remain elusive. In this study we demonstrate that HBV X protein (HBx) induces epigenetic silencing of NQO1 in hepatoma cells through promoter hypermethylation via recruitment of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A to the promoter region of the NQO1 gene. In HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens, HBx expression was correlated negatively to NQO1 transcripts but positively to NQO1 promoter hypermethylation. Downregulation of NQO1 by HBx reduced intracellular glutathione levels, impaired mitochondrial function, and increased susceptibility of hepatoma cells to oxidative stress-induced cell injury. These results suggest a novel mechanism for HBV-mediated pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases, including HCC.
