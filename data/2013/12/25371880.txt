Primary vaginal cancer combined with uterine prolapse is very rare. We present a case of 80-year-old postmenopausal women complaints of something coming out per vagina for the past 20 years, along with blood stained discharge, foul odor leukorrhea, and severe pelvic pain for the last 3 months. A 4 Ã— 5 cm ulcer was present on middle third of vaginal wall with marked edema and ulceration of surrounding tissue. The prolapse was reduced under intravenous sedation in operating room. On gynecologic examination, uterus was normal in size, no adnexal mass was examined, and both parametrium were thickened. Papanicolaou smear was normal. Biopsy of the ulcer at vaginal wall revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of vagina. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of abdomen and pelvis showed left hydronephrosis and liver metastasis. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) revealed metastasis to lung, liver and iliac bone. She died from progression of disease one month after diagnosis.
