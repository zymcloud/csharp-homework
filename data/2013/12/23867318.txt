Background & aims:Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major complication after liver transplantation (LT). The initial immunosuppression protocol may influence HCC recurrence, but the optimal regimen is still unknown.Methods:219 HCC consecutive patients under Milan criteria, who received an LT at 2 European centres between 2000 and 2010, were included. Median follow-up was 51 months (IQR 26-93). Demographic characteristics, HCC features, and immunosuppression protocol within the first month after LT were evaluated against HCC recurrence by using Cox regression.Results:In the explanted liver, 110 patients (50%) had multinodular HCC, and largest nodule diameter was 3Â±2.1cm. Macrovascular invasion was incidentally detected in 11 patients (5%), and microvascular invasion was present in 41 patients (18.7%). HCC recurrence rates were 13.3% at 3 years and 17.6% at 5 years. HCC recurrence was not influenced by the use/non-use of steroids and antimetabolites (p=0.69 and p=0.70 respectively), and was similar with tacrolimus or cyclosporine (p=0.25). Higher exposure to calcineurin inhibitors within the first month after LT (mean tacrolimus trough concentrations >10ng/ml or cyclosporine trough concentrations >300ng/ml), but not thereafter, was associated with increased risk of HCC recurrence (27.7% vs. 14.7% at 5 years; p=0.007). The independent predictors of HCC recurrence by multivariate analysis were: high exposure to calcineurin inhibitors defined as above (RR=2.82; p=0.005), diameter of the largest nodule (RR=1.31; pConclusions:Immunosuppression protocols with early CNI minimization should be preferred in LT patients with HCC in order to minimize tumour recurrence.
