Hepatitis C is serious health concern worldwide caused by HCV. It causes liver cirrhosis and hepato-cellular carcinoma. Development of prevention solutions is under progress. Meanwhile, the treatment of the viral disease using compounds isolated from natural medicinal plants is promising. The traditional use of photo-chemicals from medicinal plants like Amelanchier alnifolia for viral treatment is hopeful. Therefore, it is of interest to screen for flavonoids from Amelanchier alnifolia against protein targets of HCV. Hence, we assessed the binding of flavonoids to HCV NS3/4A protease and helicase proteins. Results show that Quercitin 3- galactoside and 3-glucosideshowed good binding score with protease and helicase respectively. Their interaction/binding sites are documented in this report. This data provide insights for the consideration of flavonoids as potential inhibitors of HCV/NS3/4A protease and helicase.
