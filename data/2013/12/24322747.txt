Background:Assessment of tumor response after argon-helium cryoablation is critical in guiding future therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. This study aimed to evaluate liver hemodynamics in hepatocellular carcinoma after argon-helium cryoablation with computed tomography perfusion.Methods:The control group comprised 40 volunteers without liver disease. The experimental group was composed of 15 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with argon-helium cryoablation. Computed tomography perfusion parameters were measured: hepatic blood flow, hepatic blood volume, mean transit time, permeability of capillary vessel surface, hepatic arterial fraction, hepatic arterial perfusion, and hepatic portal perfusion.Results:After treatment, in the tumor foci, permeability of capillary vessel surface was higher, and hepatic blood flow, hepatic blood volume, hepatic arterial fraction, and hepatic arterial perfusion values were lower (P0.05).Conclusion:Computed tomography perfusion can evaluate tumor response after argon-helium cryoablation.
