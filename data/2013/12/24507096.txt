Objective:To study the expression and prognostic significance of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in different melanocytic lesions.Methods:The expression of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in 39 cases of benign nevus, 58 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma, 24 cases of primary mucosal melanoma, 69 cases of melanoma with lymph node metastasis and 8 cases of melanoma with distant metastasis were studied by immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray.Results:The expression of galectin-1 and galectin-3 was higher in benign nevi than in melanomas (P < 0.01). The nuclear expression of galectin-3 was higher in primary cutaneous melanomas than in primary mucosal melanomas or melanomas with metastases (P < 0.01, respectively). The expression correlated with age of patients (P < 0.05), necrosis (P < 0.05) and survival time (P < 0.01). Clark's level also correlated with survival time in patients with cutaneous melanomas (P = 0.037). TNM staging was the only independent prognostic factor for melanomas (P < 0.01).Conclusions:The expression of galectin-1 and galectin-3 is decreased in melanomas. The decrease in nuclear expression of galectin-3 may represent a poor prognostic factor for melanomas. TNM staging is an independent prognostic factor which influences the survival time.
