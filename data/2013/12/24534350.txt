Objective:To explore the association of 12-lipoxygenase (LOX12) Arg261Gln polymorphism with the risk of hepatic carcinoma in Chinese population.Methods:A total of 280 cases of hepatic carcinoma and 560 frequency-matched controls were recruited from January 2008 to December 2012 at Hebei United University Affiliated Hospital. The method of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was employed to genotype LOX12 Arg261Gln polymorphism. And odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with a model of unconditional Logistic regression.Results:The allelic frequency for LOX12 Arg261Gln was significantly higher in hepatic carcinoma cases than that in controls (0.563 vs 0.437). For the control group, the three genotypes of LOX12 Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln and Gln/Gln were 24.3% (136/560), 52.9% (296/560) and 22.8% (128/560) respectively. For the hepatic carcinoma group, these three genotypes were 19.1% (53/278), 49.3% (137/278) and 31.6% (88/278) respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with 261 Arg/Arg genotype carriers, the subjects with 261Gln/Gln had increased risks for hepatic carcinoma (OR = 1.83, 95%CI:1.18-2.84). When stratified by smoking status, the 261Gln/Gln carriers had an increased risk of developing hepatic carcinoma (OR = 2.23, 95%CI:1.16-4.26) among smokers, but not among non-smokers.Conclusion:LOX12 Arg261Gln polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility to hepatic carcinoma.
