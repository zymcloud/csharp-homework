Objectives:The purpose of this study was to assess the coverage of transverse subcostal sonography in the supine position by using computed tomography (CT) performed before a sonographic liver examination as a predictor of sonographic coverage.Methods:A total of 124 patients (87 men and 37 women; mean age, 55.55 years; range, 24-79 years) who underwent abdominal CT and subsequent liver sonography were enrolled. All patients were assessed for the coverage of transverse subcostal sonography in the supine position by consensus of 2 radiologists. We evaluated the correlation between the level of the posterior rib against the liver dome on axial CT and a sonographic coverage scoring system using Spearman partial correlation analysis. The optimal cutoff value of the liver position and other potential factors associated with sonographic coverage were analyzed.Results:Among age, sex, body mass index, interposition of bowel around the gallbladder fossa, atrophic changes from cirrhotic liver, and liver position, liver position was the only independent factor associated with sonographic coverage (P Conclusions:Liver position is the only independent factor associated with the coverage of transverse subcostal sonography in the supine position. If it is above the 10th posterior rib level, we can predict difficulty in adequate sonographic coverage of the liver.
