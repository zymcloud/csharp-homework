The chiral monometallic Cu(II) (1) and Zn(II) (2) and heterobimetallic Cu(II)-Sn(IV) and Zn(II)-Sn(IV) complexes with tridentate chiral Schiff base -ONO-ligand in the presence of nitrogen donor heterocyclic ligand imidazole; were prepared and characterized by various physico-chemical and spectroscopic methods. Preliminary complex-DNA interaction studies employing optical methods revealed that 3 displayed a higher propensity towards the drug target DNA double helix and recommended predominantly an electrostatic mode of interaction as well as a groove binding affinity of the complex with CT-DNA. This was quantified by Kb and KSV values of complexes 1-4, which demonstrated a multifold increase in complex 3 binding to CT DNA and clearly demonstrates its potency to act as a chemotherapeutic agent. Furthermore, the gel electrophoretic patterns of supercoiled pBR322 DNA with varying concentrations of complex 3 exhibits the ability to cleave DNA and follow a freely diffusible radical mechanism. The antiproliferative effects of complex 3 on human hepatoma cancer cells (Huh7) was investigated. Human Topo I inhibition assay by complex 3 was performed and results confirmed significantly good activity at lower concentrations than some of the classical Topo I inhibitors. Additionally, complex 3 was investigated for the expression of MMP-2 and TGF-Î² by real time PCR. The cellular uptake of complex 3 by HeLa cells was studied by confocal microscopy.
