Background:PLD is a standard treatment in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant or refractory ovarian cancer. Vandetanib is an oral once daily administered inhibitor of VEGFR-, EGFR- and RET-signaling with activity in combination with chemotherapy in some solid tumours. We aimed to establish a feasible combination therapy of PLD and vandetanib in ovarian cancer.Methods:Eligible patients were treated with PLD 50 mg/m(2) q28 and vandetanib 100 mg/d po. It was planned to recruit at least 10 patients evaluable for toxicity over 2 treatment cycles. Primary endpoints were tolerability and safety; secondary endpoint was efficacy.Results:Fourteen of 15 registered patients started treatment and were evaluable for toxicity. Three patients (21%) stopped after first cycle (PD, withdrawal of consent, nausea/vomiting). The remaining 11 patients were treated for at least 2 cycles. Dose reductions of PLD and vandetanib were indicated in 4 (29%) and 5 patients (36%), respectively. The following G3/4 toxicities occurred per patient: 2 (14%) elevated liver enzymes G3, 2 (14%) neutropenia G3/4, 5 (36%) PPE G3/4, 2 (14%) mucositis G3. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor attributed side effects like hypertension or bowel perforations were not reported. Toxicity led to cessation of treatment in 4 patients (29%). Ten patients were evaluable for response: PR 1, SD 4. The median PFS was 6.7 months and median OS was 11.1 months.Conclusions:The combination of PLD 50 mg/m(2)q28 and vandetanib 100 mg/d is feasible, but may be intolerable due to reported toxicity.
