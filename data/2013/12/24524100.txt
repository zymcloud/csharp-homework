With over 10,000 attendees from across the U.S. and beyond, the Liver Meeting 2013 was a big success, full of interesting scientific presentations and discussions, many of which directly related to therapies for hepatitis C virus infection. These included new information on drugs currently used for treating this disease, as well as preclinical findings with putative new therapeutics that are expected to improve outcomes for patients in the future. Information was also presented on other hepatic diseases, including hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as other less common liver diseases. This report briefly reviews many of the new scientific findings coming from clinical and preclinical studies aimed at improving the care of patients suffering from hepatic conditions.
