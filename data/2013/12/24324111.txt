Background:Brain metastases (BMs) from colorectal cancer are rare (2-3%). They usually occur in advanced stages of the disease and their prognosis is poor. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of surgical resection of BMs from colorectal cancer in terms of overall survival.Patients and methods:A retrospective bi-centric study included all patients with resected BMs from primary colorectal adenocarcinoma from 1998 to 2009.Results:Twenty-eight patients [13 males, median: 62 (range: 44-86) years old) were included. Fifteen patients presented with other metastatic sites (lung, liver). BMs were metachronous in 16/28 (57%) of patients [median: 19 months (range: 7-97)]. Median overall survival reached 12 months. Brain recurrences occurred in 32% of patients and were treated by curative intent in 5/9 cases.Conclusion:When indicated, an aggressive management based on surgical resection of BMs from colorectal cancer, must be performed, in order to improve overall survival to at least 12 months.
