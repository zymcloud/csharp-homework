Aim:To determine whether an elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is negatively associated with tumor recurrence in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT), and to determine the optimal predictive NLR cut-off value.Methods:The data of HCC patients who had undergone LT came from the China Liver Transplant Registry database. We collected data from 326 liver cancer patients who had undergone LT at our medical center. We divided the patients into groups based on their NLRs (3, 4 or 5). We then compared the clinicopathological data and long-time survival between these groups. Meanwhile, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine the optimal NLR cut-off.Results:Of 280 HCC patients included in this study, 263 were HBV positive. Patients with an NLR Conclusion:A preoperative elevated NLR significantly increased the risk for tumor recurrence in HCC patients after LT.
