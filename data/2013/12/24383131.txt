Pain caused by liver tumors can be alleviated by cryoablation, but little is known about the analgesic effects and duration of pain alleviation. We retrospectively reviewed the changes in the severity of pain before and after percutaneous cryoablation of hepatic tumors. Each patient enrolled in this study had a single hepatic tumor; patients with large tumors (major diameter, P5 cm) underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) first and then cryoablation. Severe abdominal pain that was not controlled with long-lasting oral analgesics was treated with opioid injections. In all 73 study patients, severe abdominal pain was gradually eased 5 days after cryosurgery, completely disappeared after 15 days and did not recur for more than 8 weeks. There were no differences in analgesic effects between patients with hepatocellular carcinomas and those with liver metastasis (P > 0.05). The patients were divided into four groups depending on their pain outcomes: (i) immediate relief (n = 6), severe abdominalgia was no longer present after cryosurgery; (ii) delayed relief (n = 11), severe abdominalgia disappeared gradually within 15 days after the cryosurgery; (iii) always pain-free (n = 39), severe abdominalgia was not present before or after treatment; and (iv) new pain (n = 17), abdominalgia developed after treatment and disappeared within 15 days. In summary, percutaneous cryoablation of hepatic tumors caused short-term pain in some patients, but this pain disappeared within 15 days. Moreover, the pain-relieving effect of this treatment was sustained for at least 8 weeks, without severe side effects.
