Co-infection with HIV and HCV is associated with accelerated progression of liver disease and increased complications compared with HCV infection alone. Treatment of HCV and achievement of a sustained virologic response (SVR) can improve outcomes in these patients. Even after clearance of the hepatitis C virus, however, patients remain at risk, albeit diminished, for the complications of chronic liver disease. As such, longitudinal monitoring of treated patients remains important for clinicians caring for this population. This article summarizes the benefits and persistent risks after attaining SVR. It reviews the natural history of fibrosis and addresses the monitoring and management of progressive liver disease.
