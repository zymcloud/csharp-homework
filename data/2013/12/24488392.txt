Objectives:To evaluate the efficacy of microbubble contrast ultrasound in diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and to compare its results with those of magnetic resonance and histopathology.Methods:A total of 29 patients suffering from chronic liver diseases and awaiting liver transplants at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein were subject to magnetic resonance, microbubble contrast ultrasound, and excision liver biopsies.Results:Excellent agreement between magnetic resonance and microbubble contrast ultrasound was observed in this study. There was moderate agreement between both imaging methods and histopathology results.Conclusion:Microbubble contrast ultrasound was as accurate as magnetic resonance to evaluate hepatocellular carcinoma. These results were confirmed by comparing both methods to histopathological diagnosis.
