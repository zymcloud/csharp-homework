Abnormal signaling of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate IGF-IR's role as a signaling molecule, its pathological alteration in hepatoma tissues, and its effect on hepatoma cell proliferation when inhibited. As measured by immunohistochemical analysis, the incidence of hepatic IGF-IR expression in cancerous tissue was 80.0 % (24 of 30), which was significantly higher (P
