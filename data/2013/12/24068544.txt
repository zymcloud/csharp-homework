Background and objectives:Though Melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family genes have received lots of attention as cancer-related genes and targets for immunotherapy, MAGE-D4 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been evaluated.Methods:MAGE-D4 mRNA expression was assayed in nine HCC cell lines and 94 HCC surgical specimens obtained from Japanese patients by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the correlations between MAGE-D4 mRNA expression and clinicopathological factors were evaluated. The expression and distribution of MAGE-D4b protein were evaluated immunohistochemically.Results:MAGE-D4 mRNA was overexpressed in five of nine HCC cell lines and 34 of 94 primary HCCs (36.2%). Median overall survival (14.8 vs. 118 months, P Conclusions:Overexpression of MAGE-D4 may be a predictive marker of early recurrence and mortality in patients with HCC.
