Background:The prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus remains poor. We previously reported the beneficial effects of interferon alpha (IFN) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combination therapy for these patients. We showed that the mechanism of therapy was regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here, we combined IFN/5-FU therapy with the VEGF receptor-selective inhibitor PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK) and examined the antitumor effects and the mechanism of action.Methods:We studied two HCC cell lines, PLC/PRF/5 and HuH7, and a human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, HUVEC. We studied the effects of IFN/5-FU with or without PTK/ZK in growth inhibition assays, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry.Results:In a HuH7 xenograft model, the combination of PTK/ZK and IFN/5-FU significantly inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, decreased microvessel density, reduced the number of tumor cells that expressed VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), and repressed the phosphorylation of Akt in vivo. In HCC cells and HUVECs in vitro, IFN/5-FU plus PTK/ZK repressed the expression of VEGFR-2 and repressed the phosphorylation of VEGFR, Akt, Erk, and p38MAPK.Conclusions:VEGF signaling inhibition enhanced the antitumor effects of IFN/5-FU therapy on HCC cells and endothelial cells via Erk, Akt, and p38MAPK pathways.
