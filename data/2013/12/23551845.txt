Background:Tumour permittivity feedback control is a novel method for microwave ablation (MWA) that theoretically allows for larger, more predictable ablations. This prospective case series evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of MWA of liver malignancies using a device with tumour permittivity feedback control.Methods:Ten consecutive patients initially determined to be candidates for surgical resection of a liver malignancy underwent intra-operative MWA with tumour permittivity feedback control followed by a surgical resection. A 14-gauge Medwaves microwave antenna was used to deliver a single treatment according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Tumours were assessed grossly as well as by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and tetrazolium chloride staining. The primary end point was per cent tumour necrosis.Results:The median maximum ablation diameter measured was 4.1 cm (range 3.0-6.8). The median ablation volume was 8.7 cm(3) (range 4.84-17.55). Six of the 10 tumours demonstrated a pathological complete response (CR). Six of seven tumours ≤ 3 cm demonstrated a pathological CR. Zero of the three tumours ≥ 3 cm had a pathological CR, but all had ≥ 50% tumour necrosis. All patients survived and there were no ablation-related morbidities.Discussion:MWA of liver tumours with tumour permittivity feedback control is feasible and appears effective for the treatment of small (
