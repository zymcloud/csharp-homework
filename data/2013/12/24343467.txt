Objective:To study the clinical characteristics of bone metastasis from ovarian cancer, and facilitate physicians to develop treatment strategies.Methods:This retrospective study was carried out in the Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Shandong, China. Twenty-six cases of bone metastasis from ovarian cancer treated between January 2002 and May 2008 were reviewed, and the clinical data were collected.Results:In the current study, the incidence of bone metastasis is 0.82%. Twelve cases of bone metastasis occurred in the cervical vertebra, 10 in the lumbar vertebra, 8 in the pelvis, 7 in the thoracic vertebra, 5 in the limbs, one in the ribs, and 2 in the sternum. Lung metastasis occurred concomitantly in 9 cases, liver metastasis in 5 cases, brain metastasis in 4 cases, splenic metastasis in 3 cases, adrenal metastasis in 2 cases, and lymphatic metastasis in 12 cases. Twenty-three cases (88.5%) of bone metastasis were detected in stage III-IV, and 3 (11.5%) in stage II (p=0.000). The survival time in cases treated using comprehensive therapy was longer than those using radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone (p=0.047).Conclusion:Bone metastasis from ovarian cancer is rare, however, the increasing pathological stage of ovarian cancer may add to the risk of bone metastasis, especially in the cases with lung or lymphatic metastasis. The pelvis and vertebral bone are the most common location of bone metastasis, and comprehensive treatment may improve the survival time of patients.
