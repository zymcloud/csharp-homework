Background:MicroRNAs (miRNA) are abundant in the circulation and play a central role in diverse biologic processes; they may be useful for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Methods:We conducted a two-phase, case-control study (20 pairs for the discovery set and 49 pairs for the validation set) to test the hypothesis that genome-wide dysregulation of circulating miRNAs differentiates hepatocellular carcinoma cases from controls. Taqman low-density arrays were used to examine genome-wide miRNA expression for the discovery set, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate candidate miRNAs for both discovery and validation sets.Results:Sixty-six miRNAs were found to be significantly overexpressed in plasma of hepatocellular carcinoma cases compared with controls after adjusting for false discovery rate (P Conclusions:These preliminary results suggest the importance of dysregulated circulating miR-483-5p as a potential hepatocellular carcinoma biomarker.Impact:Confirmation of aberrant expression of miR-483-5p in a large prospective hepatocellular carcinoma study will provide support for its application to hepatocellular carcinoma detection.
