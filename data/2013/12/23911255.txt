Background:In patients with palpable hepatomegaly and space occupying lesions demonstrated by imaging techniques, blind fine needle aspiration puncture (FNAP) at the patient's bedside is feasible.Objective:To compare the diagnostic yield of the fine needle aspiration puncture (FNAP) performed blindly or under radiological control in patients with hepatomegaly and multiple solid space occupying lesions in the liver, demonstrated by ultrasonography.Methods:A retrospective study was made of 169 consecutive FNAPs of liver tumors performed either blindly at the bedside by an internist (55 patients) or imaged-guided by a radiologist (114 patients).Results:The diagnostic yield of the technique performed blindly to demonstrate malignancy was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66-87%) versus 83% (95% CI: 75-89%, P=.42) obtained in the image-guided FNAPs. The diagnostic yield did not vary based on type of tumor invading the liver.Conclusion:Blind FNAP procedures in patients with palpable enlarged liver due to solid space occupying lesions is as effective as those performed under radiological control.
