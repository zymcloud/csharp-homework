Objectives:To examine squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from diverse anatomic sites and invasive urothelial carcinomas (UCs) for expression of the oncofetal antigen glypican 3 (GPC3), the paired box transcription factor PAX8, and the ΔN isoform of p63 (p40).Methods:Immunohistochemistry for GPC3, PAX8, and p40 was performed on whole sections of 107 SCCs from 11 anatomic sites and 49 UCs; evaluation included extent and intensity of staining.Results:GPC3 was detected in 20% of SCCs and 12% of UCs and PAX8 in 3% of SCCs, limited to the uterine cervix, and 10% of UCs. p40 Was found in 99% of SCCs and 96% of UCs.Conclusions:GPC3 expression is frequent in SCC/UC, awareness of which should guard against an incorrect diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while PAX8, limited in distribution, may have some use in suggesting a cervical or urothelial tract origin in a metastatic squamotransitional carcinoma of unknown primary. There is no drop-off in sensitivity for the diagnoses of SCC or UC with ΔNp63-specific immunohistochemistry, and if this performance can be extended to other applications, p40 may supplant the dominant "pan-p63" antibody clone.
