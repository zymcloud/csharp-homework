Osteopontin (OPN) may facilitate tumorigenesis and metastasis through prevention of tumor cells from apoptosis. Although previous studies have suggested involvement of enhanced Bcl-2 protein family expression, the role of OPN together with Bcl-2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this study, we used western blotting to detect the OPN and Bcl-2 expression levels in cell lines with different OPN backgrounds and HCC tissues, and tumor tissue microarrays to examine OPN and Bcl-2 expression levels in 454 HCC cases. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were applied to investigate the predictive values of OPN and Bcl-2 in HCC patients. In vitro assays indicated that OPN expression increased concordantly with increasing metastatic potential in MHCC97-H, MHCC97-L, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell lines by western blotting, whereas Bcl-2 expression declined. In addition, Bcl-2 was highly upregulated in OPN knockdown MHCC97-H cell lines. Furthermore, in HCC tissues, it was confirmed that OPN levels were also significantly higher in recurrent tumor tissues compared to non-recurrent tissues by western blotting (p
