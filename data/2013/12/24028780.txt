Context:Eryngium maritimum L. and the endemic Eryngium kotschyi Boiss. of the Apiaceae family are used for antiinflammatory, antivenom, antinociceptive and diuretic purposes in folk medicine in Turkey.Objective:This study investigated the cytotoxic effects of the plant extracts belonging to Eryngium L. genus on various cell lines.Materials and methods:Cytotoxic activites of the lyophilized aqueous aereal and root parts of the plant extracts on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma (Hep2), human glioma (U138-MG) and African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cell lines at 8.33-266.62 Âµg/ml concentrations were analyzed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) cell viability assays.Results:Inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values were found Discussion and conclusion:Both plant extracts exerted cytotoxic activity aganist Hep2 and HepG2 cells, with low IC50 values defining their promising anticancer property according to NCI; however, further analysis are needed to confirm their activity.
