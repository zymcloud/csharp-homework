The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and significance of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and E-cadherin protein in hepatocellular carcinomas. The expression levels of ADAM10, EGFR and E-cadherin were analyzed in 40 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma using immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The expression levels of ADAM10, EGFR and E-cadherin were significantly correlated with portal vein thrombosis, intrahepatic metastasis, differentiation degree and tumor size (P
