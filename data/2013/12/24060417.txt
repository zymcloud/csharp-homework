The chemotherapy combined with gene therapy has received great attention. We developed targeted LPD (liposome-polycation-DNA complex) conjugated with anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) Fab' co-delivering adriamycin (ADR) and ribonucleotide reductase M2 (RRM2) siRNA (ADR-RRM2-TLPD), to achieve combined therapeutic effects in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) overexpressing EGFR. The antitumor activity and mechanisms of ADR-RRM2-TLPD were investigated. The results showed that RRM2 expression was higher in HCC than in non-HCC tissue, and RRM2 siRNA inhibited HCC cell proliferation, suggesting that RRM2 is a candidate target for HCC therapy. ADR-RRM2-TLPD delivered ADR and RRM2 siRNA to EGFR overexpressing HCC cells specifically and efficiently both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in enhanced therapeutic effects (cytotoxicity, apoptosis and senescence-inducing activity) compared with single-drug loaded or non-targeted controls, including ADR-NC-TLPD (targeted LPD co-delivering ADR and negative control siRNA), RRM2-TLPD (targeted LPD delivering RRM2 siRNA) and ADR-RRM2-NTLPD (non-targeted LPD co-delivering ADR and RRM2 siRNA). Mechanism studies showed that p21 is involved in the combined therapeutic effect of ADR-RRM2-TLPD. The average weight of the orthotopic HCC in mice treated with ADR-RRM2-TLPD was significantly lighter than that of mice treated with other controls. Thus, ADR-RRM2-TLPD represents a potential strategy for combined therapy of HCC overexpressing EGFR.
