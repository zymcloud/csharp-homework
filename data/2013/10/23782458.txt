Objectives:To assess the performance of the Milan, Shanghai Fudan and Hangzhou criteria based on a preoperative evaluation in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) for hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Using a prospectively collected database, the data of consecutive patients with hepatitis B-related HCC undergoing LT at the Department of Liver Surgery of Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University from January 2005 to December 2009 were reviewed. Overall survival and tumor recurrence rates of patients fulfilling the Milan, Shanghai Fudan and Hangzhou criteria were compared using log-rank test.Results:Altogether 148 patients were enrolled in the study, among whom 88 fulfilled the Milan criteria and 24 and 39 were beyond Milan but within the Shanghai Fudan or Hangzhou criteria, respectively. After a median follow-up of 44 months, survival rates did not differ among the three groups (P = 0.8780). Recurrence rates were significantly higher for newly eligible patients by the Shanghai Fudan or Hangzhou criteria compared with those within the Milan criteria.Conclusions:The Milan criteria should be used as the preferred criteria for the selection of hepatitis B-related HCC for LT. Considering the high tumor recurrence rates and donor scarcity, a moderate expansion of the Milan criteria must be performed cautiously until high-quality clinical trials are conducted.
