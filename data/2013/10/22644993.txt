Breast carcinoma with visceral metastasis to the lungs, liver, and bone is common. However, isolated splenic metastases from breast carcinoma are rare. This has been rarely described in the medical literature. This case report presents a 48-year-old woman with newly diagnosed breast cancer and an isolated splenic metastasis diagnosed by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Radiologic staging revealed no involvement of other organs, such as lungs, liver, or bone. The pathogenesis of rare single splenic metastasis and the diagnostic role of FNA on the spleen lesion are discussed. This case is being reported due to its rare metastatic initial presentation and the role of FNA in achieving the diagnosis.
