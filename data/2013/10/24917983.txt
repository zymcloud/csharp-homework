Objective:Epidemiological and clinical information on fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (fHCC) is scarce. We performed a Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database analysis with the aim of collecting information to better understand the biology and clinical aspects of this rare disease.Design:Incidence trends, race- and age-specific rates, tumor size, first course surgery and five-year relative survival of 191 US cases (SEER) diagnosed with fHCC during 2000-2010 were compared to cases with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HCC-not otherwise specified (HCC-NOS) and other HCC-types.Results:While HCC-NOS incidence rates increased by 5.2% annually from 2000-2008 (p Conclusion:In this largest case series, fibrolamellar and HCC-NOS age- and race-specific incidence rates and time trends differed. Despite larger tumor size than HCC-NOS cases fibrolamellar cases received surgery more often and had better survival rates. Differences in co-morbidity may influence treatment. Studies of fHCC biology, including by age, are recommended.
