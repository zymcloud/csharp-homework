Coagulopathy after liver cryoablation was first reported many years ago; the cause is local platelet trapping and destruction within the margin of the cryolesion. However, the prognosis and therapeutic effects of coagulopathy remain unclear. This study retrospectively reviewed clinical data from 372 patients (525 sessions) who underwent liver cryoablation in our hospital during the past 4.5 years. Small tumors (major diameter < 6 cm) were treated with a single complete ablation; massive tumors (major diameter 6-10 cm or >10 cm) were divided into two or three parts that were dealt with in turn. Platelet counts decreased to an average of (46.12 ± 68.13) × 10(9)/L after each session of cryoablation. The decline was most evident in patients with high pretreatment platelet counts, while those with low pretreatment counts had the highest risk of coagulopathy. Change in platelet count was not correlated with the diameter of the tumor. Slight coagulopathy (platelet count (70-100) × 10(9)/L) can resolve without treatment within 1 week and administration of recombinant human interleukin-11 can assist recovery from severe coagulopathy (platelet count < 70 × 10(9)/L).
