The present study was aimed to find out causes of ascites based on serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the serum-ascites albumin gradient, proposed as a new biochemical criterion for the differential diagnosis of ascites and to evaluate the value of serum-ascites albumin gradient in differential diagnosis of ascites. This study includes 50 patients with ascites admitted in Medicine wards of Comilla Medical College Hospital, Comilla during the period of July 2010 to June 2011. Blood was drawn from the antecubital vein and ascetic fluid was obtained by paracentesis at the same time. Determination of the concentrations of albumin in both the serum and the ascitic fluid was carried out simultaneously. Considering SAAG value of â‰¥1.1g/dl is high SAAG and a SAAG value
