Background & aims:Quality of life (QoL) is an important aspect of any palliative treatment. However, few data are available from studies comparing how embolotherapy affects QoL for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a health-related QoL study in patients with HCC treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or (90)Y radioembolization.Methods:We performed a prospective study of patients undergoing (90)Y radioembolization (n = 29) or TACE (n = 27) for HCC. We assessed patients before treatment and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) survey. We compared differences in health-related QoL between the treatment groups using linear regression repeated-measures analysis.Results:At baseline, the groups had comparable baseline Child-Pugh class and performance statuses, although patients undergoing TACE had lower tumor burdens (P = .018) and less-advanced disease, based on United Network for Organ Sharing and Barcelona stage (P = .03 and P = .02, respectively), permitting injections at segmental arteries (P Conclusions:In a prospective study, although (90)Y radioembolization was used to treat patients with more advanced disease, those who received this treatment had significant increases in several features of QoL, whereas patients who received TACE had decreases in QoL scores. However, because of the limited sample size, there was no significant difference in overall FACT-Hep health-related QoL scores. The increase was greatest in the embolotherapy-specific score.
