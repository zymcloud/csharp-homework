Background:Post-hepatectomy hemorrhage (PHH) requiring re-laparotomy is a life-threatening situation and is associated with a considerably high hospital mortality rate. However, risk factors of hospital mortality in patients with this condition have not yet been investigated.Methods:The perioperative data of 258 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent re-laparotomy for PHH from 1997 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses to identify risk factors of hospital mortality.Result:Hospital death occurred in 43 patients between 16 h and 40 days after re-laparotomy, and the overall mortality rate was 16.7 %. The median time lag between first recognition of active bleeding and re-laparotomy was 6 h (range 0.5-34 h). The mortality of patients undergoing late re-laparotomy (â‰¥6 h) was much higher than those undergoing early re-laparotomy (Conclusion:Immediate re-laparotomy is a key factor to reduce hospital mortality for patients with active bleeding after partial hepatectomy. More care should be taken in those patients who develop acute liver failure and/or serious acute renal failure after re-laparotomy.
