Background and objectives:Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common metabolic syndromes and is characterized by the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides (TG), which result from an imbalance between uptake, synthesis, export, and oxidation of fatty acids. Curcumin is a polyphenol derived from the herbal remedy and dietary spice turmeric, was found to prevent obesity and diabetes in mouse models. However, a hypolipidemic effect of curcumin in oleic acid- induced hepatocarcinoma cells has not been reported. In this study, we examined the effect of curcumin on reducing lipid accumulation in hepatic cells.Materials and methods:Hepatocytes were treated with oleic acid (OA) containing with or without curcumin to observe the lipid accumulation by Oil Red O stain. We also tested the effects of curcumin on triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in HepG2 cells. Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure sterol regulatory element binding proteins-1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression.Results:Curcumin suppressed OA-induced lipid accumulation and TG and TC levels. Also, curcumin decreased hepatic lipogenesis such as SREBP-1, and FAS. Besides, we also found out the antioxidative effect of curcumin by increasing the expression of PPARα. Curcumin increased AMPK phosphorylation in hepatocytes.Conclusions:These results indicated that curcumin has the same ability to activate AMPK and then reduce SREBP-1, and FAS expression, finally leading to inhibit hepatic lipogenesis and hepatic antioxidative ability. In this report, we found curcumin exerted a regulatory effect on lipid accumulation by decreasing lipogenesis in hepatocyte. Therefore, curcumin extract may be active in the prevention of fatty liver.
