Evaluation of: Akada J, Kamei S, Ito A et al. A new type of protein chip to detect hepatocellular carcinoma-related autoimmune antibodies in the sera of hepatitis C virus-positive patients. Proteome Sci. 11(1), 33 (2013). Unlocking the proteome and delivering biomarkers to the clinic will be critical for early and improved diagnosis and prognosis. Conventional protein microarrays have evolved as a promising proteomic technology with great potential for protein expression profiling in health and disease. In this study, Akada et al. explore a new type of protein chip, interfaced with a dual-color fluorescence-based read-out, for screening of autoantibodies in serum. Uniquely, the recombinant antigens were microarray adapted by molecular design to contain a five-cysteine tag for immobilization and green fluorescent protein for detection (color 1). The engineered antigens were immobilized on in-house-designed maleimide-incorporated diamond-like carbon substrates and subsequently heat treated in a solution of denaturing and reducing agents before any specifically bound serum autoantibodies were detected (color 2). The authors used a 4-plex array targeting hepatocellular carcinoma-related autoantibodies in the sera of hepatitis C virus-positive patients as model system to demonstrate proof-of-concept.
