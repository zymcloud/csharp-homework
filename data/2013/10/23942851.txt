Increasing evidence suggests that dietary vitamin B6 is linked to the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not yet understood. Preliminary results in the current study indicated, following DNA microarray analysis and quantitative PCR, that insulin‑like growth factor‑binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) mRNA is upregulated in HT29 colon carcinoma cells exposed to pyridoxal (PL, 500 µM). IGFBP1 is secreted from the liver and is hypothesized to exert a protective role in the development of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Thus, further experiments were performed to investigate the effect of PL on the expression of IGFBP1 in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The addition of PL (500 µM) markedly increased the expression of IGFBP1 mRNA in HepG2 cells at 6, 12 and 24 h (P
