Tumor angiogenesis, a major requirement for tumor growth and metastasis, is regulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. The aim of this study was to quantify the expression of angiogenic (VEGF, HIF-1α, Angiopiotein-2) and anti-angiogenic (endostatin, angiostatin and Thrombospondin-1) factors and to discern their clinical relevance. A total 90 patients (67 HCC, 9 cirrhosis and 14 chronic hepatitis) were enrolled in the study. Tissue transcript levels of angiogenic (VEGF, HIF-1α, Ang-2) and anti-angiogenic (endostatin, angiostatin and TSP-1) factors were analyzed by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in the tissue samples. The tissue transcript levels of VEGF, HIF-1α and endostatin were found to be significantly higher in HCC in comparison to cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis. Although Ang-2, angiostatin and TSP-1 tissue transcript levels were higher in HCC group than the others groups but the difference was not statistically significant. In univariate analysis both VEGF and HIF-1α were found to be associated with poor survival of HCC patients. Multivariate analysis by the cox proportional hazard model revealed only VEGF as an independent factor predicting poor survival of the HCC patients. Angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors are all highly expressed in HCC patients. Upregulation of tissue anti-angiogenic factors indicates the urgency for the alternative of anti-angiogenic therapies.
