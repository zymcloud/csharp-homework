Background:Low central venous pressure (CVP) affects hemodynamic stability and tissue perfusion. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the optimal CVP during partial hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Ninety-seven patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC had their CVP controlled at a level of 0 to 5 mmHg during hepatic parenchymal transection. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) was maintained, if possible, at 90 mmHg or higher. Hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in 90 patients (92.8%) and cirrhosis in 84 patients (86.6%). Pringle maneuver was used routinely in these patients with clamp/unclamp cycles of 15/5 minutes. The average clamp time was 21.4+/-8.0 minutes. These patients were divided into 5 groups based on the CVP: group A: 0-1 mmHg; B: 1.1-2 mmHg; C: 2.1-3 mmHg; D: 3.1-4 mmHg and E: 4.1-5 mmHg. The blood loss per transection area during hepatic parenchymal transection and the arterial blood gas before and after liver transection were analyzed.Results:With active fluid load, a constant SBP â‰¥90 mmHg which was considered as optimal was maintained in 18.6% in group A (95% CI: 10.8%-26.3%); 39.2% in group B (95% CI: 29.5%-48.9%); 72.2% in group C (95% CI: 63.2%-81.1%); 89.7% in group D (95% CI: 83.6%-95.7%); and 100% in group E (95% CI: 100%-100%). The blood loss per transection area during hepatic parenchymal transection decreased with a decrease in CVP. Compared to groups D and E, blood loss in groups A, B and C was significantly less (analysis of variance test, PConclusion:In consideration of blood loss, SBP, base excess and HCO3-, a CVP of 2.1-3 mmHg was optimal in patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for HCC.
