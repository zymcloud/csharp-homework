We conducted an in vivo study to evaluate the anticancer effect and toxicity of fine-powder cisplatin suspended in lipiodol (fCDDP/LPD suspension) after a single administration of three different doses to rats via the intrahepatic artery after transplantation of rat ascites hepatoma cells. The toxicity of the fCDDP/LPD suspension was also assessed in the same protocol in noncancer-bearing rats and the observed toxicologic changes were compared among groups administered saline (Sal), an aqueous solution of fCDDP (fCDDP/Sal solution), and LPD alone. In parallel with the toxicity test, plasma CDDP concentrations were compared between the fCDDP/LPD suspension and fCDDP/Sal solution. The mean weight of the tumors in the fCDDP/LPD suspension groups was significantly less than in the LPD-alone group. The pathologic changes in the liver observed in the fCDDP/LPD suspension group increased with dose, were more marked compared with those in the fCDDP/Sal solution and LPD-alone groups, and were reversible. No other toxicologic effects were observed. The concentration of CDDP in the plasma in the fCDDP/LPD suspension group was slightly lower than that in the fCDDP/Sal solution group. In conclusion, the results indicate that the fCDDP/LPD suspension has sufficient anticancer efficacy and tolerability for use in the clinical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
