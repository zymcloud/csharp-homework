RhoGDI (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor alpha or RhoGDIÎ±) has been identified as a regulator of Rho GTPases, which are essential for tumor progression, but its role in cancer remains controversial and little is known in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed RhoGDI expression in 147 clinicopathologically characterized HCC cases. RhoGDI expression was detected in cytoplasm of HCC tissues. Statistical analysis showed that there was no relationship between RhoGDI expression and clinicopathological features. Importantly, a significant trend was identified between loss of RhoGDI expression in HCC and worsening clinical prognosis. Multivariate survival analysis showed that negative RhoGDI expression was recognized as an independent prognostic factor of patient's survival. Our results suggest that RhoGDI protein is a valuable marker of prognosis for patients with HCC.
