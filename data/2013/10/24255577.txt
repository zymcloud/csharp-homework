Objective:The aim of the present study was to investigate antioxidant and the anticancerigen activity of a methanol extract from Artemisia princeps var. orientalis (APME), a well-known traditional herbal medicine in Asia, in hepatocellular cancer cells.Methods:To evaluate the antioxidant activity of APME, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase were investigated in HepG2 cells exposed to APME (5, 100, and 200 µg/mL) for 72 h. Then, to evaluate the anticancer activity of APME, we investigated the proliferation and apoptosis induction of HepG2 and Hep3B cells exposed to APME (1-200 µg/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h.Results:APME dose-dependently reduced the generation of ROS in the presence of H2O2 compared with control cells. Furthermore, it increased catalase and SOD activity. Moreover, APME inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but at concentrations lower than 100 µg/mL, the inhibition was less dose-dependent than time-dependent. HepG2 and Hep3B cells exposed to 5, 100, and 200 µg/mL APME for 72 h underwent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Exposure to APME resulted in a significant increase in the number of cells in G1 phase and a decrease in the G2/M phase cell population. In addition, APME induced P53 expression of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and played a role in the downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax in both HepG2 and Hep3B cells.Conclusions:These results indicate the potential role of APME as an antioxidant and anticancerigen agent in hepatocarcinoma cell lines.
