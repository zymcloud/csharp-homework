Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation for HBV-associated liver diseases results in decreased patient and graft survival. Herein we have reported two cases of HBV recurrence following relapse of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Both cases had LDLT for end-stage liver disease secondary to HBV infection with nodules of HCC exceeding the Milan criteria. HBV prophylaxis using hepatitis B immunoglobulin with nucleos (t) ide analogues were given and HBV DNA levels were consistently undetectable after LDLT. HCC recurred at 5 months and 13 months posttransplant respectively, and chemotherapy and radiation therapy were performed. HBV recurrence occurred during the treatment of HCC. HBV DNA levels increased despite the treatment with anti-HBV agents after HBV recurrence. In hepatitis B surface antigen positive recipients, HBV prophylaxis should be intensified during the treatment of recurrent HCC.
