Background and aim:Hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) is a rare, hepatic mesenchymal neoplasm. Its preoperative diagnosis is very difficult, and the treatment is still controversial. The aim is to summarize experience in diagnosis and management of hepatic AML from a cancer center.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the clinical presentation, histopathological, features and treatment of the tumors encountered at our institute from January 2000 to December 2012.Results:The patients included six females and two males, with female preponderance. Six patients are asymptomatic. Laboratory tests lack specificity. Combining imaging modality, only one patient obtained the accurate diagnosis of hepatic AML and was confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy combined with homatropine methylbromide-45 staining. All other patients received hepatic resection. There was no tumor recurrence or increase of tumor size within the follow-up period.Conclusion:We suggest fine-needle aspiration combined with homatropine methylbromide-45 staining should be performed in all patients who are asymptomatic and without serological abnormalities. Surgical resection might be considered only if the malignant potential of the lesion cannot be ruled out or the tumor size is increasing during observation.
