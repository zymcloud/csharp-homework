Background and aim:Liver stiffness measured by transient elastgraphy correlates with Hepatic vein pressure gradient, liver Stiffness value of 21 kpa predicts significant portal hypertension. Aim is to predict esophageal varices presence by fibroscan and possible grading by degree of liver stiffness in HCV related cirrhotic patients.Material and methods:Thirty two HCV related cirrhotic patients were recruited, age > 18 years, BMIResults:Age is higher in Group III than I & II (55+6.6 vs 49.5+4.7 & 48.9+4.7, p-value 0.04) respectively, Groups were gender & BMI matched, fibroscan values in Group I vs II & III were 27 Vs 49.4, p value 0.01, cutoff 29.7 Kpa (sensitivity 95% & specificity 67%) while its value in Group II vs III were 38.4 vs 60.4, p value 0.002, cutoff 38.2 Kpa (sensitivity 100% & specificity77.3%). Platelet count, splenic size, platelet count/splenic size in Group I vs II & III were 107.166 vs 72.900, 13.8 vs 15.4, 803.6 vs 478, p value 0.01, 0.008, 0.005, cutoff 80.000, 14.5, 545, sensitivity & specificity (85%&75%, 75%&75%, 85%&84%) respectively. On multivariate analysis fibroscan (OR 1.113; p=0.005) & platelet count/splenic size (OR 0.995; p=0.012) were positive predictors of esophageal varices presence.Conclusion:Fibroscan is a good non-invasive method to predict esophageal varices presence & possible grading with high sensitivity.
