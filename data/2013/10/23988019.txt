The human noncoding RNA gene RGM249 has been shown to regulate the degree of cancer cell differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effects of 3 microRNA-like molecules digested from RGM249 on the loss of malignant properties in cancer cells in immunodeficient KSN/Slc mice. We utilized small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) alone or in combination with a cationized drug delivery system (DDS) consisting of atelocollagen or gelatin hydrogel microspheres. The results demonstrated growth inhibition and apoptosis and the inhibition of both neovascularization and metastasis, indicating that the DDSs effectively infiltrated the majority of tumor cells in vivo. Systemic administration of the 3 siRNAs inhibited the metastatic ability of malignant cells. Cotransfection of these siRNAs exerted a regulatory effect upon the genes involved in differentiation, pluripotency, and proliferation in cancer cells. These results suggest that RGM249-derived oligonucleotides may be involved in the regulation of metastasis, proliferation, and differentiation in vivo, and that the tested siRNAs may therefore represent a new anticancer therapeutic approach.
