Background/aims:Somatostatin analogues are considered for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinomas which express somatostatin receptors (SSTR). There is limited data for the SSTR subtypes. Somatostatin receptor 1 (SSTR1) and Somatostatin receptor 5 (SSTR5) expressions are investigated in needle biopsy materials of patients diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma, using immunohistochemical methods in the assistance of antibody kits.Methodology:The needle biopsy materials of forty-one patients that were diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma between 2000 and 2006 have been examined. The underlying diseases, 4FP values, treatments received and the sections were evaluated after SSTR1 and SSTR5 staining.Results:SSTR1 expression was found in 31 (75.6%) and SSTR5 expression in 21 of (51.2%) 41 biopsies. SSTR1 and SSTR5 expressions were not determined in 10 (24.4%) and 20 (48.8%) of the cases. In addition, no significant correlation of the SSTR1 and SSTR5 stains with the underlying diseases (chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis) and gender was observed.Conclusions:This study demonstrated that the tumor cells in the tissue samples of the patients diagnosed with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma expressed a high proportion of SSTR1 and SSTR5.
