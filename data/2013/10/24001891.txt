Ethnopharmacology relevance:Our previous study showed that the proteoglycan P1 from Phellinus linteus (Mesima) exhibits significant anti-tumor activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2); however, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. This study aims to provide insights into the mechanism of the anti-tumor activity of P1 against HepG2 cells.Methods:We examined the effects of P1 on HepG2 cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. Proteomic analysis, real-time (RT)-PCR, and Western blot were carried out to observe the expression of several cell cycle control proteins in HepG2 cells.Results:Both the volume and the weight of solid tumors were significantly decreased in P1-treated mice (200mg/kg) compared with the control. The HepG2 cells in the P1-treated tumors were significantly decreased, irregularly shaped, and smaller. P1 slightly increased the body weight of the tumor-bearing mice, which indicates that P1 is nontoxic to mammals at 200mg/kg. P1 also caused a significant dose-dependent increase in S phase arrest, but no apoptosis was observed in HepG2 cells. The results of the proteomic analysis, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis showed that significantly downregulated expression of calreticulin, cyclin D1, cyclin E, and CDK2 and upregulated expression of P27 kip1 and cyclin A in the P1-treated HepG2 cells (200 Î¼g/ml).Conclusion:These results suggest that calreticulin expression and the P27 kip1-cyclin A/D1/E-CDK2 pathway were involved in P1-induced S-phase cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells.
