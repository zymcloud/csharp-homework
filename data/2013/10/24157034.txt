Introduction:Although entecavir (ETV) and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) have widely been used for prophylaxis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence following liver transplantation (OLT), there have been few studies about clinical outcomes and risk factors of HBV recurrence.Materials and methods:This study retrospectively assessed clinical outcomes and identified risk factors of post-transplant HBV recurrence in 154 patients who received prophylaxis with both ETV and HBIG after OLT.Results:The median follow-up duration was 28.0 months (range, 1.0-57.8). Post-transplant HBV recurrence occurred in 5 patients (3.2%) without any ETV-resistant mutants. The overall rates of HBV recurrence at 1, 2, and 4 years were 0.6%, 1.6%, and 6.2%, respectively. We found that recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was an independent risk factor of HBV recurrence (hazard ratio = 13.5, 95% confidence interval, 2.4-74.4; P = .006).Conclusions:Prophylaxis with a combination of ETV and HBIG resulted in a low HBV recurrence rate following OLT without any emergence of ETV-resistant mutants. Recurrent HCC was an independent risk factor of HBV recurrence in patients who received prophylaxis with both ETV and HBIG for prophylaxis following OLT.
