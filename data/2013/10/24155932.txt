Background:Although sorafenib is accepted as the standard of care in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its therapeutic benefit is marginal. Here, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib monotherapy (S-M) and sorafenib-based loco-regional treatments (S-LRTs) in advanced HCC.Methods:From 2007 to 2012, 290 patients with advanced HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C) with S-M (n = 226) or S-LRTs (n = 64) were reviewed retrospectively. Survival outcomes and treatment-related toxicities between two groups were analyzed.Results:Variables related to tumor burden and liver function were similar between the groups (all P > 0.05). Within the entire population, the S-LRTs group had both longer median overall survival (OS) (8.5 vs 5.5 months, P = 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (5.3 vs 3.0 months, P = 0.002) than the S-M group. Furthermore, the S-LRTs group had longer Os than the S-M group in a subgroup with neither extrahepatic spread (EHS) nor regional nodal involvement (RNI) (18.0 vs 7.8 months, P = 0.019) and in a subgroup with EHS and/or RNI (8.3 vs 4.8 months, P = 0.028). In addition, the S-LRTs group had longer PFS than the S-M group in the subgroup with neither EHS nor RNI (9.6 vs 3.2 months, P = 0.027).Treatment:Related toxicity was similar between two groups.Conclusion:Combined use of sorafenib and LRTs may provide better treatment outcomes without significantly increasing treatment-related toxicities, even in patients with EHS and/or RNI. Therefore, addition of active LRTs might be considered, if feasible.
