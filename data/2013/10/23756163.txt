Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors and their human leukocyte antigen class I ligands have a critical role in natural killer cell response to viral pathogens and tumors. To investigate whether killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genes could influence the chronic course of hepatitis C virus infection and/or progression to hepatocellular carcinoma we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 228 patients transplanted for hepatitis C virus-induced cirrhotic end stage liver disease, combined or not with hepatocellular carcinoma. We found that patients completely lacking activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genes had a high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C viral genotype and viral load are other risk factors that can influence the course of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In our study, the risk conferred by hepatitis C viral genotypes was enhanced in patients lacking activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors. These results point to an important role for activating killer immunoglobulin-like receptors in the control of hepatitis C virus infection and progression to hepatocellular carcinoma. In clinical practice, assessment of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor and hepatitis C viral genotype combinations should allow for more accurate monitoring of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.
