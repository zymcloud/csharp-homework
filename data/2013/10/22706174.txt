Context:Metastatic uveal melanoma recurrence after ≥10 years is not well studied in the clinical literature. This study describes the clinical characteristics and natural history of patients with delayed tumor recurrence.Objective:To describe the characteristics of patients with delayed systemic recurrence of uveal melanoma and the natural history of the disease after recurrence.Evidence acquisition:This is a chart review of patients treated between 1994 and 2008 at The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center for uveal melanoma whose disease recurred ≥10 years after treatment of the primary tumor.Results:Of 463 patients treated for metastatic uveal melanoma, 305 developed systemic recurrence within 5 years from the time of diagnosis of primary melanoma, 97 developed systemic recurrences between 5 and 10 years, whereas 61 patients developed metastasis after ≥10 years. The interval between primary to first systemic metastasis was a significant independent predictor of survival time from first systemic metastasis. The median survival time for patients with delayed metastatic recurrence after ≥10 years was significantly longer than for patients who had intermediate or early systemic recurrence. Levels of lactate dehydrogenase, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum albumin, age, M-stage, and performance status at time of recurrence, as well as sex were also independent predictors of survival time from systemic recurrence.Conclusions:Longer time interval between primary and first systemic metastasis is significantly correlated with prolonged survival. Patients who survive ≥10 years without tumor metastasis after treatment for primary uveal melanoma cannot be considered cured. Prognosis remains poor for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.
