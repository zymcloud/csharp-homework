In this study, an ultra fast LC/IT-TOF MS (UFLC/IT-TOF MS)-based serum lipidomics method was employed to characterize the serum lipid profile of patients with chronic hepatitis B, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After data collection and processing, 96 lipids including lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, triacylglycerides, and cholesterol esters were identified and used for subsequent data analysis. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis revealed that patients with liver diseases had distinctly different serum lipid profile from that of healthy controls; while cirrhosis and HCC patients had a similar serum lipid profile, but different from that of hepatitis patients. The ANOVA analysis found 75 of the 96 identified lipids to be abnormally regulated, among which most of these lipids were downregulated in cirrhosis and HCC patients compared with those of healthy controls and hepatitis patients, while hepatitis patients induced several lipids downregulated and others upregulated compared with those of healthy controls, indicating the aberrant lipid metabolism in patients with liver diseases. This work demonstrated the utility of UFLC/IT-TOF MS-based serum lipidomics as a powerful tool to investigate the lipid metabolism of liver diseases.
