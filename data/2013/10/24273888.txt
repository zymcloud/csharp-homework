The cytotoxicities of two oxovanadium complexes, VOI [VO(satsc)(phen)] (satsc = salicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) and VOII [VO(3,5-dibrsatsc)(phen)](3,5-dibrsatsc = 3,5-dibromosalicylaldehyde thiosemicarbazone), were studied by performing MTT assays on human hepatoma cell lines BEL-7402, HUH-7 and HepG2. The results showed that both the VOI and VOII complexes possess significant anti-proliferative effects. In addition, the anti-proliferative mechanism of the complexes was analyzed by cell cycle analysis and an apoptosis assay and by detecting the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m). The experimental results showed that the complexes can cause a G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and can significantly decrease delta psi m, causing depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Notably, the two complexes induced apoptosis in BEL-7402 cells and displayed typical morphological apoptotic characteristics. The cytotoxicities of the VOII complex are significantly stronger than that of the VOI complex, suggesting that the cytotoxic effects of oxovanadium complexes may be associated with the electronic effects of the complexes.
