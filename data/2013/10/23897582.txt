Background:Rats fed diets deficient in choline develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor DNA from these animals is characteristically hypomethylated, suggesting that disruption of the one-carbon metabolism pathway is an underlying mechanism for hepatocarcinogenesis. Prospective studies in humans on circulating choline and other one-carbon metabolites and hepatocellular carcinoma risk have been lacking.Methods:We prospectively examined the association between prediagnostic serum concentrations of one-carbon metabolites including betaine, choline, cystathionine, homocysteine, methionine, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP, the bioactive form of vitamin B6) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma based on a nested case-control study of 297 incident cases and 631 matched controls from a cohort of 18,244 men in Shanghai, China. Logistic regression methods were used to calculate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for established risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:Serum choline and PLP were associated with statistically significant reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas serum cystathionine, methionine, and SAM were associated with increased hepatocellular carcinoma risk (all Ptrend Conclusion:The inverse associations between choline and vitamin B6 and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development are novel and warrant further investigation.Impact:Identifying new modifiable factors for hepatocellular carcinoma prevention is warranted.
