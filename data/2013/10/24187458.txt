Aim:To investigate the risk factors and characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the patients with drug-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Methods:A total of 432 patients with drug-resistant CHB were analyzed retrospectively from January 2004 to December 2012. The patients were divided into two groups: the HCC group (n = 57) and the non-HCC group (n = 375). Two groups compared using logistic regression for various patients and viral characteristics in order to identify associated risk factors for HCC. Secondarily, patient and tumor characteristics of HCC patients with naÃ¯ve CHB (N group, n = 117) were compared to the HCC group (R group, n = 57) to identify any difference in HCC characteristics between them.Results:A significant difference was found for age, platelet count, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), positivity of HBeAg, seroconversion rate of HBeAg, virologic response, the Child-Pugh score, presence of rtM204I, and the duration of antiviral treatment in non-HCC and HCC group. Cirrhosis, age (> 50 years), HBeAg (+), virologic non-responder status, and rtM204I mutants were independent risk factors for the development of HCC. The R group had lower serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and AFP levels, earlier stage tumors, and a shorter mean tumor surveillance period than the N group. However, the total follow-up duration was not significantly different between the two groups.Conclusion:13.2% of patients with drug-resistant CHB developed HCC. Age, cirrhosis, YIDD status, HBeAg status, and virologic response are associated with risk of HCC. Patients with drug-resistant CHB and these clinical factors may benefit from closer HCC surveillance.
