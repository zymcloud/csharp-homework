Purpose:Little is known about portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to determine the incidence, background, and natural history of RFA-related PVT.Methods:This is a retrospective study of 317 patients (219 males and 98 females) with HCC treated by RFA. Clinical data were compared between patients with and without PVT detected by ultrasound/CT. The median follow-up period after RFA was 15.8 months.Results:PVT was detected in 6 (1.9 %) of 317 patients, 6 (0.8 %) of 802 treatments for HCC, and 6 (0.6 %) of 964 sessions of RFA. Body mass index was significantly higher in patients with PVT (26.9 ± 3.1 kg/m(2)) than in those without (22.9 ± 3.5 kg/m(2), p = 0.0075). PVT was significantly more frequent in RFA for the left lobe of the liver (2.7 %) than for the other sites (0 %, p Conclusions:These results indicated that a high body mass index and RFA for HCC in the left lobe might be significant risk factors for PVT and that RFA-related PVT was rarely progressive with little influence on liver function.
