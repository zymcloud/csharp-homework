Purpose:The impact of familial clustering of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected persons in a low HBV endemic area was investigated.Methods:Four hundred thirteen HBsAg-positive patients, 173 with HCC and 240 without HCC, were subgrouped into those with or without a family history of HCC and analyzed for risk factors associated with HCC development. In families with HCC clustering, the ages of HCC onset in parents and siblings were compared.Results:Forty-four of 173 (25.4 %) HCC patients, all of Asian descent, had 82 other blood relatives with HCC. Of these, 69 (84.1 %) were first-degree relatives. Compared to HCC patients without HCC family history, male HCC patients with family history developed HCC at a younger age than either their mothers or fathers with HCC (45.2 ± 10.3 years vs. 63.0 ± 6.8 years, p Conclusions:HBsAg-positive male HCC patients presented at a younger age than their parents with HCC. In adult patients with an HCC family history, HCC surveillance should begin at the time of the initial clinic encounter.
