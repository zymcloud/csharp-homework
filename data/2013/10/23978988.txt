Purpose:Few studies have investigated the effects of everolimus therapy in Asian populations. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of everolimus in Korean patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).Methods:We retrospectively reviewed records of Korean patients with mRCC (n = 22) who received everolimus between January 2009 and July 2010 and evaluated them for efficacy and safety.Results:One patient achieved a partial response, and 16 patients had stable disease, corresponding to an overall response rate of 4.5 % and a disease control rate of 77.3 %. Median progression-free survival was 5.4 months (95 % CI 0.9-9.8). Median overall survival was not reached. Univariate analysis showed that Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk (P = .004), thrombocytopenia (P = .018), hyperglycemia (P = .007) and hypertriglyceridemia (P = .041) were associated with disease progression. The most common adverse events (AEs) were hypertriglyceridemia and anemia, similar to Western patients. Creatinine and aspartate aminotransferase levels were higher than those reported for Western patients. The most common grade â‰¥3 AEs in this study were hypertriglyceridemia and anemia, compared with lymphopenia (14 %) in Western patients.Conclusions:Safety of everolimus in Korean mRCC patients differed from that reported in Western patients. Therefore, liver function enzymes, hemoglobin levels, lipid profile and chest CT scans should be monitored more closely in Asian mRCC patients receiving everolimus.
