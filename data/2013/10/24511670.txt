Liver transplantation (LT) is currently one of the best available strategies for treating multiple hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and decompensated liver cirrhosis. However, patients often undergo HCC recurrence after LT, with most HCC recurrences detected at 1-2 years. CD133 was the first identified member of the prominin family of pentaspan membrane proteins and is a marker of hepatic stem cells. Here, we report a unique case of seven repeated recurrences of HCC in the lungs after LT, with all HCC recurrences resected curatively by a thoracoscopic approach. Pathological examination revealed moderately differentiated HCC identical to that in the original histology of the liver tumor. Interestingly, no CD133 immunoreactivity was observed in cancerous lesions of the primary HCC and the 1st to 2nd recurrences, as indicated by immunohistochemistry. However, CD133 was strongly stained in the cancerous lesions from the 3rd to 7th recurrences. The patient survived and had no recurrence after 9 years of the initial living donor LT. In conclusion, we investigated an evocative case of seven repeated recurrences of HCC in the lungs to elucidate the significance of circulating CD133-positive hepatic stem cells. This case illustrates the need for further research to clarify the mutual effect of CD133-positive hepatic stem cells for the development of new therapeutic strategies.
