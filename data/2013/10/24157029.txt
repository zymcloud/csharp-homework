Purpose:Complete necrosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions has occasionally been found by explant pathology after pretransplant neoadjuvant treatment. This study sought to investigate the long-term prognostic effect of loss of tumor viability after HCC treatment in living donor liver transplant (LDLT) recipients.Methods:We reviewed retrospectively the 5-year records of 37 patients who demonstrated nonviable HCC on explant pathology.Results:The most common primary disease was hepatitis-B-virus-associated liver cirrhosis (n = 34). Single explant tumors were found in 29 patients; the mean maximal tumor size was 2.1 Â± 0.9 cm (range: 0.8-4.0). No patients showed microvascular invasion. The median level of alpha-fetoprotein was 12 ng/mL (range: 1-1160). The 1 patient who showed a recurrence at 20 months remains alive more than 6 years after adrenalectomy and repeated pulmonary metastasectomy. The 5-year HCC recurrence rate was thus 2.1%. There were 2 late mortalities, each due to graft failure and recurrent gastric cancer. The overall patient survival rate was 97.3% at 5 and 92.7% at 10 years.Conclusions:The results of this study revealed that the loss of tumor viability induced by pretransplant neoadjuvant treatment definitely decreased the risk of post-transplant HCC recurrence. Therefore, patients with nonviable HCC can be regarded as members of a superselect group with minimal risk for HCC recurrence, and may be exempted from routine HCC screening.
