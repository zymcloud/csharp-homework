Background:Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can oxidize biological molecules that mediate carcinogenesis by causing metabolic malfunction and damage to DNA. Human serum paraoxonases (PON1, PON2 and PON3) play a role in antioxidant defense and protect the cell against ROS. PON1 polymorphisms Q192R and L55M have been shown to be associated with several human cancers, but their association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has yet to be investigated.Methods:We performed genotyping analysis using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay in a hospital-based case-control study of 217 confirmed HCC patients and 217 age-, gender-, smoking- and alcohol consumption-matched cancer-free controls in Turkish population.Results:Q192R and L55M polymorphisms were in significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D' = 0.77). However, allele, genotype and haplotype analysis showed no significant differences between the risks of HCC and PON1 polymorphisms. Moreover, no significant differences were found between clinical findings, clinicopathological features and sex in comparison with the PON1 genotypes in HCC group.Conclusion:Our results suggest for the first time that neither the Q192R polymorphism nor the L55M polymorphism has relationship with the risk of developing HCC. Further independent studies are required to clarify the possible role of PON1 gene Q192R and L55M polymorphisms on the risk of developing HCC in a larger series and also in patients of different ethnic origins.
