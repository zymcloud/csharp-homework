The therapeutic performance of biodegradable micellar drugs is far from optimal due to existing challenges like poor tumor cell uptake and intracellular drug release. Here, we report on ligand-directed reduction-sensitive shell-sheddable biodegradable micelles based on poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) copolymer actively delivering doxorubicin (DOX) into the nuclei of target cancer cells, inducing superb in vitro antitumor effects. The micelles were constructed from PEG-SS-PCL and galactose-PEG-PCL (Gal-PEG-PCL) block copolymers, in which Gal-PEG-PCL was designed with a longer PEG than that in PEG-SS-PCL (6.0 vs 5.0 kDa) to fully expose Gal ligands onto the surface of micelles for effective targeting to hepatocellular carcinoma cells. PEG-SS-PCL combining with 10 or 20 wt % of Gal-PEG-PCL formed uniform micelles with average sizes of 56.1 and 58.2 nm (denoted as PEG-SS-PCL/Gal10 and PEG-SS-PCL/Gal20, respectively). The in vitro release studies showed that about 81.1 and 75.0% DOX was released in 12 h from PEG-SS-PCL/Gal10 and PEG-SS-PCL/Gal20 micelles under a reducing condition containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). In contrast, minimal DOX release (
