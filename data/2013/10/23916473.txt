Aims:Periostin (POSTN) is implicated in cancer development and progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of serum POSTN in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving curative surgery.Methods:Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to determine serum POSTN levels in 69 healthy volunteers, 30 patients with hepatolithiasis, 27 patients with cirrhosis, and 56 HCC patients. The relationships between serum POSTN and clinicopathologic features were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to calculate diagnostic accuracy of serum POSTN, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and their combination. The prognostic impact of serum POSTN on overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) was also investigated.Results:The median serum POSTN level was significantly (P Conclusions:Preoperative serum POSTN has limited diagnostic value in distinguishing HCC from non-malignant liver diseases, but serves as independent prognostic biomarker in HCC patients.
