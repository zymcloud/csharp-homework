Aim:To elucidate whether warming may reduce the viscosity of miriplatin-lipiodol suspension (MPT/LPD) and also the injection pressure through microcatheters, for potential use as a chemotherapeutic agent of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Viscosity of MPT/LPD prepared at on-label dose was measured in vitro at 25°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C and 60°C using capillary tube method. Reproducibility of viscosity change was also tested. Injection pressure through two different commercially available microcatheters was measured using a rheometer. Data sampling was performed at least twice for each measurement.Results:Viscosity of MPT/LPD was significantly reduced as the temperature was elevated (R(2) = 0.9586, P Conclusion:The viscosity and injection pressure through microcatheters of MPT/LPD was confirmed to reduce significantly as the temperature is elevated. MPT/LPD warmed to 40°C has half viscosity as that at room temperature and is considered suitable for clinical use. Warming MPT/LPD may have potential to facilitate the procedure of TACE for HCC.
