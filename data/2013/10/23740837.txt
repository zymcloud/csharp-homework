Although the infiltration of mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs) into different tumors is widely recognized in animal models, the question whether these MSCs have a positive or negative effect on disease progression remains unanswered. The aim of this study is to investigate whether human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) harbors MSCs and whether these MSCs affect tumor growth. We observed that cells capable of differentiation into both adipocyte and osteocyte lineages and expressing MSC markers can be cultured from surgically resected HCC tissues. In situ staining of human HCC tissues with a STRO-1 antibody showed that the tumor and tumor-stromal region are significantly enriched with candidate MSCs compared with adjacent tissue (n = 12, P
