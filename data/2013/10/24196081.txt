A 58-year-old man was referred to our hospital for a huge tumor occupying the entire right lobe of the liver. An imaging method revealed a 15 cm-sized hepatocellular carcinoma in the right lobe which extended to the internal segment across the middle hepatic vein. The serum AFP level was 15.3 ng/mL, and the level of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II was 4,340 mAU/mL. We judged it unresectable, then arterial infusion chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and Leucovorin was performed. After 4 courses, the tumor was markedly reduced to 56 mm. We performed an extended right lobectomy. In the operative finding, although the tumor partially reached the internal segment, the middle hepatic vein was preserved. Nine months after operation, no sign of recurrence was found. It is suggested that hepatic arterial infusion therapy is useful for pre-operative therapy of far-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma as a part of combined modality therapy.
