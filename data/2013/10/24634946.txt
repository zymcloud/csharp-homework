Background/aims:Type B and C hepatic cirrhosis are main causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In resected cases of HCC, residual liver function of type B cirrhotic patients tend to be better compared to type C cirrhotic patients. We compared clinical data of patients with type B hepatic cirrhosis with type C hepatic cirrhosis who underwent hepatic resection for HCC.Methodology:Subjects were 16 patients with type B hepatic cirrhosis and 20 patients with type C hepatic cirrhosis who underwent hepatic resection for HCC at Jikei University Hospital. Perioperative findings including age, gender, preoperative laboratory data including ICGR15, Child's classification, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, tumor factor, type of resection, duration of operation, blood loss and incidence of post-operative complications, as well as disease-free and overall survival were analyzed.Results:In type B cirrhotic patients, the age was younger (pConclusions:Residual liver function of type B cirrhotic patients were better than type C cirrhotic patients.
