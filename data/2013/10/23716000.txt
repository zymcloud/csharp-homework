Antiangiogenic therapy, specially sorafenib, has become the standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, the improvement in survival time is not satisfactory. Previous studies have found that, in some circumstances, antiangiogenic therapy promoted tumor metastasis and the mechanistic studies were mainly focus on cancer-cell-autonomous manners. In two experimental metastasis models with tail-vein injection with hepatoma cells and an orthotopic HCC mouse model, we found that pretreatment with two vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors, sunitinib and sorafenib, facilitated tumor cell survival in blood stream and promoted lung metastasis from tumors that were subsequently incubated after drug discontinuation, indicating that host response joined into the pro-metastatic effects. An antibody microarray identified that interleukin (IL)-12b was decreased in the peripheral blood of the mice treated with the two VEGFR inhibitors. IL-12b suppression in macrophages and dendritic cells from host organs was found to play a crucial role in treatment-induced metastasis. Supplement with recombinant mouse IL-12b or restoration of IL-12b expression in the host by zoledronic acid, which was previously reported to enhance IL-12 expression in vitro and in vivo, alleviated the metastasis-promoting effects of sunitinib and sorafenib. These studies suggest that host response to VEGFR inhibitors facilitates HCC metastasis and restoration of IL-12b expression could translate into clinical benefits.
