Background:The aim of this study was to evaluate whether 3-dimensional (3D) simulation software is applicable to and useful for anatomic liver segmentectomy and subsegmentectomy.Methods:A prospective study of 83 consecutive patients who underwent anatomic segmentectomy or subsegmentectomy using the puncture method was performed. All patients underwent 3D simulation analysis (SA) preoperatively for planning operative procedures. The clinical information acquired by 3D SA and the consistency of virtual and real hepatectomy were evaluated.Results:The time needed for completing 3D SA was 18.3 Â± .7 minutes. Three-dimensional SA proposed resection of multiple segments or subsegments in 29 patients (35%). It also helped complement the resection line in 26 patients (31%) who lacked a bold staining area on the liver surface. The volume of segment or subsegment calculated by 3D SA was correlated with the actual resected specimen (R(2) = .9942, P Conclusions:Three-dimensional SA showed accurate completed drawings and assisted liver surgeons in planning and executing anatomic segmentectomy and subsegmentectomy.
