Background & aims:Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) expressing "stemness"-related markers have been associated with aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis. We examined the relationship between "stemness"-related protein expression and telomere length, hTERT and shelterin complex protein expression and chromosomal instability.Methods:Quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization for telomere length, immunohistochemistry for K19, EpCAM, CD133, c-kit, HepPar1, hTERT, TRF1, TRF2, POT1, RAP1 and TPP1, and TUNEL assay were performed in 137 HCCs, and array comparative genomic hybridization was performed with 24 HCCs.Results:Telomeres were significantly longer in HCCs expressing "stemness"-related proteins (K19: p Conclusions:HCCs expressing "stemness"-related proteins are characterized by increased telomere length, increased expression of hTERT and shelterin complex proteins, and increased chromosomal instability compared to conventional HCCs. Longer telomeres and TRF2 expression in HCCs are associated with poor patient outcomes.
