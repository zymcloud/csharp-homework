IAPs are a group of regulatory proteins that are structurally related. Their conserved homologues have been identified in various organisms. In human, eight IAP members have been recognized based on baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domains. IAPs are key regulators of apoptosis, cytokinesis and signal transduction. The antiapoptotic property of IAPs depends on their professional role for caspases. IAPs are functionally non-equivalent and regulate effector caspases through distinct mechanisms. IAPs impede apoptotic process via membrane receptor-dependent (extrinsic) cascade and mitochondrial dependent (intrinsic) pathway. IAP-mediated apoptosis affects the progression of liver diseases. Therapeutic options of liver diseases may depend on the understanding toward mechanisms of the IAP-mediated apoptosis.
