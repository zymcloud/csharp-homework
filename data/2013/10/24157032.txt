Objective:The treatment of choice for combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) is surgical resection. However, the efficacy of liver transplantation is not clear. We compared the surgical outcome of hepatic resection and liver transplantation for cHCC-CC.Patients and methods:From 1995 to 2012, 89 patients were diagnosed with cHCC-CC after hepatic resection and 8 patients diagnosed with cHCC-CC after liver transplantation. We excluded 21 patients who were American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Stage III or IV and lost to follow-up. The outcomes were reviewed retrospectively.Results:The poor prognostic factors in cHCC-CC patients who underwent hepatectomy were large tumor size (>5 cm), small safety margin (2 cm), survival was comparable.Conclusions:In well-selected cases with small tumor size and with preserved liver function, liver resection should be considered when complete resection is possible.
