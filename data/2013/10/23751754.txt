This review of the literature consists of three sections. First, papers concerning non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) awareness among the general population, general practitioners, and liver and non-liver specialists were retrieved and analyzed to highlight the perception of disease, verify knowledge of current recommendations, and identify the main difficulties experienced in clinical practice. Next, position papers and clinical practice guidelines issued by International and National Hepatological Scientific Societies were identified and critically assessed in order to pinpoint the areas of convergence/difference. Finally, practical suggestions on NAFLD diagnosis and management in daily practice are provided and the open questions highlighted.
