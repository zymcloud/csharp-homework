Introduction:The laparoscopic approach is not yet widely used in liver surgery, but has proven to be safe and feasible in selected patients even in malignant disease. The experience and results of a hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery unit in the treatment of malignant liver disease by laparoscopic approach is presented.Material and methods:Between February 2002 and May 2011, 71 laparoscopic liver resections were performed, 43 for malignant disease (only patients with more than one year of follow-up were included). Mean age was 63 years old and 58% of the patients were male. Forty-nine per cent of the lesions were located in segments ii-iii. Thirty segmentectomies were performed, 7 limited resections and 6 major hepatectomies.Results:The median operative time was 163 min. There were 3 conversions. Five cases (11%) required blood transfusion. The oral intake began at 32 h and the median hospital stay was 6.7 days. There were no reoperations and there was one case of mortality. Nine patients (21%) had postoperative complications. The mean number of resected lesions was 1.2, with an average size of 3.5 cm. All resections were R0. The median survival after resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) was 69% and 43.5% at 36 and 60 months, respectively, and 89% and 68% at 36 and 60 months, respectively, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Conclusion:The laparoscopic liver resection in malignant disease is feasible and safe in selected patients. The same oncological rules as for open surgery should be followed. In selected patients it offers similar long-term oncological results as open surgery.
