Objectives:There is controversy about the roles of locoregional therapies in patients with liver metastases from breast cancer (LMBC). The aim of this study was to analyse survival after laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of LMBC and to compare this with survival in patients receiving systemic therapy (ST) alone.Methods:During 1996-2011, 24 patients who had failed to respond or had shown an incomplete response to ST underwent laparoscopic RFA for LMBC. Outcomes in these patients were compared with those in 32 patients with LMBC matched by tumour size and number, but treated with ST alone. Clinical parameters and overall survival were compared using t-tests, chi-squared tests and Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:The groups were similar in hormone receptor status and chemotherapy exposure. In the laparoscopic RFA and ST groups, respectively, the mean ± standard deviation size of the dominant liver tumour and the number of tumours per patient were 3.7 ± 0.4 cm and 2.4 ± 0.4 cm, and 2.6 ± 0.4 tumours and 3.3 ± 0.4 tumours, respectively. These differences were not significant. At a median follow-up of 20 months in the laparoscopic RFA group, 42% of patients were found to have developed local liver recurrence, 63% had developed new liver disease and 38% had developed extrahepatic disease. Overall survival after the diagnosis of liver metastasis was 47 months in the laparoscopic RFA group and 9 months in the ST-only group (P = 0.0001). Five-year survival after the diagnosis of liver metastasis was 29% in the RFA group and 0% in the ST-only group.Conclusions:This is the first study to compare outcomes in RFA and ST, respectively, in LMBC. The results show that survival after laparoscopic RFA plus ST is better than that after ST alone.
