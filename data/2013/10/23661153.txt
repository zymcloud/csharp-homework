Search for new substances with antiproliferative activity and apoptosis inducing potential towards HepG2 cells is important since HCC is notoriously resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Dietary phytochemicals with significant anti-proliferative and apoptosis inducing potential are considered as agents promising for cancer therapy. Naringenin, a common dietary flavonoid abundantly present in fruits and vegetables, is believed to possess strong cytotoxic activity in numerous types of cancer cells. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of its antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induction are still unclear. In this study, we investigated antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effect of naringenin in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Naringenin was shown to inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells resulted partly from an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Naringenin induced a rapid accumulation of p53, which might account for the naringenin-induced G0/G1 and G2/M phase arrests in Hep G2 cells. In addition, naringenin have been shown to induce apoptosis as evidenced by nuclei damage and increased proportion of apoptotic cells detected by flow cytometry analysis. Naringenin triggered the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway as shown by an increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, subsequent release of cytochrome C, and sequential activation of caspase-3. Our results showed that naringenin had inhibitory effect on the growth of HepG2 cell line through inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis induction. The elucidation of the drug targets of naringenin on inhibition of tumor cells growth should enable further development of naringenin for liver cancer therapy.
