The prognosis for renal metastatic carcinoma is poor: in fact only a small portion of patients have metastases surgically treatable for their number and sizes with often a multiorgan involvement. We present a case in whit a solitary liver metastasis was incidentaly detected 17 years after nephrectomy for renal clear cell carcinoma. during a staging computed tomography performed for colonic cancer. We discuss the main feature of this rare condition.
