Introduction:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with synchronous solitary metastasis were generally considered as stage IV and believed to be incurable. Recently, growing evidence has indicated that surgical treatment may provide these patients with a survival benefit. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the effectiveness of different treatments for primary tumors and solitary metastases.Materials and methods:Patients older than 18 years with histologically confirmed stage IV NSCLC and a confirmed synchronous solitary metastasis that diagnosed within 2 months of primary NSCLC. Patients with uncontrolled massive pleural effusion were excluded. Between February 2002 and October 2010, 213 patients were considered eligible and enrolled in this cohort.Results:The median survival time (MST) for the 213 patients was 12.6 months. Forty-five patients received primary pulmonary tumor surgery in the entire cohort. The MSTs of patients who received primary tumor resection and those who did not were 31.8 and 11.4 months (p < 0.01). The MST of the patients with solitary brain metastasis was 12.3 months. Forty-one patients who received brain surgical treatment or SRS had a MST of 15.4 months and others who only received WBRT had a MST of 11.5 months (p = 0.002). Gender, the stage of the primary tumor, PS and whether the primary tumor was removed all affected prognosis independently.Conclusions:Aggressive local and metastasis treatments could lead to better clinical outcomes and thus provide an option for clinicians in the future management of patients with NSCLC and synchronous solitary metastasis.
