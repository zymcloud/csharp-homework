Objective:To evaluate the accuracy of the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system (TNM-7) for patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to propose a modified TNM system for better prediction of survival.Methods:Clinico-pathological data for 1,313 patients who underwent hepatectomy as initial treatment for HCC between 2000 and 2008 were retrieved from a prospective database. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed to evaluate the predictive value.Results:The 1-, 3-, 5-year OS and DFS of 1,313 patients were 79.2, 55.4, 45.5 %, and 52.6, 36.1, 31.8 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that major vascular invasion was the most important prognostic factor for both OS and DFS, along with tumour number and size. Patients with pT1 and pT2 disease had significantly better OS and DFS than those with pT3 disease (P Conclusion:TNM-7 would seem to be inaccurate for staging advanced HCC. The modified system can improve both the prognostic accuracy and the hazard discrimination of disease to be consistent among subgroups of HCC.
