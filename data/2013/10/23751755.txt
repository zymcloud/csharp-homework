Background & aims:Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) frequently occurs in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) related chronic hepatitis (CHC), but the influence of OBI on the CHC outcome is still uncertain. This observational cohort study evaluated the clinical evolution of CHC patients according to their OBI status.Methods:From 1991 to 2000, 326 hepatitis B surface antigen negative CHC patients were tested for OBI by the analysis of liver biopsy DNA extracts. A total of 128/326 cases (39.2%) tested OBI positive and 198/326 (60.8%) OBI negative. Ninety-four of 326 patients (37 OBI positive, 57 OBI negative) were followed-up for a median time of 11 years (range 5-19 years). During the follow-up, 79/94 patients underwent anti-HCV treatments and 25 [corrected] achieved a sustained virological response that occurred independently of their OBI statusResults:Eighteen patients (13/37 OBI positive, 5/57 OBI negative, p Conclusions:Among CHC patients, occult HBV co-infected individuals are a category at high risk of progression toward cirrhosis, HCC development, and lower survival.
