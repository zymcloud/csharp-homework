Gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) is one of the mostly aggressive and fatal malignancies. However, little is known about the oncogenic genes that contributed to the development of GBC. Zinc finger X-chromosomal protein (ZFX) was a novel member of the Krueppel C2H2-type zinc-finger protein family and its down-regulation led to impaired cell growth in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Here, we aim to investigate the function of ZFX in GBC cell proliferation and migration. Loss of function analysis was performed on GBC cell line (GBC-SD) using lentivirus-mediated siRNA against ZFX. The proliferation, in vitro tumorigenesis (colony-formation) ability as well as cell migration was significantly suppressed after GBC-SD cells which were infected with ZFX-siRNA-expressing lentivirus (Lv-shZFX). Our finding suggested that ZFX promoted the growth and migration of GBC cells and could present a potential molecular target for gene therapy of GBC.
