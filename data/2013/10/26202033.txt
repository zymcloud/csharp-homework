Purpose:Evidence indicates a positive association between liver enzymes and the risk of death in Western countries; however, the evidence in Asian populations is scarce. We investigated the association between liver enzymes and total, cardiovascular (CVD), cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mortality in a cohort of Taiwanese male free of cancer at baseline.Methods:From 1996 to 2003, 54,751 Taiwanese male aged 40-80 years without cancer completed a health screening and were followed through 2005 (5.8 Â± 2.5 years of follow-up). A random cohort of 3,961 male was selected to compare to 1,864 male who died. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT).Results:In this population, higher levels of ALT, AST and GGT were significantly associated with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.2, 1.8 and 1.6 for ALT, AST and GGT, respectively; all p Conclusions:In Taiwanese male free of cancer at baseline, elevations of ALT, AST and GGT were associated with future risk of all-cause death, all cancer and HCC mortality, independent of conventional risk factors, and could be used to identify male who would benefit from HCC screening.
