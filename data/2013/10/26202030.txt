Background:Initial presentation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at an advanced stage in patients under a regular surveillance program is a devastating problem.Aims:We assessed the prevalence and factors associated with this surveillance failure.Methods:A total of 304 HCC patients who received regular surveillance were retrospectively reviewed. Surveillance failure was defined when the tumor was diagnosed at beyond the Milan criteria.Results:Surveillance failure rate was 5.9 %. Macronodular cirrhosis (MC), ultrasonography-only surveillance (US-S) and infiltrative tumor type were independent factors associated with surveillance failure. The surveillance failure rate was higher in patients with MC (10.3 vs. 3.2 %, p = 0.022), US-S (14.6 vs. 4.3 %, p = 0.013) and when the tumor was infiltrative type (57.1 vs. 2.1 %, p Conclusion:The HCC surveillance failure was not rare in clinical practice. These data suggest that special attention for surveillance failure might be needed for patients with MC who receive US-S.
