Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections is thought to account for more than 80% of primary liver cancers. Both HBV and HCV can establish chronic liver inflammatory infections, altering hepatocyte and liver physiology with potential liver disease progression and HCC development. Cyclophilin A (CypA) has been identified as an essential host factor for the HCV replication by physically interacting with the HCV non structural protein NS5A that in turn interacts with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. CypA, a cytosolic binding protein of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine A, is overexpressed in many cancer types and often associated with malignant transformation. Therefore, CypA can be a good target for molecular cancer therapy. Because of antiviral activity, the CypA inhibitors have been tested for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Nonimmunosuppressive Cyp inhibitors such as NIM811, SCY-635, and Alisporivir have attracted more interests for appropriating CypA for antiviral chemotherapeutic target on HCV infection. This review describes CypA inhibitors as a potential HCC treatment tool that is contrived by their obstructing chronic HCV infection and summarizes roles of CypA in cancer development.
