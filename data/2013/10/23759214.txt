Introduction:Sarcoidosis and sarcoid reactions have been previously reported in association with cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a minimally invasive test for investigating mediastinal lymph nodesPatients and methods:We conducted a retrospective review of 54 patients undergoing EUS-FNA in a cancer institute for suspected metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes showed by CT-imaging or positron emission tomography (PET). Patients with non-caseating granuloma identified by EUS-FNA were includedResults:EUS-FNA identified non-caseating granuloma in seven out of the 54 included patients. Most of them had positive PET. One patient had a prior history of sarcoidosis before the diagnosis of cancer. Another patient developed micrometastasis associated with sarcoid-like reaction. There was no adverse outcome associated with the EUS-FNA procedureConclusions:Sarcoidosis must be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with a history of malignancy who develop mediastinal lymphadenopathy. EUS-FNA is a safe and minimally invasive test to obtain tissue diagnosis.
