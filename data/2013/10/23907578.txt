Multigene-based combination therapy is an effective practice in cancer gene therapy. Apoptin is a chicken anemia virus-derived, p53-independent, Bcl-2-insensitive apoptotic protein with the ability to specifically induce apoptosis in various human tumor cells. Interleukin-24 (IL-24) displays ubiquitous antitumor property and tumor-specific killing activity. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising gene delivery vehicle due to its advantage of low pathogenicity and long-term gene expression. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of combination therapy using AAV-mediated co-expression of apoptin and interleukin-24 on hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that AAV-mediated co-expression of IL-24 and apoptin significantly suppressed the growth and induced the apoptosis of HepG2 cells in vitro. Furthermore, AAV-mediated combined treatment of IL-24 and apoptin significantly suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis of tumor cells in xenograft nude mice. These data suggest that AAV vectors that co-express apoptin and IL-24 have great potential in cancer gene therapy.
