Background & aims:The serum cell death parameters M30 and M65 and the macrophage activation marker sCD163 (soluble CD163) are elevated in patients with acute and chronic liver diseases. However, their diagnostic and prognostic potential in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been investigated.Methods:Serum levels of M30, M65, and sCD163 were measured in two cohorts of HCC patients and a cohort of cirrhotic patients. The parameters were compared between patients with and without HCC and the overall survival (OS) times according to M30, M65, and sCD163 were assessed.Results:M30 and M65 levels were higher in HCC patients than in cirrhotic patients (both p Conclusions:Serum M65 has the potential as a new diagnostic parameter for HCC and serum sCD163 is a new prognostic parameter in HCC patients.
