Background and aims:While portal hemodynamics largely affects the liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, whether the remnant liver homogeneously regenerates is unclear, especially in humans. We hypothesized that change in flow distribution varies in each remnant portal branch after liver resection in humans and the liver consequently regenerates heterogeneously.Methods:Twenty-two patients who underwent anatomical hepatic resection preserving intact drainage veins were analyzed. Based on perioperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography, the regional hepatic regeneration in each segment was analyzed using a region growing software. The perioperative change in the distribution of blood flow in each portal branch was assessed using the computational flow dynamics technique. The correlation between the change in the portal flow distribution and the later regional hepatic regeneration was investigated.Results:The distribution of portal blood flow in each remnant branch largely changed at 2 weeks (71-389 %). Each remnant segment also heterogeneously regenerated at 3 months (85-204 %). Meanwhile, a good correlation between the regional regeneration rate at 3 months and the relative change in the flow distribution in each circulating portal branch at 2 weeks was detected in each patient (r = 0.74-0.99).Conclusions:After partial hepatectomy, the change in blood flow varies in each remnant portal branch and the liver heterogeneously regenerates in humans. The good correlation between the earlier change in the portal flow distribution and the later regional hepatic regeneration strongly suggests that the portal venous flow most likely regulates the non-uniform liver regeneration after hepatic resection in humans.
