Objective:We evaluated the clinical outcome and prognostic factors for post-relapse survival (PRS) in a large retrospective series of ovarian cancer patients with localized relapse.Patients and methods:The following radiological inclusion criteria were adopted: relapse in single anatomic site and ≤ 3 nodules. All cases were followed for at least 24 months after recurrent disease.Results:Two hundred twenty ovarian cancer patients met the inclusion criteria. Serous histotype and G3 tumors were observed in 173 (78.6%) and 151 (77.4%) cases, respectively. All women received platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. Overall, the median follow-up was 46 (8-249) months, and platinum-resistant relapse was documented in 51 women (23.2%). Eighty-one patients (36.8%) recurred in the peritoneum (LPeR), 76 patients (34.5%) in the abdominal lymph nodes (LLNR), and 63 patients (28.7%) in parenchymal organs (LPaR); 142 patients (64.5%) recurred with a single nodule; and 78 patients (35.5%) recurred with 2-3 nodules. Secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) was attempted in 73 cases (33.2%), and complete debulking was achieved in all patients. On multivariate analysis, platinum-free interval (PFI, χ(2)=13.457, p value=0.001), complete SCS (median PRS, 69 months vs 25 months, p=0.001), anatomic site of relapse (median PRS, 41months in LPeRs, 63 months in LLNRs and 24 months in LPaRs, p=0.001), and number of nodules (median PRS, 58months in patients with one nodule, 24months in patients with 2-3 nodules, p=0.001) were identified as predictors of PRS.Conclusions:Beside the duration of PFI, the complete SCS, the anatomic site of relapse, and the number of nodules were independent prognostic factor for duration of PRS.
Anatomic site of disease; Favourable prognosis; Localized relapse; Recurrent ovarian cancer; Secondary debulking surgery.
