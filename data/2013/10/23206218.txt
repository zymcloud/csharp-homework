Objective:MicroRNA-133a (miR-133a) and microRNA-133b (miR-133b) are located on chromosome 18 in the same bicistronic unit. Recently, they have been commonly identified as being down-regulated in various human malignancies, such as bladder cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and hepatocellular and lung carcinomas. The present study examined the effects of miR-133a and miR-133b in bladder cancer T24 and EJ cells.Material and methods:After transfection of miR-133a and miR-133b, the expression of miR-133a/b was assessed, and a cell viability assay, cell migration assay, cell invasion assay, luciferase assay and Western blot were conducted in bladder cancer T24 and EJ cells.Results:Both miR-133a and miR-133b were found to inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion in T24 and EJ cells. The first evidence was provided that miR-133a and miR-133b may directly target the epidermal growth factor receptor in bladder cancer.Conclusions:This study provided the first glimpse of the functional role of miR-133 in bladder cancer T24 and EJ cells. The results may increase our knowledge on the molecular basis of progression and provide potential therapy for bladder cancer.
