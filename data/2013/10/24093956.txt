Background:Gankyrin has shown to be overexpressed in human liver cancers and plays a complex role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Panobinostat (LBH589), a new hydroxamic acid-derived histone deacetylase inhibitor has shown promising anticancer effects recently. Here, we investigated the potential of LBH589 as a form of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Methods:Gankyrin plasmid was transfected into HCC cells, and the cells were selected for more than 4 weeks by incubation with G418 for overexpression clones. The therapeutic effects of LBH589 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, invasive potential, and epithelial-mesenchy-mal transition (EMT) were examined.Results:LBH589 significantly inhibited HCC growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Western blotting analysis indicated that LBH589 could decrease the expression of gankyrin and subsequently reduced serine-phosphorylated Akt and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 expression although the total Akt and STAT3 were unaffected. LBH589 inhibited metastasis in vitro via down-regulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, TWIST1, VEGF and up-regulation of E-cadherin. LBH589 also induced apoptosis and G1 phase arrest in HCC cell lines. Ectopic expression of gankyrin attenuated the effects of LBH589, which indicates that gankyrin might play an important role in LBH589 mediated anticancer effects. Lastly, in vivo study indicated that LBH589 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, without discernable adverse effects comparing to control group, with abrogating gankyrin/STAT3/Akt pathway.Conclusions:Our results suggested that LBH589 could inhibit HCC growth and metastasis through down-regulating gankyrin/STAT3/Akt pathway. LBH589 may present itself as a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.
