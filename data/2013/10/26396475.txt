Organ shortage is a major issue faced by both transplant surgeons and patients. To enlarge the donor pool, marginal liver grafts are being increasingly used. In this paper, we present the case of a patient in whom a polycystic liver was successfully transplanted from a donor after brain and cardiac death. To our knowledge, this is the first successful case of liver transplantation using polycystic liver from a donation after brain and cardiac death.
