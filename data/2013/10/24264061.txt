Purpose:The relationship between the tumor size and organs of recurrence was analyzed to identify a high-risk group for the extrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after resection.Methods:A total of 544 patients with HCC underwent primary surgical resection for HCC between 2001 and 2010. Of these, 293 patients had a solitary tumor but no macroscopic vascular invasion. The prognostic factors for the overall survival and relapse-free survival were analyzed among these 293 patients. The recurrent organs and frequency of recurrence were also examined.Results:The analysis of the 293 patients showed that both the overall and relapse-free survival rates of the patients with a large tumor (>7 cm in diameter) were significantly worse than those of the patients with a tumor Conclusions:The patients with large HCC tumors more than 7 cm in diameter were at high-risk for a poor prognosis due to a high percentage of lung metastasis, even if there was no macroscopic vascular invasion.
