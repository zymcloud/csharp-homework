Objectives:The aims of this cross-sectional study were to explore the agreement in symptom evaluation results between patients and their family caregivers and to search for the possible factors influencing the agreement.Methods:A convenience sample of 280 dyads consisting of hepatocellular carcinoma patients and their family caregivers was included in this study. All of them completed the symptom checklist of Chinese version of the M. D. Anderson symptom inventory and the evaluations of six common symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma.Results:The levels of agreement ranged from moderate to substantial. A number of factors associated with caregivers (particularly depression state, age, others helping to care for the patient or not, and the relationship with patient) and patients (traditional Chinese medicine treatment, religion, KPS scores, and educational levels) were significantly correlated with levels of disparity on some symptoms.Conclusion:The study illustrates that family caregivers of hepatocellular carcinoma patients can provide reasonable reports on patients' symptoms. Healthcare providers need to pay special and sufficient attention to the caregivers' depression.
