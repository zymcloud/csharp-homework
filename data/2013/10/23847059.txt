Background:γδ T cells comprise a small subset of T cells and play a protective role against cancer and viral infections; however, their precise role in patients with chronic hepatitis B remains unclear.Methods:Flow cytometry and immunofunctional assays were performed to analyze the impact of Vδ2 γδ (Vδ2) T cells in 64 immune-activated patients, 22 immune-tolerant carriers, and 30 healthy controls.Results:The frequencies of peripheral and hepatic Vδ2 T cells decreased with disease progression from immune tolerant to immune activated. In the latter group of patients, the decreases in peripheral and intrahepatic frequencies of Vδ2 T cells reversely correlated with alanine aminotransferase levels and histological activity index. These activated terminally differentiated memory phenotypic Vδ2 T cells exhibited impaired abilities in proliferation and chemotaxis, while maintained a relative intact interferon (IFN) γ production. Importantly, Vδ2 T cells, in vitro, significantly suppressed the production of cytokines associated with interleukin 17-producing CD4+ T (Th17) cells through both cell contact-dependent and IFN-γ-dependent mechanisms.Conclusions:Inflammatory microenvironment in IA patients result in decreased numbers of Vδ2 T cells, which play a novel role by regulating the pathogenic Th17 response to protect the liver in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
