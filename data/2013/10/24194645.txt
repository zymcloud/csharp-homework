Objective:To retrospectively analyze and compare the outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with either surgical excision or CyberKnifeÂ® from September 2006 to August 2011.Materials and methods:Local control and toxicity were the primary endpoints, followed by local progression-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival as the secondary endpoints. Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors were the evaluation criteria for efficacy; Common Toxicity Criteria 3.0 were the evaluation criteria for adverse events. Local control was calculated using the direct method (nonactuarial). The survival curves were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method along with log-rank test analysis.Results:The research included 26 patients treated with tumor-free cutting edge (R0) surgical excision and 22 patients treated with CyberKnife treatment. The results showed that the adverse effects of CyberKnife were milder, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year local control rates of 92.9%, 90.0%, and 67.7%, respectively. The overall survival rates of the surgical treatment were 88.5%, 73.1%, and 69.2% for the same periods, while those of CyberKnife treatment were 72.7%, 66.7%, and 57.1%, respectively. In this study, surgical excision appeared to prolong overall survival to a greater extent, but with no statistical significance; no statistical difference was observed in the tumor-specific overall survival and progression-free survival between the two cohorts.Conclusion:According to this preliminary study, with its mild toxicity, the efficacy of CyberKnife treatment for early hepatocellular carcinoma was on par with that of surgical resection.
