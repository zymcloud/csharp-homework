Background & aims:Aim of this study was to evaluate whether the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism, previously associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk, influences the clinical presentation of HCC and survival.Methods:we considered 460 consecutive HCC patients referred to tertiary care centers in Northern Italy, 353 with follow-up data.Results:Homozygosity for PNPLA3 148M at risk allele was enriched in HCC patients with alcoholic liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD&NAFLD: relative risk 5.9, 95% c.i. 3.5-9.9; other liver diseases: relative risk 1.9, 95% c.i. 1.1-3.4). In ALD&NAFLD patients, the PNPLA3 148M allele was associated with younger age, shorter history of cirrhosis, less advanced (Child A) cirrhosis at HCC diagnosis, and lower HCC differentiation grade (pConclusions:PNPLA3 148M is over-represented in ALD&NAFLD HCC patients, and is associated with occurrence at a less advanced stage of liver disease in ALD&NAFLD. In ALD&NAFLD, PNPLA3 148M is associated with more diffuse HCC at presentation, and with reduced survival.
