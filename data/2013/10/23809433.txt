Early and specific diagnosis is critical for treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In this study, a carbohydrate antigen-S27 (CA-S27) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was established using pooled CCA tissue-extract as immunogen. The epitope recognized by CA-S27-mAb was a new Lewis-a (Le(a)) associated modification of MUC5AC mucin. A Soybean agglutinin/CA-S27-mAb sandwich ELISA to determine CA-S27 in serum was successfully developed. High level of CA-S27 was detected in serum of CCA patients and could differentiate CCA patients from those of gastro-intestinal cancers, hepatomas, benign hepatobiliary diseases and healthy subjects with high sensitivity (87.5%) and high negative predictive value (90.4%). The level of serum CA-S27 was dramatically reduced after tumor removal, indicating tumor origin of CA-S27. Patients with high serum CA-S27 had significantly shorter survivals than those with low serum CA-S27 regardless of serum MUC5AC levels. Fucosyltransferase-III (FUT3) was shown to be a regulator of CA-S27 expression. Suppression of CA-S27 expression with siRNA-FUT3 or neutralization with CA-S27 mAb significantly reduced growth, adhesion, invasion and migration potentials of CCA cells in vitro. In summary, we demonstrate that serum CA-S27, a novel carbohydrate antigen, has potential as diagnostic and prognostic markers for CCA patients. CA-S27 involves in promoting cell growth, adhesion, migration and invasion of CCA cells.
