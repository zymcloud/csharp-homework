We report our first case of single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy in a 43-year-old woman with a 30-mm solitary combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. A port of single-incision laparoscopic surgery was inserted through the abdominal wall using a 2.5-cm single incision in the umbilical area. To obtain adequate operative view for the tumor in segment 6, a 5-mm flexible endoscope, roticulated instruments, and a miniloop retractor were used. After precoagulation with a 5-mm flexible microwave probe, liver resection was performed using laparoscopic ultrasonic shears, soft-coagulation devices, and a tissue-sealing knife. Subsequently, cholecystectomy was carried out for a gallbladder polyp. The procedure was successfully completed without conversion to conventional laparoscopic technique. The operation time was 180 minutes and operative blood loss was uncountable. Transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic hepatectomy using precoagulation and clipless techniques is feasible and seems to provide better cosmetic appearance in selected cases by qualified endoscopic liver surgeons.
