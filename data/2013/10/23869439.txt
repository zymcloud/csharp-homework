Objectives:Right posterior sectorectomy (RPS) preserves liver volume but typically requires a longer parenchymal transection distance than does right hepatectomy (RH). This study was conducted to define the advantages of one approach over the other.Methods:Databases at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed for all patients submitted to RPS or RH between January 2000 and August 2012. Primary outcomes were perioperative complications and 90-day mortality.Results:Patients undergoing RPS (n = 100) and RH (n = 480), respectively, were similar in demographics, comorbidities, operative indications and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) mean scores (7.8 in the RPS group and 7.7 in the RH group; P = 0.49). A comparison of the RPS group with the RH group showed no significant differences in mean estimated blood loss (697 ml versus 713 ml; P = 0.900), rate of transfusions (19.2% versus 17.1%; P = 0.720), margin-positive resection (9.2% versus 11.6%; P = 0.70), complications (41.8% versus 42.0%; P = 1.000), bile leak (3.0% versus 4.0%; P = 1.000), or length of stay (7.5 days versus 8.3 days; P = 0.360). Postoperative hepatic insufficiency (defined as a postoperative bilirubin level of >7 mg/dl or significant ascites), occurred less frequently after RPS (1.0% versus 8.5%; P = 0.005). Operation type remained an independent determinant of postoperative hepatic insufficiency after controlling for preoperative risk factors (RH: hazard ratio = 9.628, 95% confidence interval 1.295-71.573; P = 0.027). A total of 28 (4.8%) patients died within 90 days; these included 25 (5.2%) patients in the RH group and three (3.0%) in the RPS group (P = 0.449).Conclusions:Despite similar blood loss and overall morbidity, RPS is associated with less hepatic insufficiency than RH. Right posterior sectorectomy is parenchyma-sparing and should be strongly considered when it is technically feasible and oncologically sound.
