Background:Previous database studies have found gender disparities favoring men in rates of liver transplantation, which resolve in cohorts examining only patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Aims:Our study aims to use two large, multicenter United States (US) databases to assess for gender disparity in HCC treatment regardless of transplant listing status.Methods:We performed a retrospective database analysis of inpatient admission data from the University Health Consortium (UHC) and the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), over a 9- and 10-year period, respectively. Adults with a primary discharge diagnosis of HCC, identified using the International Classification of Diseases 9th Edition (ICD-9) code, were included. Series of univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine gender disparities in metastasis, liver decompensation, treatment type, and inpatient mortality after controlling for other possible predictors.Results:We included 26,054 discharges from the NIS database and 25,671 patients from the UHC database in the analysis. Women with HCC appear to present less often with decompensated liver disease (OR = 0.79, p Conclusions:US women more often receive invasive treatment for HCC (especially resection) than US men with no observed disparity in transplantation rates when adjusted for pre-treatment variables.
