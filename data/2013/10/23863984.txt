Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the third highest cause of cancer-related mortality in humans. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been shown to inhibit the metastatic activity of certain cancer cells. The aim of this study was to determine the effects and molecular mechanism(s) of action of EGCG in human HCC cells. A migration and invasion assay for the metastatic behavior of HCCLM6 cells was performed. The anti-metastatic effects of EGCG were investigated by RT-PCR and gelatin zymography. A total cellular protein profile was obtained using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses of proteins with significant differences in expression following treatment with EGCG. The results revealed that EGCG induced apoptosis and inhibited the metastasis of HCCLM6 cells. The anti-metastatic effects of EGCG were associated with the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activity. The expression levels of far upstream element (FUSE) binding protein 1 (FUBP1), heat shock protein beta 1 (HSPB1), heat shock 60 kDa protein 1 (chaperonin) (CH60) and nucleophosmin (NPM) proteins, which are associated with metastasis, were significantly altered in the EGCG-treated HCCLM6 cells. The data from the present study suggest that EGCG has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC.
