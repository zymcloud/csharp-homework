Background:There is limited knowledge on how diabetes and other comorbidities influence the survival of patients undergoing curative esophageal cancer surgery.Methods:A population-based and prospective cohort study included patients who underwent surgical resection for esophageal or cardia cancer in Sweden from 2001 to 2005, with follow-up until 2011. Associations between diabetes and other comorbidities in relation to postoperative mortality were analyzed using Cox proportional-hazards regression with adjustment for potential confounding factors.Results:Among 609 patients, 67 (11%) with diabetes had no increased risk for mortality compared with those without diabetes (hazard ratio, .81; 95% confidence interval, .60 to 1.09). Compared with patients without any predefined comorbidities, those with 1 (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, .93 to 1.43) or â‰¥2 comorbidities (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, .83 to 1.33) had no statistically significantly increased risk for mortality.Conclusions:This study revealed no strongly increased risk for mortality in patients with diabetes or other comorbidities selected for esophageal cancer surgery.
