Objectives:There is no standardized method for size measurement of hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the size and stage of hepatocellular carcinoma differ according to the imaging modality.Methods:This retrospective study was approved by our Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was waived. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) along with planning sonography for radiofrequency ablation on the same day were included. A total of 113 patients with 127 hepatocellular carcinomas were included. The sizes of the tumors were measured and the tumor stages were assessed on CT/MRI and sonography. The results were compared by a t test, Bland-Altman limits of agreement, and a McNemar test.Results:There was a significant difference in the hepatocellular carcinoma size between CT/MRI and sonographic measurements (mean difference, 0.26 cm; P Conclusions:The size of hepatocellular carcinoma measured on sonography tends to be larger than on CT/MRI; therefore, the tumor stage can differ between sonography and CT/MRI.
