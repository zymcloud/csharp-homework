Purpose:Combined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) is a rare pair of intrahepatic malignancies. Differential diagnosis among combined HCC-CCC, HCC, or CCC can be difficult; thus malignancies other than ordinary HCC are occasionally encountered unexpectedly in explanted liver specimens. The present study analyzed the long-term outcomes of liver transplantation (OLT) among patients with HCC-CCC.Methods:Between January 1999 and December 2009, we performed 2137 adult OLT at our institution including 15 cases of pathologically confirmed HCC-CCC, who all underwent OLT with a pretransplant diagnosis of HCC. We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of these 15 patients.Results:Their mean age was 58.9 ± 7.2 years. The median preoperative alpha-fetoprotein level was 32.6 ng/mL. Fourteen patients underwent living donor and one deceased donor OLT. The Milan criteria were met in 12 cases. A single tumor was identified in 8 and multiple lesions in 7 patients. The maximal tumor diameter was 2.9 ± 1.7 cm. Seven patients experienced tumor recurrences: including 6 within the first 12 months. All of the patients who experienced recurrences died at a median 4 months after that diagnosis. The overall patient survival rates were 66.7% at 1 year and 60.0% at 3 and 5 years. Disease-free patient survival rates were 60.0% at 1 year and 53.3% at 3 and 5 years.Conclusions:Patients with combined HCC-CCC showed a high rate of early recurrences, particularly within the first year.
