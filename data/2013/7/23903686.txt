The objective of this study was to examine hepatitis B virus (HBV) subgenotypes and mutations in enhancer II, basal core promoter, and precore regions of HBV in relation to risks of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Southeast China. A case-control study was performed, including chronic hepatitis B (CHB; n=125), LC (n=120), and HCC (n=136). HBV was genotyped by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and subgenotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism. HBV mutations were measured by DNA sequencing. HBV genotype C (68.2%) predominated and genotype B (30.2%) was the second most common. Of these, C2 (67.5%) was the most prevalent subgenotype, and B2 (30.2%) ranked second. Thirteen mutations with a frequency >5% were detected. Seven mutation patterns (C1653T, G1719T, G1730C, T1753C, A1762T, G1764A, and G1799C) were associated with C2, and four patterns (C1810T, A1846T, G1862T, and G1896A) were associated with B2. Six patterns (C1653T, G1730C, T1753C, A1762T, G1764A, and G1799C) were obviously associated with LC, and 10 patterns (C1653T, G1730C, T1753C, A1762T, G1764A, G1799C, C1810T, A1846T, G1862T, and G1896A) were significantly associated with HCC compared with CHB. Four patterns (C1810T, A1846T, G1862T, and G1896A) were significantly associated with HCC compared with LC. Multivariate regression analyses showed that HBV subgenotype C2 and C2-associated mutation patterns (C1653T, T1753C, A1762T, and G1764A) were independent risk factors for LC when CHB was the control, and that B2-associated mutation patterns (C1810T, A1846T, G1862T, and G1896A) were independent risk factors for HCC when LC was the control.
