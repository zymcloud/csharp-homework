Background & aims:Due to the phenotypic and molecular diversity of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), it is a challenge to determine a patient's prognosis. We aimed to identify new prognostic markers of patients with HCC treated by liver resection.Methods:We collected 314 HCC samples from patients at Bordeaux (1998-2007) and Cr√©teil (2003-2007) hospitals in France. We analyzed the gene expression patterns of the tumors and compared expression patterns with patient survival times. Using the coefficient and regression formula of the multivariate Cox model, we identified a "5-gene score" associated with survival times. This molecular score was then validated in 2 groups of patients from Europe and the United States (n = 213) and China (n = 221).Results:The 5-gene score, based on combined expression level of HN1, RAN, RAMP3, KRT19, and TAF9, was associated with disease-specific survival times of 189 patients with resected HCC in Bordeaux (hazard ratio = 3.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.9-6.6; P Conclusions:The molecular 5-gene score is associated with outcomes of patients with HCC treated by resection in different clinical settings worldwide. This new biomarker should be tested in clinical trials to stratify patients in therapeutic decisions.
