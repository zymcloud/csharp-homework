Background:Previous studies have focused on the association of miR-34 family members with carcinogenesis of many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has been suggested that miR-34b/c polymorphism (rs4938723) is associated with susceptibility to HCC. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically summarize the possible association between rs4938723 and the risk for HCC.Methodology/principal findings:We conducted a search of case-control studies on the associations of rs4938723 with susceptibility to HCC in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, Wangfang database in China, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data from eligible studies were extracted for meta-analysis. HCC risk associated with rs4938723 was estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). 3 studies on rs4938723 were included in our meta-analysis. Our results showed that neither allele frequency nor genotype distribution of the rs4938723 was associated with risk for HCC in all genetic models.Conclusions/significance:This meta-analysis suggests that rs4938723 is not associated with the risk of HCC. Well-designed studies with larger sample size and more ethnic groups are required to further validate the results.
