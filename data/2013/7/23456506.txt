Background:Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19)-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and the Î²-catenin pathway may be involved in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. This study aimed to elucidate the prognostic significance of FGF19 protein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.Methods:By immunohistochemistry, we investigated the expression of FGF19 protein in tumor tissue from 281 hepatocellular carcinoma patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate its predictive value for tumor recurrence and survival of patients. The median follow-up period was 75.6 months.Results:FGF19 protein expression was observed in 135 (48.0 %) of the 281 hepatocellular carcinomas. FGF19 expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size (P Conclusions:FGF19 protein expression might be an effective predictor of early recurrence and a marker for poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma after curative hepatectomy, indicating that FGF19 might be a potential preventive target in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
