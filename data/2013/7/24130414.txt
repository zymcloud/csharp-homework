Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) evidenced by erythropoietic cells and megakaryocytes is a characteristic feature of hepatoblastoma (HB). The typical cytomorphology, the presence of EMH and associated clinical and radiological findings offer a reliable diagnosis of hepatoblastoma by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). We describe the cytologic features of hepatoblastomas and discuss the differential diagnosis in two children, aged 53 days and 19 years. The usefulness of EMH in differentiating HB from other small round cell tumors and well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on cytology is highlighted.
