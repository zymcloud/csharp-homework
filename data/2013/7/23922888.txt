Metformin has been widely used as an oral drug for diabetes mellitus for approximately 60 years. Interestingly, recent reports showed that metformin exhibited an anti-tumor action in a wide range of malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we investigated its impact on tumor-initiating HCC cells. Metformin suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis showed that metformin treatment markedly reduced the number of tumor-initiating epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)(+) HCC cells. Non-adherent sphere formation assays of EpCAM(+) cells showed that metformin impaired not only their sphere-forming ability, but also their self-renewal capability. Consistent with this, immunostaining of spheres revealed that metformin significantly decreased the number of component cells positive for hepatic stem cell markers such as EpCAM and Î±-fetoprotein. In a xenograft transplantation model using non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice, metformin and/or sorafenib treatment suppressed the growth of tumors derived from transplanted HCC cells. Notably, the administration of metformin but not sorafenib decreased the number of EpCAM(+) cells and impaired their self-renewal capability. As reported, metformin activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) through phosphorylation; however its inhibitory effect on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway did not necessarily correlate with its anti-tumor activity toward EpCAM(+) tumor-initiating HCC cells. These results indicate that metformin is a promising therapeutic agent for the elimination of tumor-initiating HCC cells and suggest as-yet-unknown functions other than its inhibitory effect on the AMPK/mTOR pathway.
