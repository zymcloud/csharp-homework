Background:Improvements in surgical technique and perioperative care have made partial hepatectomy a safe and effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even in the event of spontaneous HCC rupture.Methods:A consecutive cohort of patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC between 2000 and 2009 was divided into a ruptured group and a non-ruptured group. Patients with ruptured HCC were further divided into emergency and staged hepatectomy subgroups. Mortality and morbidity, overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared. Prognostic factors for overall survival and RFS were identified by univariable and multivariable analyses.Results:A total of 1233 patients underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC, of whom 143 had a ruptured tumour. The morbidity and mortality rates were similar in the ruptured and non-ruptured groups, as well as in the emergency and staged subgroups. In univariable analyses, overall survival and RFS were lower in the ruptured group than in the non-ruptured group (both P Conclusion:Spontaneous rupture predicted poor long-term survival after hepatectomy for HCC, but surgical treatment seems possible, safe and appropriate in selected patients.
