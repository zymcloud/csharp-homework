Immunosuppressive therapies are indicated following liver transplantation (LT) to prevent graft loss through rejection, and these same agents also may have a role in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aims of this study were to examine the effects of immunosuppression following LT on IBD activity and to identify markers of IBD control post-LT in patients with IBD who underwent LT for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). A retrospective analysis of all adult patients with a pre-LT diagnosis of IBD who underwent LT for PSC over a 15-year period was performed. The primary outcome was IBD activity based on symptomatology and endoscopic assessment. Secondary outcomes included recipient mortality and post-LT development of colorectal cancer or small bowel lymphoma. A total of 105 patients underwent LT for PSC, and IBD was diagnosed in 27 (26%) pre-LT. Patients were followed for a mean of 88.5 months. Fourteen (52%) patients had stable IBD, 6 (22%) had worsening disease, and 7 (26%) had clinical improvement after LT. Colorectal cancer developed in 2 (7%) patients, and small bowel lymphoma developed in 1 (4%) patient. The absence of additional maintenance therapy for IBD was found to be associated with good outcome for IBD control. The use of either infliximab (Remicade, Janssen Biotech) or corticosteroids to control IBD post-LT was associated with poor outcome. Most patients with PSC and IBD had a stable course of IBD post-LT. The need for infliximab or additional or prolonged corticosteroids after LT appears to be a surrogate marker of aggressive disease.
