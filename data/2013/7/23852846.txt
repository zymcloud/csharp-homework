Hepatitis is the infections of a common cause disease among poly transfused patients. Hepatitis C is slowed progression and inducing HCC. This study assessed HCC incidences, the role of iron and possible antitumor activity of chelators in 170 thalassemia patients using deferoxamine (DFO) therapy. They are diagnosed with Hepatitis C due to positive PCR-RNA. They are Treated with IFN. The follow up program including tests every 3 Months and PCR-RNA, AFP and liver US every 6 months. Whenever there was suspicion of liver malignancy, Biopsy was performed. From the total of 170 patients, 59.4% were male, and 40.6% were female. Mean age of thalassemia diagnosis was 2.69±5.403 (1-41) years and mean Age of hepatitis diagnosis was 17.37±7.263 (3-51) years. 92.4 % of Patient's MT, 0.6 % SS, 2.9% TI. the viral genome was 1a3a. 73.5% of patients had first course of therapy. The frequency of AFP greater than 10 was 5.9%. And the incidence of HCC was 0.6 %(1/170) with a 95% confidence interval. The main risk factor for HCC was HCV infection in TM patients, but it was iron activity in TI patients. Iron chelation with DFO appeared to play a Protective role.
