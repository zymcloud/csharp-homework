Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism that results in the accumulation of copper in the body and primarily in the liver, brain, and cornea. Copper is a toxic metal and might be associated with cancer induction. Most malignancies associated with WD are hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Other intra-abdominal malignancies have been only rarely reported. To our knowledge, this is the first report to suggest that patients with WD may be vulnerable to a malignant change in the colonic mucosa during long-term copper chelating therapy. We report a case of colonic adenocarcinoma in a patient with WD and review the related literature.
