Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 2 (HINT2) is a mitochondrial adenosine phosphoramidase mainly expressed in the pancreas, liver and adrenal gland. HINT2 possibly plays a role in apoptosis, as well as being involved in steroid biosynthesis, hepatic lipid metabolism and regulation of hepatic mitochondria function. The expression level of HINT2 is significantly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. To date, endogenous substrates for this enzyme, as well as the three-dimensional structure of human HINT2, are unknown. In this study, human HINT2 was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Crystallization was performed at 278 K using PEG 4000 as the main precipitant; the crystals, which belonged to the tetragonal space group P41212 with unit-cell parameters a = b = 76.38, c = 133.25 Å, diffracted to 2.83 Å resolution. Assuming two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the Matthews coefficient and the solvent content were calculated to be 2.63 Å(3) Da(-1) and 53.27%, respectively.
