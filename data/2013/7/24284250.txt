Objective:To discuss the clinical value of CT-guided (125)I brachytherapy with retroperitoneal metastatic lymph nodes from primary hepatic carcinoma(PHC).Methods:Twenty patients with retroperitoneal metastatic lymph node recurrence from PHC were percutaneously treated by (125)I brachytherapy with computed tomographic (CT) guidance. The number, radioactive dose, placed position of radioactive seeds and puncture path were determined by computerized treatment planning system (TPS). The radioactive seeds were implanted when the needles were in right position by CT scan. Radiotherapy verification and quality assessment were performed after treatment by CT scan. Follow-up contrast material-enhanced CT were reviewed.Results:The local control rate of 3, 6, 10, 15 months was 70.0%, 56.3%, 44.4%, 25.0% respectively. There were no severe complications such as massive bleeding and radiation injury of normal tissues.Conclusion:CT-guided (125)I brachytherapy are effective and may be safely applied to retroperitoneal metastatic lymph nodes from PHC.
