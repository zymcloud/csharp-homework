Background:To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of preoperative short-course radiotherapy followed by capecitabine and oxaliplatin treatment in combination with bevacizumab and subsequent radical surgical treatment of all tumor sites in patients with stage IV rectal cancer.Patients and methods:Adults with primary metastasized rectal cancer were enrolled. They received radiotherapy (5 Ã— 5 Gy) followed by bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg, day 1) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2), day 1) intravenously and capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) twice daily orally, days 1-14) for up to six cycles. Surgery was carried out 6-8 weeks after the last bevacizumab dose. The percentage of radical surgical treatment, 2-year survival and recurrence rates, and treatment-related toxicity was evaluated.Results:Of 50 included patients, 42 (84%) had liver metastases, 5 (10%) lung metastases, and 3 (6%) both liver and lung metastases. Radical surgical treatment was possible in 36 (72%) patients. The 2-year overall survival rate was 80% [95% confidence interval (CI) 66.3%-90.0%]. The 2-year recurrence rate was 64% (95% CI 49.8%-84.5%). Toxic effects were tolerable. No treatment-related deaths occurred.Conclusions:Radical surgical treatment of all tumor sites carried out after short-course radiotherapy, and bevacizumab-capecitabine-oxaliplatin combination therapy is a feasible and potentially curative approach in primary metastasized rectal cancer.
