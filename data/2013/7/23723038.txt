Curcumin, the major phytochemical in turmeric, exerts anti‑proliferative, anticancer and anti‑inflammatory activities in various types of cancer cells. Curcumin has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis through multiple signaling pathways; however, its association with survival pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, is not fully understood. The Wnt signaling pathway is involved in diverse functions, including cell development, growth and proliferation. This pathway is important for cancer cell survival and metastasis. β‑catenin and GSK3β play a key role in the Wnt signaling pathway and therefore, various members of the Wnt signaling pathway have been hypothesized to represent potential targets for anticancer therapy. In the present study, the effect of curcumin on the suppression of migration and proliferation of Hep3B hepatocarcinoma cells was investigated via suppression of Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo. 12‑O‑tetradecanoylphorbol‑13‑acetate (TPA)‑induced cell migration was observed to be suppressed by curcumin treatment. In addition, curcumin suppressed TPA‑induced activation of Wnt signaling. These results indicate that curcumin induces anti‑migratory activity, which functions via the Wnt signaling pathway.
