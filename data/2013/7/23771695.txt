Purpose:We evaluated molecular features of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that shows iso- or hyperintensity (hyperintense HCC) in the hepatobiliary phase (HB phase) of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI).Materials and methods:We investigated 89 surgically resected cases. Patients were divided into two groups according to the signal intensity in the HB phase of EOB-MRI: hyperintense HCCs (n = 18) and hypointense HCCs (n = 71). We performed immunohistochemical staining for uptake transporter of gadoxetic acid: organic anion transporter polypeptides (OATP8); tumor markers: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA-II); hepatic stem cell markers: epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), cytokeratin 19 (CK19), and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM); biliary marker: CK7; hepatocyte marker: hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1); markers of HCC differentiation: glypican-3; signaling: beta-catenin, and the respective grade was semiquantitatively determined.Results:Histopathologically, hyperintense HCCs showed significantly weaker expression of AFP (p Conclusion:Hyperintense HCC expressed OATP8 and showed a feature of mature hepatocytes with a weak expression of stem cell characteristics immunohistochemically. In addition, this type of HCC demonstrated a weaker expression of the poorer prognosis markers including, AFP, PIVKA-II, EpCAM, CK19, and glypican-3.
