Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem worldwide. CD147 has been reported to be overexpressed in HCC and blocking CD147 expression can decrease tumor growth. (131)I is often used in combination with other drugs to treat HCC and yields positive results. In this study, we combined the (131)I and CD147 monoclonal antibody to treat HCC in a rabbit VX2 animal model. In the (131)I-labeled CD147 antibody ((131)I-CD147-Ab) treatment group, the animals lived considerably longer than the animals in the other treatment groups. Metastasis and tumor growth in the (131)I-CD147-Ab treatment group were also inhibited. MMP2 and CD31 expression were significantly lower in the treatment group, whereas Tunel staining was overexpressed. These findings suggest that (131)I-CD147-Ab is a promising drug in the treatment of HCC, by inhibiting metastasis and growth and by decreasing the expression of MMP2 and CD31 or by inducing tumor necrosis. After testing the biochemical parameters, (131)I-CD147-Ab caused fewer side-effects in the animals.
