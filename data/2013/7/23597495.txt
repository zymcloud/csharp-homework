Aims:Several studies have reported the benefit of hepatic resection for metastatic tumor from gastric cancer. However, the value of treatment with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has not been clearly defined.Methods:Between Jan 2002 and Dec 2007, 21 patients with primary gastric cancer were diagnosed with synchronous or metachronous liver metastases. All patients were treated with RFA, and the complication, survival, and recurrence rates were assessed.Results:The postoperative complication rate was 5% (1/21), with no mortality. The median actuarial survival time was 14 months. The 1-yr, 2-yr, 3-yr, and 5-yr survival rates after RFA were 70%, 11%, 5%, and 3%, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 19 months, local recurrence at the RFA site was 19% (4/21). Solitary metastasis had significantly longer survival than multiple lesions after RFA (22 vs 10 months, P = 0.004).Conclusions:RFA provides a minimally invasive and safe modality of treatment patients with liver metastasis from gastric cancer. Patients with solitary liver lesion were considered appropriate candidates for RFA.
